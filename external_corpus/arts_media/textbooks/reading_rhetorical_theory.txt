Why this Online Textbook?

With the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic in Spring 2020, I began the process of transitioning course
content from the in-person version of my large lecture, "Introduction to Rhetorical Theory," to this platform.
My intention was to create an accessible repository for teaching materials that would enable students to access
the course remotely while minimizing the stress associated with this transition. After several semesters, I added
recorded lectures, supplementary embedded videos, and guidance for written assignments. In its present form,
the book now functions well for "flipped" modalities of teaching, both in-person and online. Given the
significant labor cost associated with transitioning courses online, my hope was to (1) offload some of the
effort of moving classes online by creating an open resource for other instructors to draw upon, (2) to provide
a basis for instructors to justify the appropriateness of a rhetorical theory course for an online modality of
teaching, and (3) to lighten the burden upon instructors and students at a time when online/in-person pivots
are increasingly likely and unpredictable.

   Reading Rhetorical Theory also provides a number of additional advantages over a conventional textbook.

  · There is no cost to either the instructor or the student.
  · It enables instructors to teach in a range of modalities, or to move between online and in-person

      administration as needed.
  · It is formatted for reading/watching/listening on mobile devices and computers.
  · The online format allows course content to be updated on the go, rather than releasing successive

      editions over time.
  · Chapters/entries offer multiple ways for students to receive the materials. The written chapters contain

      the same content as the posted recorded lectures (although occasionally, the recordings will be truncated
      (i.e., shortened) compared to material posted in the textbook to avoid excessively long lectures).
  · It provides a course shell that harmonizes with an ever-present need for online teaching in synchronous
      and asynchronous modalities while minimizing the amount of preparation required to teach.

Exam and quiz questions are currently available to confirmed course instructors on an individual basis. If you
wish to access assessment questions, contribute to this resource, supply correction notices for content and/or
broken links, or otherwise have feedback or requests regarding Reading Rhetorical Theory, please feel free to
send a message to me using the email address listed at the bottom of this page. To avoid confusion while
2 | INTRODUCTION

reading, please note! There is no chapter 13 in this book. Instead, Reading Rhetorical Theory skips
from chapter 12 to chapter 14.

Why Speech, Representation, and Power?

When it is traced to Greek and Western European roots, the academic tradition of rhetorical studies is often
divided into two categories, which correspond with its evolution as a tradition of higher learning: Rhetorica
Docens and Rhetorica Utens. Rhetorica Docens is rhetoric as theory. Of the two, it is the earlier-occurring
category and refers to an art (techne) of speech, spectacle, and fabrication governed by specific rules. This art
is prescriptive in nature, in the sense that it offers guidelines for how speech can and should be organized
and delivered. Frequently associated with the sophist Gorgias, the tradition of artful speaking diminished in
importance between the 7th and the 15th centuries CE, displaced by the traditions of logic and dialectic.
Rhetorica Utens is rhetoric as practice. Associated with Isocrates, it is a method of civic discourse that attends
to the potential (dynamis) of speech and its enactment (praxis). It is a political process that organizes a
population, guiding them toward prudent actions in the face of uncertain decisions.

   As concerns Rhetorica Docens and Rhetorica Utens, this book is about rhetoric as theory AND as practice.
Per the title, I expand upon these themes by offering three core understandings of rhetoric that progressively
unfold over the chapters: Rhetoric as speech, Rhetoric as representation, and Rhetoric as power.

  · Rhetoric as an art of speech is often the most familiar form of rhetoric for undergraduate students.
      They frequently encounter rhetoric as a systematic account of how to deliver genre-defined oratory in
      public speaking and argumentation classes. Here, rhetoric is about speech insofar as it concerns the
      practice of suasive speaking and writing, the artistic proofs (ethos, pathos, and logos) employed by a given
      speaker, as well as the political consequences of speaking that are hard-wired into rhetoric's suite of
      theories. Speech describes a mode of translating thought into action, of imagining the disposition of
      those spoken-to or spoken-about, and vigilantly attending to the ethical consequences of speaking in
      public.

  · Rhetoric as an art of representation expands upon speech by taking into account signs and symbols
      as vehicles for communication and persuasion. Representation requires a similar craft as spoken rhetoric
      insofar as signs and symbols are designed with an audience in mind. However, these audiences are often
      more sprawling and less easily defined than a physical audience, or people gathered in proximity to a
      single speaker. It also requires a different kind of literacy from audiences who regularly encounter signs
      and symbols because representations create an ideological matrix of belief and action. Representations
      are working upon us even when they do not appear to be doing anything at all; they describe ways of
      shaping the world, bringing forth thought and action at the level of the collective, the mass public, and
      the nation.

  · Rhetoric as a technology of power describes the way that communication, persuasion, speech, and
                                                                                                                                   INTRODUCTION | 3

representation work in tandem to create and dismantle a "natural" conception of lived reality. Rhetoric
makes and unmakes social and symbolic hierarchies; it attunes us to (incorrectly) believe that social
stratification is normal or natural and provides an available means of undermining the social hierarchies
that have become entrenched parts of lived experience. As a technology of power, rhetoric alerts us to the
fact that our experiences speech, representation, and force are vastly different from one another. My
familiar way of understanding and navigating this world cannot be generalized. It is habituated, made
familiar by systems that are beyond perception but not beyond change. Power varies vastly depending on
our experience in this nation or in others depending, for instance, on one's position relative to the
history of colonization, human enslavement, and imperialism. Because power is distinct within different
cultures, under different forms of governance, and within distinct racial and gendered regimes, rhetoric
can help us to understand how power acquires the feel of being `natural' or `normal' and how a shift in
speaking and action can recalibrate these force relations.

   A Note on Citing this Book
   As a final note, although each chapter also includes a note on how to cite this book, I strongly encourage
students to cite the linked sources within the text itself. One example is the term "persona," which has a long
scholarly history in rhetorical studies. Many of the folks who have contributed to this conversation are cited if
not also hyperlinked within this book. The same goes for any number of other concepts.
   Please cite those original sources when possible! A key affordance of a resource like this one is that it makes a
wide selection of scholarship readily available to students and instructors. These ideas are not my inventions:
they are the intellectual yield of hundreds of rhetoricians, accumulated over many, many, many years.
Rhetorical theory is not a finished project and our work here is ongoing. In the meanwhile, however, I wish
you all the best in your teaching and learning.

                Thank you for picking up Reading Rhetorical Theory!

   I hope that it is engaging and useful. If you have feedback, we have also set up this survey for you to let us

UPDATES AND REVISIONS

This page contains a record of updates to Reading Rhetorical Theory (RRT). Although there are no new
`editions' of this volume due to the editable OER format, this page is intended to offer a similar form of
documentation. Each series of updates is accompanied by a year-date and a version number.

Updates in 2025: RRT Version 2.0

In 2025, Reading Rhetorical Theory underwent several major updates:

 1. The order of chapters was changed and sorted under new headers to better reflect the progression of the
      book's major units.

          Explanatory prefaces were added for Part 1: Speech, Part 2: Representation, and Part 3: Power.
            Each of these unit introductions contains an overview of the unit and an explanation of the
            chapter progression.

          The Rhetorical Situation was moved to the end of Part 1: Speech.
          Rhetoric and Ideology was moved to the beginning of Part 3: Power.
          The Settler Situation was re-titled Settler-Colonial Rhetoric(s). It appears in Part 3: Power.
          The Secrecy Situation was re-titled The Rhetoric of Secrecy and Surveillance. It appears in Part 3:

            Power.
          The Digital Situation was re-titled Digital Rhetoric(s). It appears in Part 3: Power.

 2. New chapters from invited subject-matter experts (see "Contributors") have been included across each
      of the sections. These are scheduled for release in early 2025.

          "Rhetoric and the First Amendment" by Emily Berg Paup
          "The Public Sphere" by Angela McGowan-Kirsch (Published online 1/3/25)
          "Counterpublics" by Carlos A. Flores and Sarah E. Jones (Published online 1/3/25)
          "Latine Rhetoric(s)" by Robert Mejia and Diana Isabel Martínez

These changes bring the total number of chapters in the book to 18, although as always, there is not -- and will
never be -- a chapter 13. While the web address of the textbook remains identical, nearly all of the chapters have
10 | UPDATES AND REVISIONS

new permalinks. This change was necessary because many of the original links contained a chapter number
that had to be adjusted due to the inclusion of new chapters and the reorganization of existing chapters.

   Other, smaller changes in 2025 include:

PART 1: SPEECH

To understand rhetoric as "speech" can mean many things. In most historically distant cases, rhetoric is an
art of speech and political oratory; a series of proofs and techniques that prepares the speaker for any possible
situation: past, present, or future. Understanding rhetoric as speech can be a way to set it apart from other,
related terms, like argument. If arguments refer to the logical form and presentation of claims and evidence,
then speeches demand a different rhetorical skill sets like attentiveness to an audience, faculties (abilities)
of observation, and adaptability to the particular contexts where speech is called for. Often, students first
encounter rhetoric as an art of speaking in their public speaking courses, where rhetorical terms and concepts
are aligned with techniques of speaking well on specific topics or under specific circumstances. Such rhetoric
can be informative, persuasive, and ceremonial; it can be spoken and written; it can make sense of series of
urgent problems in ways that allow audiences to reckon with a difficult set of circumstances.

Why These Chapters?

This book opens with a quick review of what rhetorical theory conventionally is taken to be and covers the
three headings that comprise its major units: speech, representation, and power. From there, this unit focuses
on the first of these terms: speech. Conventionally, rhetorical theory classes have started with an Ancient Greek
                                                                                                                                          PART 1: SPEECH | 13

context because (1) it is etymological (linguistic) origin of the word `rhetoric' and (2) it is a case study in how
and why speech is a powerful political tool when leveraged as a means of persuasion.

   Chapter 2 accounts for the Sophists and how their reputations were smeared by Socrates/Plato, while
Chapter 3 accounts for philosopher-sophists like Aristotle and Isocrates, whose concerns about rhetoric-as-
dangerous persuasion allow us to see parallels with the 20th century U.S. context of dangerous propaganda.
There are, of course, problems with starting with this context: Ancient Greece was not as `ideal' of a democracy
as has often been taught, the role of speech in it cannot be easily generalized to a contemporary context, and
ancient Greek teachers of speech -- the Sophists -- have a lasting negative reputation because of philosophers
like Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Isocrates, and others. The purpose of starting with Ancient Greece is to draw out
these complexities, warts and all.

   From there, Chapter 4 by Emily Berg Paup expands on speech as a legally enshrined right codified into law,
drawing on Greek terms such as isegoria and parrhesia as the precedent for what we might think of as `free'
and `fearless' speech. It accounts for the transformations of speech in a more contemporary context and how
we might imagine rhetoric to be a suitable explanatory mechanism not for explaining what speech is in a fixed
or forever sense, but how it fluctuates and changes with the times.

   Chapter 5, 2hich concludes this unit, is about "the rhetorical situation," a popular framework employed
by many rhetorical scholars for the analysis of speeches and the specific context that informs them. Drawing
on distinct elements (exigence, audience, and constraints) the rhetorical situation offers a powerful lens to
understand why a speech was delivered when it was delivered, and how this context is essential for
understanding rhetoric's received meanings, then and now.

CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS RHETORICAL
THEORY?

"chicago bean during sunrise" by Wright Way Photography, CC BY 2.0

This chapter offers a brief overview and definitions of rhetorical theory. "Theory" is sometimes imagined
as abstract thinking or complex philosophy. However, in this class "theory" is something that all people
do when they seek to apply a way of thinking about the world to real-life circumstances. It describes the
imaginative and practical meanings that are applied to a surrounding world, and how we revise those meanings
in accordance with perceived changes to that environment. Rhetorical Theory most often describes our
ways of understanding practices of meaning-making and interpretation that rely on persuasion. As explained
below, persuasion is traditionally associated with historical practices of speeches and speech-making. This is
why Rhetorical Theory is often described as the "art of persuasion" or the "art of speechmaking," although
subsequent chapters will build on (and depart from) this foundation.

             · Handout: Definitions of Rhetoric

 Defining Rhetorical Theory

  The two Greek words that combine to form rhetoric are techne, as art or skill, and rhetor, or speaker. The
  two terms are not explicitly linked in fifth-century Greek texts, and there is no explicit reference to the art of
  persuasion in the first recorded use of the word. The word rhetor was a legal term denoting a specific class of
  people: those who often put forward motions in courts of law and in the general assembly.

     Perhaps the most widely circulated definition of rhetoric still circulating today is from Aristotle: "the faculty
  of observing the available means of persuasion, in any given situation."1 That means that rhetoric isn't just how
  we persuade. It's also the ability to stand back from the scenes where persuasion happens to understand how

                                                                                                     CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS RHETORICAL THEORY? | 17

  and why it is happening. Another popular definition of rhetoric is "the capacity to affect and be affected." This
  means that rhetoric becomes the art of movement, or how people use their bodies to create movements and
  change. Both definitions capture the perspective that we can take when we think rhetorically: one that seeks
  to understand the way that influence and power move and the role of communication in creating common
  knowledge.

     My preferred definition of rhetoric is "the active and retroactive organization of discourse." This means that
  rhetoric is a way of creating a shared perspective on the past and future, a way of organizing speech to correct or
  realign a point of view. At its most basic, we might think of rhetoric as "the art of speaking" or even "the art of
  speaking well," which is part of the reason why public speaking classes are housed in Communication Studies
  departments. Before Communication Studies existed as an academic discipline, most of these departments
  were named "Speech Communication," which reflects rhetoric's traditional emphasis on the theory, criticism,
  and practice of speech-making. That's still a central aspect of the theory that rhetoricians are interested in,
  although these theories have also grown broader in scope.

     In this class, rhetoric, as we understand it today, is a collection of humanist, literary, and political theories
  that explain how speech motivates human action and imagines possible futures. As developed in this un-
  textbook, it is a theory of how speech, representation, and power are instruments rooted in understandings
  of persuasion and its audiences. Persuasion is key to rhetoric because it is both the thing that rhetoricians study
  and the thing that rhetorical scholarship seeks to generate: the imagining of a more just world.

     More important than just defining rhetoric is thinking critically about which definitions of rhetoric that
  we choose to embrace. Although he is among the earliest people to theorize rhetoric, Aristotle is not always
  the best authority because we would register many of the views he espoused as philosophy as categorically
  inhumane or racist.

     It is important not only to situate rhetorical theory in the context from which it emerges but also to assess
  the utility of these theories according to the ethical standards that we would abide by in our own present-day.
  As the scholar and abolitionist Joy James writes:

        Philosophy or theory courses may emphasize logic and memorizing the history of "Western" philosophy rather
        than the activity of creating philosophies or theorizing. When the logic of propositions is the primary object of
        study, how one argues becomes more important than for what one argues. The exercise of reason may take place
        within an illogical context -- in which academic canons absurdly claim universal supremacy derived from the
        hierarchical splintering of humanity into greater and lesser beings, or the European Enlightenment's deification
        of scientific rationalism as the truly "valid" approach to "Truth.2

  In keeping with James's statement, this class seeks to critically address how rhetorical theory has been made or

2. Joy James, Seeking the Beloved Community, Albany: State University of New York Press, p.4.
   18 | CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS RHETORICAL THEORY?

  built. It is not just about memorizing rhetoric's ancient history. It does not seek to elevate a predominantly
  white or "Western" tradition as the only one that matters or exists.

     One way to think beyond this tradition is what rhetorical theorist Molefi Kete Asante calls "Afrocentricity."
  Afrocentricity describes a worldview that is "pro-African and consistent in its beliefs that technology belongs to
  the world; Afrocentricity is African genius and African values created reconstructed and derived from our history
  and experiences in our best interests." Asante argues that Afrocentricity is essential to understanding rhetoric for
  the following reasons:

        "Maulana Karenga argues that "no people can turn its history and humanity over to alien hands and expect social
        justice and respect" (Karenga, 1979). Language is the essential instrument of social cohesion. Social cohesion is
        the fundamental clement of liberation. All language is epistemic. Our language provides our understanding of
        our reality. A revolutionary language must not befuddle; it cannot be allowed to confuse. Critics must actively
        pursue the clarification of public language when they believe it is designed to whiten the issues. We know
        through science and rhetoric; they are parallel systems of epistemology. Rhetoric is art and art is as much a way
        of knowing as science." 3

  This course is about rhetorical terms and concepts. It is also about why it matters where and when we start
  rhetoric's story and why rhetorical criticism is still a useful theory of practice. In this un-textbook, we will
  return to ancient Greece, but with a specific purpose: to highlight the ways that rhetoric signaled a broken or
  unhealthy state of public and political affairs. By telling this ancient story in this way, we may also bear witness
  to how the characteristically unjust patterns and practices of those times live on for us in the present day.

 Artistic Proofs and Genres

  Let's talk about some of the most commonly discussed concepts in rhetoric and rhetorical theory: ethos, pathos,
  and logos, which are also known as the artistic proofs. The phrase "artistic proofs" means that they are the
  elements of persuasion that originate from the speaker, rather than from inartistic sources, or the data the
  speaker uses but did not `originate,' `invent,' or `create.' Entire courses on rhetorical theory have been built
  around these concepts. They correspond to the major premises of Aristotle's book, the Rhetoric, and form
  three pillars that much present-day rhetorical theory is built upon.

     · Ethos, or the appeal to authority. These are the ethical proofs derived from the moral character of the
        speaker.

     · Pathos, or the appeal to the emotions. The objective of pathos is to put the hearer into a certain frame

   of mind using what the speaker already knows about their audience.
· Logos, or the appeal to reason, logic, and the word. These are the proofs contained in the speech itself

   when a real or apparent truth is demonstrated. The two modes of logical proof that Aristotle describes
   are induction and deduction. Induction refers to "bottom-up" reasoning; deduction refers to principles
   applied from the "top-down."

Aristotle's explanation of logos also describes three genres of rhetoric, which correspond to different "tenses"
in which a speech may be made. These include the forensic, the epideictic, and the deliberative. In each of
these, rhetoric manages some uncertainty: uncertainty over what is and what is not; uncertainty over whether
to praise or to blame; and uncertainty over what one should or should not do.

The Genres of Speech

               Forensic                            Epideictic                           Deliberative

               The Past                           The Present                            The Future

Facts: whether a thing did or did not  Values: whether to issue praise or  Policy: whether we should or should
                happen.                               blame.                          not take action.

       Judiciary or the Courts                Punditry or Eulogy                    Legislation and Law

The forensic genre of rhetoric is about matters of fact, what is and is not, what did or did not happen. The
forensic corresponds to the past. The site of forensic arguments is typically the judicial system and the courts.
Today, the word "forensic" has meaning specifically in a criminal justice context. There, and on "forensic"
science television shows, the problem is reconstructing the past, what did or did not happen, who did or did
not perpetrate the act.

   The epideictic genre of rhetoric is about matters of praise or blame, whether to celebrate or to denounce.
20 | CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS RHETORICAL THEORY?

It corresponds to the now, the place between past and future. Epideictic speeches are traditionally speeches
like eulogies, special-occasion speeches, or toasts; other versions of epideictic could include newspaper opinion-
editorials, news-comedy hybrids, or pundit pieces that try to offer `spin' to politicize a person or issue. They
can also be speeches, images, and text that highlight a "now" as a particularly urgent or important moment of
transition or change.

   The deliberative genre of rhetoric is about policy and what should or should not be done. The deliberative
corresponds to the future and the course of action that should be taken to attain it. It is traditionally associated
with lawmaking and legislature. A speech about the decision to impeach, for instance, is a deliberative one: it is
a question of policy and the path that people should pursue.

   This rhetorical terminology -- ethos, pathos, and logos; forensic, epideictic, and deliberative -- is just some
of the basic language that is most often associated with the history and discipline of rhetoric. If you take classes
in rhetoric elsewhere in the university, you will very likely encounter these foundational terms again.

Histories of Rhetorical Theory

The last thing I want to talk about is the organization of this course and how it relates to the history of rhetoric.
Most of the time, rhetorical theory classes start in Classical Greece, where the term was allegedly invented. They
might then move through Rome into Western Europe. Many times, such classes end in the 20th century when
speech communication departments began appearing in American universities around 1914. Sometimes these
courses also cover the 20th century and the developments of structuralist, post-structuralist, and materialist
                                                                                                  CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS RHETORICAL THEORY? | 21

theories. In Communication Studies, this could also include accounts of the functionalist, constructivist, and
critical traditions.

   This textbook organizes a range of traditions of rhetoric under three headings: speech, representation, and
power. Each of these headings captures a wide array of rhetorical theories and span from the ancient to the
contemporary. These headings are imperfect at best, given that there is considerable room for overlap. The
chapters on the ancient Greek context, ongoing legal battles over the first amendment in the United States,
the rhetorical situation, publics, and counterpublics all attest to the role of speech in shaping, exercising,
and channeling power. Settler colonial rhetorics are often enmeshed with problems related to representation
such as symbols and narrative. Even if they are imperfect, these categories are intended to offer some concrete
coordinates for how we may locate rhetoric in a general sense given how difficult it can be to define.

  · Speech. One of rhetoric's earliest and most enduring associations is as a theory of speech, which tends to
      feature problems related to persuasion, contingency (i.e., uncertainty), and adaptability to a specific
      situation. Early chapters are devoted to the so-called "origins" of rhetorical theory, its deeply troubling
      beginnings, and the idea of the "common good." We start here because this history helps us to define
      rhetoric and illustrates how problems within a rhetorical culture illuminate similar problems that
      resonate with us in the early 21st century. It then moves to more contemporary frameworks that
      similarly center rhetoric's role as an art of speech, persuasion, and world making with chapters on
      rhetoric and the first amendment and the rhetorical situation, an evolving framework for studying
      speech within and across distinct moments in time.

  · Representation. When rhetorical theories are associated with representation, they tend to feature
      problems related to the interpretation of signs, symbols, and arguments as well as the unique tools
      associated with crafting and deciphering messages in written, visual, and narrative forms. This part of
      the book also offers chapters on the public sphere and counterpublics, both of which grapple with
      the problem of representation in terms of audience: who is `the' public, and what other kinds of publics
      might it be defined against?

  · Power. When rhetorical theories are associated with power, they tend to feature problems related to the
      complex interaction among ideology, institutions, identities, histories, and technologies in the creation
      of unequal social hierarchies and strategies for dismantling structures that uphold inequitable force
      relations among different groups. In this final part of the book, chapters offer detailed accounts of how
      rhetoric is related to ideology, how we may redefine rhetoric's core tenets around the culture, identity,
      and traditions of Latine rhetorical theory, the enduring and transforming legacies of settler-
      colonialism, the way that secrets and surveillance make use of rhetoric to keep different publics
      distracted or in compliance, and how digital rhetorics preserve and transform ancient ways of thinking
      about the spoken arts.

Speech, words, and language have consistent and long-lasting effects. Rhetorical theory can describe the ability
22 | CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS RHETORICAL THEORY?

of a speaker to invent persuasion, envision and steer their audience, and change the real-world scenes where
rhetoric is received or taken up. Rhetorical theory is also a way of understanding the process of public meaning-
making, or how representations can take on a vital life of their own. Finally, rhetorical theory can be a tool for
ethical world-making, one that allows us to make more deliberate and inclusive choices about our speech.

 Part 1: Why Ancient Greece?

  In the last lecture, we introduced the term "rhetoric" by drawing on Greek terminology. Beginning rhetoric's
  history in ancient Greece is a common choice, but it is not rhetoric's only starting point. We could, for
  instance, "start" our history of rhetoric in 1914 with the invention of "speech communication" in American
  universities. (That is also how we came to have Communication Studies Departments at universities around
  the country). Alternatively, we could also begin in China, Egypt, South America, or Mesopotamia. In these
  places, documented evidence that persuasion was a studied and practiced art existed even before the Greek
  invention of the word "rhetoric."1 As Carol L. Lipson and Roberta A. Binkley argue, when we think about
  rhetoric as the art of persuasion, it may take many different forms depending upon the original cultural context
  we start from.

        The classical rhetorical system has built within it an understanding that ethos and pathos are central factors in
        the success of a text (along with logos), and that ethos and pathos must be appropriately suited for the particular
        audience. It's not much of a stretch to look at rhetoric as contextualized culturally, with practices and values
        and norms differing in different cultural settings. Indeed, in the field of rhetoric and composition, the term
        alternative rhetorics is being used to describe rhetorical approaches in particular cultures that differ from the
        dominant paradigm.2

  Where we choose to start rhetoric's history is important for other reasons. Greece is sometimes treated as the
  "first" democracy or as the birthplace of philosophy. This chapter starts in ancient Greece because I would
  like to challenge some of those common assumptions. Ancient Greece presents ideas about democracy and
  philosophy that are very different than those that are common today. Additionally, we will learn how the
  ancient Greek invention of rhetoric teaches us about communication problems and social inequalities that
  mirror the distress in our own political culture.

     This chapter is also critical of the ancient Greeks because they only recognized the personhood of adult,
  property-owning men. These people alone were allowed to participate in democratic governance, which means
  that it was not a truly egalitarian democracy, which presumes the equality of all stakeholders or participants.
  Ancient Greece generally (and ancient Athens specifically) excluded foreign-born non-citizens, women, and
  enslaved or indentured persons from participating in the political life of the city-state (or polis). Ultimately,
  if we start the history of rhetoric with ancient Greece, then we also need to think about how the deep social
  inequalities of that society are reflections of related problems in the present-day United States.

 The Invention of "Rhetoric"

  The previous chapter discussed how "rhetoric" combines the words "rhetor" and "techne," each of which
  describes a kind of speaker and their technique or art. According to rhetorical scholar Edward Schiappa, Plato
  invents the word "rhetoric."3 Apparently, Plato also invented many words in his dialogues that are difficult to
  locate elsewhere in the Greek historical record, such as "eristic" (or point-scoring debates) and "anti-logic" (or
  debating both sides of an issue).

     But why does Plato invent the word rhetoric? What was his purpose in giving a name to "the art of the
  speaker"? Who would have counted as a "rhetor" or "speaker" for Plato and his contemporaries? Who did the
  word "rhetoric" exclude?

     One answer is that Plato invents the word rhetoric to describe a kind of teaching that was common when
  he and his teacher, Socrates, lived. According to Plato, rhetorical teaching was administered by a group of
  people called "the sophists". Plato was deeply skeptical of the sophists, and so he used the word rhetoric to
  describe speech that was dangerous and disingenuous. "The sophists" were teachers of speech and argument
  who would train "ordinary" citizens in the art of persuasion. The sophists were like early professors, each with
  their own schools and following of students. Much like today, the sophists advertised themselves as individuals
  who offered tools for upward mobility. By learning to speak well in public, a person could win court cases or
  steer public opinion. Plato and Socrates believed these teachers and their rhetorical teachings were dangerous
  because they promised anyone the ability to make compelling arguments in courts and the assembly without
  a clear sense of the values that should guide this kind of speech. However, as Plato also argues, the sophists
  primarily catered to people who could afford them. This means that "ordinary" must be put in scare quotes
  because the people who benefitted from the sophists' instruction were in all likelihood wealthy aristocrats.

     Plato attacks the sophists a lot. In the dialogue entitled the Sophist, he describes the sophists, or rhetoric
  teachers, as "paid hunters of rich men" who have expertise in no particular subject but claim expertise in all
  subjects. In Gorgias, Plato says that rhetoric is not a true art but a "knack" of creating artificial appearances or

illusions with speech. That's also where Plato allegedly invents the word rhetoric, where Plato calls sophists out
- primarily the sophist Gorgias - for being opportunistic liars and charlatans.

   Rhetoric, according to Plato, is dangerous because it is a way of producing a "fake" reality. He argues that
it is not a true art form, but a "knack" or aptitude for creating a misleading illusion. He says that it is less like
medicine than "cookery." If rhetoric were a true art, it would heal the political body of the polis. But because it
is just "cookery," rhetoric often sounds, looks, tastes, and smells good while in fact worsening the health of its
listeners.

A strange twist in this story is that no sophist ever used the word "rhetoric" to describe their public speaking lessons.
It is a word invented by Plato to call the sophist out for unethical teaching. For that reason, it is not clear that
Plato is an entirely credible source on the sophists - or rhetoric. Why? Because Plato's act of pejorative naming
used rhetoric to persuade people that the sophists could not be trusted. Although he dismisses rhetoric, his
comparison to "cookery" is an example of rhetoric, employing persuasion to make a point. In that way, Plato
is more than a philosopher; he is also a kind of sophist. He stands apart because he writes about the sophists as
persuasive object lessons about the dangerous effects of rhetoric.

   That is one way the Greek context reflects contemporary communication problems: Just as Plato blamed
the sophists for the problems of the ancient Athenian polis, bad or disingenuous rhetoric is often blamed
for creating "fake news," conspiracy theories, and disinformation. This book is
about reading and practicing rhetoric. It also widens the scope of what rhetoric can be, beyond spoken
persuasion. It is about the uses and function of rhetoric as a practical strategy of persuasion, much like the
sophists taught. However, it is also about knowing rhetoric when we see it. In the case described above, this
   28 | CHAPTER 2: THE "ORIGINS" OF RHETORICAL THEORY

  means understanding that Plato uses certain persuasive techniques to criticize the sophists, an ancient Greek
  group of professional persuaders.

 Athenian Democracy  Contemporary Democracy

  Ancient Greek democracy was also very different from the structure of representation in a present-day
  democratic republic. Our structures of government do not look at all like Athenian democratic institutions.
  Before democracy in Athens, the government was based on family ties.4 By 450 BCE, early Athenian leaders
  Kleisthenes and Ephialtes had instituted two political reforms in Athens, the "hallmarks" of its democracy.
  However, these reforms also indicate just how different this democracy was relative to a present-day American
  context.

    1. The lottery reforms of Kleisthenes. Kliesthenes' reforms eliminated the aristocratic, family-based
        government and replaced it with a representative democracy based on wealth and land ownership. High
        offices were entrusted by lot -- random selection followed by a vote -- only to citizens perceived as fit.
        In addition to excluding women, enslaved persons, and those who did not own property in the
        Athenian polis, the government retained policies of ostracism, whereby selected individuals perceived to
        be too dangerous for the political life of the city-state were exiled for approximately ten years.

    2. The court reforms of Ephialtes. Ephialtes' court reforms reduced the role of court magistrates and
        replaced them with common courts where decisions were rendered by juries chosen from the citizenry.
        The consequence of this second set of reforms (Ephialtes) was that any citizen could bring a suit against
        any other, and except for sacrilege or homicide, would be decided by an Athenian jury. But, in this new
        court system, citizens always represented themselves and had to argue their own cases. There were no
        lawyers in the modern sense. Additionally, juries consisted of 200+ members, and deliberations were
        considerably more public than they are today.

  In the assembly and the courts, the ability to be eloquent was very desirable. That's "why" rhetoric, the art of
  the speaker, may have been both desirable and dangerous. Among the many things that the Sophists claimed
  to teach, public speaking was the most sought after.

 Social Inequalities in Ancient Greece

  Perhaps the most prominent parallel between ancient Greece and today are deep social inequalities. This was
  especially true because the reforms mentioned in the previous section didn't eliminate status or the privilege
  of inherited family wealth. Democracy just created a situation whereby these privileges could be neutralized
  by the influence a speaker might possess. It is no small irony that, because the sophists charged such large fees,
  mostly the wealthy could afford the instruction. Beyond wealth inequalities in ancient Greece, there is evidence
  that Athenian culture was not an ideal democracy where all people were equal and "the people" made decisions
  in common. This is also why Greece holds a mirror up to our own problems: it shows us how problems with
  our own rhetorical culture may be tied to entrenched social inequalities.

    1. Indenture and Enslavement. One often-unacknowledged aspect of ancient Greek history concerns
        ancient Greek practices of slavery (doulí), which is part of rhetorical terms like epideictic. The peoples
        of ancient Syracuse are, for example, the reputed originators of epideictic or commemorative speech that
        brings persuasion "before the eyes." In its earliest recorded form, epideictic was a mode of secret sign-
        language communication among the enslaved peoples of Syracuse.5 It was necessary for the people of
        Syracuse to communicate in secret because the tyrannical rulers of Syracuse, Hieron and Gelon, had
        prohibited people from speaking aloud. Epideictic, in other words, originates as a language made up of
        physical gestures, but then, much later, curiously appears as a name for an important genre in
        Aristotle's Rhetoric.

    2. Denial of Citizenship to Women. As rhetorical scholar Jane Sutton notes, patriarchal governance in
        the ancient polis coerced women into contradictory and repressive roles.6 They were also systematically
        excluded from the history of philosophy and the teaching of rhetoric. Misogyny was also perpetuated by
        the belief that women "cannot be controlled or possessed." Helen of Troy, for instance, was often

        depicted as a seductress or else denied that she possessed agency at all.7 Greek men also openly
        appropriated women's intellectual contributions. In their article on Aspasia the sophist, Jarratt and Ong
        argue that Plato "insinuated ... that women would gain their status primarily from association with well-
        born men." He also "chose a form that typically referred to women only ... as reproducers of warriors."
         Plato also argued that his dialogues are a kind of "maieutics," or midwifery, which was Aspasia's own
        avowed profession. Plato "appropriates reproduction for the male philosopher," denying Aspasia (and
        potentially other women sophists) credit by claiming her inventions as his own.
    3. Colonialism and Xenophobia. Ancient Athenians were reportedly suspicious of outside influence
        and were hostile to foreign-born non-citizens. Susan Jarratt and Rory Ong also describe Ancient greek
        xenophobia as the rejection of foreigners from the Athenian polis. Foreignness was a way to exclude
        people from participation in ancient Athens for another reason: some non-citizens were suspected of
        being spies. For example, Aristotle, who was not born in Athens, fled into exile to the isle of Lesbos
        because he was suspected to be a Macedonian spy. This was also the case with the sophists, who most
        often taught outside of the city limits.

        Foreigners had no more than a distant relationship to any country because they were wanderers ... Athenians ...
        were situated on the land that had created them."8

  One reason why we should be skeptical of the idea that ancient Athens was an "ideal" democracy was that there
  is significant evidence that shows that the members of its society were far from "equals." As is also true in the
  contemporary United States, ancient Athens had deep problems related to inclusion. Only citizens -- that is,
  wealthy, land-owning men -- had the ability to participate in government. Often, those who did not have that
  status had their ideas and labor stolen from them. It was not an ideal democracy because it privileged those
  who had already accumulated wealth, power, and property.

     Ultimately, we shouldn't believe that Athens was the city-state (or polis) in Greece that presents an "ideal"
  model of democracy because philosophers literally took ideas from people who had lesser status. All people
  who lived in the polis were not equals. Instead, Greek culture embraced regressive ideas about who did not
  count as a `person' based on status, gender, land, and ownership.

  Part 2: Sophistic Knowledge and the Encomium

   This section goes into greater detail about the sophists. Who were they? What did they teach? What kinds of
   persuasion are they famous for?

      The sophists emerged in Ancient Greece as teachers of general wisdom and were most valued because of
   their ability to teach public speaking. They emerged out of a culture of competition and valued poetry as a key
   way to keep a common record of important historical events.

      Before the sophists, poets like Pindar had stood at the sidelines of athletic contests exalting the sons of
   aristocrats and praising heroic deeds and ideals.9 The poet was an observer to such competitions. However, the
   Sophists, like other athletes, musicians, and dramatists in their era, thought of themselves as competitors. They
   sought to achieve victories by overpowering adversaries with their words.10 With this change from observation
   to participation in place, to be an orator meant both to accept and issue symbolic challenges.11 It also meant to
   engage in the production and critique of rhetoric, a kind of verbal combat in which no point of view remained
   unopposed for long. It meant that a prevalent argument was prevalent not because of its historical status
   or its compelling logic but because it had been tested by and withstood the attacks of the opposing side(s).
   Importantly, one of the criticisms of the sophists is that a "both sides" style of teaching is not a good way to
   impart virtue or ethics to students or listeners.

   The sophists also lived in an oral culture and at a time of emergent literate culture.12 Oral cultures refer to
   cultures that spread knowledge primarily by way of the spoken word and whose techniques of communication
   and memory are centered upon the delivering of speeches used for (for instance) trials, commemoration,
   legislation, and the recording of history.

32 | CHAPTER 2: THE "ORIGINS" OF RHETORICAL THEORY

   (1) Orality describes a mode of information transmission that primarily occurs through speech. It has the
following characteristics:

  · Orality is Low-fidelity. This means that information is passed around like a game of "telephone." As
      information is passed around from person to person, the transmitted knowledge is not identical to the
      source.

  · Orality is a means of Information Storage and Transmission: Mnemonic devices, meter, and
      rhyme are ways of recording and remembering information. Poetry is not just a way of making speech
      eloquent; it was a functional way of ensuring that the past carried forward into the future.

  · Orality is a Social Function of Memory: telling history is an entertainment event, and public
      speaking is a shared public ritual. Ancient Greek plays, like Sophocles' Oedipus Rex and Antigone, had a
      similar function of entertainment and were consistently organized around the "chorus," an audience to
      the play that was also a participant to the play, which would act as a kind of moral conscience, spelling
      out the `lesson' for the attending audience.

(2) Literacy describes a mode of information transmission that primarily occurs through writing. It has the
following characteristics:

  · Literacy is High-Fidelity. This means that the transmission of knowledge became significantly more
      consistent from one telling to another because literacy enables the copying of one text repeatedly. For
      example, Homeric epics like the Iliad and the Odyssey begin in an oral culture, where they were much
      more variable, changing between different tellings. With literate culture, these stories became "rigidified"
      in form and content and more consistent in their different `parts.'

  · Literacy makes possible the inscription of laws: writing allows for the codification of a common
      code that is now generally enforceable. It also makes mercantile relationships and the inscription of fixed
      laws possible using ledgers and established legal codes.

  · Literacy increases social emphasis upon logos or `the word' as a fixed and unchanging
      object: "logos" literally means both `the word' and `reasoning,' which writing allows audiences to
      inspect, review and consider over a longer stretch of time than just the performance. When Socrates
      writes about literacy in the Phaedrus, he is critical of it because it means that words suddenly have a life
      beyond their authors and that the "dead letter" may be picked up and examined by people who have no
      understanding of the word and how it is tailored to the soul of the listener. This may also be related to
      the fact that the sophists distributed handbooks of their teachings, meaning that any literate person
      might be able to make strong arguments without necessarily considering the weight or consequences of
      their arguments. Plato also argues against writing in general because it makes memory unnecessary; it
      will install "forgetting," he says, because it makes the soul lazy, reducing its need for recollection. Given
      that we are at the beginning of a digital era ourselves, you might be able to think of similar criticism
                                                                                           CHAPTER 2: THE "ORIGINS" OF RHETORICAL THEORY | 33

         about "millennial" or "zoomer" online culture today.

  Resemblance: The Sophist's Epistemology

   The word "epistemology" refers to "the study of knowledge." Split into its Greek roots, epistemology
   combines episteme (knowledge) + logos (reason or logic). When we talk about epistemology today, it most
   often means "how we know what we know." The scientific method is an example of epistemology: it is a way of
   knowing what we know about the surrounding natural world. When we say "the sophist's epistemology," we
   are asking the following question: what did the sophists know, and how did they know it?

      Generally speaking, the ancient Greeks gathered knowledge in a very different way from how we think of
   it today. They relied on a foundational concept of resemblance, in which a fundamental association between
   dissimilar objects revealed something true about the world.13 One example is how the ancient Greeks associated
   walnuts with healing the human head. The walnut resembles the brain with a hard exterior and a folded
   interior and resembles the cerebrum's appearance. For the sophists, the visual resemblance between objects in
   the natural world dictated an important or essential connection between them.

                        them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=33#oembed-4

   Another example of resemblance is how the ancient Greeks associated the lives of animals, humans, and the
   Gods. The actions of humans mirrored actions that occurred among the gods; other times, animals displayed
   characteristics that resembled the characteristics of men. The quality of metis, or cunning intelligence, was a
   kind of knowledge gotten from resemblance.14 Metis was a trait displayed by animals like octopi and foxes, who
   were capable of making traps and laying in hiding until the right moment. That was metis: an ability to look
   beyond the situation or envision the opportune moment before it happened. But a person, animal, or god
   could also use their metis to blend into the background or wait until just the right moment arrived. Among the
   gods, metis allowed the gods always to be outmaneuvering one another, inventing strategies to get the best of
   their opponents.

     34 | CHAPTER 2: THE "ORIGINS" OF RHETORICAL THEORY

      As rhetoric, metis allowed people to seize the right moment through the gift of foresight. As important
   as what to say was when to say it and to anticipate the moment at which speech was both appropriate and
   effective. This foresight might dictate when to speak or when not to speak, disguising oneself with words like
   an octopus changes their appearance. This intelligent foresight amounts to "knowledge" in Greek thought
   because it was possessed by animals, humans, and the gods. The way these worlds mirror one another offers
   an example of how the Greeks thought in deeply rhetorical terms, namely, by transforming resemblances into
   apparent knowledge of the world.

      Plato's definition of rhetoric in Gorgias15 is an object lesson in Greek resemblance. To define what
   rhetoric is, Plato has use resemblances. In other words, he has to compare the art of rhetoric to other arts that
   either are -- or are not -- similar to it. According to Plato, there are four "true" arts of bodily health and four
   "lesser" arts considered to be their counterfeit reflections. Rhetoric is one of the allegedly "lesser" arts. All of
   the arts "resemble" one another to the extent that they improve health or create a false impression of health.
   The different categories also reflect each other because in each case, Plato's argument builds from arts that are
   for the individual body to arts that are for a collective body-politic:

      · Gymnastics, which improves the health of the (individual) body.
      · Medicine, which improves health by rehabilitating the (individual) body.
      · Legislation, which improves the health of the (collective) body-politic.
      · Justice, which improves health by rehabilitating the (collective) body-politic.

   The lesser arts are about appearances rather than truth. He calls rhetoric a `knack,' not even a true art, and
   states that it "flatters" and "impersonates" the art of justice. These lesser arts give the human body and the
   body-politic what it desires, but not what it needs to survive.

      · Cosmetics, which creates the illusion of (individual) bodily health.
      · Cookery, which makes food to (individual) taste, but not for rehabilitation.
      · Sophistry, which creates the illusion of legislative competence for the (collective) body-politic.
      · Rhetoric, which creates the illusion of serving justice for the (collective) body-politic.

   These four arts are the mirror image of the first four. They resemble each other because they are all "corrupt" in
   related ways. Plato ends his criticism by referencing the resemblance between "cookery" and "rhetoric": Why
   should we mistrust the sophist? "What I say rhetoric is, then - you've heard it. It corresponds to cookery, doing
   in the soul what cookery does in the body." The reason to dismiss rhetoric is that it resembles cookery: it tastes
   good but won't make you well.

      The sophists also developed their own methods for knowledge-making through what we would call a
   "switch-sides" debate. According to the sophist Protagoras, one could only truly know an argument if they
   could argue both sides of the case.16 For that reason, the sophistic instruction called the dissoi logoi, or "opposed
   reason," is typically attributed to Protagoras. The dissoi logoi claims the ability to "make the weaker argument
   [into] the stronger [one]" and is grounded in the presumption of humankind's total ignorance of what
   happens in the celestial or heavenly realm. According to Protagoras, "one cannot know the gods." The
   examples provided in the dissoi logoi include "the good and the bad," asking questions like "are they the same
   or not?" and "on proper and shameful taste," asking the question, "can the same thing be [in good taste] and
   [also] shameful?" This attention to "both-side-ism" is also one way that the Greek context strongly resembles
   our own; it is one of the reasons that the philosopher Plato provides for strongly disliking the sophists and for
   his belief that they have nothing to offer except for lies and illusions.

  The Encomium of Helen

   The Encomium of Helen, written by the sophist Gorgias, offers one way to understand the sophists' way of
   understanding rhetoric to create or constitute social reality.17 Sometimes, the sophists' creation of a shared
   fantasy is described as a "deception" because the speaker misleads the audience into believing false information.
   Other scholars have claimed that what the sophists did was not "deception," but rather that they "[placed]
   all possible representations of reality on equal epistemological footing," creating the opportunity to compare
   different kinds of knowledge.18

   Why did it ever occur to Gorgias that Helen was in need of a speech in which she would be "rescued"? As
   described in the video above, this belief stemmed from the common and misogynistic belief among the ancient
   Greeks that Helen had caused the Trojan war. Many attributed the start of the war specifically to the fact that

36 | CHAPTER 2: THE "ORIGINS" OF RHETORICAL THEORY

Helen, wife to Menelaus, had been taken by Paris of Troy immediately after the Trojans and Greeks had signed
a peace treaty. It is a suspicious rumor for many reasons. When the Greeks went to war, in other words, it
was not the war-making Menelaus - or even Helen's kidnapper, Paris -- who are most often held responsible.
Instead, the Greeks conferred blame on the kidnapped Helen. The encomium of Helen is the sophist Gorgias's
spoken challenge to this common story. He writes the following:

      "either by will of fate and decision of the gods and vote of Necessity did she [Helen] do what she did,
         or by force reduced
         or by words seduced
         or by love possessed."

In other words, Helen "left" Greece because the gods made it so, because she was forced to, because Paris
seduced her, or because the madness of love possessed her. Of course, if the Encomium of Helen "rescues"
Helen from this blame, it's important to note that it does so in a way that is itself deeply misogynistic because
it reduces her freedom or agency. By Gorgias' account, Helen is passive and cannot assume responsibility for
a path she could not have chosen. Helen is redeemed, in his eyes, because she can be made a non-agent; she
cannot be responsible for her actions because her only option was to acquiesce to more powerful forces.

   According to Gorgias's reasoning, if the speech can rescue Helen, it also illustrates how speech (and rhetoric)
can create a shared social reality, moving people toward a new common sense.

      Sacred incantations sung with words are bearers of pleasure and banishers of pain, for, merging with opinion in the
      soul, the power of the incantation is wont to beguile it and persuade it and alter it by witchcraft. There are have been
      discovered two arts of witchcraft and magic: one consists of errors of soul and the other of deceptions of opinion. All
      who have and do persuade people of things do so by molding a false argument.

         To understand that persuasion, when added to speech, is wont also to impress the soul as it wishes, one must study:
      first, the words of astronomers who, substituting opinion for opinion, taking away one but creating another, make
      what is incredible and unclear seem true to the eyes of opinion; then, second, logically necessary debates in which a
      single speech, written with art but not spoken with truth, bends a great crowd and persuades, and third, the verbal
      disputes of philosophers in which the swiftness of thought is also shown making the belief in an opinion subject to
      easy change. The effect of speech upon the condition of the soul is comparable to the power of drugs over the nature of
      bodies. For just as different drugs dispel different secretions from the body, and some bring an end to disease and
      others to life, so also in the case of speeches, some distress, others delight, some cause fear, others make the hearers bold,
      and some drug and bewitch the soul with a kind of evil persuasion.

The final segments of the speech unify the audience with Helen by drawing a parallel between their supposed
intoxication with Gorgias' speech. `Being persuaded by speech' is made `unfortunate,' a decision imposed
rather than chosen. If persuaded by Gorgias' own claim to non-truth, the audience must accede to the claim
that Helen herself was constructed falsely, or misconstrued, in Homer's familiar narrative.

CHAPTER 3: PROPAGANDA AND THE
COMMON GOOD

This chapter addresses propagandistic persuasion and ideas related to civic virtue. The first section covers
deception, a distant Greek relative to the concept of propaganda, as well as how Greek history has been used as a
destructive form of propaganda in American history. The second section addresses how rhetoric was thought
to be opposed to common well-being (or civic virtue) as well as how certain ideas related to civic virtue became
a part of early theories of rhetoric.

 Part 1: The Propaganda of History

  The phrase "The Propaganda of History" is the title of a chapter of W.E.B Dubois's Black Reconstruction
  in America. As Dubois explains, it is important to recount history truthfully and as fully as possible. This is
  because history, told untruthfully, may be put in service of dangerous beliefs, naïve idealism, and the idea that
  our history is continuous with only positive developments. These, Dubois says, are pitfalls of telling history
  "unscientifically" or inaccurately.

        If history is going to be scientific, if the record of human action is going to be set down with that accuracy and
        faithfulness of detail which will allow its use as a measuring rod and guidepost for the future of nations, there
        must be set some standards of ethics in research and interpretation. If, on the other hand, we are going to use
        history for our pleasure and amusement, for inflating our national ego, and giving us a false but pleasurable sense
        of accomplishment, then we must give up the idea of history either as a science or as an art using the results of
        science, and admit frankly that we are using a version of historic fact in order to influence and educate the new
        generation along the way we wish. It is propaganda like this that has led men in the past to insist that history is
        `lies agreed upon'; and to point out the danger in such misinformation. It is indeed extremely doubtful if any
        permanent benefit comes to the world through such action. Nations reel and stagger on their way; they make
        hideous mistakes; they commit frightful wrongs; they do great and beautiful things. And shall we not best guide
        humanity by telling the truth about all this, so far as the truth is ascertainable?1

 Ancient Greek Storytelling as "Deception"

  One aspect of Ancient Greek history, especially as told by the Ancient Greeks, is that it blurs the line between
  fiction and what Dubois would call the "scientific" account of past events, which renders the with past clear
  and concrete evidence. With the grand, epic poems, such as those commemorating the Trojan War, details
  might change from speaker to speaker while retaining the pivotal moments: Helen, the horse, Achilles.

   As Simon Critchley, author of Tragedy, the Greeks, and Us, explains, the knowledge that such stories

communicated was more critical than a faithful retelling. That's why Critchley says that tragedy is an invention
and an institution; it served a function then that we cannot relate to today insofar as it was a way to create
shared stories and community. That's also why he says it's anachronistic and self-consciously fictional; it is out-
of-sequence, and the details never seem to stay the same. Especially consistent in Greek tellings of history and
poetry were tragic knowledge and the ruse of deception. According to Gorgias, author of Helen's Encomium,
tragedy creates "a deception in which the deceiver is more honest than the non-deceiver, and the deceived is
wiser than the non-deceived." Today, we would consider that position categorically immoral, in part because it
is possible to have a truthful rendering of history. Often, the tragedy of history surpasses the tragedy of fictional
events. But, among the Greeks, history was self-evidently a fiction or propaganda: an engaging story designed
to teach a lesson.

   When I say that the Ancient Greeks thought of history as tragedy and a story that teaches a lesson, it also
tells us something about the play Oedipus Rex, which Critchley also describes and is sometimes synonymous
with "Greek tragedy."

                   The author of "The Fault in Our Stars" discusses Oedipus Rex. 14 minutes.
   The point of Oedipus Rex is that the audience is always "in" on the information that fate will reveal to
the main character, namely Oedipus's family of origin. In effect, when Oedipus learns his last name he also
discovers the crimes he has committed against his own family. When Critchley describes how Oedipus "doesn't
hear what is said to him and doesn't see what is in front of his eyes," it is because the audience is there, hearing
and seeing him ignore a lesson that is very obvious to everyone else who is watching the play.
   The point of tragedy is the lesson: to witness how a person may go through life with the truth in front
of them, unable to see it. For the audience, the point is to learn how to rid ourselves of Oedipus's kind of
stunted perception. By allowing ourselves to be "deceived" - suspending disbelief or pretending as if the
                                                                                       CHAPTER 3: PROPAGANDA AND THE COMMON GOOD | 41

  fictional actions on stage were real - tragedy allows us to learn something about ourselves. By watching
  tragic knowledge dawn on a fictional someone else, the audience becomes more able to anticipate moments
  when tragic knowledge dawns upon them, to change how they act, and to handle such moments with greater
  courage.

     Ultimately, that is what Critchley and Gorgias mean when they celebrate rhetoric as "a deception in which
  the deceiver is more honest than the non-deceiver, and the deceived is wiser than the non-deceived." By
  watching the fictional story unfold, the audience may learn something by pretending that the represented
  events really happened.

 Classical Greece as Propaganda about Democracy

  I want to turn to two examples of how Ancient Greek history can be - and has been - used more literally as
  propaganda in the contemporary sense. A first example is classical iconography and architecture supporting a
  white telling of history and racist institutions. As Carl J. Richard explains:

        "when the history and imagery of ancient Athens finally achieved popularity in the United States, that
        popularity, at least in the South, was based partly on its social inequalities."2

  In other words, in the United States, classical Greece has offered a popular myth that supported American
  racism. Comparing the United States to ancient Greece showed how deep social inequalities had always
  coexisted with democracy; not because the Greeks had finally overcome these problems. Affluent white
  Americans, seeking to emulate the Greeks, identified fully with this vision of the past and present.

     For example, when Greek history, culture, and architecture became a mainstay in the pre-Reconstruction
  American South, "most abolitionists responded by arguing that slavery had been the greatest flaw of Athens
  and the other classical republics." There is, in fact, a direct connection between how "the advocates of slavery
  viewed Athens as an ideal society" and the present-day glorification of warlike Greek city-states like Sparta.
  Sarah E. Bond writes that ancient Greek culture has, even in recent years, been a source of deeply coded and
  racist beliefs about, for instance, eugenics and immigration policy:

        Not all modern depictions are accurate illustrations of Sparta, however. While the movie 300 focuses on the
        fight for Greek liberty in the conflict with Persia in the early 5th century BCE, it also neglects to tell the audience
        that Sparta also took liberty from others. Sparta was a slave society dependent on unfree workers, called helots,
        who were tied to the land to work the fields. They were not chattel slaves (i.e. they were not the property of the
        Spartans), but were still unable to leave or to participate as citizens. The use and abuse of helots is what allowed

44 | CHAPTER 3: PROPAGANDA AND THE COMMON GOOD

   Bond highlights the film 300 as an especially problematic source of beliefs regarding the glorification of
Greeks' warlike culture. Like the adoption of Greek iconography in the pre-Reconstruction American South,
the infatuation with Sparta may transmit a desire for violence. As Bond argues, adopting an image of oneself
or the nation as the defensive and warlike "Spartan" may reflect a greater national obsession with racist or
xenophobic violence.

Platonic Propaganda: The Allegory of the Cave

A final way that Ancient Greece intersects with familiar ideas related to "propaganda" is Plato's famous
"Allegory of the Cave," presented in Book VII of the Republic. Although he does not speak explicitly
about rhetoric or the sophists in this passage, he does say that the people trapped in the cave are "no different
from us." Although "us" is addressed to himself and his companion, Glaucon, it is reason enough to reflect on
how or whether the Allegory remains a relevant story today.

      Imagine people living in a cavernous cell down under the ground; at the far end of the cave, a long way of, there's
      an entrance open to the outside world. They've been there since childhood, with their legs and necks tied up in a
      way which keeps them in one place and allows them to look only straight ahead, but not to turn their heads. There's
      firelight burning a long way further up the cave behind them, and up the slope between the fire and the prisoners
      there's a road, beside which you should imagine a low wall has been built - like the partition conjurors place between
      themselves and their audience and above which they show their tricks.

      Imagine also that there are people on the other side of this wall who are carrying all sorts of artefacts. These artefacts,
      human statuettes, and animal models carved in stone and wood and all kinds of materials stick out over the wall;
      and as you'd expect, some of the people talk as they carry these objects along, while others are silent.

Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" explores the nature of knowledge and its proper objects. The world we perceive
through the senses, Socrates argues, is illusory and deceptive because it depends on a realm of separately
existing Forms organized beneath the Form of Good. Forms are the ideal or highest possible organization of
an object. They are not accessible through the senses but only through rigorous philosophical discussion and
mathematical reasoning. Measuring, counting, and weighing all bring us closer to the realm of Forms than
poetry. All art can only mimic or create inferior representations of the true Forms. Rhetoric especially can
only lead further away from the truth into a world of illusion and deception. As a general explanation for how
                                                                                   CHAPTER 3: PROPAGANDA AND THE COMMON GOOD | 45

"deception" and "illusion" are still basic functions of rhetoric, how else might we update the allegory of the
cave for our present moment?

Part 2: The Common and the Good

If there are valuable ideas drawn from Ancient Greek thinking about rhetoric, one place to look would
be the terms "common" and "good." Although we would be hard-pressed to translate the terms topos, or
`commonplace,' and eudaimonia, or `flourishing' as "common good," each of these roots teaches us something
about the art of speaking well and the kinds of goals that this art may have.

   Topos refers to a "commonplace," a site or location, most often invoked in speech, that is cited to be
recognizable to a large audience. "Helen of Troy" would have been commonplace in ancient Athens because
audiences would have known who this person was when a speaker would bring them up. Topoi are essential to
rhetoric. Without some shared sense of what the speaker and audience are discussing, communication cannot
happen. Communication between a speaker and an audience relies on translating experience. The speaker has
to tell the audience that they know and understand their experience to be credible or worthy of attention. The
audience has to recognize some aspect of their own experience in what the speaker is saying. That site of mutual
recognition, the place of commonality, is a topos. The plural of topos is topoi. Topoi allow us to compose writing
and imagine speeches because they put us in the frame of mind where we have to consider what is similar
between us and our imagined audience.

           A five minute description of eudaimonia and ancient Greek philosophical debates over it.
   Eudaimonia refers to "flourishing" and is sometimes translated as "the good life" or "happiness" as a
principle of morality. The Greek term "eudaimon" is composed of two parts: "eu" means "well," and "daimon"
means "divinity" or "spirit." Therefore, to be eudaimon is to live in a way that is well-favored by a god. But
Aristotle never calls attention to this etymology in his ethical writings, and it seems to have little influence on
his thinking. It means the attainment of one's highest self and an orientation toward the preservation of life.
For Aristotle, Eudaimonia is the greatest end for man collectively and individually.
   One task of this class is how to construct, create, and imagine better pro-social rhetorics or better practices
of communication that could stand in place of those we are trying to criticize or place in context. That is the
function and purpose of drawing attention to the words topos and eudaimonia, which allow us to think about
46 | CHAPTER 3: PROPAGANDA AND THE COMMON GOOD

what kinds of commonplaces we must draw upon in our political rhetoric today; and how that rhetoric must
be oriented toward human flourishing, in the sense of confronting social problems and charting a better way.

Why was Isocrates "Against the Sophists"?

Let's turn now to Athenian philosopher Isocrates. A first and frequent question is whether Isocrates is the same
person as Socrates. The answer is no. Socrates was Plato's teacher and is featured as the main character in Plato's
dialogues. Isocrates was a teacher of rhetoric at about the same time that Aristotle was a figure in Athenian life.
Isocrates taught speech but did so in a way that he designed to support the Athenian city-state. He is significant
because his idea of "the common good" was service to the state and its institutions.

Classical Rhetoric Timeline by Bridie McGreavy

Isocrates was born in Athens in 436 and remained there until his death at the age of 97. His career spans
Plato's lifetime, the great Athenian orators of the late fifth century, and most of the fourth century. When
Aristotle opened his school at the Lyceum, he found himself in competition with Isocrates for the best minds
of the Athenian youth, and there is evidence that he was acutely aware of that fact. Isocrates' works "were
clearly intended to provide a model of eloquence he held to be so crucial in the conduct of public affairs.
More than that, they were the vehicles for his notion of the true "philosophy," in which wisdom in civic affairs
emphasizing moral responsibility and equated with mastery of rhetorical technique.

   Like Protagoras and Gorgias, Isocrates believed that human knowledge is limited. In every case, knowing
                                                                                   CHAPTER 3: PROPAGANDA AND THE COMMON GOOD | 47

the right course of action is "one of the impossibilities of life" (Against the Sophists 2). He also says, "it is not
in the nature of man to attain exact knowledge (episteme) by which, having it, we can discern clearly what we
should do or say. ... [instead], those who are wise are those who are able by [changing public] opinion (doxa)
to hit upon what is, for the most part, the best course of action." For Isocrates, rhetoric is a means to heal and
nourish the collective. Sophistic rhetoric promised social mobility in the polis because it gave individuals the
ability to `make it' by speaking well in public.

   Isocrates was very familiar with this. Maybe his most famous writing is the Antidosis, a word for a legal
procedure that results in an exchange of property. If a citizen accepted the legal challenge of antidosis, the
wealth of the loser would be transferred to the winner. Another Athenian, Megacleides, attacked Isocrates's
character by raising some doubt about his teaching. Isocrates then wrote the Antidosis in response. It was his
way of saying, "try and see what happens."

Isocrates also believed that the art of oratory was a finished project -- because the sophists had figured that
much out. Isocrates's school had a term of study lasting three to four years. According to Isocrates, technical
instruction should be supplemented by the speaker's own good moral character and involvement in public
affairs, as would be fitting for the good citizen who possesses civic virtue (arete). This was a key charge against
the sophists: they are irresponsible and bad teachers who swindle their students into knowing a handful of
tricks. The sophist, by his account, teaches rhetoric "as simply as they would teach the letters of the alphabet,
not having taken the trouble to examine the nature of each kind of knowledge." In Isocrates's words: "To
obtain a knowledge of the elements out of which we make and compose all discourses is not so very difficult
if anyone entrusts himself, not to those who make rash promises, but to those who have some knowledge of
these things. But to choose from these elements those which should be employed for each subject, to join
them together, to arrange them properly, and also, not to miss what the occasion demands but appropriately
to adorn the whole speech with striking thoughts and melodious phrase -- these things require much study
and are the task of a vigorous and imaginative mind."

   But little by little, as the Athenian empire began to crumble, Athens and its rhetoric were turning toward
tyranny. When we get to Isocrates's historical moment, we should imagine an Athens yearning for days past. It
is where education is born and is immediately merged with the interests of the city-state. Isocrates has a kind of
politics that wants to push the state back on track and educates the people who will allow that kind of policy
to come to life. On the other hand, Plato believes that it will take more than the most influential members of
the polis to change the city-state's government. Until many people see the same sort of Truth, there can be no
48 | CHAPTER 3: PROPAGANDA AND THE COMMON GOOD

state. The plans that Plato and Isocrates bring were, therefore, responses to the gloomy circumstances facing
Athens. There is some dialogue between the two, but they are both after the same thing: drastic reform.

Aristotle, Pathos, and the Golden Mean

The last thing I want to talk about in this recording is the concept of pathos in Aristotle's Rhetoric. Aristotle's
concepts of "the good" and "flourishing" usually depend upon striking a balance or harmony between
extremes. This is the basis both for Aristotle's system of virtue ethics and his rhetorical theory of pathos, which
appears in his book, the Rhetoric.

   Aristotle's Rhetoric is an important source for many definitions of rhetoric that are still in use today. He
defines rhetoric as "the counterpart of dialectic," or an art that supports the philosophical testing and creation
of true knowledge. By his account, rhetoric is both an art of persuasion and a mode of observation. By
defining rhetoric as "the faculty of observing/the available means of persuasion/in any given situation,"
Aristotle explains that rhetoric deals with changing conditions of public influence and that it deals
with common knowledge, with the way a speaker draws upon topoi or commonplaces, to both observe and
create compelling speech.

   The Rhetoric offers a systematic explanation of what rhetoric is and how a rhetor may use it. For that reason,
it reads a bit like a VCR manual, a set of instructions for an ancient machine. In Rhetoric, we encounter
the terms logos, pathos, and ethos - in that order. Logos, which describes the speaker's choice of "words," their
reasoning, argument, and arrangement, is by far the most privileged term in Aristotle's work. Historically, it
has received the greatest share of attention. In this section, Aristotle declares that logical forms of argument,
including the syllogism and the enthymeme, have not been nearly considered enough. These "forms" have been
important for the study of, for instance, mathematical and symbolic logic, as well as modern forms of debate
and argumentation.

   The topic of pathos is a bit different. This "chapter" of the rhetoric has separate sections for distinct
emotional pairings like anger and mildness. Pathos is usually understood as the "appeal to emotion," which
creates the impression that a speaker is trying to generate a specific feeling in an audience, for instance, to make
them sad or make them laugh. But that is not the same thing as pathos. The object of rhetoric is to produce
judgment in the hearers. For that purpose, the `demonstration' of logos, or reason, alone is insufficient to
produce conviction. The speaker must produce within the judge a particular frame of mind receptive to the
judgment. Pathos, therefore, refers to the disposition of hearers concerning judgments that cause them pleasure
or pain. "For Aristotle, the principles that govern emotional excitation can be examined completely apart from
the contexts in which real orators had produced specific passions."

   Pathos gives the speaker the job of knowing the extremes of their audience's emotions. Knowing where
their audience already is, pathos is the waxing and waning of these emotions, with well-known extremes. For
instance, anger and mildness mean that the speaker's ability to observe may allow them to make an angry
audience get angrier. Alternatively, the speaker may seek to cool their hot tempers. Mildness is "the quieting
                                                                                   CHAPTER 3: PROPAGANDA AND THE COMMON GOOD | 49

and appeasing of anger." The admission that one is worthy of punishment tends to defuse anger, since "we
punish more severely those who contradict us and deny their offense, but cease to be angry with those who
admit that they are justly punished. Aristotle writes, "to deny what is evident is disrespect, and disrespect is
slight and contempt."

   This movement between the `extremes' makes pathos resemble Aristotle's notion of virtue ethics. This
concept, sometimes also casually referred to as "the golden mean," similarly seeks a point of balance between
two "extremes" of behavior as the correct or most virtuous course of action.

Ultimately, Aristotle helps us understand steering the emotions requires a unique skill set because speech
allows the speaker to move collective emotions. Speeches do not just affect us individually; they can urge a
group of people to action. When contemporary scholars of rhetoric Robert Hariman and John Louis Lucaites
theorize public emotion, they make similar assumptions. A public, like a person, can experience emotions, but
these emotions support that group or collective in ways that are different from individual wellbeing. For the
public, emotions may foster participation, identification with leaders or the nation and calls for more-or-less
inclusive norms of citizenship. Like Aristotle, however, they set public emotion apart from rationalization,
maintaining the traditional separation of logos and pathos.

Introducing Rhetoric in the 20th Century

Between 1914 and 1917, Rhetoric departments were new in the United States. These departments were unique
from other disciplines because they studied speech instead of a literary canon, and sought to define themselves
apart from English departments. The argument that the early students of rhetoric made in the United States
was that the study of speeches deserved to be considered apart from the study of literature. Literature might
impart social values, but speeches were a reflection of the values of the speaker. At the very least, speech
constituted a very specific kind of literature that required its own independent consideration. Members of the
early "Cornell School" of rhetoric included James Wichelns, Alexander Drummond, Harry Kaplan, Evertt Lee
Hunt, to name just a few.

   Over time, Rhetoric and Speech Communication departments spread across the United States, primarily
housed in major public universities. These departments were among the first to study rhetoric as
communication. Even today public speaking courses are predominantly housed within Communication
50 | CHAPTER 3: PROPAGANDA AND THE COMMON GOOD

Studies departments in public universities around the country. Graduates of the Cornell department carried
speech communication to doctoral institutions and small colleges across the country.

   One prominent example of the kind of criticism that these early departments performed is Herbert
Wichelns' "The Literary Criticism of Oratory," an essay that has been widely reprinted and is clearly one of the
starting points for the 20th-century rhetorical criticism. This essay argued that classifying oratory and other
modes of public persuasive discourse as literature was to completely miss the point. Instead, these speeches
reflected the political priorities of the time and reflected a unique kind of invention on the part of the speaker.
To analyze these speeches, many early speech communication professors drew upon Aristotle's Rhetoric, which
they argued contained a set of principles by which effective and persuasive speech could take place. Speeches
either did or did not conform to Aristotelian principles, and rhetorical criticism consisted in explaining
how these persuasive concepts were brought to life by a speaker. This framework of analysis was called neo-
Aristotelianism

   Scholars like Wichelns also argued that speech and oratory deserved consideration as a unique subject of
study. According to Wichelns, oratory was also concerned which own says with permanent values and ideas
that endure beyond the historical moment. Even in the present, the endurance of these values is evident
because speeches are still intelligible to present-day audiences.

   Writing some time after Wichelns was Ernest Wrage. His focus was significantly more on the history of
speeches and telling a history of ideas using speech as the primary evidence. According to Wrage, the study
of speeches should not be focused on just the techniques of persuasion or dissecting a speech for its basic
Aristotelian elements, but telling history with a rhetorical sensibility, drawing upon individual speeches in
chronological sequence. Rhetorical criticism is specifically the investigation that uncovers a common public
attitude. Wrage is one of the first who organizes American political speeches according to genre, theme, and

52 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

and connection to the rhetorical tradition. It will explore these ideas through their theoretical foundations,
historical development, and the ongoing struggle to ensure their equitable application.

  · Part 1 explores the rhetorical and historical justifications for protecting the freedom of speech, which
      includes considering the importance of open discourse as a cornerstone of democratic societies for
      critical thinking and the pursuit of truth. It introduces two ancient greek notions of "freedom of
      speech," parrhesia and isegoria, connecting the need for free discourse to the rhetorical concepts of
      dialectic and doxa.

  · Part 2 examines the five freedoms protected in the First Amendment and how the law distinguishes
      between different types of expression through something called the "Two-Tiered Theory of Speech,"
      such as political speech and symbolic speech. This section also considers the role and limitations of a free
      press plays in the circulation of discourse.

  · Part 3 chronicles the exclusion of marginalized communities from the full exercise of their freedom of
      speech, including ways they have actively resisted censorship and made their voices heard.

By examining these diverse facets of freedom of speech, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive
understanding of both the promises and the challenges of this fundamental right.

Part 1: Why Do We Value Free Discourse?

The value of public discourse and the free exchange of ideas is something that has been part of philosophical
debate for thousands of years. This first section will explore why the right to free expression is important from
a rhetorical and philosophical perspective.

Rhetorical Reasons

The rhetorical tradition emphasizes people's ability to make good judgments about uncertain problems based
on the best possible argument. Of course, this requires healthy argument practices and assumes that those in
a position to make decisions will act in good faith. As discussed in Chapter 2, the early rhetorical theorists,
known as Sophists, were not only famously criticized by Plato, but they also had a unique worldview that
was rooted in argumentation. According to the Sophists, myth, religion, and family were unreliable ways of
solving social, scientific, and political problems. Instead, argument, debate, and discussion were crucial tools.
Through logos (which means both `reason' and `the word') they believed that individuals could change the
world through thought, discourse, and action. Hence, the Sophists sought to instruct individuals in spoken
arts that would enable them to secure the agreement of their audiences, navigate uncertain situations, and
guide them in forming judgments.

Dialectic and Doxa

There is power here, for if humans learn to use argument to influence the decisions of others, there is great
potential for unethical and deceptive speech. This early ethical debate led Plato to raise a crucial question in
the rhetorical tradition: Does teaching persuasion equate to promoting deception, resembling mere sophistry?
Plato addressed this by distinguishing between rhetoric, which he considered to be concerned with only the
appearance of truth, and dialectic, a higher form of discourse where knowledge is acquired, opinions refined,
and truth discovered (Jasinski 164-165). Aristotle, too, distinguished between rhetoric and dialectic, albeit
with a slightly more positive spin. In the Rhetoric, he noted that although both concern persuasion, rhetoric
primarily focuses on adapting to the audience, while dialectic centers on universal truths pursued through
logical argumentation (1.1).

   The importance of safeguarding freedom of expression is also rooted in the Platonic concept of doxa and
dialectic. For Plato, these concepts represent two ways of engaging with knowledge (or episteme). Dialectic
is the method Plato advocates for ascending to the intelligible realm of true knowledge (episteme), a process
of using reasoning, dialogue, and discourse, whereas doxa refers to beliefs based on people's worldviews,
which can change as times, contexts, and societies change. That is because worldviews are fluid, unstable,
and susceptible to persuasion. In The Gorgias, Plato portrays the Sophists as manipulators of doxa, who
would use their skills to sway public opinion without regard for truth or justice; who would persuade people
toward "belief without knowledge." Rhetorical theorist Lloyd Bitzer's writings highlight the lasting resonance
of Plato's concepts over 2,000 years later when he defines rhetoric as "a mode of altering reality, not by the
direct application of energy to objects, but by the creation of discourse which changes reality through the
mediation of thought and action (4)." Whereas rhetoric and persuasion can influence doxa, dialectical inquiry
is meant to create social change through ethical debate. Protecting the freedom of speech opens this space for
self-expression, self-fulfillment, growth, and change.

Parrhesia and Isegoria

Just as ancient Athens was the birthplace of rhetorical theory, so too was it the birthplace of "democracy" - a
space in which ordinary people could gather and exchange ideas. As introduced in Chapter 1, ancient Athens
resembled the early United States because both similarly conferred rights only to wealthy and propertied male
citizens. Ancient Athens also provides us with an early model of `free speech,' which it captured in two distinct
54 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

concepts. The first is parrhesia, or "the license to say what one pleased, how and when one pleased, and to

whom." The second is Isegoria, or "the equal right of citizens to participate in public debate in the democratic

assembly" (Bejan 97). Whereas parrhesia accounts for `fearless' speech that puts power dynamics and the law's

use of force on display, isegoria accounts for speech that is free as defined from within the bounds of the law.

In ancient Greece, parrhesia, which is often translated as "freedom of speech," really meant "frank" or

"fearless" speech. Parrhesia bade people not only to share their opinions or beliefs, but also to challenge

the doxa, question those in power, and push the boundaries of knowledge, even if it meant doing so at

great personal risk. In fact, parrhesia was seen as an essential character attribute in the pursuit of truth and

development of knowledge, reinforcing the importance of an environment that protected free discourse. In the

Apology, for example, Socrates exemplifies parrhesia by speaking truthfully to the Athenian court, even at the

cost of his life. In the Gorgias, rhetoric is portrayed as speech that can manipulate and praises Callicles of his

honesty and frankness (487a-e; Walzer 8).

Central to the Athenian idea of parrhesia was that it "allowed the citizens to be bold and honest in expressing

their opinions even when outside the assembly and extended to many spheres of Athenian life including

philosophy and theatre" (Mchangama 13). For ancient Greek orator Demosthenes, "freedom of speech" was

integral to Athenian democracy because of how it and "political debate" could lead to truth (Mchangama 14).

"Parrhesia," according to Jacob Mchangama, "also allowed for a rich intellectual life in Athens and provided

both positive and negative confirmation of Demosthenes's later point about the virtue of permitting dissent

against the very democratic order" (15).

                                           Further, the ancient Greeks believed that people had an

                                           ethical duty to act with parrhesia. Isocrates redefined

Listen to this Next                        parrhesia as a civic responsibility in his work. In 374 B.C.E.,

                                           Isocrates offers "frank advice" (Walzer 11) in his "Letter to

                                           Nicocles" as his "gift to the prince" (Walzer 11). He encourages

speak? Free Speech in                      extended this idea to personal relationships when in his essay

Ancient Athens, October 25,                "How to Tell a Flatterer from a Friend," he referred to

2017                                       parrhesia as "the language of friendship" (Walzer 17). He

                                           argued that friends have a duty to speak truthfully to each

                                           other as a way to cultivate moral character, even if it means

                                           offering unflattering advice.

Of course, it is important to remember that only a select group of voices could enact this virtue. Another

commonly translated Greek word for freedom of speech is isegoria, which translates to "equal speaking in

the assembly," --a privilege granted to all male citizens of Athens during the democracy in the 5th and 4th
                                                                          CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 55

centuries B.C.E. Citizens would gather in the Ekklesia, a space in which they would try to persuade each
other of political policies. As Lu writes, "Isegoria was a crucial conceptual element of Athenian democracy;
voting was its conceptual partner. The two concepts formed an integrated unit whereby, under ideal conditions
if not necessarily in reality, citizens engaged each other in deliberation in order to come to decisions which
represented both what the citizens wanted done, and what best served the community" (28). In addition,
while isegoria is often understood to mean "equal right to speech," there was no such codified right in ancient
Athens. Greek society operated a space of privilege that excluded women, slaves, and non-citizens. In this way,
isegoria can actually be understood as a "socially constructed power, not a natural power" (Lu 29).

   This socially constructed nature of isegoria highlights its role not just in granting some individuals access
to spaces of discourse and excluding others, but also in fostering a culture of open dialogue in a community -
one in which each individual feels entitled to speak, even if they don't exercise that right. As Lindsay Rathnam
writes, "Equal right of say guarantees the person space in the public realm; it doesn't matter how valuable or
moral or wise their contribution is but rather that they are entitled to be there, to exist, to develop their own
selves through their pursuit of their own good" (Rathnam 145). In contrast, parrhesia moves beyond oneself
to emphasize the moral duty of truth-telling for the common good. Together, isegoria and parrhesia reflect
different dimensions of discourse: one fostering an environment for equal opportunity for speech (in theory),
the other (together with dialectic) demanding the courage to confront truths for the sake of the development
of knowledge that is foundational to the growth of society.

   Both concepts are foundational to understanding how free speech, the pursuit of truth, and rhetoric work
together. Michel Foucault's work on parrhesia emphasizes that while speaking truth to power (or speaking
with frankness to a friend), is inherently risky, it is precisely this risk that lends it moral weight and importance .
Foucault stressed that parrhesia "comes from `below,' as it were, and is directed towards `above'" (Franks 114).
Quoting Foucault, Mary Anne Franks points to the idea that the "parrhesiastes is always less powerful than
the one with whom he or she speaks...this is why an ancient Greek would not say that a teacher or father who
criticizes a child uses parrhesia." She continues, "but when a philosopher criticizes a tyrant, when a citizen
criticizes the majority, when a pupil criticizes his or her teacher, then such speakers may be using parrhesia"
(115).

   In addition, while Foucault argues in "Discourse and Truth" that parrhesia and rhetoric "stand in strong
opposition" because parrhesia is the "zero degree of those rhetorical figures which intensify the emotions
of the audience" (7), other scholars disagree. Walzer argues that "It would not...be inaccurate to describe
rhetoric...as the `technical partner' of parrhesia in the context of the philosophical schools" (Walzer 16). This
is because offering "frank criticism" requires considering timing, audience, and circumstances. He quotes
Plutarch in saying, "frank criticism is `an art,' a medicine for the soul" (Walzer 17).

   Thomas Goodnight further argues that parrhesia "emerges from a communication predicament where, at
one and the same time, an arguer is obligated to raise unwelcome claims while preserving a communication
space that gives the interlocutor reasons to listen, rather than an excuse to react" (1). Building on Goodnight's
view of parrhesia as the balance between raising difficult truths and preserving open dialogue, Jessica
56 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

Townsend further characterizes rhetoricians as "political parrhesiastes" who adapt truth-telling to the
political and situational nuances of their time (39). She explains: "whereas ethical parrhesia is the frank truth
telling of present circumstances to a ruler, rhetoric is that parrhesia which requires a gentler nudge in the
direction of truth according to the constraints of the situation at that time" (39). Or, Townsend describes this
another way when discussing Plato's dialogues as an example:

If Socrates at this time had simply told his arguers what was wrong with their reasoning, they would not
have been convinced of these truths; they would have called him mad, ignored him altogether, or simply had
him indicted of corruption much earlier in life because of such controversial beliefs. Instead, Socrates used a
rhetorical line of questioning to gently lead his arguers into their own conclusions so that they applied their own
reasoning to discern the truth (39).

This ancient commitment to parrhesia--the courage to speak truth openly for the sake of ethical and

intellectual growth toward the common good --echoes through later arguments for freedom of speech several

centuries later. In an historically significant speech to the British Parliament called Areopagitica in 1644, John

Milton defended the freedom of speech and the press against pre-publication censorship (something we will

call "prior restraint" later ), arguing that truth thrives in an environment where ideas can be freely debated and

confronted and warning against the dangers of censorship. He said, "the ingenuity of Truth, who when she

gets a free and willing hand, opens herself faster than the pace of method and discours[e] can overtake her."

Like the Greeks, Milton sees free speech as a path to wisdom and societal improvement, advocating for an open

marketplace of ideas where truth can emerge from the clash of opposing views.

                                  200 years later in 1859, English philosopher John Stuart Mill

                                  continued this through-line of argument in Chapter 2 of his

Listen to this Next               treatise On Liberty, in which he wrote about the need for free

                                  discourse in the pursuit of truth. Just like Plato's Socrates

                                  professes public discourse should do in Gorgias, Mill writes

So to Speak: The Free Speech      that "If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only
Podcast from The Foundation for   one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be

(FIRE)                            had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind" (30).
                                  Mill offers several reasons for this assertion. For instance, the

· Episode 222: John Stuart        censored opinion might be true and the accepted opinion

Mill's Lasting Impact on the      erroneous. By censoring speech, society would deprive itself of

Supreme Court, August 15,         "exchanging error for truth" and deny itself of "the clearer

2024                              perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its

                                  collision with error" (31). Legal scholar Robert Post argues that

                                  the understanding of public discourse enshrined in the U.S.

                                  Constitution has a similar function as Mill's maxim because it

forbids the state from imposing rules on discourse communities: "to do so would privilege a specific
CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 57

community and prejudice the ability of individuals to persuade other of the need to change it" (632). This is

speaking with parrhesia in a modern sense, preventing the government from retaliating against frank speech

that might change the doxa. Freedom of thought was for Mill was what dialectic was for Plato - integral for

seeking truth and a fundamental to the human condition.

                                                         Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes,

                                                       Jr. used a different metaphor for this philosophy in

                                                       his dissent in one of the first free speech cases to

                                                       reach the Court in 1919, Abrams v. United States.

                                                       Holmes, with Justice Brandeis concurring, wrote,

                                                       "But when men have realized that time has upset

                                                       truth is the power of the thought to get itself

Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. sits  accepted in the competition of the market" (Abrams
at a desk, circa 1924.                                 v. United States 630). Holmes roots his concept of

                                                       freedom in a specific tradition of economics that

viewed competition as a driving force that encourages participants to prioritize goods (or ideas) based on their

perceived value. In his view, such competition would naturally lead to informed choices. Holmes' metaphor of

the "marketplace of ideas" is the most widely cited metaphors First Amendment theory and remains a potent

argument for advocating for open discourse well into the 21st century.

Historical Reasons

"Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and
burnt women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears," wrote Justice
Louis Brandeis in a concurrence in the case Whitney v. California. He went on, "If there be time to expose
through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy
to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence" (376). When Justice Brandeis wrote these words, it was
1927, and the Supreme Court was still leaning more toward censorship of political speech than away from
it. Brandeis' words, however, would foreshadow what would eventually become the guiding principles of our
First Amendment philosophy today. By making ideas and knowledge accessible to anyone and everyone,
people may feel empowered to engage in discourse and, in theory, use reason and sound judgment to improve
society.

   While a free exchange of discourse may allow a person or public to develop epistemological understanding
- or to know how they know what they know - protections upon freedom of expression preserve the ability
58 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

to continuously achieve such understandings. Even this, however, cannot happen without a space for free
discourse. As Cicero insinuated in Rhetorica ad Herennium, speakers should seek to move their hearers.
However, audiences cannot be moved unless they have the freedom of thought to consider the message, which
is only possible if the speaker has isegoria (and specifically the legal protection against government retaliation
for speech) and/or embodied ability to speak their mind; to speak with parrhesia. The sentencing of Galileo
Galilei is a well-known example of what happens when such rights are not protected. Charged with heresy
during the Spanish Inquisition, Galileo was found guilty of teaching and defending the Copernican doctrine
of a heliocentric universe, in which the earth moves around the sun, presumed to exist at the universe's center.
In what was in actuality a trial of truth v. power, Galileo was subsequently forced to live the rest of his life
on house arrest (Galileo Galilei). To ensure that speech is free, people must be guaranteed the ability to seek
knowledge without fear of retribution, to have opinions without fear of persecution, and to engage in public
discourse without fear of those in power.

   Thinkers from Plato to Justice Holmes privileged the notion that the freedom to exchange ideas is necessary
for knowledge to develop, communities to be just, and people to grow. Authoritarian leaders, however, fear
that an educated populace might question decision-making, criticize actions, and discover corruption. There
is a risk that an educated citizenry, especially one provided with information via a free press, might decide
through public discourse that it wants a change in leadership. Providing the protections of freedom of speech,
assembly, and the press that provide for parrhesia and isegoria empowers the people, a prospect that may be
formidable and less than ideal for those with authoritarian tendencies. This is indeed why when authoritarian
regimes rise to power, institutions like universities and the press are often the first to be shuttered. The New
York Times Editorial Board wrote about this in March, 2025:

      "When a political leader wants to move a democracy toward a more authoritarian form of government, he often
      sets out to undermine independent sources of information and accountability. The leader tries to delegitimize
      judges, sideline autonomous government agencies and muzzle the media...The weakening of higher education
      tends to be an important part of this strategy. Academic researchers are supposed to pursue the truth, and
      budding autocrats recognize that empirical truth can present a threat to their authority."

This troubling global trend is reflected in the actions of leaders like Turkey's President Tayyip Erdoan, who
has jailed university professors and political rivals, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who has exiled
journalists and imprisoned his most prominent political critic, Alexei Navalny--who recently died in prison.
                                                                          CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 59

   As Mchangama points out, "the ability to criticize freely one's own political system is still a litmus test
of democracies, both past and present" (14). In fact, The United States was on its democratic journey for
less than a decade before its government restricted the ability of its citizens to fearlessly criticize government
leaders, despite explicit protections for speech in its constitution. President John Adams passed the (1798)
Alien and Sedition Acts, one of which made it illegal to "write, print, utter or publish...any false, scandalous
and malicious writing...against the government of the United States" ("Alien and Sedition Acts"). Fortunately
for him and the nation's future, President Adams had the foresight to write a sunset clause into The Sedition
Act so that it would expire upon his exit from office, lest it be used against him by his political enemies.
When he took office on that day, March 4, 1801, the new President, Thomas Jefferson, made reference to the
importance of these freedoms in his "First Inaugural Address" when he laid out what he deemed "the essential
principles of our Government":

      "Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political; peace, commerce, and
      honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none...the preservation of the General Government
      in its whole constitutional vigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad...absolute
      acquiescence in the decisions of the majority, the vital principle of republics...the diffusion of information and
      arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public reason...These principles form the bright constellation which
      has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation. The wisdom of our sages
      and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment. They should be the creed of our political faith,
      the text of civic instruction, the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust; and should we wander
      from them in moments of error or of alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone
      leads to peace, liberty, and safety."

Only one of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 remained law -- The Alien Enemies Act. This act gives the
President wartime power to "apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove," any all natives, citizens, denizens, or
subjects of the hostile nation or government," 14 years of age and older. The act was used during the War of
1812, World Wars I and II, and most recently by President Donald Trump, although because the act can only
be used once Congress has officially declared war, Trump's use of the law is constitutionally questionable and
is facing court challenges (Treisman).

   When the framers of the U.S. Constitution codified a right to free expression into their new set of laws as the
first right protected in a list of civil rights guaranteed to citizens, it was a radical act. For more than a thousand
years, monarchial systems of government in the Western world had held sway, refusing to explicitly protect the
60 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

right of "common people" to openly discuss issues of public importance or be critical of their leaders. This did
not mean, though, that people did not want the right to do so.

   Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, known as "the people's attorney," Justice Brandeis wrote the
following in his concurring opinion in one of the initial landmark First Amendment decisions in the early
20th century:

      Those who won our independence...believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think
      are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly
      discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the
      dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion
      is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government ("About Our
      Namesake: Louis D. Brandeis").

   What is significant about Brandeis's statement is his
reminder that the United States was the first country to cement
free speech into its Constitution and its laws. While free speech
does not always lead to thoughtful, responsible discourse, it is
essential to democracy and a bulwark against tyranny. In the
late 18th-century American colonies, the conditions were right
for legal protections upon free speech to resurface, albeit in a
contradictory and violent manner. In fact, the first British
colonizers to arrive in America forcefully seized land from
Indigenous peoples with the explicit purpose of seeking
religious freedom. Although England guaranteed the
"freedom of speech and debate" in Parliament in the English
Bill of Rights, individual British citizens were not allowed to
criticize their leaders, as the government considered that
"seditious libel." Ironically, British colonists who sought
freedom of religion ultimately limited both religious freedom
and freedom of speech by establishing governments that

                                                                                   Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis

mimicked this top-down monarchial system. They made the
head of the church and the head of the town synonymous,
while also imposing their "Puritan" religious standards on the Indigenous people they colonized.

   The years preceding the American Revolution, however, emphasized the necessity of criticizing one's
government and having a say in its policies. Lacking representation in the British government, colonists were
subjected to a series of taxes that they opposed but had no standing to contest. Perhaps of most symbolic
significance for the freedom of expression, The Stamp Act of 1765 imposed a tax on printed materials,
including newspapers and documents. By requiring that any printed material appear on taxed, stamped paper,
the Act literally demanded that subjects of British law pay for their right to freely circulate information.
                                                                           CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 61

   Following boycotts and protests, the British colonial government passed a series of punitive measures
in 1774 called The Intolerable Acts, which closed Boston Harbor and altered the Massachusetts colonial
government. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson levied the criticism that the colonists
could not criticize their government. Neither able to protest or boycott without persecution, they could not
speak against government policy, had no access to political representation, and could not even communicate
without payment. It is clear, then, why the freedoms protected in the First Amendment appear first in the
top of the Bill of Rights.

Part 2: Freedom of Speech and the First
Amendment

The Five Freedoms in the First Amendment

     The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution reads:

     "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
     exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people
     peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

Religion

The first freedom is known as the "free exercise clause," and states that the government cannot establish a law
that dictates how Americans practice religion nor what religion they practice. Additionally, the government
cannot establish a "state" religion.

Speech

The speech protected means more than simply spoken or written speech. It has been extended to mean
"expression" in the broadest sense of the term. Symbolic action, art, nonverbal communication, creativity, film,
speech on the internet, music, inventions, and even pornography have all been types of "speech" added to the
62 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

protections of the First Amendment over the years. In fact, the crux of most First Amendment debates center
around this question: does the expression in question fall into the category of protected "speech"?

Petition

The right to petition for a redress of grievances was likely one of the highest on the minds of the Founders
because the Declaration of Independence is a petition at its core, yet is one of the least litigated of all of the
rights in the First Amendment. Petitioning is a way for the government to hear directly from the people.
Arguments can be clearly written out and support can be clearly indicated. Further, the right to petition has
been extended to include the right to sue the government to challenge pre existing laws. Petitioning is also a
way of participating in the public sphere for marginalized communities when hegemonic cultural dictates keep
them out of the public square in other ways. For example, anti-slavery petitions were one of the earliest ways
for women to assert their personhood (Zaeske).
                                                                          CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 63

"Congress shall make no law..."

Congress refers to the legislative branch of the federal government. Most state constitutions also have
protections for the rights outlined in the First Amendment, thus preventing their legislatures from abridging
these rights as well. Because the 14th Amendment declares that "All persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein
they reside," the First Amendment's protections extend to every citizen in the country. Further, the 14th
Amendment's "due process" clause - that "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law," means that states cannot restrict any rights guaranteed to citizens
in the Federal Constitution, including the rights enumerated in the First Amendment. However, even this
extension of rights implies that speech and expression by non-citizens remains less protectable by federal
law, that such rights may be suspended in times of war, and that private, non-governing entities such as
corporations remain able to abridge the rights in the First Amendment. Because the First Amendment
only stipulates that Congress shall make no law, and the Constitution only governs actions taken by the state,
private entities remain mostly able to act as they choose.

   This distinction is important. While U.S. citizens have a right to free expression, they do not necessarily
have a right to say what they want (to speak with parrhesia) without facing consequences from other entities
besides Congress. For example, an individual could attend a protest at their state capitol, and it would be
within their First Amendment right to do so. However, if their company found that in doing so it violated
their own policies, that company could be within its rights to fire the individual. The protection of the
First Amendment would protect the individual's right to attend the protest, but does not guarantee that
individual's position or job.

     Discussion: Colin Kaepernick Protests Racial Injustice

     When then San Francisco 49er's quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the national
64 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

     anthem to bring attention to police brutality and racial injustice, he ignited a national controversy
     over free speech, patriotism, and civility in public debate (Branch). At the time, President Barack
     Obama defended Kaepernick's "constitutional right," while presidential candidate Donald Trump
     suggested that, if a player couldn't stand for the national anthem, that "maybe you shouldn't be in
     the country" (Boren). Kaepernick faced major backlash for first sitting and then kneeling during the
     anthem in protest, facing ire from many around the country. In the clip above, ABC News covers
     Kaepernick's continued "protest against racial injustice" on September 13, 2016. Kaepernick kneeled
     during the national anthem on nationally televised Monday Night Football, along with his
     teammate, Eric Reid. His other teammate, Eli Harold, raised his fist in solidarity. Kaepernick
     continued to kneel during the anthem, ultimately inspiring other NFL players and athletes around
     the world to follow his example. He eventually lost his job and remains out of a job today.

     Discussion:

         1. The First Amendment protects against government censorship, but not necessarily
             consequences from private employers. Should private institutions like the NFL be expected
             to uphold similar standards of free expression for their employees? Why or why not?

         2. How do factors like race, public visibility, and institutional power affect who gets to speak
             freely without consequence? Would a white athlete have been treated the same way for a
             similar protest? How does Kaepernick's protest illustrate the concepts of isegoria and
             parrhesia?

         3. Some argue that Kaepernick was "canceled" for his protest. How do we differentiate
             between a violation of free speech and the social or professional consequences that come
             from using that speech?

         4. What lessons can college students and institutions learn from the Kaepernick case about the
             value and cost of protest? How should universities handle student or faculty protests that
             are unpopular or politically charged?

The rights of students at public and private schools offers another example. In general, the Supreme Court
found that "students and teachers don't shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate" (Tinker v.
Des Moines School District) in public schools because they are funded by and under the jurisdiction of the
government, thus falling under the auspices of the phrase "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom
of speech."

   However, students and teachers at private schools are on private property and receive funding from private
entities. Private organizations can enforce a greater set of restrictions upon allowable speech and protest,
even as they draw on the government resources such as the police to enforce these restrictions. This is why
                                                                          CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 65

private schools can enforce prayer in schools, require school uniforms, ban school plays, etc. while their public
counterparts, in theory, cannot.

   It has been determined, though, that owing to the State's interest in safeguarding minors and the belief that
school officials act in loco parentis ("in the place of a parent") while children are in school, a slightly greater
degree of censorship is sometimes permissible. Over the years, the Supreme Court has decided that public
schools can sometimes impose certain restrictions on speech. For instance, public schools can censor lewd
speech, the promotion of illegal drug use, and student newspapers (a decision that has also been extended to
school-sponsored college newspapers as well) (Bethel School District v. Fraser, Morse v. Frederick, Hazelwood
School District v. Kuhlmeier, Hosty v. Carter). Conversely, the Court has also found that students cannot be
compelled to say the Pledge of Allegiance in school (West Virginia v. Barnette).

     Example: Protests at Columbia University and other institutions in 2024

     Columbia University students representing the Palestinian and Jewish side speak about the campus
     protests on NBC News in April, 2024. The University had a tumultuous year when in April, pro-
     Palestinian student protestors set up an encampment on campus protesting the war in Gaza and
     demanding the University divest from "academic and economic stakes in Israel."
     On that same day, then Columbia University President Nemat Shafik gave a controversial testimony
     before Congress, prior to returning to campus and calling in law enforcement to arrest the student
     protestors. More than 100 students were arrested, the largest mass student arrest since protests
     during the 1960s. The encampment at Columbia inspired similar demonstrations at universities
                                                                          CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 67

     around the country. The tense protest eventually led to the resignation of Shafik and the
     cancellation of several commencement ceremonies around the country, including at Columbia.
     President Donald Trump has brought renewed attention to the demonstrations when ICE arrested
     Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian graduate student who played a leadership role in some of the
     protests. Khalil's wife is a U.S. citizen and he is a permanent U.S. resident with a green card, leading
     many to call the arrest an attack on his First Amendment rights. Since Khalil's apprehension, other
     international students have had their visas revoked or have been detained by ICE officials, some of
     them seemingly in connection to expression opinions about the Israel-Palestine conflict in
     newspaper editorials or in protests.

"...abridging the Freedom of Speech..."

The Supreme Court gets to decide what the language in the First Amendment means, including what it
means to abridge the right to free speech. According to most legal dictionaries, to abridge means to "diminish"
or "reduce in scope." This is commonly understood to mean that Congress cannot take away a person's right to
free speech, privileging it as a cultural and political value. That is, people should be able to speak freely without
fear of government censorship or retaliation - to speak with parrhesia. While many commonly translate
parrhesia as "freedom of speech," Chin-Yu Ginny Lu problematizes that when she writes, "Parrhesia, then,
is a quality which a particular act of speech has or lacks. Freedom of speech, on the other hand, is not
tied to particular acts of speech, but is rather the possibility of saying whatever you like without government
interference or retaliation" (Lu 57).

   In the United States, one can challenge a speech restriction by appealing it to the Supreme Court (the
judicial branch interprets whether or not a law or conviction violates the clauses in the First Amendment).
Cases reach the Supreme Court in a few different ways. One way is if a dispute over a state law reaches a State
Supreme Court and is then appealed to the Federal Supreme Court - these cases will have a state as one of
the named parties. The Court will hear state issues if they are an issue of national interest or if there are two
state laws in conflict with one another. Another way is if a federal law is challenged or violated, and it climbs
68 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

through the federal court system - these cases will have the "United States" as one of the named parties in the
lawsuit. Finally, cases make their way to the Supreme Court via special courts - like when a policy created by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is challenged. Cases usually take a few years to reach the
Supreme Court. One of the fastest cases in history from start to finish was a landmark First Amendment
decision famously called the "Pentagon Papers" case, which only took 17 days from the first injunction to the
Supreme Court decision (New York Times Co. v. United States).

The Two-Tiered Theory of Speech

"The idea of free speech is an eternally radical and counterintuitive one that requires constant education

about its principles" (Lukianoff and Perrino). While the idea of protecting the right to "free speech" might

seem simple, it is anything but. On one hand, this value supports speaking with parrhesia, which Thomas

Goodnight defines as "a figure of thought associated with speaking truth to power" (1). On the other hand,

such unrestricted, fearless, parrhesiastic speech can lead to a lack of a collective understanding of facts, values,

or knowledge. Foucault points out that this was a concern of Plato when he writes: "The primary danger of

liberty and free speech in a democracy is what results when everyone has his own manner of life, his own style

of life. For then there can be no common logos, no possible unity, for the city" ("Discourse and Truth," 32).

He also suggests that Plato considers parrhesia "not only as the freedom to say whatever one wishes, but as

linked with the freedom to do whatever one wants" (32). Perhaps even more directly, Foucault writes in Fearless

Speech, "the parrhesiastes uses the most direct words and forms of expression he can find," and avoids "any

kind of rhetorical form which would veil what he thinks" (12). In American culture and legal jurisprudence,

parrhesia as "speaking truth to power" has been a powerful tool for change. Because "speech" itself is hard to

define," though, a modern conception of speaking with parrhesia has allowed for some to interpret it as their

right to say what they please without consequence, even if it means spreading hate speech or causes harm.

                                     Typically, the Supreme Court classifies expression protected

                                     under the First Amendment into two categories. Justice

                                     that there are "certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes

following decades did in fact follow this prescription. For the

most part, political speech, symbolic speech, and speech on

public issues is protected, allowing for some regulation,

assuming it does not restrict viewpoint. Expression that can fit into one of the categories have historically been

limited.

Political Speech

"Political" speech is the typically most protected form of expression, but typically for those with socially
privileged identities. As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion in a 2011 case involving the
hate group the Westboro Baptist Church, "as a Nation we have chosen a different course--to protect even
hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate" (Snyder v. Phelps). Aside from the
Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the U.S. Supreme Court did not hear cases involving the First Amendment
until 1919. This was likely because cultural conditions made it so that the freedoms protected in the First
Amendment more readily applied to white men. As such, free speech controversies rarely got the attention
of the Court. However, at the turn of the 20th century, way of life shifted and those who those who were in
positions of privilege found themselves not to be the only voices having an influence in society. The Industrial
Revolution brought unprecedented urban growth - and subsequently increased poverty, spurred on by mass
immigration, primarily from Eastern Europe. This growth catalyzed new social movements as labor unions
formed, workers went on strike, and a new generation of educated women fought for the right to vote. Leaders
would literally stand on "soap boxes" to lead rallies.
70 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

A key context for the dramatic changes of the

early 20th century concerns significant political

unrest in Europe and Russia between 1914 and

1917. In 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his

wife were assassinated in Sarajevo, Bosnia-

Herzegovina in an event widely regarded as the

inaugurating event of World War I. In 1917, Tsar

Nicholas II and his family were deposed and

subsequently killed in a series of events broadly

labeled the Bolshevik Revolution. There was

political upheaval in the U.S., too, as third parties

like the Populists and the Socialists gained political

power. President McKinley was assassinated by

anarchist Leon Czolgosz, who claimed he was             Anarchist Emma Goldman addresses a crowd of

primary. This was, as the history suggests, no doubt a result of classism born from the progressive wins of the

labor movement and antisemitism driven by the success of the Bolshevik Revolution. The Espionage Act,

which remains law today, is directed at acts of sabotage and protection of military secrets, whereas the Sedition

Acts, repealed by the government in 1921, was aimed at censoring those who spoke out against the war effort.

There were more than 2,000 prosecutions brought during the years 1917 and 1918. The first free speech case

to reach the Supreme Court involved Charles T. Schenck, the general secretary of the Socialist Party. The Party

attempted to mail 15,000 leaflets to thousands of Americans who had been drafted, encouraging them to assert

their rights, avoid the draft, and join the Socialist Party. Schenck was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in

prison, and the Supreme Court unanimously upheld his conviction.

Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the majority opinion in this case, penning what is now a well-known

phrase: "The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a

theatre and causing a panic." Holmes also established the "clear and present danger" test for political speech,

stating that speech should be allowed under the First Amendment unless it is "of such a nature as to

create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to

prevent (Schenck v. United States). Prominent Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs was also arrested and convicted

for violating the Espionage Act and similarly found guilty of violating the clear and present danger test that

same year. He ran for President from jail in 1920.

It was not until culture, context, and the makeup of the Court itself changed decades later that the

protections for political speech broadened. The year was 1969, and the country was in an era of social
movement and protest. The Civil Rights movement been prominent for over a decade, the second wave
of feminism gave rise to a new woman's movement, the Stonewall uprising gave birth to the LGBTQ+
rights movement, and a massive anti-war movement dominated the country. It seemed as if many historically
marginalized communities were using their voices to participate in debate on public issues in greater numbers
than ever before, placing greater and broader value on political speech.

It is within this context that the Supreme Court heard the case of Clarence Brandenburg, a leader in the Ku
Klux Klan white supremacist hate group. The case of Brandenburg v. Ohio expanded the test for censoring
political speech from whether it poses a "clear and present danger" to whether it is likely to incite or produce
"imminent lawless action" (Brandenburg v. Ohio). In other words, unless it can be shown that an individual's
words directly and immediately caused action that was illegal, speech is allowable. Because causation is difficult
to prove outside of scientific experimentation, this standard makes it so that almost all political speech is
allowed in today's public sphere.

   Most recently, the "incitement test" established in the Brandenburg case was applied in the Articles of
Impeachment filed against former President Donald Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the U.S.
Capitol. Filed in the Senate, House Resolution 24 Article I bears the title "Incitement of Insurrection," and
states that former President Trump:

      willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged--and foreseeably resulted in--lawless action at the
      Capitol, such as: "if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore". Thus incited by
      President Trump, members of the crowd he had addressed, in an attempt to, among other objectives, interfere
      with the Joint Session's solemn constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020 Presidential election,
      unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced
      Members of Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly,
      destructive, and seditious acts. (H.Res.24 - Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States,
      for high crimes and misdemeanors).

72 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

Although the U.S. House of Representatives impeached Former President Donald Trump, there were not
enough votes in the U.S. Senate to remove him from office. He has not been officially charged with the crime of
incitement. However, hundreds of individuals who participated in the riots at the Capitol have been charged
with crimes, including some with seditious conspiracy (Habeshian). When he took office in 2025, President
Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of approximately 1,500 people who were charged in connection
with January 6.

Symbolic Speech

Political speech has since been expanded to include expression beyond just words. "Speech plus" is a concept
that considers speech as an attribute that is paired with one's conduct and is generally considered to have less
protection because it can sometimes lead to other actions or have other consequences. For example, a person
cannot burn their draft card, because a person's draft card serves a function for the government - it is a form of
I.D. required of Americans to report if their draft number is called, etc. (United States v. O'Brien). So, while the
symbolism of burning one's draft card might make a statement, the conduct does damage to something that
serves a function. On the other hand, one can burn a U.S. flag because of the power of the symbolic expression.
Here is Justice William J. Brennan from the majority opinion in Texas v. Johnson, they key flag burning decision
in 1989:

      "If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the
      expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable...We can imagine no
      more appropriate response to burning a flag than waving one's own, no better way to counter a flag burner's
      message than by saluting the flag that burns, no surer means of preserving the dignity even of the flag that burned
      than by--as one witness here did--according its remains a respectful burial. We do not consecrate the flag by
      punishing its desecration, for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem represents" (414,
      420).

Congress attempted to pass a law banning flag burning after the Supreme Court ruled it protected speech,
however the law did not withstand constitutional scrutiny (United States v. Eichman, 1990).

   Speech cannot be banned just because someone might find it offensive. As Justice Harlan wrote in a case
involving a man walking through a courthouse wearing a jacket with the words "F*** the Draft" on it, "one
man's vulgarity is another's lyric" (Cohen v. California). In order to justify a speech restriction, the government
must satisfy something called the strict scrutiny test. It is the highest form of judicial review because the rights
protected in the First Amendment are considered so paramount. In most cases, the government must prove
                                                                          CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 73

that any restriction of a right laid out in the First Amendment is narrowly tailored, serves a compelling
governmental interest, and is the least restrictive way of achieving that interest.

"...or of the press..."

The Supreme Court has established that the free press should be free from what is called "prior restraint"

upon publication (Near v. Minnesota). That is because it is believed that a free press is necessary to hold

the government accountable and to protect against authoritarianism and the abuse of power. Further, the

free press contributes to public discourse by keeping its participants informed and by fostering continued

dialogue. The case that solidified those protections involved the New York Times and the Washington Post.

Both newspapers published a stolen classified study of the Vietnam War known as "The Pentagon Papers."

The study was stolen by whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg,

acting with what he would likely view as parrhesia, and leaked

to the press. Ellsberg was eventually charged with violating the The Pentagon Papers

Espionage Act, although he was never convicted due to a

mistrial. Every single Justice wrote an opinion in the case, six in

the majority and three dissenting. As Justice Hugo Black wrote       You can now read declassified

The Libelous

Just as Plato was concerned about the need for truth in rhetoric, society also values truth and ethics in its
reporting. Parrhesia was generally understood in the ancient world to be a way of speaking truthfully, or, at
the very least, "whose aim is to reveal the truth" (Lu 58). Foucault traces the transformation of parrhesia in
his "Discourse and Truth" lectures as a "personal feature of the ethical or moral character" (33). Aristotle, for
example, "prefers aletheia to doxa, truth to opinion. He does not like flatterers...He uses parrhesia to speak
the truth because he is able to recognize the faults of others: he is conscious of his own difference from them,
of his own superiority" (34). Arthur Walzer observes a similar pattern when he writes about parrhesia from
Plutarch's understanding of it as "the language of friendship" (17). While the press has license to write what
they please, individuals do have legal recourse to sue agents of the press if they print false information or violate
privacy protections - suggesting a cultural value on the ethical dimensions of parrhesia today. Suing the press
or an individual for defamation, sometimes known as libel, is one of the more common free speech lawsuits.

   There are four burdens of proof a person needs to demonstrate to prove they were defamed. First, they
need to show that the false statement (truth is a defense in a defamation suit) was "published" or that it
was a statement made to a third party. Second, they need to prove that they were indeed "identified" in the
statement, either directly or indirectly. Third, they need to prove that the statement legitimately harmed their
reputation - that it "defamed" them. Some statements that might harm someone's reputation are things like
accusing someone of having a communicable disease, claiming someone committed a crime, saying something
76 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

that would damage someone's standing in their community, or saying something that would harm their

professional reputation.

Finally, they need to prove "fault" or that the statement was made

carelessly. For private individuals who do not have the ability to

exchange allegedly false information for true information, they

sometimes only need to prove that the statement was made

negligently (it varies by state law). However, public officials and

figures need to demonstrate that the statement was made with

"knowledge that it was false" or with "reckless disregard for whether

it was false or not" (New York Times Co. v. Sullivan). In other words,

the person making the claim had to know what they were saying

wasn't true or did not try to determine its validity. This "fault"

burden makes it almost impossible for public figures to win

defamation lawsuits because it is very hard to prove the intent or

mindset behind the making of a claim.

High-profile defamation lawsuits often receive media attention. In

Gollea v. Gawker (2013), one of the most impactful cases,

professional wrestler Hulk Hogan (real name Terry Gene Bollea)          "Heed their Rising Voices," New York
sued Gawker media for posting a sex tape of him. He won that            Times, March 29, 1960 -- the

have been made into Netflix documentaries. In 2023, Dominion Voting Systems won a series of legal victories

against Fox News Broadcasting Systems and other individuals for claims made by former President Trump and

his partners on their programs about election fraud during the 2020 presidential election. Former New York

City Mayor Rudy Giuliani recently lost a defamation lawsuit against two election workers in Georgia for a

related incident. In January 2024, former President Trump was ordered to pay damages in a defamation lawsuit

filed by writer E. Jean Carroll related to a legal battle involving the sexual assault allegations against him. She

filed the suit against him for claiming that she lied when she accused him of the assault. One of the largest

amounts of damages ever awarded in a defamation lawsuit was to the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary

Shooting victims when they sued YouTube personality Alex Jones for defamation for claiming that the

shooting was a hoax. The families have won multiple lawsuits in several states and were awarded damages

amounting to billions of dollars.

Structural Exclusions

In order to even participate in the public sphere, though, one has to have access. As has been the case for
thousands of years, initially, the rights protected under the First Amendment only extended to white, wealthy,
78 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

male citizens. According to the first census ever taken in 1790, approximately 20% of the population (free
white males over the age of 16, as they were counted) - actually enjoyed the right to free expression (Decennial
Census Official Publications).

   Neither slaves nor free Black men had a right to free speech. It was illegal in most southern states to even
teach slaves to read or write for the very reasons outlined above - an educated populace threatens those in
power. Slave codes prevented African Americans from assembling or communicating at all. After the Civil
War, Reconstruction-era Jim Crow laws imposed restrictions upon newly freed African Americans that denied
the rights of free expression in similar ways. The broader system of racial segregation prevented Black people
from assembling in public spaces and limited their ability to engage in public life. Limited access to public
education and inferior funding led to institutionalized and hindered educational improvement, which in turn
contributed to limited economic opportunities. Voter suppression laws limited their political expression and
the constant fear of retaliation, often in the form of lynching, for speaking out against systemic injustices made
access to the right of freedom of expression all but non-existent.

   The right also did not apply non-citizens nor the Indigenous population, nor did it apply to women, who
under the system of coverture had no legal identity. A woman, it was believed, could "speak" through the
men closest to her in her life - whether that be her father, husband, or another close male relative. This
applied to expressing her political beliefs through voting, making financial decisions, making decisions about
her household, and even expression of her body, as marital rape did not become officially illegal in the last state
until as late as 1993.

   Further, many believed that white women's sensibilities were too delicate for "raucous" public sphere,
fearing that their perceived moral purity would be corrupted. As a result, they were relegated to the private,
domestic sphere and not permitted to freely assemble like their white male counterparts. Many even believed
that women were simply not as intelligent as men. In the 1860s, the French physician and anatomist Paul Broca
wrote that "we must not forget that women are, on the average, a little less intelligent than men, a difference
which we should not exaggerate but which is, nonetheless, real. We are therefore permitted to suppose that
the relatively small size of the female brain depends in part upon her physical inferiority and in part upon her
intellectual inferiority." Women were not allowed to be educated or pursue a career. White women could not
even participate in the democratic process through voting until 1920, 130 years after the adoption of the Bill
of Rights.

   There is perhaps no category that has been censored more broadly than obscene speech, and it has been used
as a way to silence women's voices for over 150 years. Concerns about "immoral," blasphemous, indecent, and
similar types of speech have a long history in our country that affects parts of culture outside of issues of free
expression. While this story dates back thousands of years and appears in Greek myths, the Bible, and even
fairy tales, at least in the 19th century, this story begins with a man named Anthony Comstock. Comstock
made it his mission to target what he believed to be "immoral" speech circulating society, primarily seeking to
suppress speech related to birth control, sex education, and obscenity. He was a key player in the passage of the
Comstock Act of 1873, which makes it illegal to send "obscene" materials through the U.S. Postal Service.
                                                                          CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 79

   After its passage, he became a vigilante as a post office agent, particularly targeting birth control advocates.
Many famous historical figures were jailed under the Comstock Act, including Planned Parenthood founder
Margaret Sanger, who was exiled to Europe. Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for President and
the first woman stockbroker on Wall Street was also jailed under the Comstock Act for writing a newspaper
column alleging that one of her political opponents engaged in an extramarital affair. The Comstock Act is
still in effect today and is suddenly relevant again in a post-Roe v. Wade world (Bazelon). It is being used
as justification for outlawing the mailing of Mifepristone across state lines, an FDA approved medication
abortion pill ("The Threat to Abortion Rights You Haven't Heard Of").

   Until 1957, the U.S. operated with a broad understanding of what obscenity meant and many books,
including works like James Joyce's Ulysses and Lady Chatterley's Lover, were banned under its umbrella. Once,
a book publisher named Samuel Roth published unauthorized copies of these works and another obscene
book called American Aphrodite before he was charged with violating the Comstock Act for sending circulars
about the books through the mail. As such, the Supreme Court revisited the definition of "obscene speech" in
1957 (Roth v. United States). They further expanded the definition in 1973 and settled on the definition still
used today (Miller v. California). For speech to be illegal, it must be considered based on "whether the average
person applying contemporary community standards would find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the
prurient interest."

   Average person is meant to refer to a general category of reasonable person. However, even this idea is
complex. As feminist thinker feminist Catherine MacKinnon points out, the average person standard on
which obscenity law is built is based on a pornography industry built around male standards of morality
that doesn't consider harm to women (Franks 50-51). Prurient means having an excessive or unwholesome
sexual interest. Further, the work must depict or describe in a "patently offensive way," "sexual conduct" as
specifically defined by the law in the state in which the speech is uttered. Finally, it has to violate the SLAPS
test - it has to lack Serious Literary, Artistic, Political, or Scientific value (Miller v. California). In a modern,
contemporary context, the work must describe sexual conduct as specifically defined by state law, and it cannot
pass the SLAPS test. It is for this reason that things like sex education books (scientific value), pornographic
films (artistic value), and erotica (literary value) are now no longer categories of speech that can be censored.

   The other realm of speech that it has been considered permissible to limit is speech that is harmful to
children. Child pornography is considered unprotected speech because of the harm it does to the minors who
might be involved in making it and who might be triggered emotionally by seeing it (New York v. Ferber).
Another example of protecting children from harmful speech concerns the restriction of lewd or profane
speech on broadcast mediums as regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Supreme
Court determined in 1978 that it is within the regulatory power of the FCC to restrict certain language and
content on broadcast airwaves because the broadcast medium is uniquely pervasive and accessible to children
(FCC v. Pacifica Foundation).

   This is also the justification that the government first used when seeking to regulate Internet content. As part
of the vast Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress attempted to pass the Communications Decency Act,
80 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

prohibiting indecent or obscene content on the Internet. The Supreme Court found it overly broad and vague,
as it did other attempts to regulate Internet content (Reno v. ACLU). The Court has only been satisfied with
attempts to regulate the Internet when they align with the regulation of political speech, specifically focusing
on Time, Place, and Manner restrictions. The Court determined it permissible to require libraries and schools
to install filtering software to prevent minors from accessing inappropriate material (United States v. American
Library Assn., Inc.). That way, if an adult wanted to have the filter removed, they could.

   The LGBTQ+ population is another historically marginalized group who has been denied a right to free
expression and, while progress has been made, is still fighting against prejudice and censorship today. For
centuries, LGTBQ+ individuals have been unable to live as their authentic selves, which a form of censorship
in and of itself. Today, Republican lawmakers have introduced over 500 bills across the country that aim
to restrict LGBTQ+ expression that include things like bans on books and limits on school curricula that
teach about gender and sexuality. Florida passed a law that prevents "all employees or contractors in a public
K-12 school from providing students with their `preferred personal title or pronouns if such personal title or
pronouns do not correspond to that person's sex,'" while at work.

   Perhaps the most visible and obvious ban on expression are the bans aimed at "drag queen story hours,"
events at which drag queens will visit public libraries to read books to children. Tennessee became the first
state to pass legislation that restricts drag shows in public spaces, and many states have bills either pending or
passed since. Most legislation argues that the drag queen story hours violate state anti-obscenity statutes. So
far, federal judges have found that these bills are unconstitutional and violations of free speech. Judge Thomas
Parker, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, went so far as to say that the Tennessee law "targets
the viewpoint of gender identity" (Cochrane).

   Across the United States, a wave of book bans is disproportionately targeting stories by and about
marginalized groups. Many of the banned books center on race, gender identity, and sexuality--topics that
some view as controversial but are vital to inclusive education and representation. These bans amount to a
form of censorship that silences diverse voices and limits students' access to the full exploration of knowledge.

For those in privileged groups, though, they often need only contend with structures and systems when
wanting to express their political viewpoint. The only regulation the Court has in theory put on "political"
speech relates to what are referred to as Time, Place, and Manner restrictions. These restrictions give the
government the power to regulate the when, where, and how of speech for purposes of order and public safety.
Such restrictions must also be "content-neutral" and made in a "non-discriminatory" manner. In other words,
a city can charge an organization a fee to stage a parade because of the costs to law enforcement, street clean-up,
                 CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 81

etc. They must also charge the same fee to other groups and not charge more because they disagree with what

they represent.

                                                         Time, Place, and Manner restrictions are based on

                                                         the 3-part public forum rule - the idea that publicly

                                                         owned spaces (tax-payer funded spaces run by the

                                                         government) should be open for public discourse.

                                                         There are three different types of public forums,

                                                         though (Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Educators' Ass'n).

                                                         A quintessential public forum is a space that is

                                                         always open for debate and public discourse, such as

                                                         the grounds of a state capitol, the steps of the

                                                         Supreme Court, or the National Mall. Some of the

                                                         country's most famous protests, marches, and

school students; it is therefore not an open public forum. However, in the evening, a school board or city

council meeting could open this space for use as a public forum. The third type is a non-public forum - spaces

that are owned by the government but never open as spaces for public discourse - such as the Oval Office.

These categories do not necessarily account for today's true space of discourse: cyberspace. The Internet is

difficult to regulate because it is not easily delineated in terms of time and space, transcends borders, and is

for the most part controlled by private companies. Further, while most of the Communication Decency Act

of 1996 was overturned for being overly broad and vague, remains law. Section 230 provides immunity for

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and content platforms for the content posted by users. The rationale for this

law is that there is no way for the platforms to control what users post, so if they make a good faith effort to take

down threatening content or content that violates intellectual property (something referred to as the "good

Samaritan clause"), they cannot be sued for wrongdoing. Section 230 has been controversial, particularly with

the rise of social media, as critics of companies like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have accused platforms of

avoiding accountability for harmful and misleading content.

When members of historically privileged populations have unrestricted access (isegoria) and can speak

with parrhesia, it is not uncommon throughout history for that privilege to be abused, sometimes with

dire consequences. Adolph Hitler used oratory to convince millions of people to commit heinous crimes,

leading to the torture and murder of millions of Jewish people, LGBTQ+ people, people with disabilities, and

more. White Europeans used logic and argument based in Christianity and "science" to convince others to
82 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

enslave and torture Africans. They were successful at persuading others in believing that people of African
descent were inferior, and thus justifiably categorized those of African descent as 3/5th of a person in the U.S.
Constitution and treated them as less than human in practice. Relatedly, white European men also convinced
themselves that they were more superior intellectually than any other race around the world, which led to a
centuries-long campaign of colonization and violence around the world. White supremacist groups like the Ku
Klux Klan held marches to intimidate Black communities in the wake of the Civil War and continue to do so
today, most visibly at the "Unite the Right" rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia when a car ploughed into
a crowd and killed a counter protestor named Heather Heyer.

   History is also riddled with examples of instances when culturally privileged voices stole the rightful
expression of those who do not have the right to speak. It dates back to the ancient Greek rhetoricians and
the debate over whether or not Aspasia of Miletus (who likely philosophized with Socrates and Plato) was
the true author of Pericles' famed "funeral oration," one of the first documented speeches in history. Women
have been the authors of famous works, the minds behind scientific discoveries, and the brains behind many
consequential decisions that history often attributes to men. Lessons in Chemistry, a TV series based on a book
of the same name by Bonnie Garmus, follows Elizabeth Zott, a chemist in the 1950s whose groundbreaking
scientific work is stolen by her male colleagues. African Americans, too, often had/have creative work stolen
or attributed to their white peers or counterparts. The most prominent example related to free expression is
the history of racial inequality in the music and fashion industry. Black artists in jazz, literature, the visual arts,
and popular fashion have frequently had their innovations and creativity stolen by white musicians, artists, and
producers.

Free Speech Advocacy and Resistance

Although they were denied a constitutional right to free speech, historically marginalized communities also
benefitted from its limited codification into law, leading to some of the most significant social movements
in history. Although they were forced to stay within the private sphere, early women activists would subvert
this cultural expectation during the abolition movement and sign anti-slavery petitions. By doing this, they
"bypassed the requirement of suffrage to participate publicly in the political debate over the heated national
debate over slavery (Zaeske 148). The woman suffrage movement spanned seven decades and three generations.
What began with a small convention of a few dozen women signing a petition and issuing a declaration in
Seneca Falls, New York in 1848 culminated with members of the National Woman's Party being arrested for
silently picketing at the White House during WWI.
                                                                          CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 83

   Today, women use public forums like social media
to advocate and speak out on behalf of other women
through movements like #metoo. Mary Anne
Franks identifies women speaking publicly about
male perpetrators of sexual violence, especially when
those men hold positions of power and influence in
society, as examples of modern parrhesiastes. She
writes of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony
against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanagh,
accusing him of sexual assault when they were in
high school, as an example of what she calls the three Thousands march during "The Women's March," on
"hallmarks of parrhesia": "sincerity, criticism, and Jan. 21, 2017.
courage" (121). The Women's March on Jan. 21,
2017, held the day after President Trump's first inauguration, was considered one of the largest single-day
marches in history, as millions of women marched around the world to speak out on behalf of bodily
autonomy, empowerment, and yes, freedom of expression.

   Similarly, African Americans have a long history of speaking out against oppression. That activism began
with prominent figures like Frederick Douglass and continued with the civil disobedience actions of the Civil
Rights Movement of the mid-20th century. Despite being subjected to harassment, violence, and suppression,
protest leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Fannie Lou Hamer, John Lewis, Malcolm X, James Farmer,
and others organized actions that enacted the rights that are in theory protected under the First Amendment.
Well-known campaigns like the lunch counter sit-ins, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Freedom Rides, the
marches, the protest songs, and countless other actions are an example of what the First Amendment is about
- citizens using collective action to raise questions about public policy and inspire change.

10 years ago, in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin,
an unarmed Black teenager in a neighborhood in Florida, the #blacklivesmatter movement was formed. The
efforts of #blacklivesmatter co-founders Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi's ignited global
activism that reached a high point in reaction to the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota in
May 2020. Peaceful marches and protests often ended in violence and riots reminiscent of the Civil Rights
movement. The movement has also garnered a culturally conservative backlash as schoolboards around the
84 | CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

country passed policies banning the teaching of "critical race theory ," diversity, equity, and inclusion, and
books about racial and gendered equality (Banned and Challenged Books).

   When President Trump took office for the second time in January, 2025, he issued a series of Executive
Orders targeting what his administration claimed were aiming to "restore merit based opportunities," directing
all federal agencies to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, grants, and language. The EO's
have significantly impacted educational institutions by mandating the elimination of DEI offices, roles, and
initiatives. The Trump Administration threatened schools with losing federal funding if they did not comply.
A document of Frequently Asked Questions about the Department of Education directives seems to suggest
that teaching about the history of systemic racism and white supremacy would "create a racially hostile
environment." The actions are being challenged by several organizations as being unconstitutional for violating
the First and Fifth Amendments, arguing they threaten academic freedom and the pursuit of knowledge.

Conclusion

An evolving and ever-changing part of our country's story and key element to understanding the nature of
free expression is that the public sphere must be open and accessible to everyone. For the marketplace to work,
however, "society has to accept the force of reason over the power of irrational resentments and prejudice"
(Stanley). As you learned in Part I, there are philosophical and historical reasons for protecting free expression,
including its ability to foster critical thinking, informed decision-making, and the pursuit of truth. Ultimately,
the preservation of the freedom of speech is essential for the advancement of knowledge and the flourishing
of democracies. Only through the continuous and fearless exchange of ideas can we hope to build a more just
and informed society. However, it is contingent on those in power to uphold and protect that freedom.

   In Part II, you learned that there are five freedoms protected in the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution and that it is only Congress, or entities that the government has jurisdiction over, that can
"abridge" your speech rights. "The genius of the First Amendment lies in bringing isegoria and parrhesia
together, by securing the equal right and liberty of citizens not simply to `exercise their reason' but to speak
their minds," Teresa Bejan writes. "It does so because the alternative is to allow the powers-that-happen-to-
be to grant that liberty as a license to some individuals while denying it to others." This is because the right
to freedom of speech is codified in the U.S. Constitution, which makes it unique in the modern world.
Since it started interpreting laws related to the First Amendment, the Supreme Court has generally held
that "political speech" (at least for those in majority identity groups) and the rights of a free press should be
protected because of the need to hold those in power accountable.

   This does not mean, though, that speech is without limits in the United States. The Supreme Court
developed the "two-tiered theory" of speech, dividing speech into two categories: worthwhile speech that is
a step toward truth and thus having social value and speech that is worthless (the "lewd and obscene," the
"profane," "libelous," the "insulting or fighting words"). Further, in Part III you learned that the historical
                 CHAPTER 4: RHETORIC AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION | 85

application of the First Amendment reveals a stark disparity between its idealistic promise and the lived realities

of marginalized groups. For centuries, access to free expression was systematically denied to women, enslaved

people, and people of color. However, despite systemic attempts to silence them, members of historically

marginalized groups have consistently leveraged whatever avenues were available to exercise their voice and

fight for their rights. From the suffrage movement to Black Lives Matter, these acts of resistance highlight the

power of collective action and the inherent bravery in the enactment of modern day parrhesia in challenging

injustice.

Sophie Scholl was a leader in the White Rose, a student resistance

movement at the University of Munich in Nazi Germany. She joined

the group in 1942 after learning about its mission to oppose the

regime through nonviolent means, such as distributing leaflets that

called for justice, freedom, and an end to the war.Inspired by the

activism of her father, who was imprisoned for opposing the Nazi

regime, she played a key role in writing and distributing thousands of

leaflets across Munich and beyond, often risking her life to ensure

their message reached others. Scholl's speech acts are true examples of

parrhesia, speaking truth at great personal risk. In February 1943,

Part 1: Defining the Rhetorical Situation

The rhetorical situation is a fundamental framework for understanding rhetoric as a form of persuasion, that
is, as a speech or text that seeks to influence an audience's actions. It describes rhetoric as a response to a
problem or an answer to a question. Given an imperfect state of affairs, rhetoric responds or intervenes to
create some change by addressing an audience. The rhetorical situation is also part of the tradition of public
90 | CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION

address scholarship. Public address may consist in the composition of eloquent speeches that are to be
delivered in public settings, a studied reflection upon the geographical locations where public events have
occurred in the past, or the researching of presidential correspondence, letters, or newsprint publications about
former occupants of the executive branch. Public address is most aptly described as the criticism of public
speech that approximates more closely a genuinely historical point of view regarding the ideas of our shared
social history.

   The rhetorical situation is also part of a tradition that understands rhetoric as context-dependent. Often,
rhetorical scholars attribute this idea to Aristotle, who defines rhetoric as "the available means of persuasion in
any given situation." In other words, understanding the force of a persuasive speech act relies upon a deep
knowledge of the setting in which it was spoken. Aristotle also describes rhetoric's situations in terms of
three discrete genres: Forensic rhetoric is about the past and whether it did or did not happen; the traditional
"situation" for forensic rhetoric was the courtroom proceeding. Epideictic, about matters of praise or blame,
was speech situated in public spaces and delivered to a mass audience. Deliberative or policy-making speeches
would occur in the situation of legislation and lawmaking, in service of developing a future course of action.

92 | CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION

These three original genres of speech give the speech that is delivered in these spaces a specific function. They
respond to a set of pre-defined circumstances concerning matters of fact, good and bad judgment, and policy.
The rhetorical situation is an extension of this understanding. It provides us with a framework that says that
speech responds to a set of pre-existing circumstances and is tailored for an audience.

      According to Lloyd Bitzer, the rhetorical situation is that it is a "complex of persons, events, objects, and
      relations presenting an actual or potential exigence which can be completely or partially removed if discourse,
      introduced in the situation, can so constrain human decision or action as to bring about the significant
      modification of the exigence.

  · First, the rhetorical situation is a complex of persons, events, objects, and relations. The complex
      of persons includes speakers and audiences. Events include important and historic instances of speech
      and speech-making. Objects include the symbols gathered by speeches, what those speeches reference,
      and the speech's effects. The complex relations of the situation describes the audiences it brings forth
      and the modes of identification it cultivates.

  · Second, the rhetorical situation presents an actual or potential exigence. An exigence is "an urgency
      marked by imperfection." It describes a state of discontent or emergency in which speech is an adequate
      response and can bring about a resolution. Exigences ultimately describe the problem that the speech
      must respond to.

  · Third, the rhetorical situation can completely or partially remove the exigence. This means that an
      adequate speech makes the exigence is reversible by producing effects and audiences that are capable of
      addressing or effecting the change as the emergency requires.

  · Fourth, the rhetorical situation introduces discourse into the situation. This means that the use or
      application of rhetoric can undo the emergency. A speech that will heal the situation will bring things to
      a resolution.

  · Fifth, the speech presented in a rhetorical situation may constrain human decisions or actions. This means
      that a situation is rhetorical when speech resolves an emergency by steering people to act in a way that,
      had the speech not happened, they otherwise would not.

  · Finally, the speech presented in a rhetorical situation may bring about a significant modification of the
      exigence. Significant modification means that the speech does something to address the problem.
      Ultimately, this effect of speech upon a greater exigence is what makes the situation a rhetorical one.
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION | 93

Key Aspects of Rhetorical Situations

  · The historical context is the larger background in which a message is situated. The rhetorical
      situation is a subset of that field, a smaller, more defined relative of a greater historical context.

  · The rhetorical situation always places three specific elements into a relationship with each other.
      These are the rhetorical exigence, the audience, and the constraints.

  · A rhetorical exigence is an urgency marked by imperfection. It is the thing to which a speech - the
      rhetorical response - responds.

  · A rhetorical audience is those people who have the capacity to act on the speaker's message.
  · A rhetorical constraint describes those things that limit the audience to interpret the message and steer

      them to act in one direction or another.

A Rhetorical Situation is not a "Context" ...

A further important feature of the rhetorical situation is that it is not the same as context. This is, first of
all, because every message occurs in a context, and not all contexts are rhetorical. Practically, this means that
context is general, and the rhetorical situation is specific. A historical context is one in which any message can
occur.
94 | CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION

      ... because not all contexts are rhetorical.

A rhetorical situation is a situation that allows for a response, a speech that is capable of changing people's
minds and motivating their actions. The second reason the rhetorical situation is not the same as context is that
only a rhetorical situation can invite a rhetorical response.

      ... because only a rhetorical situation can invite a rhetorical response.

Context is the history of an utterance, a series of motivations, occurrences, and acts that set a precedent for a public
and cultural status quo. As a running example of the difference between context and situation, let's consider the
2020 presidential impeachment hearings.

      The greater context for these presidential impeachment hearings might include the 1987 Iran-Contra scandal
      and the 1998 impeachment hearing of Bill Clinton. Both are distant historical events in which speeches and
      arguments were made concerning Congress's authority over the Executive branch. Consistently, attorneys for
      the President have claimed that Congress did not have the authority to investigate the President whereas
      Congress has claimed that authority.

      The rhetorical situation for Presidential impeachment hearings in 2020 would instead be the circumstances
      and consequences surrounding a 2019 phone call between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and
      Donald Trump. The speakers and speeches generated by the impeachment trials themselves would be the
      "rhetoric" that responded to this situation. It would be comprised of Congressional testimony, official
      investigative reports, political biographies, and commentary by political pundits.

Rhetorical Response/Rhetorical Audience

Not every response to a rhetorical situation is rhetorical. Non-rhetorical responses are those that do not affect
the exigency. Rhetorical responses are those that do. An emergency such as war might provoke messages
that people should be afraid or display courage. Those messages can't be separated from the emergency that
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION | 95

occasioned it. In that sense, they are "responses" to the rhetorical situation. But not every "response" has its
intended effects, and not every "response" can be directly tied back to the exigence at hand.

   Below is an example of the testimony offered during the 2019 impeachment hearings instigated by the
Zelensky-Trump phone conversation. The speaker is Fiona Hill, a U.S. diplomatic liaison to the Ukraine who
was removed from her post just days before the phone call occurred.

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=196#oembed-2

A response is rhetorical when it is addressed to a rhetorical audience, that is, those auditors or listeners who have
the capacity to act. Not all audiences can be rhetorical audiences. In practice, this means more people will hear
the rhetorical response than can address it--only people who can act count as the rhetorical audience.

      For example, consider a political speech urging young people to vote delivered by a candidate that is delivered to
      an audience that has a mix of high school students. However, this speech may be heard by the younger members
      of the crowd or people whose naturalization status prevents them from voting. If the sought-after effect of the
      speech is for people to vote for the candidate, then Bitzer's theory of the rhetorical situation is limited because it
      only includes those with the capability to vote.

Exigence, Audience, and Constraints

The rhetorical exigence is defined as imperfection marked by urgency. It is a defect, an obstacle, something
waiting to be done, a thing other than it should be. There are also non-rhetorical exigences, or "emergencies,"
for which speech isn't a good or effective response. Bitzer describes a natural disaster as a "non-rhetorical
exigence" - a well-delivered speech, traditionally conceived, might not be the best immediate response. Instead
of speech alone, an adequate rhetorical response would have to include emergency alerts, funding, and climate
change mitigation efforts. What makes for a rhetorical exigence is when speech provides the remedy to the
imperfection by urgency.

      In the case referenced earlier, the recorded conversation between Zelensky and Trump documented a request
      to investigate Joe Biden in exchange for an already-promised military defense system. This conversation is
      the rhetorical exigence: it generated a public emergency for which speech was deemed to be a fitting response.

The rhetorical audience is defined as only those capable of being influenced by discourse and of being
mediators of change. They must be capable of making some change that would adjust the exigence due to
hearing the speech.
96 | CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION

      There were at least two rhetorical audiences for the 2020 impeachment proceedings. One rhetorical audience of
      the Senate hearings consisted of the US Senate and Chief Justice John Roberts. They were the ones who would
      be ultimately voting on the Impeachment. In the style of forensic rhetoric, the Senators and possibly Roberts
      in the event of a tie were charged with discovering whether or not the President had committed an impeachable
      offense. Because they were the ones with the capacity to act, they composed the rhetorical audience.

      The American voting public was a second rhetorical audience insofar as the messages conveyed in the Senate
      were meant to convince voters to turn out for the November 2020 election. Hearing the appeals on the Senate
      floor also persuaded those who could vote to cast them.

Finally, rhetorical constraints are comprised of persons, events, objects, and relations. These are part of the
situation because they have the power to constrain decision-making and action.

      In the Senate, constraints could include procedural limitations such as who gets to make the rules about how and
      when testimony is offered. It could be relations, in the sense partisan groups would seek to shut the trials down.
      It could be that another emergency interrupts the proceedings, or prevents that event from being remembered.

Responses to Rhetorical Situations

There are different kinds of responses to rhetorical situations.

  · The first response is conformity, in which the audience accepts what the speech is asking of them, and
      they perform the action that is requested.

  · The second is desecration which violates what would have been an appropriate response. Given that
      there is a normal range of responses that would be accepted from a situation, the response of desecration
      would violate those expectations and challenge them. If someone were giving a eulogy, for instance,
      laughter would be a prohibited response and example of desecration.

The famous Apple "1984" advertisement linked below offers a dramatized example of both "conformity" and
"desecration," in the sense that the gathered viewers are in conformity with the televised speaker's message
whereas the running character who throws the sledgehammer violates conformist expectations
and desecrating both the speaker and their message.

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=196#oembed-3

  · The third response is non-participation, which rejects the legitimacy of the rhetorical situation by
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION | 97

      refusing to be a part of it. In other words, it says that the emergency is not that big of an emergency, or
      that we don't have to be so concerned about the emergency that is being posed. That non-participation
      is a rhetorical response because it simultaneously responds to the exigency by refusing to recognize it.
  · Finally, contextual reconstruction is when a rhetor redefines the situation. In other words, given the
      rhetorical effort to redefine or reframe the exigency, it provides an alternative look at the current
      circumstances.

Below is an episode of Crossfire, a debate-style television show from the early 2000s which embraces a both-
sides format. This episode features John Stewart, recently the new host of the Daily Show. Stewart first
engages in non-participation by rejecting the premise of the show and refusing to "debate." He then engages
in a contextual reconstruction that reframes Crossfire as contributing to a destructive both-sides mentality in
politics. Stewart's explanation is a contextual reconstruction because reframed the event, putting it in a new
light. His appearance also coincided with the cancellation of the show shortly thereafter.

Part 2: Analysis of a Rhetorical Situation

This section of the chapter provides detailed examples of the major terms of the rhetorical situation,
including rhetorical exigence, context, audience, and constraints. It ends with an example of a rhetorical
situation, with a brief discussion of each of its parts.

Rhetorical Exigence: Michael Brown and Barack Obama

The exigence is the defect of the status quo. It is a problem we live with that has become acute; it is an
emergency that is other than it should be. Rhetorical exigences can be modified through discourse. "In any
rhetorical situation, there will be at least one controlling exigence which functions as an organizing principle."
This "organizing exigence" defines the audience to be addressed and the change to be effected.

   On August 9, 2014, a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, spurring nationwide
mass protests against police brutality. The following year, in April 2015, protests erupted in Baltimore after
the death of Freddie Gray, who was brutally assaulted as he was arrested, fell into a coma, and died. These
events also illustrated the larger problem that police departments had started to acquire military equipment as
a way to police crowds, and technologies that the military had previously used during wartime deployments
98 | CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION

oversees suddenly became technologies used to police American citizens. Worse yet, police who were using
these weapons had not been trained to use them appropriately. The racial bias of police departments across the
country was becoming apparent given the accumulation of events related to police brutality.

This short speech by Barack Obama on October 31, 2015 sought to address the exigence of mass incarceration
and over-policing by healing the divide between the different groups he addresses. We should think hard about
whether this speech is accomplishing that goal given its emphasis on helping the economy and people recently
released from prison. However, what is clear is that it is both a response to a problem that exists prominently
at the moment that Obama is speaking and a way of curating the behavior of the audiences that are meant to
hear this speech.

   If the rhetorical situation "specifies the audience to be addressed," then in the above clip, we can quite
clearly hear Obama discussing "drug rehabilitation" and the pipeline from schools to prisons. We also heard
Obama discussing police officers as people who "protect Americans." To whom is this addressed? Both
audiences: it is meant to affirm both the structural causes of mass incarceration for the public made angry
by prominent instances of police brutality and defend violent police officers by describing them as civil
servants. However, this speech neither addresses police brutality directly nor holds police officers accountable
for excessive use of force. Specified audiences of the rhetorical situation includes over-policed and structurally
oppressed Americans and police officers, resulting in a "middle voice" that is stretched between these
audiences.

Context: 13th by Ava DuVernay

Obama's speech, shown above, occurs within a larger context of racial policing in the United States, which
disproportionately targets minoritized communities. Every message occurs within a context: a larger, more
encompassing umbrella term for the setting in which a speech or utterance happens. Context is the history
of the speech or utterance, a series of motivations, occurrences, and acts that set a precedent for the current
status quo - which means how things are in our present moment, right now. Consider the video below as an
illustration of the larger context for Obama's 10/31/2015 speech. The documentary "13th" by Ava DuVernay
explains the historical transition from slavery to the thirteenth amendment to a contemporary system of mass
incarceration.
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION | 99

Rhetorical Audience: George H.W. Bush v. Michael Dukakis

Next, let's consider the rhetorical audience, which describes only those capable of being influenced by a speech
(or rhetorical discourse) and of being mediators of change.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=196#oembed-7

Above is another rhetorical message that is situated within the larger context of mass incarceration. However, it
has a different situation: the 1988 Dukakis/Bush presidential election. The video is a campaign advertisement
from the first George Bush campaign which attacks Dukakis. The exigence is Dukakis's early lead on George
Bush, which created an opening for a rhetorical response. This response is important for how it targeted
specific voters by preying on the stereotype of violent minorities and the idea that people who had been
imprisoned would always be "prisoners" or "criminals," regardless of rehabilitation or if their incarceration was
unjust. Let's take a look at the video.

   The rhetorical audience here isn't just who can be influenced by the message. Viewers, for instance, might
be angered by the message that's being sent by this video. It is specifically those who would act on that message
by voting against the Dukakis campaign. Viewers who might react against this message are also a rhetorical
audience. They may reject the message and doing the opposite of what it asks or offer an alternative explanation
of mass incarceration that does not rely on racist caricatures.

Rhetorical Constraints: Parody and Satire

Let's consider the last element of the rhetorical situation: constraints. Constraints are comprised of persons,
events, objects, and relations that are part of the situation because they can constrain decision-making and
action that could modify the exigence. This example offers another campaign ad. IT is not as clearly related to
the larger context of mass incarceration. This video illustrates "constraints" by showing how political campaign
ads are always limited in what they can say or the messages they communicate.

The Phil Gulbright/Gil Fulbright/Phillip Mymoufwiffarts political advertisement illustrates the limitations on
the speaker because he draws attention to how his own beholdenness to multiple audiences: the voting public
and his private donors - narrowly shape his own rhetorical response.

Rhetorical Situation: The Challenger Address

The final example of the rhetorical situation is Ronald Reagan's Challenger Address Speech.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=196#oembed-9

The following explanation of this rhetorical situation comes from Catherine Palczewski et al.:

      Reagan clearly identified the exigence: "the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger... is truly a national loss" that made
      it a day "for mourning and remembering," but the march of progress and the call for exploration gave meaning
      to that loss of life.
      The context for this meaning was a history of exploration associated with past empires. According to Reagan,
      the members of the space shuttle crew had "a hunger to explore the universe" and were part of a long line of
      explorers. The examples of the 1967 Apollo I fire and the 1596 death of Francis Drake offered similar historical
      events that helped make the loss of life during exploration seem normal and expected. As Reagan explained to
      schoolchildren: "Its all part of the process of exploration and discovery."
      The audiences in the situation were composed of people who shared the need for reassurance and the sentiment
      that exploration defines the people of the United States: the families of the astronauts, schoolchildren, NASA
      workers, and the viewing public who had tuned in to the event. Reagan provided an explanation not of the
      accident but of exploration. He thus offered a response that quickly passed through stages of mourning while
      seeking to reinforce the public faith in expanded American space exploration. Reagan's hybrid response sought
      to justify funding for the space program (a deliberative goal) while also eulogizing the lives of the astronauts who
      had died in the explosion (an epideictic goal).
                                                                                                    CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION | 101

      The constraints in the situation concerned the genre of eulogy, which Reagan mirrored in structuring his
      speech. He also assumed a paternalistic role in the speech, speaking not only as President but as an elder relative
      to schoolchildren who had been watching the speech from across the country.

      As a total rhetorical situation, the rhetor, Reagan, responded to an exigence by speaking to
      particular audiences, such as school children and the viewing public, in a way that accounted
      for constraints such as the appropriate way to respond to a tragic loss of life. Reagan did not just respond to
      this situation, but sought to actively redefine what it meant.

Part 3: Rhetorical Ecologies

Although Lloyd Bitzer develops the concept of "the rhetorical situation" there are several other participants in
this conversation. I'd like to draw our attention to Lloyd Bitzer, Richard Vatz, and Jenny Edbauer.

 1. Bitzer is the originator of the rhetorical situation. In his view, there is first a situation, then there is a
      rhetorical response, and finally, rhetoric that people can act upon. The emergency arises and it creates
      conditions for a speaker to invent a speech that moves people to some action.

 2. Vatz argues that rhetoric arises not because of a situation, but because of the speaker. From this point of
      view, there is no emergency unless a rhetor perceives there to be an emergency. It is the speaker's job to
      create a shared reality for the audience through their speech. However, if the public's perception of an
      emergency depends on the speaker, a real, material reality may be at odds with other "emergencies" that
      a speaker brings to the public's attention as distractions. The realities of pandemics and climate change,
      for instance, may be something that a speaker cannot distract from with another "imagined" exigence.
      Some emergencies simply cannot be ignored or deflected by a speaker because they form such a
      commonly felt urgency.

 3. Edbauer argues that rhetoric never occurs in one situation but always unfolds across many situations.
      Whereas Bitzer and Vatz focus on individual speeches delivered in isolated situations, Edbauer is more
      interested in the way that rhetoric moves from one situation to another, much like a viral tweet or video.
      Rhetoric that occurs in one situation may then give rise to similar rhetoric that arises in a separate
      situation. This then may create yet another rhetorical response, unrelated to the first, and so on. The
      speaker isn't the most important person in the Edbauer model. Instead, the rhetoric moves from one
      rhetorical moment to the next to produce a message across a variety of situations.

Rhetorical ecologies are variations on the traditional framework of the rhetorical situation. A rhetorical
situation is typically conceived as a speaker's unique creation or as a response to an emergency. Edbauer's
version of a rhetorical situation suggests that it isn't fixed; it does not happen once or in isolation. Instead,
Edbauer argues that exigences are always a series of events. These situations create a network of lived
experiences and structures of feeling. Edbauer also contextualizes rhetoric in terms of time, history, and
102 | CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION

experience. Rhetoric from this point of view isn't linear. It doesn't start with a speaker who devises a speech
that is received by an audience. Rhetoric moves from one moment to another, from one situation to another.
It changes depending on the historical moment and the particular experiences that a given instance of rhetoric
foregrounds.

Newton's fixed space vs. Einstein's flexible spacetime, from the film "Testing Einstein's Universe" by
Norbert Bartel.

  · The Rhetorical Situation: Traditionally conceived, situations are fixed spaces. By comparison,
      rhetorical ecologies are dynamic spaces. The word situation comes from the Latin Situs, which signifies a
      bordered and fixed location. An example of Situs is the (incorrect) idea of the Earth as the presumptive
      center of the Universe, having a stable position that does not affect the space around it. A Situs for
      rhetoric would mean that everything revolves around the speech's ability to respond to an emergency.

  · The Rhetorical Ecology: Instead of a Situs for rhetoric, the ecology model describes rhetoric's force,
      intensity, and circulatory range as a distribution. This would be like the shift from the Newtonian Model
      to the Einsteinian Model, where space is molded or shaped around the speech or object. In other words,
      there is no clear "center" for rhetoric; rhetoric instead has many centers with distinct mass and gravity.
      Rather than just one speech or rhetorical discourse, an ecology-based approach would think about
      multiple speeches or discourses and how they affect and interact with one another.

Writing as Rhetorical Situation and Rhetorical Ecology

Let's consider "writing an assignment" in terms of the situation and ecology models of rhetoric. As
a Situs, writing would be a very linear process. It would follow a first, second, third progression: receive the
                                                                                                    CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION | 103

assignment (the exigence), outline and draft a (rhetorical) response, and see if it had the intended effect (upon
an instructor or peers). The writer would make a message, then transmit it to an audience. Bitzer would say that
there is an emergency to which the writer responds, like an upcoming deadline, and then their text or speech
offers a more or less adequate response to that emergency.

   Writing conceived in terms of distribution means that it would occur across a range of processes and
encounters. There is, for instance, the event of starting a blank document and the tyranny of the blinking
cursor. Your encounter with the keyboard might restrict or open up the flow of words. It might also create
physical limitations as your fingers begin to cramp or your posture hunches over. You may stop, lose your place,
or write across multiple days, weeks, or months. Then again, the same act of writing may occur in a group
setting or a collaborative document. These interactions could energize your writing and stimulate productivity,
or zap your ability to focus by creating pools of distracting conversation. As distribution, writing doesn't
happen in one moment or even because of one person. Instead, it happens across many moments and with the
influence of many people. In a rhetorical ecology, there isn't just one audience for writing but many. Writing
would occur across distinct situations that describe how the process of writing is lived, or even how our writing
outlives our unique authorship, getting picked up by other people who revise and repurpose it.

      According to Edbauer, "To say that we are connected is another way of saying that we are never outside the
      networked interconnections of forces, energies, rhetorics, moods, and experiences. In other words our practical
      consciousness is never outside the prior and ongoing structure of feeling that shape the social field."

Rhetorical ecologies highlight the importance of a shared and interactive social field. They demand an
understanding of how certain speech acts, utterances, or writing circulate and proliferate. Similar to biology,
where ecology refers to the relationships between organisms and their environment, rhetorical ecologies
illustrate how words interact with their environment over and over again. Rhetoric from this perspective isn't
static but viral; it has effects beyond what a single author could ever anticipate.

      "The intensity, force, and circulatory range of a rhetoric[al ecology] are always expanding through the mutations
      and new exposures attached to that given rhetoric, much like a virus. ... A rhetoric emerges already infected by
      the viral intensities that are circulating in the social field."

Examples of Rhetorical Ecologies: The Amen Break

The Rhetorical Ecology model means that rhetoric never just occurs within one isolated situation, but evolves
and moves across different situations. This means that rhetoric interacts with other pressing issues or concerns
of the moment. A viral intensity is how topics may be pressing or important at one moment and how those
concerns may transform a given instance of rhetoric from one moment to the next. Below is a clip about the
"Amen break," which explains how a given text moves across situations rather than remaining stationary.
104 | CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION

As the video indicates, although you may not know it, you have likely heard the Amen break in many different
advertisements and musical genres. Rather than occurring in a single situation, the Amen break happens across
different moments that enable it to mean something different in each instance. As an example of a rhetorical
ecology, the message undergoes a significant transformation as it moves from one situation to another; it means
differently because it moves.

Examples of Rhetorical Ecologies: Keep Austin Weird

Let's consider a separate example of the rhetorical ecology that comes directly from Edbauer's article on the
topic. The phrase `Keep Austin Weird!' started in Austin, Texas, with the closure of the Sound Exchange, a
popular record store. Gradually over time, more and more large businesses started entering Austin, including
Urban Outfitters, Barnes and Noble, and Baja Grille, each of which is (or was) a national chain. Two local
businesses, Book People Books and Waterloo Records decided to stand against Austin's stand to give a tax
break to a Borders that was opening across the street from them.

      According to Steve Baroo, the owner of Book People Books: "I was talking to the people of Waterloo Records
      about our struggle to stop the city of Austin from providing incentives to the developer, who planned to put a
      chain book store across the street from our stores. I suggested that we get some bumper stickers that said: `Keep
      Austin Weird,' put both our logos on them and then give them away at our stores. He decided that we should
      buy five-thousand stickers and saw what our customers thought."

The five thousand stickers were so popular that the stores immediately bought another ten thousand and then
twenty-five thousand stickers. Almost a year later, nearly sixty thousand stickers had been distributed. Soon
enough, other Austin businesses joined their call to weirdness. Local businesses began to sell T-shirts with
individual logos on the front and the same `Keep Austin Weird' logo on the back. The phrase `Keep Austin
Weird' quickly passed into the city's general culture and popular circulation. One pledge pitch for a local
public radio station told listeners, "You too can work toward keeping Austin Weird by pledging to keep KOOP
917 FM on the air."
                                                                                                    CHAPTER 5: THE RHETORICAL SITUATION | 105

"Austin Airport, Keep Austin Weird tee shirt" by Lawrence G. Miller, CC BY NC-ND 2.0

In certain parts of Austin, it is nearly impossible to go for very long without finding some display of the slogan
on a T-shirt, bumper sticker, tote bag, mug, or a local businesses billboard vowing to keep it weird. In fact, even
the increasingly popular counter-slogans managed to illustrate a kind of distributed ecological spread of this
rhetoric.

   Appearing on T-shirts and bumper stickers throughout Austin, there is the `Make Austin Normal'
campaign, by a University of Texas business student who wanted to make a point of - and profit from
- the ironic popularity of the "Weird" slogan. "Keep Austin Weird" was also taken up by large,
gentrifying businesses, largely against its original intent. Its uptake by the South By Southwest (SXSW)
Convention and Festival and local politicians indicated that real estate corporate interests co-opted the phrase
interests. Ultimately, the message moved from one situation to the next and changed until eventually its
meaning became antithetical to what it had signified at its inception.

We can even see evidence of this spread in Minnesota in the form of parodic "Keep Minnesota Passive-
Aggressive" slogans. Ultimately Edbauer's case study investigates how `Keep Austin Weird' is distributed
through a rhetorical ecology, one going beyond the traditional boundaries of the rhetorical situation. As
rhetorics and their companion counter-rhetorics move between situations, they respond to, resist, and
transform the message. Sometimes these messages address the original exigence; other times, they deflect
from it. When we set aside the rhetor, audience, exigence, and constraints as the only elements of rhetoric
deserving of attention, we can see how textual movement extends our understanding of where, when, and how
communication happens.

PART 2: REPRESENTATION

To describe rhetorical theory as a function of representation can mean many things. It can mean that rhetorical
theory is the theory of how representations are made, created, or manufactured for popular and public
circulation. It can also mean that rhetorical theory is how we make sense of representations, offering guidance
on how to interpret, decipher, or understand the meanings that circulate around us. In the chapters that fall
under this heading, rhetorical theory is associated with key terms like "symbolic action," "identification" and
"meaning making." As a function of representation, rhetoric also extends beyond speech's spoken and written
media, encompassing theories of the sign and the symbol, forms of arrangement like argument and narrative,
modes of visual presentation, as well as specific spaces of circulation like the public sphere. Representation also
describes rhetoric that enables groups to define their identities, boundaries, and communication practices. The
chapters on counterpublics and Latine rhetoric take this question up, asking how we can rethink rhetoric from
the ground up as a set of representation practices that are specific to a community.
110 | PART 2: REPRESENTATION

Why these Chapters?

Chapters 6-7 depart from theories of rhetoric as speech, suggesting that language itself can shape how we think
about and act in the world by virtue of the representations that are most available for popular consumption.
Rather than intentional choices that a speaker makes to influence an audience, to understand rhetoric as
                                                                                                                           PART 2: REPRESENTATION | 111

inhabiting the field of representation means that the words, symbols, and images that are most available for
our use come pre-loaded with significance, and that by using them, we contribute to an existing field of force-
relations between ourselves and others we perceive to be unlike us. Importantly, symbols (Chapter 6) and
signs (Chapter 7) are not the same! They have different philosophical underpinnings and have been used to
theorize rhetoric in vastly different ways. The key to these chapters is that rhetoric can be speech but also
more than speech, inhabiting the very patters of speaking, writing, and representing that we undertake without
consciously reflecting upon them.

   Chapter 8 offers a way of understanding rhetoric's relationship to arguments -- that is, claims, evidence,
and the connections between them (or warrants). It offers an overview of the way that we might think of
rhetoric and argument at the micro- and macro-levels; that is, as a way of organizing individual sentences or
paragraphs as well as ways of organizing whole essays or even books. Such frameworks are the basis of organized
debate, and provide coordinates not just for making arguments, but for recognizing how others are arranging
information in order to achieve some effect through representation.

   Chapters 9 (by Angela McGowan-Kirsch) and 10 (by Carlos A. Flores and Sarah E. Jones) describe the
predominant way of thinking about the audiences of argument: as publics. The most conventional way of
thinking about the audiences for arguments comes from Jurgen Habermas's conception of "the public
sphere," a spatial metaphor for the way that arguments circulate and become accepted as common knowledge.
As rhetoricians like G. Thomas Goodnight have argued, the public sphere sits alongside two other spheres: the
`technical' and the `personal,' which have their own complex relationship to `the public.' McGowan-Kirsch
elaborates on the public sphere as a space for civic engagement, meaning that rhetoric is a way of employing
representations that make a difference and demonstrate one's stake in the common good. Chapter 10 describes
a critical response to the idea of a singular public sphere: counterpublics, or spaces of resistive activity that stand
apart from the singular (and often exclusionary) norm of `the public.' Offering a range of examples and case
studies, Flores and Jones describe the contingent, flexible, and multiple nature of counterpublics alongside key
definitions of this concept.

   Chapters 11 and 12 expand on the idea that rhetoric need not be only speech -- or, for that matter, rooted
in language, symbols, and arguments. These chapters take on the way that representations are powerful ways
of transmitting cultural knowledge and identity through narrative, the structured stories that are reflective of
a particular experiences with general significance, and visual rhetoric, powerfully influential images that can
include iconic photojournalism, monuments, lightning-rod events, and the enactment of meaning through the
action and movement of bodies. Across these chapters, representation means both how experiences and ideas
are translated from one medium into another and how one's inclusion in the social whole may be registered
through such media.

This chapter covers the concept of the symbol. The first portion of this chapter defines the symbol and presents
several philosophies of language developed in the 20th century by Kenneth Burke, George Herbert Mead, and
Charles Sanders Peirce. Important concepts from these philosophies/philosophers include identification, the
"I" and the "me," and the icon, index, and symbol. The second part of this chapter addresses Burke's framework
of "Rhetoric as Symbolic Action," discussing the terministic screen, the dramatistic pentad, and demagoguery.

Part 1: What are Symbols?

The concept of "the symbol" comes from an ancient Greek word, "symbolon," which is the union of the
words "thrown" and "together." The ancient use of the word "symbol" had an important social function:
they were objects that represented a pact, treaty, or agreement between people and the state. Receiving a
"symbolon" was more than receiving a gift or a token: they indicated the presence of a specific relationship
between an individual and an institution. This chapter continues this line of reasoning by considering the
kinds of relationships created by prominent symbols in the 20th century. This section covers the concept
of identification, different 20th-century theories of the symbol, and continues an ongoing discussion about
dangerous propaganda from the previous chapter.

Kenneth Burke and Identification through Rhetoric

Between 1939 and 1945, Kenneth Burke's theories of identification and symbolic action changed the study of
rhetoric by bringing new attention to the powerful effects of speech. Rhetoric and rhetoricians adopt a new
framework that considers rhetoric to be a mode of symbolic action, in which speech is primarily understood to
unify and divide a mass public. Whereas rhetorical scholarship had previously concerned itself with effective
persuasion, Burke introduces the idea of identification. As persuasion, rhetoric happens in or as a speech and
relies upon the speaker's conscious choices, their historical circumstances, and the timeliness of the moment.
As identification, rhetoric is about influence. It concerns communicating a meaning that reflects something
that the audience shares with the speaker and other listeners.

   In other words, identification is a way of talking about rhetoric as collectivizing, or as creating the audiences
that it addresses. It is about bringing people together using symbols. When we identify with or around a
symbol, we may come to share a similar system of values, assessment of social hierarchy, and rules of
communication. The symbol is how we make not just any meaning but a shared meaning that we all hold
in common. A related concept is consubstantiality, or the creation of sameness or likeness between different
members of a group. Identification is not just about persuading with the right words. It encourages us to think
about groups coming together around a symbol, how it moves the group, and how this symbol comes to mean
something similar for everyone within it.

   X Gonzalez's March 24, 2018 Speech at the "March for Our Lives" Rally. An Example of Identification.
   The speech above offers a good example of identification. The silence that spans the majority of the
recording symbolizes the school shooting that X Gonzalez experienced for the gathered audience. The silence
in this speech creates shared meaning with which this audience may identify. Identification does not happen
all at once, however. Gonzalez begins the speech with the following statement:

      Six minutes and about twenty seconds. In a little over six minutes, seventeen of our friends were taken from us,
      fifteen were injured and everyone, absolutely everyone in the Douglas community was forever altered. Everyone
      who was there understands. Everyone who has been touched by the cold grip of gun violence understands. For
      us, long, tearful, chaotic hours in the scorching afternoon sun were spent not knowing. No one understood
      the extent of what had happened. No one could believe that there were bodies in that building waiting to be
      identified for over a day. No one knew that the people who are missing had stopped breathing long before any
      of us had even known that a code red had been called. No one could comprehend the devastating aftermath or
      how far this would reach or where this would go.
116 | CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL

      For those who still can't comprehend because they refuse to, I'll tell you where it went, right into the ground,
      six feet deep. Six minutes and twenty seconds with an AR-15 and my friend Carmen would never complain to
      me about piano practice. Aaron Feis would never call Kiera Ms. Sunshine. Alex Schachter would never walk
      into school with his brother Ryan. Scott Beigel would never joke around with Cameron at camp. Helen Ramsey
      would never hang out after school with Max. Do you know Montalto would never wave to her friend Liam at
      lunch? Joaquin Oliver would never play basketball with Sam or Dylan. Alaina Petty would never, Carol Lungren
      would never, Chris Hixon would never, Luke Hoyer would never, Martin Duque Anguiano would never. Peter
      Wang would never, Alyssa Alahdeff would never, Jamie Guttenberg would never, Meadow Pollick would never.

At that stage in the speech, Gonzalez pauses for the entire length of time that the students at Stoneman
Douglas had to remain silent while an active shooter was in the building. Gonzalez's silence is uncomfortable
for some listeners, who cheer and make noise as if encouraging them to speak.

      Since the time that I came out here. It has been six minutes and 20 seconds. The shooter has ceased shooting and
      will soon abandon his rifle, blend in with the students as they escape, and walk free for an hour before arrest.
      Fight for your lives before it's someone else's job.

Identification describes the creation of a shared experience around the symbol. In this case, Gonzalez's symbol
is silence. This silence, which disrupted the expectation that they would speak, represents Gonzalez's specific
traumatic past experience, which also lasted six minutes and twenty seconds. Identification is clear in the
discomfort and uncertainty of the audience during this long silence, simulating the disorientation
characteristic of the event itself. Audiences - including its distant viewers on YouTube - come to identify
with X because they come to understand the relationship between the speech and the scenario that the symbol
represents.

   Of course, identification does not always work. When this happens, it is called failed identification: when
a meaning that a speaker wishes to share with a wider audience does not create the intended effect. During
his 2012 US Presidential election campaign, Mitt Romney was widely criticized for using a false accent in his
southern speeches. According to some critics, the former Massachusetts governor and US senator's choice to
use a southern accent was an example of unsuccessful pandering:

                      Mitt Romney's "Grits" Moment. An Example of Failed Identification.
   As Romney's clip illustrates, disingenuous or inauthentic rhetoric may lead to effects of failed or (dis-
)identification. The intent of this kind of speech may be to create an audience that shares the speaker's
                                                                                                                           CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL | 117

understanding and worldview. However, a speaker who chooses symbols that challenge or their
existing ethos also risks distancing themselves from their listeners.

   In review, rhetoric emerges at the beginning of the 20th century as the study of public address, or as, again,
the study of speeches and the systematic way they persuade. But at the same time, there's also a second notion
about rhetoric that is emerging that rhetoric is a mode of identification, that it requires symbols that everyone
interpreting the same way.

The Symbol and the Philosophy of Language

There are two early American philosophers of language who independently develop theories of the symbol.
The first is George Herbert Mead, who coins the phrase symbolic interactionism. The second is Charles
Sanders Peirce, who develops a theory of representation based on the icon, the index, and the symbol.

   George Herbert Mead argues for a fundamental difference between "the I" and "the me" to explain how
social expectations surrounding symbols are created. The "me" is the self that exists in relationship to a
generalized, non-specific other. It is the generic response that I would expect from someone else when I execute
a gesture or say a phrase. If "the me" says "how are you doing?" to a stranger on the street, they might expect
them to say, "I'm fine, how are you?" or "none of your business!" depending on the customary expected
response within that social environment.

   The "I" describes individual reactions inflected with freedom and unpredictability. If "I" wave to someone
on the street, I might (as "the me") expect them to wave back or acknowledge my hello. But the I is all of the
actions that could happen: they could run up to me and confront me or suddenly run in the other direction.
The sense of freedom that is characteristic of "the I" is, in this case, all of the different ways that this other
person interprets my gesture differently or in a way that is opposed to the intention of the symbolic gesture I
used to interact with them.

   A second mid-20th-century philosopher of language who develops a theory of the symbol is Charles Sanders
Peirce (pronounced "purse"). Peirce is the inventor of linguistic pragmatism, in which the meaning of an idea
may be understood as the totality of possible observations about it. According to Peirce, meaning must have
an actual value; it must be taken from empirical observations. This is "value" occurs in one of three registers:
"firstness," "secondness," and "thirdness."

118 | CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL

      Imagine thinking of nothing but the color blue, not thinking about the color or addressing questions about
      the experience. The idea would be to perceive one thing alone. This is Peirce's concept of firstness, the
      contemplation of the essential qualities of something, the color blue. But we cannot purely experienced this
      before some secondness (the sun, the landscape) a quality distinct from the blueness that you first perceived
      enters your consciousness. Perhaps something different or distinct from the original phenomenon, in relation to
      the foreground of background appears as a secondness. Perhaps it could be a sound. It could be another color
      or it might be an object that appears in the midst of that color. [It could be] something in a contrasting color
      that makes it distinguishable, that has characteristics, such as a shape. Finally, Perice recognized that what you
      experience in your mind is thirdness, the mediation of signs that occurs as a mental process of your experiences,
      thoughts or ideas. He called this an interpretant. An interpretant is a being with the potential to interpret signs
      [and who occupies the position of thirdness relative to firstness and secondness]

Signifier, Signified, Referent

Peirce employs three-part distinctions like firstness, secondness, and thirdness throughout his philosophy of
language. One related framework is the distinction between the signifier, the signified, and the referent.
The signifier is the graphic mark before it comes into contact with a specific meaning. It is also called the
`shape' of the word and the sound image. The signified is the meaning of the signifier, or the concept the word
invokes. It is the ideational component of the word or the shared and similar thought that a word conjures for
a person or people. Finally, the referent is the actual, literal object, which exists in the world.
                                                                                                                          CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL | 119

"White House South Lawn" by MCS@flickr is licensed under CC BY 2.0

For example, "the White House": the signifier is the phonemes and sounds that combine to form this phrase.
The signified is what this phrase "means," such as the office of the American presidency that symbolizes
the authority of the executive branch. Finally, the referent is the literal building or structure that exists in
Washington D.C.

Icon, Index, Symbol

A final three-part distinction related to representation is the icon, the index, and the symbol.
120 | CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL

                                              An Icon: Rock Slide Warning Sign

The icon resembles its referent, the literal thing to which it refers. The image of rocks falling is an icon because
the thing it warns us against, rocks falling, is represented as a literal depiction of rocks falling.

  An Index: The 2021 Loma Fire outside of Santa Barbara
                                                                                                                           CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL | 121

The index is associated with a referent by cause or inference. When we see an index, we can deduce what it
means. An image of smoke in the distance means that there is a fire; reasoning rather than a natural resemblance
gives away the meaning of the index.

                                            A Symbol: A Biohazard Sign

Finally, the symbol is related to the referent by convention. The biohazard symbol means that there is radiation
present. However, there is no natural resemblance between a biological hazard (such as radiation) and this
symbol; this danger does not "look like" anything we can easily represent. Additionally, we cannot use
reasoning or deduction to infer that the biohazard symbol means that radiation is present. The symbol does
not, for instance, show what the effects of radiation might be, like the image of smoke. Instead, the symbol
means "radiation" through convention, circulation, and use.

   Here's another example, an image of a bicycle, a skull and crossbones, and the infinity symbol. The bicycle
is an icon because it literally resembles the object. The skull and crossbones are an index because the audience
may infer that consuming the object will lead to death. Finally, the final image, the leviathan cross, is a symbol
because it does not refer specifically or reverentially to an object, and an audience cannot easily infer its
meaning. Although it symbolizes protection and balance, this meaning is only attached to the symbol through
convention and use.
122 | CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL

A tree decorated with several Nazar Boncuk ("bon-juk") medallions

The final example of icon, index, and symbol is the Nazar Boncuk. It is an ornament that hangs in many
homes to ward off the "evil eye"; many of you may have seen it or own them yourselves. It is an important
example because it illustrates how the icon, the index, and the symbol can be part of a single object. It is
an icon because the object resembles an eye. It is an index because, most often, when it is placed in a home, it
hangs above the doorway as a message for guests: someone is always watching, so behave yourself as if you were
being watched. Finally, it also has a symbolic value because its meaning is only learned by convention. When
I grew up with this symbol in my home, I only realized that it was there as a symbol of protection because it
was part of a story that was communicated to me by my family and which is part of a larger cultural tradition
of hanging these symbols in homes. However, just seeing the symbol by itself doesn't necessarily communicate
this shared, well-known meaning.

The last bit of historical context about the symbol that I want to provide is political propaganda in the early
20th century. Propaganda is an important feature of the early 20th century that still lingers with us today.
This time in the United States created a class of professional persuaders whose job was to create symbols and
shared identifications on behalf of corporations and government. Several important figures for the history of
propaganda in the United States are George Creel, Edward Bernays, and Walter Lippmann. Edward Bernays is
widely regarded as one of the founders of the field of public relations.

   (1) George Creel. Seven days after the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Woodrow Wilson
created the Committee on Public Information, a propaganda agency acting to release government news,
sustain morale in the US, administer voluntary press censorship, and develop propaganda abroad. Creel was
named the head of the committee, and he created 37 distinct divisions, most notably the Division of Pictorial
Publicity, the Four Minute Men Division, the News Division, and the Censorship Board.

   The Division of Pictorial Publicity was staffed by hundreds of the nation's most talented artists. They
created over 1000 designs for paintings, posters, cartoons, and sculptures that instilled patriotism, fear, and
interest in the war efforts. Creel himself said that the images were "something that caught even the most
indifferent eye." Between the News Division and Censorship Committee, Creel and the CPI could control
the flow of official war information. Creel sought to portray facts without bias, though most pieces of news
were "colored by nationalistic assumptions." Creel's committee may have produced biased news, but he hoped
that the US could avoid rigid censorship during the war, as Creel's views on censorship were "expression,
not repression." Under Creel's direction, the CPI sought to repress material that contained "dangerous" or
"unfavorable" ideas to avoid demoralizing the population.

(2) Edward Bernays was born in Vienna, Austria. In 1891 Bernays's family moved to New York City.
The nephew of Sigmund Freud, Bernays often consulted his uncle's work. He was the first to incorporate
psychology and other social sciences into PR, yet where Freud sought to uncover motivations, Bernice sought
to mobilize them. Bernie's clients were companies rather than individuals. In one instance, the American
Tobacco Company asked him to expand sales. He responded with a campaign (see below) that marketed
cigarettes as "torches of freedom" and sought to associate tobacco consumption with the women's suffrage
movement.

(3) During World War I Walter Lippmann, an American journalist, became an adviser to Woodrow Wilson
and assisted in drafting Wilson's Fourteen Points speech. He sharply criticized George Creel, whom the
President appointed to head wartime propaganda efforts at the Committee on Public Information. While
he was prepared to curb his liberal instincts because of the war, saying he had "no doctrinaire belief in free
speech," he nonetheless advised Wilson that censorship should "never be entrusted to anyone who is not
himself tolerant, nor to anyone who is unacquainted with the long record of folly which is the history of
suppression."

   Lippmann examined the coverage of newspapers and saw many inaccuracies and other problems. He
and Charles Merz, in a 1920 study entitled A Test of the News, stated that The New York Times' coverage
of the Bolshevik Revolution was biased and inaccurate. In addition to his newspaper column "Today and
Tomorrow," he wrote several books. He was also the first to bring the phrase "cold war" to a common currency
in his 1947 book by the same name.

   Lippman also argued that people, including journalists, are more apt to believe "the pictures in their heads"
than to come to judgment by critical thinking. He wrote that humans condense ideas into symbols, and
journalism, a force quickly becoming the mass media, is an ineffective method of educating the public. Even if
journalists did better jobs of informing the public about important issues, Lippmann believed "the mass of the
reading public is not interested in learning and assimilating the results of accurate investigation."

                                     CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL | 125

Part 2: Rhetoric as Symbolic Action

Symbolic Action describes the construction of social reality through symbols that foster identification. If
rhetoric-as-symbolic action is the expressive human use of symbols, then social reality is the reality that we
perceive through symbols, as well as the rituals, habits, and practices that use symbols. Additionally, symbolic
action must involve identification because symbols allow people to see themselves as a group based on common
interests and characteristics. Groups may also be broken apart using symbols, for instance, by claiming that
some group members hold on to symbols that threaten the whole group's identity. Symbolic action also occurs
in public, out in the open. It means that symbols are leveraged to move people as a group to do things that they
otherwise might not do. Symbols move people because they identify with them -- because they see something
at stake in protecting symbols and see similarity (or difference) in those who cling to them.

   Let's place some firm definitions on this terminology, starting with Symbolic Action.

· Symbolic Action describes the making or construction of social reality through symbols that foster
   identification. It is expressive human action, the rhetorical mobilization of symbols to act in the world.

· Rhetoric is the use of symbolic action by human beings to share ideas, enabling them to work together
   to make decisions about matters of common concern and to construct social reality.

· A rhetor is any person, group, or institution that uses symbolic action.
· A symbol is an arbitrary representation of something else, a word, an image, or an artifact representing a

   thing, concept, or action. Verbal Symbols are symbols found in language, whether spoken or
   written. Visual Symbols are symbols that include pictures, images, objects, recordings, enactments,
   demonstrations, and other collective actions.
· Identification, finally, "is a communicative process through which people are unified into a whole
   based on common interests or characteristics." It is how symbolic action allows a rhetor to connect with
   the audience on a psychological level.

Kenneth Burke's theory of symbolic action revolves around his "definition of man." (see the additional
readings for this week). Although the word "man" is both a dated and imprecise way to say "human,"
Burke's definition is significant because it defines the human in terms of their capacity to use symbols ("the
symbol-using animal"). Burke points out that animals can understand symbols; birds, for example, interact
with symbols regularly. Wrens use food as leverage to goad hatchlings to leave the nest. However, humans
manipulate symbols to advance their own purposes and create social groups, which sets them apart.

   Burke's "definition" has five parts. The first is that humans are symbol-using (and misusing) animals. As
Burke writes,

      "What is our reality for today but all of this clutter of symbols about the past combined with whatever things we
      know mainly through maps, magazines, newspapers, and the like about the present. In school, as they go from
      class to class, students turn from one idiom (like mathematics or chemistry) to another (like Communication
126 | CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL

      Studies or Rhetoric). The various courses in the curriculum are in effect but so many different terminologies.
      And however important to us is the tiny sliver of reality each of us has experienced first-hand, the whole over-all
      `picture' is but a construct of our symbol-systems."

Humans have the capacity to recognize symbols, but they also have the capacity to put them out into the world.
They can use these symbols to destructive ends, and most often, substitute symbols for one another, such that
a new symbol may carry on the work of an older one. The other aspects of this definition are important as well:

  · Inventor of the negative refers to how symbols are exclusive; for example, a group of people may
      gather around a symbol like a religious text or a conspiracy theory while excluding others, making them
      the "negative" of their symbolization.

  · The idea that humans are separated from their natural conditions by instruments of their own
      making symbol-use can delude a people; how we may become `detached' from reality based on the
      stories we elect to read or the news that we choose to watch. It also recalls the famous Clausewitz
      quotation that "diplomacy is war carried out by other means," similarly, language allows for a kind of
      violence that sometimes stands in for acts of physical aggression.

  · Goaded by a spirit of hierarchy refers to the tendency not only to separate other people who are not
      part of our same symbol system or social group but to think of groups in terms of relative importance or
      as more and less deserving of recognition or rights. It describes how humans put some principles, ideas,
      and even people `first' and subordinate others to those in that category.

  · The final part, rotten with perfection, describes how creating these hierarchical and exclusive orders is
      often the opposite of creating a `perfect world.' The idea of American exceptionalism, for instance, that
      America is completely or wholly unlike any other country because it is `perfect' in its ideals can be a way
      to legitimize oppressive laws or violent policing.

That brings us to Martha Solomon's Article on the "rhetoric of dehumanization," which discusses the misuse
of symbols. Using Burke's concepts, Solomon argued that the Tuskegee progress reports, printed in major
medical journals from 1936 to 1973, functioned as "rhetoric of dehumanization" (p. 231). Specifically, the
symbols used in the report show how Black men were treated as less human than the scientists who were
conducting the study. The scientists' "neutral" scientific language normalized inhuman practices of human
testing, resulting in the deaths of patients who doctors never told that they were receiving placebos.

   What was the Tuskegee Project? (from the CDC's webpage documenting the Tuskegee Project) In 1932,
the Public Health Service, working with the Tuskegee Institute, began a study to record the natural history of
syphilis in hopes of justifying treatment programs for Black Americans ... The study initially involved 600 black
men - 399 with syphilis, 201 who did not have the disease. The study was conducted without the benefit of
patients' informed consent. Researchers told the men they were being treated for "bad blood," a local term used
to describe several ailments, including syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. In truth, they did not receive the proper
treatment needed to cure their illness. In exchange for taking part in the study, the men received free medical
                                                                                                                          CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL | 127

exams, free meals, and burial insurance. Although originally projected to last 6 months, the study actually went
on for 40 years. Now that we've established what the article was about and how it is related to the topic of
`symbolic action,' we will return to Solomon's article to show other aspects of symbolic action at work.

The Terministic Screen

The Terministic Screen describes how symbols distort reality or create a partial `lens' to interpret the world.
It is connected to the idea from Burke's "Definition" that symbols create a social reality that may be at odds
with the way that other people perceive it. Burke defines the "terministic screen" using the trio of terms
"reflection," "selection," and "deflection." In his words,

      [Humans] "seek for vocabularies that will be faithful reflections of reality. To this end, they must develop
      vocabularies that are selections of reality. Any selection of reality must, in certain circumstances, function as a
      deflection of reality."

First, language reflects reality or provides a vocabulary that has scope and breadth to account for things that
happen in the world. Language then selects reality, placing a sliver or snapshot of the real world under a
microscope and elevates it to the status of the `whole thing.' Finally, language deflects reality. Humans use
language to discard what doesn't fit within the version of reality they have become accustomed to. Burke's
examples include a color filter on a camera and the interpretation of the `same' dream by psychotherapists who
come from different traditions of dream interpretation. A color filter deepens the yellows, reds, and blues while
also pushing out other wavelengths. A Freudian interpretation of dreams might likely focus on the patient's
parents; a Jungian one on their religion and mythical beliefs.

   Ultimately, the terministic screen is a way that symbols are used to filter our reality. One example is the
"national security state," a framework not just for international relations or the FBI but also for how we
think of and organize our homes. The national security state is built on the idea of surveillance, or watching
-- and that we are somehow safer when there is more watching. The national security state is a terministic
screen because it has become a part of schools, hospitals, cities, and homes. Even "smart home" technology
assumes that intelligence means we can watch everything at once. New parents can take this to new extremes
by putting cameras literally everywhere. That idea -- that when we're watching, helicoptering, surveilling, we
are somehow more intelligent, more in control -- is a terministic screen. Suddenly the national security state
isn't just a way to look at how we pass through airports, but a way to organize our lives.

   In "The Rhetoric of Dehumanization?" Solomon connects the terministic screen and "neutral" scientific
language. According to Solomon,

      [scientific language] is a "way that symbols are used to filter our reality" that "is constituted by terms through
      which humans perceive the world," and "that directs attention away from some interpretations and toward
      others."
128 | CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL

Solomon condemns the dehumanizing characteristics of scientific writing, which often removes the author
from the essay with the passive voice. (This is also why I don't discourage students from writing using
"I," it involves the writer as a participant in the writing process, rather than just as a neutral observer.)
Because the Tuskegee reports "avoided emotionally connotative language," researchers emotionally dissociated
from patients and deflected attention from human suffering, racism, and the possibility of intervention (pp.
237-238, 244).

   The terministic screen of the Tuskeegee report also displays "four features of scientific investigation that
"are accepted almost without question." These include

 1. The scientific method encourages the perceptions of distinctions and the investigation of their
      significance.

 2. Objectivity and detachment are [wanted or needed] characteristics of the people who administered the
      Tuskeegee study,

 3. Science assumes knowledge as a primary value, rather than the wellbeing of the patient, and finally,
 4. The scientific approach is consistent across subject matter areas. These four characteristics were the

      `screen' that allowed the Tuskeegee patients to be dehumanized.

Dramatism

Dramatism is a theory that describes instances of communication as if they were staged as a play or a fictional
human drama. According to Burke, we read and understand the world rhetorically (i.e., as a narrative or theater
performance). We process communicative phenomena through a restricted set of categories that Burke likens
to a stage-act, consisting of a scene, actors/agents, and agency. Dramatism tells us that we are not just symbol-
using animals but story-telling animals who use dramatistic elements in many different ways.

   Dramatism makes two assumptions: First, language is primarily a species of action rather than an instrument
of definition. (i.e., its primary function is NOT denotation or to establish the literal meaning of things).
Second, that the best way to understand human relations and motives is to analyze symbolic action. There are
five elements of dramatism that constitute a "pentad." These include:

 1. The Agent - the person or kind of person who performed the act;
 2. The Act - what took place in thought or deed;
 3. The Agency - how the act was accomplished;
 4. The Scene - the background of the act, the situation in which it occurred;
 5. The Purpose - the justification for the act.

Dramatism is like a detective drama, where the rhetorical critic tries to figure out the motives of the people
who perpetrated the symbolic act. What is most important about this framework is NOT `finding' these five
                                                                                                                          CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL | 129

elements but understanding their relationship to one another. This relationship is what Burke called the ratio.
In a ratio, one is the `container,' and the other is the `thing contained'. The meaning of the second term
depends on the meaning of the first.

  · The scene/act ratio, for instance, requires some explanation of `where' the act happened to explain
      `what' happened. The inventor of anesthesia, for instance, discovered `oxygen' but called it
      "dephlogisticated air." Unless we know something about the historical "scene," this "act" of naming
      would be hard for us to understand.

  · The scene/agent ratio describes how the "who" is over-determined by the "where." We might be
      puzzled by the fact that Brittany Spears has withdrawn from public life and developed increasing
      hostility toward the paparazzi, for instance, until we recognize the larger `scene' in which such actions
      have been set: the fact that she has for years been able to go out in public without confronting a sea of
      microphones, and that she and others have been fighting relentlessly to retain conservatorship of her
      estate. Without that "where," we lack a clear understanding of the "who."

  · The act/agent ratio describes how a person's ethos is over-determined by an act attributed to them. In
      the courtroom, a plaintiff may be symbolized as a `criminal' by repeatedly drawing attention to the "act."
      Alternatively, if you send a friend or colleague a basket of baked goods after hearing that they are having
      a particularly tough day, this act can configure or reconfigure that person's impression of you as a
      person.

In "The Rhetoric of Dehumanization?" Solomon provides several additional examples: the agent/agency and
the agent/scene ratio. In the first case, the AGENT (or "who performed the Tuskegee experiments") explains
the rationale for the AGENCY, or how "the experiments were done." The agents are `noble' doctors pursuing
knowledge, and the "means to an end" are the patients. Doctors dehumanized the patients because they were
only the "agency" for the doctors (the "agents") the means of completing the medical experiment.

   In the second case, dehumanization occurs because the disease is the AGENT and the patients' bodies
become a SCENE. This choice of language is significant because this ratio erases the fact that the doctors were,
in fact, the ones doing harm.

Demagoguery

The last part of this recording is devoted to the topic of Demagoguery, which is exactly the kind of symbolic
action that Kenneth Burke is concerned about when he talks about the "misuse of symbols." A demagogue
is a dangerous speaker who perpetuates conspiracy theories and acts as a political salesperson. They attract an
audience by spreading lies that divide a group of people from another group.

Before World War II, Kenneth Burke was concerned with the rhetoric emerging from Nazi Germany and
saw a similar pattern of thinking and speaking emerging in the United States. Disturbed by what he saw in
Germany, he applied his framework of symbolic action there. He said he identified several key features that
were hallmarks of demagogic speech. These features were used to `constitute' a people using language that
is similarly hateful to the speech that was delivered by the staged demagogue in the clip just shown. The
demagogue encourages "the division of the attention of a people" by focusing on a convenient but phony
scapegoat. He noted specifically the treatment of the Jewish people in Germany. The demagogue also fashioned
themselves like a religious pattern, using patterns like rituals, and made themselves into a paternalistic `father-
like figure who would lead the `feminized' public to salvation. These were above all dangerous characteristics
because they are so easily picked up and used elsewhere. When analyzing the dangerous speech itself, Burke
also came up with the following characteristic progression of ideas.

  · First, Inborn Dignity. This stresses the "natural born" dignity of a group elevated above all others
      while other people are described as innately inferior.

  · Then, the Projection Device. This gesture associates the target audience's problems with a scapegoat.
      If one can attribute their problems to a "cause" outside the self, they can battle an external enemy instead
      of an enemy within.

  · Then, Symbolic Rebirth. Rebirth involved a symbolic change of lineage by voting oneself and the
      members of one's group as different and less-than.

  · Finally, Commercial use. This provides a macroeconomic interpretation of economic problems, such
      that depression/recession is due to the actions of a particular social group rather than to larger structural
      forces.

Demagoguery is still prominent in American culture. Watching this final clip, consider the elements of
demagoguery and how they are played out in "Dwight's Speech" from the popular television show, The
Office. In this clip, Dwight is delivering a speech to North Eastern Salesmen after winning an award. He has
been given a speech that strongly resembles and was adapted from one by Benito Mussolini.
                                                                                                                           CHAPTER 6: THE SYMBOL | 131

In the clip, Dwight quickly runs through Burke's criteria: inborn dignity, a projection device, symbolic rebirth,
and commercial use. He appeals to inborn dignity when he says that North Eastern salesman stand apart from
other people, that they are special and unique because of the difficulty of their work. Next, he appeals to a
projection device when referring to "door-to-door charlatans" and those who would be nasty to salespeople
in principle. He then tells the audience to "unite" in opposition to these ideas, corresponding with "symbolic
rebirth." Finally, he pushes them to the ultimate purpose: more sales, more money, bringing his speech to its
commercial use and application.

This chapter introduces the concepts of representation and the sign. These are counterparts to the theory of the
symbol, and seek to account for the way that language acts both at a given historical moment and across
different moments of time. The first part of this chapter adapts premises developed in the textbook
Representation: Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices, edited by Stuart Hall, Jessica Evans, and
Sean Nixon.

   The first (somewhat longer) section of this chapter addresses representation and the basic components of
the sign, as theorized by Ferdinand de Saussure. It then describes the role of metaphor and engages the idea
that the President (of the United States) functions as a sign for the reading, listening, and viewing public.

Part 1: Signs and Representations

Here is a simple exercise about representation. Look at any familiar object in the room. You will immediately
recognize what it is. But how do you know what the object is? Now try to make yourself conscious of what
you are doing - observe what is going on as you do it. You recognize what it is because your thought processes
decode your visual perception of the object in terms of a concept of it that you have in your head. This must
be so because, if you look away from the object, you can still think about it by conjuring it `in your mind's eye'.

   Now, say what it is. The concept of the object has passed through your mental representation of it to me
via the word for it which you have just used. The word stands for or represents the concept. It can be used
to reference or designate either a `real' object in the world or indeed even some imaginary object, like angels
dancing on the head of a pin. This is how you give meaning to things through language. This is how we
134 | CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN

make sense of the world of people, objects, and events. It is also how you express complex thoughts about
those things to other people in a way they are able to understand. That brings us to our first definition
of representation.

      Definition 1: Representation is the production of the meaning of the concepts in our minds through language.
      It is the link between concepts and language which enables us to refer to either the real world of objects, people
      or events, or to imaginary worlds of fictional objects, people, and events.

      Definition 2: Representation means using language to say something meaningful about (or to represent) the
      world meaningfully, to other people. By this understanding, representation is an essential part of the process by
      which meaning is produced and exchanged between members of a culture.

How does the concept of representation connect meaning and language to culture? We will look at several
theories about how language is used to represent the world.

Approaches to Language and Representation

We will distinguish between three different accounts or theories: (a) the reflective, (b) the intentional, and (c)
the constructionist approaches to representation. In other words:

      Reflective: Does language simply reflect a meaning which already exists out there in the world of objects, people
      and events (reflective)?

In the reflective approach, meaning is thought to lie in the object, person, idea, or event in the real world,
and language functions as a mirror, to reflect the true meaning as it already exists in the world. As Gertrude
Stein once said, "A rose is a rose is a rose." In the fourth century BC, the Greeks used the notion of mimesis to
explain how language, even drawing and painting, mirrored or imitated Nature; they thought of Homer's great
poem, The Iliad, as `imitating' a heroic series of events. So the theory which says that language works by simply
reflecting or imitating the truth that is already there and fixed in the world, is sometimes called `mimetic'.
Language from this point of view is primarily denotative; it indicates the objective status of things.

      Intentional: Does language express only what the speaker or writer or painter wants to say, his or her personally
      intended meaning (intentional)?

The second approach to meaning in representation argues the opposite case. It holds that it is the speaker, the
author, who imposes his or her unique meaning on the world through language. Words mean what the author
intends they should mean. This is the intentional approach. Again, there is some point to this argument since
we all, as individuals, do use language to convey or communicate things that are special or unique to us, to our
way of seeing the world. From this perspective, a speaker controls the intended meaning of their language, and
correspondingly, steers how an audience might see or perceive them.

   However, as a general theory of language, the intentional approach is also flawed. Our words sometimes have
                                                                                                                                CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN | 135

consequences that we do not anticipate. Other times, we can say more than we mean. What, for instance, is the
role of intentions when we translate trauma experienced in one domain of our lives into words that we project
onto other people? We cannot be the sole or unique source of meanings in language, since that would mean
that we could express ourselves in entirely private languages. But the essence of language is communication
and that, in turn, depends on shared linguistic conventions and shared codes. Language can never be wholly a
private game. Our private intended meanings, however personal to us, have to enter into the rules, codes and
conventions of language to be shared and understood. Language is a social system through and through. This
means that our private thoughts have to negotiate with all the other meanings for words or images which have
been stored in language which our use of the language system will inevitably trigger into action.

      Constructionist: Or is meaning constructed in and through language (constructionist)? What kind of
      constructions are at play?

The third approach recognizes this public, social character of language. It acknowledges that neither things
in themselves nor the individual users of language can fix meaning in language. Things don't mean: we
construct meaning, using representational systems - concepts and signs. Hence it is called the constructivist
or constructionist approach to meaning in language. According to this approach, we must not confuse
the material world, where things and people exist, and the symbolic practices and processes through which
representation, meaning, and language operate. Constructivists do not deny the existence of the material
world. However, it is not the material world that conveys meaning: it is the language system or whatever system
we are using to represent our concepts. It is social actors who use the conceptual systems of their culture and
the linguistic and other representational systems to construct meaning, to make the world meaningful, and to
communicate about that world meaningfully to others.

   Additionally, there may be several different kinds of constructions that are at play in a given instance of
representation. One kind of representational construction is semiotic, which is based on language and shared
meaning-making. Another kind of representational construction is discursive, which is a manifestation
of power being exercised. Consider the clip below. Are the representations conjured by words like "freedom"
and "terror" semiotic, discursive, or both?

                            George W. Bush's 2001 Declaration of the "War on Terror"
   The above clip from 2001 shows George W. Bush declaring "the war on terror" which initiated America's
21st-century interventions in Afghanistan. Bush reuses words like "freedom" and "terror" over and over to
create a web of representations and language that support the idea of an emergency or imminent threat. The
136 | CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN

argument that words construct our lived realities is brought to life here because Bush's speeches constituted a
reality of actual and ongoing warfare, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people and a
failed search for weapons of mass destruction. The representations conjured through this language created an
impression of threat, danger, and fear. In turn, these representations produced a social reality that authorized
an "endless" war.

Ferdinand de Saussure's Theory of the Sign

Representations create a shared conceptual map for a body of people to use symbols to refer to similar ideas
which are held in common. This shared conceptual map must be translated into a common language so that we
can correlate our concepts and ideas with certain written words, spoken sounds or visual images. The general
term we use for words, sounds or images which carry meaning is signs. These signs stand for or represent the
concepts and the conceptual relations between them which we carry around in our heads and together they
make up the meaning-systems of our culture.

   The theory of the sign is most often attributed to the work and influence of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de
Saussure. Saussure. who was born in Geneva in 1857, did much of his work in Paris, and died in 1913. For our
purposes, he is important for his general view of representation and the way his model of language shaped the
semiotic approach to the problem of representation in a wide variety of cultural fields.

      The production of meaning depends on language. As [Saussure] writes, `Language is a system of signs.' Sounds,
      images, written words, paintings, photographs, etc. function as signs within language `only when they serve to
      express or communicate ideas ... [To] communicate ideas, they must be part of a system of conventions ...."
      (Culler 1976, p. 19)

In an important move, Saussure divides the sign into two elements.
   First, there is the "concept" or "meaning" of the sign; a shared idea. This is the signified. Every time your

read, hear, or see "poodle," it correlates to the concept of a floofy dog.
                                                                                            CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN | 137

              The referent: the thing-in-the-world, a delightful poodle

Second, there is the signifier: the form or sound-image (the actual word, image, photo, etc.) that consists of the
different sounds that combine to create a word (P-O-O-D-L-E). can also be an image, such as the one shown
below. The signifier is the material dimension of the sign. It may consist of the actual sounds we make with
our vocal cords, the images made with cameras, the marks we use to write words or paint on canvas, or digital
1s and 0s we transmit electronically.

   In his original diagram of the sign, Saussure places the signified over the signifier and separates them with
a bar. This bar is meant to illustrate that the signifier (or sound-image) is only associated with the signified
(or the implied concept) by convention. There is no necessary relationship between them. The bar is a visual
reminder that a signifier (a word or series of sounds) may come to mean something different. Across or at a
precise moment in time, a signifier may have different signifieds. Saussure also encloses the sign in an ellipse.
This ellipse illustrates how the signifier and signified appear as if they are fixed. If I say the word "tree," the
meaning (a leafy living organism) seems as though it is permanently attached to this word. However, the sign
illustrates that this association is only ever temporary at best.
140 | CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN

Saussure's original diagram of the sign. Saussure places the "signified" (or concept) above the "signifier" (or
sound image)

Both the signifier and the signified are required to produce meaning, but it is the relation between them, fixed
by our cultural and linguistic codes, that sustains representation. The sign is the union of the signifier and
the signified. Although we can talk about them as if they were distinct or separate entities, they only exist as
components of the sign, which is the central fact of language.

   He also introduces a distinction between the "diachronic" and "synchronic" axes of language.
   The diachronic refers to the transformation of signs over time. This is represented by the "vertical" (y) axis
in the figure below. It is the time during which a language transforms and evolves. The diachronic axis draws
attention to the sign's meaning for all time. It describes the distinct associations of signifiers and signifieds
across time and traces a path between them. As a given signifier acquires and sheds distinct signifieds, it may
remain in use but with new meanings, uses, and effects across history.
   The synchronic refers to "horizontal" or immediate time in which the sign exists. It is the "horizontal" (x)
axis that refers to the individual synchronic snapshots of language's meaning. These are the individual moments
in time where the meaning of signs appears stable, natural, and normal. The synchronic dimension of language
isolates the meaning of the sign as a relationship to other, related signs in a specific and historically defined
instance. The synchronic meaning of the sign is what it means at a particular moment in time, and not what it
means for `all time'.
                                                                                                                                CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN | 141

              The synchronic and diachronic axes of language

Consider, for example, how many words there have been since the 1990s to describe the aversive emotional
impact of the digital age: people have accused the age of the internet of causing information overload, the too-
much-information effect (now just `TMI'), information anxiety, and (most offensively, but nonetheless a real
term that was once used) infobesity. Each of these invokes a similar concept, anxiety at the quantity of
information that is out there because of the internet. But the sign is arbitrary because in each case it is attached
to a different signifier.

      "Each language produce a different set of signifiers, articulating and dividing the continuum of sound (or
      writing or drawing or photography) in a distinctive way ... each language also produces a different set
      of signifieds; it has a distinctive and thus arbitrary way of organizing the world into concepts and categories"
      (Culler, 1976, p. 23).

The language system that is the raw material of signs is used here in a very broad sense. Cultural norms of
pronunciation and signification make Spanish, Swedish, Basque, Turkish, and English `languages'. However,
photographs, cinema, and medical imaging (e.g. x-rays), all possess their own unique "languages" as well.
142 | CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN

Similarly, we might say that mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, and biology share similar
"languages." Other, less academic genres share a "language" that is not `linguistic' in any ordinary sense. For
example, the `language' of facial expressions or of gesture, the `language' of fashion, of clothes, or of traffic
lights. Music is a `language', with complex relations between different sounds and chords. When this language
represents a meaning for a subject, it becomes a sign.

   Saussure divided language into two parts. He called the underlying rule-governed structure of language,
which enables us to produce well-formed sentences, the langue (the language system). This consisted of the
general rules and codes of the linguistic system, which all its users must share if it is to be of use as a means
of communication. The rules are the principles that we learn when we learn a language and they enable us to
use language to say whatever we want. For example, in English, the preferred word order is subject-verb-object
(`the cat sat on the mat'), whereas, in Latin, the verb usually comes at the end. For Saussure, the underlying
structure of rules and codes (langue) was the social part of language, the part which could be studied with the
law-like precision of science because of its closed, limited nature. It was his preference for studying language at
this level of its `deep structure' which makes Saussure's model of language structuralist.

      `La langue is the system of language, the language as a system of forms' (Culler, 1976, p. 29).

The second part consisted of the particular acts of speaking or writing or drawing, which -- using the structure
and rules of the langue - are produced by an actual speaker or writer. He called this parole. The second part
of language, the individual speech-act or utterance (parole), he regarded as the `surface' of language. There was
an infinite number of such possible utterances. Hence, parole inevitably lacked those structural properties --
forming a closed and limited set -- which would have enabled us to study it `scientifically'.

      "Parole is actual speech [or writing], the speech acts which are made possible by the language" (Culler, 1976, p.
      29)

Perhaps the most important aspect of the sign's use in language is that the meaning of the sign is always
determined differentially. That means that The meaning of the sign is fixed based on the relative meanings
of the other signifier/signifier combinations that exist relative to it at a given moment in time. For example,
the meaning of "panther" is stabilized, for instance, by signs like "cat," "lion," "feline," and "ocelot." But
it is also stabilized by its relationship to other signs like "Wakanda," "Fred Hampton," "Kwame Ture," and
"COINTELPRO." The meaning of a sign depends on other, related signs. The difference between signs
ultimately determines many of the concepts we share in common.

   Ultimately, language is a social phenomenon. It cannot be an individual matter because we cannot make
up the rules of language individually, for ourselves. Their source lies in society, in the culture, in our shared
cultural codes, in the language system - not in nature or in the individual subject.
                                                   CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN | 143

Metaphor Transfers Meaning between Signs

Metaphor describes a relationship between signs. It fits with our discussion because it supports the
constructivist view of representation. We experience reality through the language our shared language
community uses. Metaphor is part of our basic capacity to construct this reality. It allows us to focus on certain
aspects of reality while avoiding others. And different metaphors can depict and transform the *same* reality,
so that two people can look at, read, or hear the same thing and come away with a different interpretation of
reality.

   The word "metaphor" is older than the theory of the sign and is often attributed to Aristotle, who mentions
it explicitly in the Rhetoric. In Greek, it is the composite of meta (over) and phereas (to carry). It can be defined
as a figure of speech in which two dissimilar things are said to be similar, offering a new perspective on a known
issue. Metaphor provides "perspective" by activating a range of cognitive associations. Metaphors are "Non-
literal comparisons in which a word or phrase from one domain of experience is applied to another domain."
Most importantly, they transfer the characteristics of one object (a vehicle) onto a second object (the tenor).

   For example, if I were to say "my roommate is a pig!," pig (sign 2) would be the vehicle because I am
attempting to transfer characteristics of `pig-ness' onto them. My roommate is the tenor (sign 1) because they
are the literal person, subject, or topic that I am trying to describe.

The social construction aspect of metaphors enters the picture when we habitually or even unconsciously
begin to use metaphors that texture our reality. We could think, for instance, of how often we describe social or
professional situations in terms of implied violence or hostility, thereby setting the expectation and reflecting
the reality that our social and work lives are violent. When life is war, we conceive of aspects of our reality
in warlike terms. "They attacked my argument" or "I shot down her point" are ways of imagining oneself as a
speech-combatant in which the other person is the enemy. When debates or arguments are battles, then they
are framed implicitly as things to be won and lost, rather than spaces for shared understanding. If for instance,
we moved to metaphors where arguments were a dance, then this vehicle would allow us to instead imagine
144 | CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN

ourselves as partners who are practicing for the purposes of collaboration. This is also the direct tie-in to Part
2 of this recording by Dr. Belinda Stillion Southard. Dr. Stillion Southard argues that it is possible to change
beliefs by changing language and that the metaphors we use directly guide the values that we support.

   As a final example of metaphor, the above clip displays John Mulaney's "Horse in the Hospital" sketch. The
"horse" is the vehicle for an extended metaphor. Although he doesn't explicitly name his tenor, you will likely
be able to deduce it. As John Mulaney notes at the beginning of the clip, the President represents a larger body
of people and values. In other words, the President is a signifier for a shared set of public meanings. Once
you've watched the clip, let's turn to Anne Norton's chapter, "The President as Sign."

The President as Sign

Norton makes the point that Americans are so extensively wedded to the idea of representation that it would
be nearly impossible to think of our culture without the many ways that Americans represent themselves to
themselves:

      Americans represent themselves in public documents and private letters, diplomas and diaries. In education,
      institutions, and the mundane practices of everyday life, Americans read and write themselves (as they read and
      write their nation) into being. This self-conscious being in language does not replace being in the flesh. The
      constraints of the body are partially evaded, but the needs and desires of the body are enhanced and elaborated
      in writing and in these written selves. (Anne Norton, "The President as Sign" in Republic of Signs, p.3)

All of these are "signs," documents, letters, diplomas, diaries, reading, writing, and bodies are sites of
representation, of meaning-making. To that end, the president is a very good example of the theory of the `sign'
in practice. The President represents a lot: "the nation, the government, the executive branch." The President
is assumed to represent the nation to itself in many ways.

      "The embodiment of the presidency enables the President to present an image of the people to itself: singular,
      united, with a common material form and a single will." (p. 121)

On the one hand, as the elected "representative" of the people, the President often seems to stand in for the
popular will, even if they do not win the popular vote. The character of the President is understood to reflect
the character of the voting public. The policies of the President reflect the values of their electors and the vision
                                                                                                                                CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN | 145

of the future they would like to see. The President also represents the nation when they engage with other
leaders abroad, where they strive to erase the idea that there are many `meanings' competing for attention and
publicity in the United States. The fact that the President cannot represent "everything" but must represent
"something" is precisely what makes them a sign; their body and individuality act as the material support
for a multiplicity of meanings competing for national attention and accountability. That responsibility is, in
the words of philosopher Jacques Derrida, both necessary and impossible. It is necessary because governing
to benefit the widest population possible. It is impossible because the interests of the population appear to
conflict, because the interest of some is to be against governance, or because some interests are refused. That is
also why it is so important that the person elected be capable of understanding the obligation of the position
to the public.

   Using Ronald Reagan and Franklin Delano Roosevelt as examples, Norton demonstrates the "variety of
representative strategies made available to Presidents through the interplay of signifier and signified in the sign"
(93), and revealing the complex history of personality traits and circumstance that help shape presidential
history.

Roosevelt, whose mobility was limited due to polio, took office during the Great Depression. His prominent
disability was analogous to the hardship the entire nation faced, and when he spoke of national recovery he
could therefore be trusted. When the United States eventually emerged from the Great Depression, Roosevelt
garnered comparisons to Lincoln, as the nation's second savior. The President's sick body -- and his ability
to apparently overcome it -- was a sign of the nation's economic sickness, and the chutzpah it would need to
overcome it, albeit in a deeply ableist way.

      Roosevelt could be recognized as a representative without recourse to that faith in abstractions that the collapse
      of central economic significations had undermined. The multiple referents Roosevelt entailed as signifier played
      a crucial role in determining the meaning of his presidency. The nation was economically paralyzed. Roosevelt
      was paralyzed. But Roosevelt came from a family of great wealth, power, and prestige. He possessed these
      himself. This apparent contradiction. in Roosevelt as signifier enabled him to simultaneously represent and
      subvert the image of the nation as paralyzed and impotent. (p.106)

Reagan's authority and reputation as president in part derived from his career in acting. Though he had not
served in actual combat, he had portrayed it on screen, lending credibility to his calls for military action.
Reagan's self-aggrandizing bears resemblance to the boasting of Davy Crockett, frontiersman turned
congressman. Reagan's own boasting alludes to this history of the mythic Westerner, explaining the personal
146 | CHAPTER 7: THE SIGN

exceptionalism that allowed him to transcend from actor to president. As President, Reagan's own "personal
exceptionalism" became an "American exceptionalism," an idea that America is beholden to no one and
nothing, creating tremendous national debts while rallying his voters in the name of white and evangelical
values. Consider the following advertisement, which presents a famous example of "American exceptionalism"
as nostalgia for a version of American life which, for many, has never existed:

                         Reagan's 1984 "Morning in America" Campaign Advertisement
   As Reagan and Roosevelt illustrate, the office of the presidency holds meaning as a result of those who have
previously held office, personality traits, and simultaneous political contexts. This is made possible as a result
of the president's visibility to the public, as the president is seen by the public they are able to see themselves
reflected in the president "singular, united, with a common material form and a single will" (121). That is why
the president is a sign: different versions and visions of a "whole" of the people, the "whole" of the nation.
   One of the last points that Norton makes is about Richard Nixon and the way that the Watergate
controversy changed the character of the president-as-sign. One of the things that are at least as true today as
it was during the Watergate scandal is that the people are subjected to power as a function of sight. As Norton
writes,

      Those who watched the Watergate hearings saw those who held power brought unwillingly into the public
      eye. They saw them subjected to the gaze, their actions, their words, their secrets revealed. All who watched
      participated directly in this exercise of the power of surveillance' a power they held collectively. Those who
      watched knew that they watched with their compatriots. They knew that their watching was a sign and an
      exercise of a power held (as it was then exercised) collectively. The President, the President's men' and the
      congressional committee came under the watching eye of the people.

In the following clip from the film Frost/Nixon, which depicts a famous series of post-presidential interviews
with Richard Nixon, you can see how Nixon moves from being the "watcher" to being "the watched":

ARGUMENTATION

"General Assembly" by hmerinomx, CC BY-SA 2.0

This chapter is about rhetoric and argumentation and is divided into three sections. The first introduces
key terminology related to "argumentation" including syllogism and enthymeme, Monroe's Motivated
Sequence, presumption and burden of proof, and audiences of argument. The second section
introduces the Toulmin Model. Whereas the Toulmin Model focuses on the structure of individual claims,
the third section of the chapter introduces the Logical Dependency model, which may be used to scaffold
an entire speech or essay. This section also discusses fallacies or the characteristic errors of argumentative
reasoning.

This first section is about key terms for argument. This will include two definitions of argument and how
they relate to the terms fact, value, and policy. It means we're gonna be talking about structures of argument
including the syllogism and the enthymeme as well as Alan Monroe's motivated sequence. We're gonna
be talking also about presumption, the burden of proof, kinds of argument-audience, and spaces of
argument. These describe the audiences for whom arguments circulate and the places or the locations where
arguments may be found.

Defining Argument

In the above clip, Kelly Kapoor (played by Mindy Kaling) invents a distinction between two different kinds
of argument: trash talk and smack talk. Trash talk is hypothetical and doesn't describe a real-world situation.
Smack talk is happening right now because the evidence is in front of us. The example resembles
argumentation because a major way that arguments are built is by drawing divisions or distinctions. Generally,
we should also think of argumentation as a practice of reason-giving in which a speaker provides reasons to
support a given claim. We can also think of arguments in two additional ways: as things and as relationships.

Arguments as Things

When we talk about arguments as things, we're talking about speech that we exchange between different
participants in an argument. And one person presents a claim and then supports it with evidence to gain assent
to the claim or to get other people to believe that the claim is true. We've already thought about arguments
as things all the way back in Chapter 1. There, we drew upon Aristotle's three rhetorical genres: forensic,
epideictic, and deliberative.

  · Fact-based claims are forensic because they are concerned with what is and isn't the case, and prove the
      truth or falsehood of a claim. These are also known as arguments that fall within the forensic genre of
      rhetoric.

  · Value-based claims are epideictic because they either praise or blame. These are also known as
      arguments that fall within the epideictic genre of rhetoric.

  · Policy claims are deliberative because they are concerned with what we should or shouldn't do as a
      course of future action. These are also known as arguments that fall within the deliberative genre of
      rhetoric.

When we talk about arguments as things, we're talking about speech that we exchange with one another as well
as discrete claims that we make about the true and the false (forensic), praise and blame (epideictic), and what
we either should or should not pursue as a course of action (deliberative).
152 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

Arguments as Relationships

When we think about arguments as forms of interaction, we're thinking about how people interact.
Argument-based relationships are modulated by three factors: culture, ritual, and learning.

  · A cultural context exercises a strong influence over the kinds of relationships created by argument. In
      some contexts, arguments are thought of as "heated disputes," which leads people to avoid arguing at all
      costs. In others, arguments are a routine part of group interactions and are part of normal social
      behavior. Different cultural contexts for argument define different rules for when and how arguments
      can be made. Often, departing from one's family or familiar home environment challenges these rules. A
      person who goes to a department store and attempts to negotiate the price of the items there may be
      more familiar with a cultural context in which arguments are part of buying and selling rituals.

  · Rituals of argument may also define distinct kinds of relationships. Families, courts of law, and
      graduate school each create unique rituals around argument: whether or not to allow them, when to
      accept them, and how they should be made. Often, arguments are ritualistically made in self-defense or
      in support of candidates for jobs. The defining feature for such rituals is that arguments are made in a
      consistent way and that participating in them is part of defining oneself as a member of a larger group.

  · Learning is a final way that relationships develop around arguments. One circumstance in which
      arguments are leveraged is an educational setting, in which people have the opportunity to test claims
      and arrive at well-thought-out conclusions. Whether through the classroom or the process of peer
      review, different arguers engage with one another in order to facilitate a greater common interest. When
      experts or authorities make arguments, we also learn how to make claims. When we see someone on
      television using an argument that connects rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to global warming,
      we may learn how to make similar claims. Using arguments and warrants makes them more available to
      others.

Syllogisms and Enthymeme

When we think about arguments as things, most often we are thinking of them as structures or organizations of
information that allow us to convey an argument to someone else. The earliest forms or structures of argument
that allow us to think of an argument as things are the syllogism and the enthymeme.

   The syllogism is long-form logical reasoning. A way of reasoning that first developed in philosophy in which
a statement is offered, a second statement is offered, and a conclusion is provided that is a permutation of these
two statements. Syllogisms are statements in which a conclusion is inferred from the truth of two premises.

  · Major premise: all pandas are mortal
  · Minor premise: John is a Panda
                               CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 153

· Conclusion: John is mortal.

Characteristically, with syllogisms all work is shown, you can see all of the steps taken. The enthymeme is a
similar form of reason, but unlike the syllogism, some element is left out for the audience to fill-in. By leaving
some part of the argument out, what this allows is rhetorical persuasion or the feeling that the audience is "in"
in the act of logical reasoning. Instead, the audience's inference supplies a missing premise, allowing persuasion
to occur in the mind of the audience.

The 1990s ad Be Like Mike featured Michael Jordan for instance drinking copious amounts of Gatorade,
followed by the sign "Be Like Mike" that aired at the very end. What the audience would fill in is the idea that
drinking Gatorade would allow them to "be like Mike."

For many watchers/listeners, the tri-tone jingle of this advertisement is instantly recognizable. The number
they provide (like 867-5309) is embedded in the memory of MILLIONS and the company name functions like
a punchline to the tune. This resembles the enthymeme because the audience is part of the persuasion. They
participate in the message because they are "in" on the reasoning of the advertisement.

Alan Monroe's Motivated Sequence

A related way of structuring arguments comes to us from Alan Monroe who in the 1950s developed a
sequence of arguments that allowed salespeople to put their products on display in an easy and accessible
manner. Monroe's motivated sequence lives on today because we can see it in patterns of speech that appear on
television advertisements. It has the following steps:

  · Attention: A flashy opening, something that takes the audience by surprise or gets them to tune in.
154 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

  · Need: Establish that the audience needs something or that something is lacking from their lives.
  · Satisfaction: Satisfy the need with a product. Presumably, this consists in an explanation of how the

      product fills the need.
  · Visualization: Allow the audience to see how their lives would be changed or different by acquiring the

      product.
  · Call to action: Specific steps or instructions to take to acquire this new magical thing that was going to

      transform everything.

Here are two classic examples:

In the second ad, the late Billy Mays first gets our attention with his signature self-introduction. He then
establishes a need: tough-to-clean stains. The solution that satisfies this need? Oxi-Clean, which cleans,
brightens, and eliminates odors all at once. Mays then provides a range of visualizations to allow the viewer
to envision how they would use this product. In conclusion, Mays provides the call to action: to purchase Oxi-
Clean, presumably at an all-time low price. This sequence, the syllogism, and the enthymeme are arguments as
things. They are discernable structures people have used to leverage claims, exchange capital, and gain others'
attention.

Presumption and the Burden of Proof

Presumption and the burden of proof describe distinct obligations or the responsibilities given to arguers
who engage in a debate. In debates, arguers typically take on one of two roles: the affirmative (who proposes
a policy) and a negative (who defends the status quo). Alternatively, in a forensic, courtroom setting, these
arguers either take the role of the plaintiff (the accuser who brings forth a case) or the defendant (the accused
who defends against this case). They are usually oppositional in nature and so they have different roles or
different tasks that they have to fulfill.
                                                                                            CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 155

   The affirmative and the defendant share the characteristic of presumption. Presumption means that we
should believe that a given set of facts or information is true unless proven otherwise. A defendant in a
courtroom should have the presumption of innocence, which means that we would presume that what
they say is true unless contravening evidence arises. Likewise, for the affirmative in a debate, there is often
a presumption that their plan will work unless the negative proves otherwise.

   The companion to presumption is the burden of proof, which traditionally belongs to the person in a debate
who brings forth the charges: the plaintiff and the negative. The role of a negative in a policy case is to generate
uncertainty about the affirmative, to prove that their case will not work as planned, or that their evidence rests
on shaky ground. As the plaintiff in a court case, you would have the responsibility to offer reasons that would
overcome the defendant's presumption, thereby casting significant doubt upon it. However, not all burdens of
proof are the same, as illustrated by this video on the distinction between criminal and civil courtroom trials:

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=178#oembed-6

Presumption and the burden of proof, therefore, describe two different roles and responsibilities given to the
participants in the debate: one of them is the affirmative/defendant who is given presumption, and the other is
the negative/plaintiff, who receives the burden of proof.

The Audiences of Argument

The audiences of an argument can be divided into two categories: the universal and the particular audience.
These concepts answer the question: "to whom is an argument addressed"?

   The universal audience is the audience of all reasoning, beings, and humanity. If everyone were presumed
to be rational, capable of reasoning, then the universal audience would be the audience to whom this message
was addressed. In other words, if we needed to get emergency information to COVID-19 out to the public, it
would be addressed to a presumed universal audience: all people who are capable of reasoning or all people who
are capable of taking in a message. Likewise, when we dispose of nuclear waste, it has become a problem for
scientists to develop messaging that wouldn't just last for ten years or twenty years, but hundreds or thousands
of years into the future. Making them imagine a universal audience for whom a single message would still
be intelligible. The question is, what would it take to communicate with all of humanity? How would it be
possible to create a message that would be available to literally everyone?

   The particular audience is the actual audience we engage in the real world. Particular audiences are varied
and have their own dispositions, judgments, values, attitudes, opinions, rituals, and traditions. Particular
156 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

audiences remind us that it is not possible to just send one message to all people and expect the same response
or reasoning. Particular audiences require arguers to tailor their messages. Just as you would not send one letter
to every potential future employer, a particular audience is a "someone" rather than an "everyone," they must
be addressed with a message specifically for them, rather than with one message that you're sending out to the
public.

Spheres of Argument

The spheres of argument describe the places where it is that arguments can be found. From smallest to largest,
the personal, the technical, and then the public are the places where these arguments circulate.
                                                                                            CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 157

G. Thomas Goodnight, "The Personal, Technical and Public Spheres of Argument: A Speculative Inquiry into
the Art of Public Deliberation," Journal of the American Forensic Association 18 (1982): 106-119. 1.
"Argumentative endeavors involve the creative resolution and the resolute creation of uncertainty." 2.
"Particular arguments emerge in concert with or opposition to ongoing activity in the [three] spheres." 3.
"Argument practices arising from the personal and technical spheres substitute the semblance of
deliberative discourse for actual deliberation, thereby diminishing public life."

  · The personal sphere is the place of limited circulation and informal reasoning. Meaning people aren't
      using syllogisms, they are using enthymemes more often than not, and the arguments that are made are
      intuitive to the people that belong to that personal sphere. The participants are ley participants, are non-
      experts, and so the concerns of this community largely regard the members of that community. It is the
      place where the most informal arguments occur among a small number of people, involving limited
158 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

      demands of proof, and are often about private topics.
  · The technical sphere, by contrast, has expert participants who use formal reasoning and the

      participants in this sphere can vet each other's arguments because they all belong to the same shared
      community. However, like the personal sphere, the arguments that circulate in this sphere have limited
      circulation. It is an argument sphere that has explicit rules for argument and is judged by those with
      specific expertise in the subject.
  · Finally, the public sphere is the largest or widest sphere of argument circulation. In terms of the other
      terms we've just discussed, it is most like the universal audience. It is the argument sphere that exists to
      handle disagreements transcending personal and technical disputes. When arguments escape the
      personal sphere or escape the technical sphere, they go into the public sphere where they can be
      interpreted, misinterpreted, and negotiated. Twitter is a good (albeit small) example of a public sphere
      because of the way that personal disputes or technical information can escape and then become part of a
      larger discussion (although, of course, that doesn't always happen and sometimes arguments also stay in
      their respective spheres).

Part 2: The Toulmin Model

The Toulmin Model has several specific features:

  · First, it imagines arguments as objects of verbal exchange. This places it into the category of arguments
      as things, discussed in the previous lecture--or as objects that are transacted between arguers.

  · Second, the Toulmin Model is useful for individual claims that you would set out to prove in a
      paragraph or less. When thinking about how to apply the Toulmin Model to your own writing, this
      would be a way of organizing individual paragraphs or sentences, rather than a way of thinking about
      how to build out the structure of an essay as a whole. (We'll talk more about how essay argument
      scaffolding is better understood in terms of the logical dependency model in the next major section).

  · Finally, the Toulmin Model is a way to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of individual arguments.
      For example, if the evidence is not sufficient in a given argument or if the reasoning is not strong, the
      Toulmin Model points to these elements as specific ways to address the weakness of arguments.

The Toulmin Model has six components. The primary elements are the claim, the data (or evidence) and
the warrant (or reasoning). A claim is a contestable statement based on the data/evidence. The warrant is the
logical connection between the data and the claim. The secondary elements are the qualifier, the rebuttal, and
the backing. The qualifier softens the claim by making it conditional. The rebuttal offers likely
counterarguments to the major claim. And the backing is evidence that the warrant is itself sound. The images
                                                                                            CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 159

below shows the full Toulmin Model, including all six of its separate elements, as well as an example drawn
from Colin Powell's 2003 speech to the United Nations.
160 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION
                                                                                             CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 161

Data, Claim, Warrant

The most fundamental part of the Toulmin Model is the warrant, the data, and the claim. All claims require
data. The previous section discussed three kinds of claims: fact, value, and policy. The three parts of the
Toulmin Model may be phrased in the following way: on the basis of this information (the data), you should
reach this conclusion (the claim) if you use this logical reasoning or connection (the warrant). For example:
162 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

One of Toulmin's own examples

This claim is connected to data by way of a logical warrant. In this case, the data or the evidence is that
Russia has violated fifty of fifty-two international agreements. Because of this information, we should conclude
that Russia would violate a proposed ban on nuclear weapons testing that we are considering right now. The
connection between these two elements is the following warrant; that the past is a predictor of the future. Since
past violations are symptomatic of probable future violations, we can assume that the claim is true. All of these
elements taken together would read in the following way:

      On the basis of the information that Russia has violated fifty of fifty-two existing international agreements, we
      should conclude that Russia would violate the proposed ban on nuclear weapons testing. We should reach this
      conclusion using the reasoning that past violations are symptomatic of probable future violations.

In the real world, it's important to note that warrants often go unstated. They're usually assumed, or the logical
connection between the data and the claim simply is not set out correctly.

Backing, Qualifier, Rebuttal

The secondary elements of the Toulmin Model are the backing, the qualifier, and the rebuttal.
                                                                                            CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 163

Toulmin, Stephen E.. The Uses of Argument. United Kingdom, Cambridge University Press, 2003, pg.97.

  · The backing refers to the support for the warrant. It describes the assurance that the warrant is
      authoritative or current. We can know for instance that the past isn't just true for Russian treaty
      agreements, it's true under other circumstances as well.

  · The qualifier is a statement that reduces the strength of the claim. It indicates the strength conferred by
      the warrant, and claims can be qualified with terms like usually, possibly, likely, in all probability,
      presumably, and always. The qualifier specifically reduces the strength of the claim that we've been
      considering by making it conditional or probabilistic.

  · The rebuttal is a counterargument that invalidates the claim. This counterargument might be certain
      circumstances in which the general authority of a warrant should be set aside. If for instance, there has
      never been a historical precedent for what we're up against today, the past might not be a good predictor
      of the future.

If we think about all of these different elements working together, using the example through the previous
slide, it might look something like this.

      On the basis of the evidence that Russia has violated fifty out of fifty-two of its past agreements, we should
      conclude it would violate the treaty that is in front of it right now. This is good reasoning because we know the
164 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

      past is a good predictor of the future. We know that the past is the predictor of the future because there are many
      other instances of history repeating itself. Of course, it is possible that Russia might not violate the treaty, but if
      so, this would only be the third time that Russia would have complied with an international agreement.

      Because Harry was born in Bermuda, we can conclude that Harry is a British subject, since a person born in
      Bermuda will generally be a British subject. Moreover, we can know that a person born in Bermuda will generally
      be a British subject on account of existing statutes and other legal provisions. So presumably, Harry is a British
      subject, unless, of course, both his parents were aliens or he has become a naturalized American.

Next, let's consider warrants more closely. There are many kinds. Warrants are the connection between a data
and a claim, between evidence and the argument that we're making.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=178#oembed-7

Deductive reasoning argues from general or well-accepted premises to concrete cases. The syllogism,
discussed in an earlier section of this chapter, is an example of deductive reasoning because it begins with a
major premise that is presumed to be generally true. It then leverages a hypothesis (the minor premise) to
reach a conclusion. Although deduction is often associated with the scientific method of hypothesis-testing,
deductive reasoning need not begin from a science-based major premise. To engage in deductive reasoning,
one may start from a major premise based in fact, value, or law to make a claim about a particular, as-yet
unexplained case. Deduction, in a nutshell, argues from what is already understood to be true or factual
and moves from this true statement to a particular circumstance in which the truth of that major premise
may be evaluated and refined. When we talk about deductive warrants, we are describing a logical move of
argumentation that takes us from something well established to a particular circumstance that supports the
truth of this well established claim.

  · Major Premise: Gravity acts upon all bodies with mass.
  · Minor Premise: Photons (light) do not have mass.
  · Conclusion: Gravity does not act upon photons (light).
                                                                                            CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 165

      Ultimately, the deductive conclusion provided above is not completely correct. Gravity does have an effect upon light,
      although this is not because light has mass! This has led to a refinement of the major premise: Because light has no
      mass, gravity does not affect light directly. instead, gravity affects the space-time through which photons travel. This
      results in the `warping' or `bending' of light through space, even though gravity does not act upon photons themselves.

Inductive reasoning argues from specific cases to general conclusions. When you're faced with a situation in
which you have knowledge or information about a specific number of cases, but you lack an understanding
of the "global" or "overaching" factors that might unite those cases, inductive reasoning is what allows you to
make that leap. If deductive reasoning is "top down" (from the most general to the most specific) then inductive
reasoning is "bottom up" (from the most specific to the most general). If you live someplace with a view
of the street and you see that 8/10 people walking on the street are wearing facemasks, inductive reasoning
would allow you to reach the conclusion that mask compliance in your town is approximately 80%. Inductive
reasoning would allow you to reach that conclusion, even if it is note entirely reliable (unless, of course, you
live in a very small town).

   This kind of causal logic is a causal generalization. This example is about medical care at the university.
It is a well-accepted premise that reducing the choice of medication for generic brands will create negative
health outcomes, and so here at this particular university, a transition to a health plan with less coverage will
negatively impact graduate students on campus. Because we widely know that the transition of generic drugs
has negative health outcomes, in this particular circumstance at this university, we can infer that the same cause-
effect relationship would hold in place, making this a deductive cause. As causal correlation, the logic of cause
can be inductive, showing from a specific case how a more general consequence will follow, and as a deductive
case, showing how a general pattern of cause and effect will show up in local or particular circumstances.
166 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

   I'd like to talk very briefly about the relationship between signs and causes as different kinds of warrants and
                                                                                            CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 167

to distinguish them from one another a little bit more closely. Signs and causes are easy to confuse, they fall
often into the same sort of category, and they do differ depending on the kind of evidence that is being brought
to bear on a given claim. On the exam, you can expect to see a question that provides data, claim, and a warrant,
and you'll be asked to identify what the warrant is. And so, a sign is the logic that where there's smoke, there's
fire. How do we know that there's a problem there? What is the sign, what is the symptom that is out there
that shows us that a problem exists? When we're talking about causes, we're talking about the origin of the
problem. Where did it start from, where it began. And so if our claim is about dinosaur extinction, we could
say that, on the one hand, a very big asteroid caused an enormous shock, that created their extinction, or on the
other hand, we could say that we know that the dinosaurs went extinct, because we have geological evidence
from the crater impact zone, which is like the smoke from the fire, the thing that reminds us of what happened
there, as opposed to the thing that happened. If our claim was about the ballooning national deficit, the thing
that caused that deficit is multiple increases in the national debt ceiling. Whereas the sign of a ballooning
national deficit is lower bond returns and a widening gap between the lower and middle class. Again, these are
symptoms, rather than the cause of the looming national deficit.

   If we're talking about how the cause of a specific pandemic disease is ultimately a virus, a fungus, or a
bacteria that has not been contained, but we know that it's out there, we know that there's smoke that is
showing us that it's out there, that, based on population levels, and symptoms of illness.

Inductive Warrants: Example, Analogy, and Causal
Correlation

Two kinds of inductive warrants include example and analogy.

      Examples are inductive warrants in which what is true of the specific is true of the general.

For instance, consider the claim "the people of ancient cultures believed in an afterlife." The data is that the
Egyptians believed in an afterlife, which is shown by their funeral preparations. Plato's writings also indicate
that the ancient Greeks believed in an afterlife. And so the connection between the general belief in an afterlife
is supported by two pieces of data: the Egyptians and Plato. What is true of the specific is true of the general:
two cases indicate that ancient peoples believed in an afterlife, so more generally, people of ancient cultures
must have believed in it as well.

      Analogies are inductive warrants in which if two things are alike in most respects, they will be alike in a general
      sense.

Consider the following claim: If exposed to Nerve Agent 274, then 90% of all humans will die because a similar
proportion of rats died in experimental trials. The data for this claim is that rats are mammals and possess a
nervous system that resembles a human's in most respects. The relationship between the claim about humans
168 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

potentially dying from this nerve agent, and the evidence, (a comparison between rats and humans) is that if
these two things are alike in most respects, they will be alike in this respect. And thus, it forms a connective
logic that takes specific cases and draws a general conclusion.

      Causal correlations are inductive warrants in which "if an increase in X leads to an increase in Y, then a decrease
      in X should lead to a decrease in Y."

For instance, if an increasing in indoor masking and vaccination leads to an increase in the number of people
who have natural immunity to a given infectious disease, then causal correlation would tell us that a decrease
in indoor masking and vaccination status would lead to a decrease in this same immunity. Correspondingly,
if an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels leads to higher global temperatures, then a decrease in
atmospheric carbon dioxide would lead to a decrease in global temperatures. The warrant from causal
correlation is inductive because a particular link between X and Y allows us to reach a more general conclusion:
namely, other related linkages between these two variables.

Deductive Warrants: Sign and Causal Generalization

Two kinds of deductive warrants include signs and causes.

      Signs are deductive warrants where evidence is a verified general indicator of something beyond itself.

The logic of the sign resembles the "index" discussed in the chapter on "the symbol." The claim that "where
there's smoke, there's fire" relies on a sign: the smoke is a verified, general indicator of something beyond
itself: fire. Similarly, economists long ago pointed to positive purchasing trends in low-cost food items (such
as Kraft Macaroni and Cheese) as a sign of imminent economic downturn. Mass purchases of Mac n' Cheese
indicate something beyond the evidence: that a recession is on the horizon. A final example is if your instructor
comes into class flustered, it may signal that they are underprepared for class. It may or may not be true - your
instructors may be having a difficult day due to family, job, or health problems - but the logical conclusion is
deductive because you, as an observer, are making a claim based on what you perceive to be general indicators.

      Causal Generalizations are deductive warrants when, given a recognizable cause, we can infer a particular effect
      or consequence.

When it is deductive, this kind of causal logic is called a causal generalization. For instance, rising atmospheric
carbon dioxide levels are a clear cause of the "greenhouse effect," which leads to global warming. Because
carbon dioxide levels verifiably lead to this consequence, we can make the causal generalization that an
observable increase in these gasses will yield a predictable result.

   Another example of causal generalizations might be about medical care at the university. It is a well accepted
premise that narrowing the availability of generic brand medication causes greater negative health outcomes.
                                                                                            CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 169

At our particular university, a transition to a health plan with less coverage of generic brands will negatively
impact the health of students on campus. Because this cause-effect relationship is verifiable and generally true,
it would make it true att our university, making it a deductive causal generalization.

Separating Signs from Causes

It is easy to confuse signs with causal generalizations, although they are different kinds of warrants. Ultimately,
the deductive logic of the sign is asking about a confirmed symptom: "where there is smoke (the symptom)
there is fire (the disease). The deductive logic of causal generalization refers to an origin: where did a given
thing-in-the-world start or begin? Let's consider a few examples:

   Let's say that we are considering a claim about dinosaur extinction.

  · A causal generalization might argue that a very big asteroid was the origin of a catastrophic global
      shock that resulted in extinction. Because we know that A (the asteroid) causes B (global extinction
      events) we can say that this cause resulted in that effect for the dinosaurs.

  · A sign might point to geological evidence from the crater impact zone that indicates an inhabitable
      environment for oxygen-breathing creatures, such as residues of ancient carbon monoxide. Because we
      know that this sign (carbon signatures) are an indicator of something beyond itself (an unbreathable
      environment) we can say that this evidence points to the reason megafauna no longer walk the earth.

Another way to separate signs from causes is to consider the ballooning national deficit.

  · A causal generalization might point to repeated increases in the national debt ceiling, which is the
      literal, most immediate 'cause' of this debt.

  · A sign-based argument might point to lower bond returns and a widening gap between the lower and
      middle class as indicators that debt has gotten out of control.

A third example is pandemic diseases.

  · There are limited general causes for a pandemic disease: a virus, a fungus, or a bacteria.
  · The signs of a pandemic disease are literal symptoms as well as changes in employment, hospitalization,

      and mortality rates.

Finally, let's consider different warrants related to becoming internet-famous.

  · We might say that the general cause of that internet fame is that you had a very viral post, and then
      someone confirmed or with many followers retweeted you, and then that spiraled out of control.
170 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

  · The sign that you're internet famous might be that people you don't know on campus come up to you,
      tweet at you, or start talking to you out of the blue.

The difference between sign and causal generalization is the difference between symptoms and origins. A sign
points to an indicator of the claim that you're trying to make, whereas a causal generalization points to a cause-
effect relationship.

Complicating Toulmin, Anticipating Rebuttals

Ultimately, the Toulmin Model is useful not just because it lets us map our arguments, but because it helps
us to anticipate how others will respond to our claims based on the intrinsic weakness of an argument.
Recall, arguments are designed to be contestable even though they often begin from well-established or proven
grounds. As indicated in the diagram below, there are a number of standard ways to respond to a given claim:

  · A claim may be either too extreme or unclear.
  · A warrant may make too big of a leap, it may lack backing, or it may just be the wrong warrant for the

      kind of claim being made.
  · Evidence may not have been collected correctly, there may be too much evidence to reach a good

      conclusion, or there may be too little evidence to support the claim.
                                                                                             CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 171

Diagram of Toulmin components and responses developed by media studies scholar Dan Faltesek

Clearly, this can get complicated. The point is that the Toulmin Model is a way to diagnose and strengthen
your individual arguments, to anticipate what others will find wrong with them, and how to respond before
someone raises an objection.

Part 3: Logical Dependency and Fallacies

This final section is about large-scale structures of argument that span the length f an entire book or essay.
These include the logically independent and dependent structures. The last section of this essay is about bad
arguments and fallacies and how to diagnose when arguments go wrong.

   The Dependency Model is an alternative to the Toulmin Model. Dependency establishes two kinds of
relationship between the thesis and the sub-claims of a speech or an essay. Whereas the Toulmin Model posits
the warrant as the connection between a claim and it's evidence, the logical Dependency Model posits two
kinds of connection between a thesis and supporting claims. Like the Toulmin Model, logical dependency
offers a way to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of an argument based on its overall structure, or how the
different arguments are linked together.
172 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

Logically Dependent and Independent Arguments

The two kinds of dependency are logically dependent and logically independent. The dependency
structures can be imagined as a circuit because they arrange claims either in a series (dependent) or in parallel
(independent):

Logically Dependent                          Logically Independent
                                             Thesis: A is a general category with
Thesis: A condensed syllogism.               subcategories BCD
                                             A: Koalas are a dangerous species
A = D Koalas are a dangerous species.        B: Koalas eat their young
A = B Koalas thrive on eucalyptus
B = C Eucalyptus is invasive and the Koala   C: Koalas wage war on other marsupials
population can grow a lot.
C = D Koala overpopulation is dangerous for  D: Koalas are carriers of disease
the larger ecosystem.

The logically dependent argument begins next to the plus or minuses: the thesis or "source". It then moves
from argument to argument, one building after the other, toward the conclusion. The thesis in a logically
dependent structure is a condensed version of the entire argument as it unfolds from paragraph to paragraph.
If one of the "lights" (supporting arguments) along the circuit fails, then the entire circuit (the thesis/total
argument) ceases to function.

      In the logically dependent example provided above, the thesis is that "koalas are a dangerous species." To arrive at
      this conclusion, we have to go through a series of steps: First, koalas thrive on eucalyptus; second, because eucalyptus is
      an invasive species of plant, it can lead to koala overpopulation; and finally, koala overpopulation spells danger for
      a larger ecosystem. However, if one of the claims is proven false (e.g. eucalyptus is NOT an invasive species) then the
      entire argument fails.

In the logically independent model the thesis still starts at the source, but then offers three separate criteria or
pieces of evidence that support the original claim. The thesis statement is like an umbrella. When we look at it
as a drawn out argument, the thesis is a general claim that can be supported by any number of sub-claims that
are separate (independent) from it. If one of the "lights" (supporting claims) along the circuit fails, the others
may still function.

      In the logically independent example provided above, there are three separate independent reasons that support
      the claim that koalas are dangerous. Unlike the dependent structure, these supporting arguments do not `build'
      upon one another; instead, they stand alone. The first supporting argument is that that koalas eat their young.
      The second is that koalas wage war on other marsupials. Finally, koalas are carriers of disease. Each offers a
      different rationale for why koalas pose a real danger. However, if one of the arguments is invalidated (e.g. koalas
      clearly cannot `wage war') the other two supporting claims may still stand.
                                                                                            CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION | 173

When it comes to writing an essay, the structure of logical dependency can help you to scaffold arguments
at the level of the topic sentence. A thesis should appear in the first paragraph of your essays, laying out your
major claim as well as the purpose and overall structure of the paper. Each paragraph can then be organized in
either a dependent or independent manner, building one claim atop another from paragraph to paragraph or,
alternatively, providing separate reasons why the thesis should be supported.

Logically Dependent                        Logically Independent

Strengths: Allows the arguer to go "in     Strengths: Allows the arguer offer "breadth"
depth" on a claim by providing a           about a claim by providing a number of
stage-by-stage account of its validity.    separate reasons why it is to be accepted.

Weaknesses: If any one `stage' of the      Weaknesses: No one of these sub-claims is
argument is falsified or invalidated, the  fully developed or goes beyond a surface
entire argument may be dismissed.          treatment.

Both structures have unique strengths and weaknesses. The strength of the logically dependent series is that
it allows the arguer to go into depth with a single claim, by providing a stage-by-stage account of its validity.
However the logically dependent series also has a key weakness. If any one stage or piece of the argument is
falsified or invalidated, the entire argument may be dismissed.

   The most defensible claims use a hybrid structure: one that uses both dependent and independent forms
of argument. To return to an example from earlier in this chapter, Colin Powell's argument to the UN was
organized as a hybrid dependent/independent structure:
174 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

   The major claim that runs across the top of this page is dependent. Each part builds one part atop another,
and each `step' is required for the ultimate claim (the UN Security Council should authorize the use of force).
If one of these top-level claims is invalidated, then the whole argument falls apart.

   The substructure below this top line is independent. There are a series of separable reasons provided for
each claim as a redundancy measure for the dependent claim. For example: the second "step" ("Iraq cannot
prove it has disarmed") is supported by two independent supporting claims: ("Weapons of Mass Destruction
[WMD] programs are continuing" and "Iraqi denials cannot be trusted"). These claims, in turn, are backed by
their own supporting claims (We can know that WMD programs are continuing in the areas of "biological,"
"chemical," and "nuclear" weapons creation).

   It is important to note that just because a claim is complex does not mean it is true. Ultimately, Powell was
incorrect about the stockpiling of WMDs in Iraq: investigators found no evidence that this was ever occurring.
Additionally, the UN Security Council did not find Powell's claims compelling because they were based on
uncertainties about Iraq rather than obvious evidence. In the end, even Powell said that his speech was "a great
intelligence failure" based on unsupported evidence and inadequate sourcing.

Fallacies of Reason

Next, we are going to talk about logical fallacies. Once again, please remember that all the powerpoints
displayed in this lecture are available on canvas if you experience poor video quality. There are several videos
in this next section. The first thing that I want to show you here is the ad hominem fallacy, one of the most
common fallacies that we know of. This video will explain not only what it is, but also sub variants and sub
categories of the ad hominem fallacy.

One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=178#oembed-8

Beyond the ad hominem, fallacies are generally incorrect forms of reasoning. Typically, when someone uses a
fallacies, it is grounds to call them out for using a bad warrant, or incorrectly making a connection between
claims and evidence.

   There are many fallacies of reason. Here are few common variations:

  · The argument ad hominem, which we just explored, is an attack on the person rather than engagement
      with the argument. It's a deflection from the claim by talking about the character of the people who are
      making the claims.

  · The argument ad populum employ the bandwagon fallacy. It establishes that if a majority of people are
      doing something, we should do it too.

  · The straw man argument is a reduction of an opposing argument. It takes issue with a very narrow or
      specific piece of someone's argument and then blows it up as if it is the entire argument that the person
      is making. So by reducing the position to a non-representative claim or to a single sentence or single
      word in an arguer's argument, the straw man fallacy allows the arguer to take up a position of strength
      by making an over claim about what the opponent is actually saying.

  · The slippery slope fallacy is a way of connecting evidence through an unbacked causal chain. A leads to
      B leads to C leads to D, but the connection between these points is assumed rather than proven. Because
      the causal chain is very weak, one thing rests upon another thing, rests upon another thing, rests upon
      another thing so that ultimately it leads to some devastating consequence.

  · The non-sequiter fallacy is one in which the claim does not follow from the evidence. Non-sequiter
      literally means "does not follow," in which the connection between an argument and its data is absurd,
      satirical, or nonsensical.

  · The false dilemma is an option of A or B. It forces a choice between two options as though there is no
      option except for these two. In fact, there may be a third or a fourth option. Here is an example of the
176 | CHAPTER 8: RHETORIC AND ARGUMENTATION

      false dilemma in action:

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=178#oembed-9

Fallacies are arguments that are made in a way that makes us want to believe them, but at the same time, use
shortcuts or use connections between evidence that are inappropriate or not as rigorous as they should be. But
even though we can see arguments as bad in this way, they are more and more common. This is especially in
advertisements, which use fallacies as a recognizable form of reason, thereby allowing the audience to be part
of the persuasion.

   This Doritos ad employs the non-sequitur because it descends into absurdity when demonstrating the
lengths to which people will go for their chips.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=178#oembed-11

                                                                The Slippery Slope

   In this case, the viewing audience can identify with the reasoning, even as we recognize that it is flawed.
The slippery slope allows one thing to lead to another and another until "you" end up with an eye patch. As
a technique for advertising, we are all in on the joke. The commercial doesn't try to sell us on the product as
much as it tries to create a shared experience of absurdity for the seller and the viewer.

   The point here is that advertisements in general allow us to identify with bad reasoning. Fallacies are indeed
flawed arguments, but insofar as they are common modes of reasoning, they can also allow us to connect with
the message on the basis that we are all in the know. They are not just ways to dismiss incorrect claims; they are
ways of leveraging claims that are recognizable to a wide audience.

Rhetorical critics who study rhetoric create new knowledge regarding what makes communication (rhetoric)
effective. When analyzing a rhetorical act, critics will often examine its symbols. From Chapter 4, a symbol is
an image, sound, or word representing something else. A symbol can convey meaning and vary depending on
cultural context. A rhetorical critic studying the picture above may be interested in why and how a particular
symbol--the clenched fist--was successful or unsuccessful in urging an audience to think, feel, believe, or
do something. The symbol in the picture is not a mere image but a powerful communication tool, sparking
curiosity and inviting deeper analysis.

   When humans use symbols, they engage in symbolic action, which refers to using symbols to express
meaning or communicate ideas, often through behavior or ritual. Symbolic actions are deliberate and are
intended to convey messages, express beliefs, or bring about social change. For instance, a public
demonstration--such as the one shown above--may involve symbolic actions like holding signs, chanting
slogans, or performing symbolic gestures to express a collective message. Symbolic action becomes a useful
180 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1

rhetorical device because it is a powerful tool for identity formation, social reality construction, social
movement mobilization, and cultural expression.

   Let's use another example to explore the distinction between symbols and symbolic action. I teach at a
university near Buffalo, NY. In 2022, there was a mass shooting at a local supermarket in Buffalo. When a tragic
event like this one occurs, people often lay wreaths and flowers at the memorial site as a sign of respect and
remembrance. This is an action that is performed symbolically or ceremonially.

   In the photograph below, you'll see a variety of flowers. Before visiting a memorial site, a person will choose
a particular flower color to represent what a deceased person means to them. For instance, a white flower
symbolizes innocence, purity, and honor. People may place a white flower at a memorial site to express love,
respect, and grief. The flower is a symbol, and putting it at the memorial site makes it a form of symbolic
action. In doing so, the flower becomes a powerful symbol of sentiment and serves to honor the killed people,
express grief, and show support for a cause. While a symbol (flower) is a tangible representation of an abstract
concept, symbolic action involves the intentional use of the symbol (flower) in behavior or rituals (placing it at
a memorial site) to convey meaning or communicate an idea.

We uncover a symbol's rhetorical consequences by understanding what a rhetorical action means and what
it does. Remember, a symbol is an arbitrary representation of something else (a white flower at a funeral
symbolizes love for one person and grief for another). Symbolic action occurs when people use that symbol
(a white flower) to engage in action (placing it as a memorial site to achieve an outcome). Studying symbolic
action helps rhetorical critics better understand how humans use symbols to affect the world. Moreover,
while studying rhetoric, symbols, and symbolic action, we get a sense of rhetorical agency, which refers to
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1 | 181

our capacity to act in a way that gets others in our community to mobilize. This is where civic engagement
enters. Change and maintenance of social, political, and economic structures is accomplished through civic
engagement, and civic engagement is achieved through rhetoric. People use rhetoric to develop their identity
as individuals and citizens and determine what should be done about a problem.

   This chapter explores rhetoric and symbolic action in the context of civic engagement. Civic engagement
is "a multifaceted concept, consisting of political interest, political discussion, and political knowledge"
(Mossberger et al., 2008, p. 48). Accordingly, civic engagement activities tend to focus on political involvement,
which involves actions related to systems' efforts on individuals and communities. Civic engagement
encompasses individuals' activities to participate in their communities and broader society. It is critical in
fostering active citizenship, building stronger communities, and advancing social justice and democracy.
Consequently, studying symbolic action in the context of civic engagement offers beneficial insights and tools
for promoting effective communication, mobilizing collective action, fostering social cohesion, and advancing
social justice and inclusion. To this end, the chapter is broken up into two parts. In Part 1, I apply various
concepts related to rhetoric and symbolic action to 5 examples:

  · Example 1: A hot dog
  · Example 2: Bell "Let's Talk" campaign
  · Example 3: #NotOneMoreDisplay
  · Example 4: Disability Nation art
  · Example 5: A reshaping of the American flag

This section concludes with an activity on the Left-Right Political Spectrum and a discussion of political
polarization. Then, I discuss rhetoric and civic engagement in the public sphere. Within this section, I discuss
two types of civic engagement: activism and political engagement. The chapter ends with a summative
conclusion. Throughout the chapter, you'll find hyperlinks to websites and videos that provide additional
information on concepts.

Part 1: Rhetoric and Symbolic Action

Kenneth Burke (1969) considers symbols as action, hence the phrase "symbolic action." Rhetoric is not
just a communication tool but a powerful mode of symbolic action, which is the "constitution of social
reality through symbols that foster identification" (Hallsby, 2022). Rhetoric is how symbols act in our world
(Palczewski et al., 2022). Burke (1969) considers humans to be "symbol-using animals" such that when we use
symbols, we engage in symbolic action. A rhetor refers to "any person, group, or institution that uses symbolic
action" (Palczewski et al., 2022, p. 5). Understanding rhetoric as a mode of symbolic action can enlighten us
182 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1

about the profound influence of symbols in shaping our social reality. You can learn more about symbolic
action and Burke's concept explanation in Chapter 4.

Example 1: Rhetoric as Symbolic Action: A Hot Dog

On June 11, 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt hosted King George
VI and Queen Elizabeth at Hyde Park, their home in Hudson Valley. It was the first time a reigning British
monarch had set foot in its former colony. The president served the royals a dinner of hot dogs and beer to
celebrate. The Queen had no idea how to eat the hotdog. The casual American-style picnic was meant to
dispel anti-British sentiment. The president hoped the picnic would humanize the British monarch and win
the American people's sympathy. The following day, the picnic made the front page of the New York Times
with the headline, "KING TRIES HOTDOG AND ASKS FOR MORE." The photo below captures Mrs.
Eleanor Roosevelt and Queen Elizabeth leaving the station for the White House.
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1 | 183

In this example, the hotdog became more than food--the hot dog was a symbol that fostered a "likable"
impression of King George VI of Great Britain. As a symbol, the hotdog's meaning was fluid because it held
a different meaning for different people. While the literal meaning of a hot dog is "a sandwich consisting of
a frankfurter in a split roll, usually eaten with mustard, sauerkraut, or relish" (Dictionary.com, 2024), some
could say it represents summer, hosting cookouts with family and friends, and baseball. Michaels (2020)
commented, "The simplicity of the event endeared the King and Queen to the American public who now saw
them as regular people capable of casual dining rather than as evil colonial rulers" (para. 5). Thus, the hot dog
became a symbol that contributed to the president's construction of Americans' social reality. Who knew that
a hotdog--and what it symbolized--could play a key role in diplomacy?

II.

Example 2: Rhetoric as Symbolic Action: Bell "Let's Talk"
Campaign

                                 "Bell Let's Talk" by Bell Canada is in the Public Domain

The photo above shows the Bell Let's Talk logo. The logo represents (or symbolizes) the meaning behind
the day: end the stigma around mental health and start a conversation to initiate change surrounding the
topic. The flag may look familiar if you are Canadian because the awareness campaign is prominent in your
country. However, those outside Canada may have never seen the logo or heard of the "Bell Let's Talk"
campaign. Consequently, the symbol might have little meaning for some and great significance for others,
particularly those who have mental health issues. You'll see examples of visual symbols in a 2024 "Bell Let's
Talk" advertisement. This commercial also provides more information on creating change in mental health.

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=820#oembed-2

Although symbols like the "Bell Let's Talk" logo often represent tangible things, they also exemplify a
constructed reality. Kornfield (2021) defines constructed realities as "The ways of life that humans take for
granted as the natural order, even though humans originally constructed them through symbols" (p. 5). This
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1 | 185

aligns with concepts discussed in Introduction to Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World,
which emphasizes that reality is not something we passively observe but actively shape through interactions
and shared meanings. Symbols are central to this process, influencing our perceptions, behaviors, and
attitudes. For instance, a symbol gains its meaning through social processes. When encountering symbols, we
draw on cultural backgrounds, personal experiences, and social contexts to ascribe meaning. This meaning, in
turn, shapes how we perceive ourselves, others, and the world, thus constructing our social reality.

Example 3: Rhetoric as Symbolic Action: #NotOneMore
Display

In an act of protest on March 13, 2018, activists placed 7,000 pairs of shoes outside the U.S. Capitol building.
Each pair symbolizes a child who was killed by gun violence since Sandy Hook (Icsman, 2018). From 8:30 am
to 2:00 pm, the shoes were displayed on the southeast lawn in the hope of sending a clear message to Congress:
Reform gun control legislation or more children will be killed by gun violence. A global advocacy group, Avaaz,
planned the protest and collected shoes from people from across the country (Icsman, 2018).

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=820#oembed-3

The shoes, which covered 10,000 square feet, became a form of symbolic action. The symbol--pairs of
shoes--became an arbitrary representation of something else: the estimated number of children who die from
gun violence every year. By capturing media attention and eliciting emotional responses, activists' symbolic
actions framed a social issue, sought to shape public opinion, and influenced policy debates.

   This is also an example of how a rhetor may use visual symbols to represent a thing, concept, or action. As
such, the installation advocated for gun control legislation while fostering a sense of collective responsibility
and urgency for change. In this instance, Avaaz's use of symbols sought to spark cooperation, generate
identification, produce division, enable persuasion, and constitute identity. Identity is rhetorically
constructed and refers to the "physical and behavioral attributes that make a person recognizable as a member
of a group" (Palczewski et al., 2022, p. 193). By participating in the protest, those who donated shoes advanced
a uniform identity that answered the question, "Who/what are you." This further exemplifies how symbolic
action can contribute to constructing identity within a person's social reality. By engaging in this symbolic
action, people participating in Avaaz's act of protest asserted their identities, values, and beliefs, thus shaping
how others and themselves perceived them.

Example 4: Rhetoric as Symbolic Action: Disability Nation

When you look at "Disability Nation," what verbal and visual symbols do you see? How does the rhetor's social
reality appear within the mixed-media artwork? The rhetorical act contains visual and verbal symbols. As you
examine its persuasive message, remember that when people engage in symbolic action, they construct social
reality. After all, symbolic action creates the meaning people ascribe to the things in their world.

   While in her 40s, the rhetor, Cheryl Kinderknecht, was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a rare eye
disease that causes vision loss. Kinderknecht did not want her loss of vision to impede her identity as an artist.
Guided by her social reality, Kinderknecht created this rhetorical act in response to H.R.620: ADA Education
and Reform Act of 2017. Many disability advocates believed that despite being disguised as strengthening the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA Reform Act weakened the Americans with Disabilities Act while
also undermining the key goals of the law (ACLU, 2017). This video features Cherly Kinderknecht discussing
the Art of Possibilities Art Show. In the video, the mixed-media artist discusses her piece, In the Garden with
Friends, and how her visual impairment influences her art.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=820#oembed-4

"Disability Nation" is a form of protest art in which Kinderknecht uses symbolic action--words, images, and
artifacts--to construct, maintain, and transform others' social realities. The rhetor challenges prevailing social
norms and structures by addressing injustices and disrupting established social norms and hierarchies. This
rhetorical act prompts the audience--such as yourself--to discuss what the rhetor believes is a pressing societal
problem and mobilize individuals around a common goal.

   Furthermore, "Disability Nation" features symbols that depict an ideology. In Chapter 6, ideology is
defined as "the religious, artistic, moral, and philosophical beliefs contained within and perpetuated by a
society or culture, and which are determined by the material circumstances that occasion them" (para. 5). In
the case of "Disability Nation," ableism is an apparent ideology. Ableism is the discrimination of and prejudice
against people with disabilities. This ideology is grounded in the belief that people with "normal" abilities are
superior. Similar to sexism or racism, ableism classifies people as "less than." This BuzzFeed video explores
ableism. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b7k6pEnyQ4

   Ideology is a comprehensive set of normative beliefs that an individual, group, or society possesses. Ideology
reinforced signs and symbols. For instance, in "Disability Nation," the American flag is hung upside down. A
hegemonic reading of the American flag proposes that the American flag is a national symbol of freedom and
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1 | 187

democracy. Yet, when people fly an American flag upside down, it is generally seen as a symbol of a distressed
nation. The symbol represents an abstract ideological concept, value, or belief in this example.

   The rhetorical act incorporates symbols that contest and resist dominant ideologies (e.g., ableism) by
challenging their meaning, power structures, and narratives. In doing so, the rhetor appropriates existing
symbols (e.g., the wheelchair) and creates new ones to subvert dominant ideologies. Kinderknecht challenges
hegemonic ideologies and advocates for social change by reinterpreting or reclaiming symbols. As a result, the
rhetor elucidates alternative values and viewpoints.

Example 5: Rhetoric as Symbolic Action: A Reshaping of
the American Flag

The flag of the United States-- "Old Glory"--is a symbol deeply embedded within American cultural
practices and traditions. The American flag is encoded with ideological meanings (e.g., democracy) and values
(e.g., freedom) in everyday life. For instance, by reciting the "Pledge of Allegiance" in elementary school, the
American flag became integrated into our cultural practices; thus, we internalized the ideology tied to the flag.
This, in turn, shaped our perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors as Americans.

                                          "Possible 52-star U.S. flag" by Gaiole is in
                                          the Public Domain, CC0

Let's discuss a different iteration of "Old Glory"-- the "Blue Lives Matter" flag, which features a modified
American flag with one blue stripe. Although the traditional American flag symbolizes unity, the "Blue Lives
Matter" banner sparks disagreement between those who favor defunding law enforcement agencies and those
who believe it symbolizes honor and sacrifice. The banner, which represents the police, is associated with
the Blue Lives Matter movement, a countermovement to the Black Lives Matter movement. In addition
to representing solidarity with police, the banner is a response to and rejection of the Black Lives Matter
movement (Kweku, 2024). Its flag functions as a symbolic action by incorporating symbolic elements to
support law enforcement, raise awareness of related issues, mobilize political action, and respond to broader
social and political contexts. As a symbol, the "Blue Lives Matter" flag holds cultural significance and serves as
a rallying point for individuals and groups advocating for police officers' interests.
188 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1

                                        "Twemoji-style Blue Lives Matter" by
                                        Alejandro Basombrio is licensed under CC
                                        BY-SA 4.0

The "Blue Lives Matter" banner's meaning has a much more specific ideology than the United States flag.
Although the thin blue line was originally meant to symbolize the uniform color worn by police officers, the
thin blue line has "become emblematic of white nationalist, neo-Nazi, and alt-right movements in the U.S."
(Thin blue line, 2024). Many rioters carried this banner while storming the capitol on January 6, 2021 (Kweku,
2024). Thus, the thin blue line banner moves from the level of a symbol charged by and deployed in service
of ideology to that of symbolic action. This occurs, for instance, when politicians use the rhetorical act for
political gain. By rallying support around the flag, advocates seek to mobilize political action, influence policy
decisions, and shape public discourse on police funding, training, or accountability.

   As another example, at a rally in 2020, candidate Donald Trump made a closing argument that featured
the thin blue line banner. The Trump campaign cast the Democrats as enemies of law and order and, in turn,
law enforcement (Kweku, 2024). Then, Trump and his supporters at the Republican National Convention
claimed, "Under President Trump, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line" (Kweku,
2024). This demonstrates how the "Blue Lives Matter" flag can be understood as a response to broader social
and political contexts. Symbolic actions, such as adopting the flag, reflect efforts to counter criticisms of law
enforcement and assert alternative narratives that prioritize the perceived needs and challenges facing police
officers.

   The "Blue Lives Matter" flag is associated with political movements (e.g., the Blue Lives Matter movement)
and political campaigns (e.g., President Trump). Given this, the blue line flag provides an entry point for
discussing ideologies: conservatism and liberalism. Political parties--such as Republicans and
Democrats--have ideological affiliations that differentiate them from one another. For instance, those
belonging to the Democratic Party may possess a liberal ideology, whereas members of the Republican Party
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1 | 189

support a conservative ideology. People often use the left-right political spectrum to describe a political
ideology.

As political polarization increases in the United States, so does the tendency for Republicans and Democrats
to view those who identify as members of the opposing party negatively and people of the same party more
positively (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). In a polarized electorate, people do not hold centrist attitudes but
push toward ideological extremes. As polarization increases, the center begins to disappear (Levendusky, 2009).
Evidence indicates that supporters of political parties loathe and distrust people from the opposing party
(Druckman & Levendusky, 2019; Iyengar et al., 2019). For instance, Moore-Berg et al. (2020) found that
Democrats and Republicans exhibit a steady and persistent bias in how much prejudice and dehumanization
they express toward people who hold a different party affiliation. Because perceptions of polarization influence
behavior (Van Boven et al., 2012), we should reflect on our perceptions of people from the opposing party
190 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1

and how/why these perceptions came into existence. Why does aligning yourself with one side lead to hostility
toward members of the contrasting party?

   Let's do a quick activity:

 1. Complete the "Ideology Checker" quiz, which is available at https://www.polarizationlab.com/
      ideologyquiz.

 2. After reviewing your results, consider how your experiences and perceptions influenced your chosen
      statement.

 3. I challenge you to engage in a political discussion with people who deviate from your party affiliation
      and ideological beliefs. Why? Research suggests that political discussions with those with different
      political views and support of a political party that diverges from one's own have positive implications
      for democracy (Nir, 2017).

I would be remiss if I did not point out that there are instances when points of view are not equally valid
(e.g., xenophobic, homophobic, or racist attacks; hate speech; misinformation; white supremacist and alt-right
trolling). Serving to divert attention, these communicative acts do not warrant a response. To summarize,
a rhetor is any person, group, or institution that uses symbolic action. Symbolic action, which is expressive
human action, uses symbols to persuade. These symbols provide an arbitrary representation of something else.
A symbol represents a word, image, or artifact representing a thing, thought, or action. Now, let's discuss
symbolic action as it relates to civic engagement.

Part 2: Rhetoric and Civic Engagement in the Public
Sphere

Civic Engagement

Civic engagement is "people's participation in individual or collective action to construct identity and
develop solutions" (Palczewski et al., 2022, p. 14) to problems facing one's community and beyond. Civic
engagement is also "a multifaceted concept, consisting of political interest, political discussion, and political
knowledge" (Mossberger et al., 2008, p. 48). Civic engagement motivates civic participation because the
individual's interest in politics and current events can translate into action (Klofstad, 2011). Accordingly,
civic engagement activities tend to focus on political involvement with actions related to the effects of systems
on individuals and communities. Before continuing, let's explore your connection to civic engagement by
answering these questions:

 1. A civic association is an organization whose official goal is to improve neighborhoods through
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1 | 191

      volunteer work by its members. What civic organizations do you belong to?
 2. How do you enact citizenship and civic engagement? Remember, civic engagement as a process is a

      "mode of public engagement." Participation in society has many different forms, all of which involve
      symbolic action
 3. How do you use rhetoric to persuade and/or seek recognition from others to support the organization?
      When you engage in rhetoric, you necessarily commit yourself to an interaction.

On the Illinois State University's Center for Civic Engagement's webpage, readers find an infographic
identifying different civic engagement forms. In this chapter, we focus on political engagement and activism.
While activism "involves organizing to bring about change or show support" for a particular cause or policy,"
political engagement "develops one's political understandings and views that may be expressed by
challenging the political ideas of others and/or influencing politics or political positions" (Center for Civic
Engagement, 2024).

The Public Sphere

In both contexts, citizens discuss social issues in the public sphere. Jürgen Habermas identifies and describes
the public sphere in The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere. Habermas (1992) defines the public
sphere as "a network for communicating information and points of view" (p.x), which converts into public
opinion. Habermas's public sphere refers to a space within a society where individuals engage in rational
discourse, debate, and deliberation about matters of common concern. Consequently, political engagement,
which involves individuals participating in activities to influence or shape political processes and decisions,
intersects with Habermas's notion of the public sphere.

   Habermas believes there is a space and time for deliberation in a true public sphere. Habermas (1991)
proposes that the public sphere is a place where people can join to discuss and identify societal problems freely.
Debate within the public sphere enables discussants to have open access, a place to bracket social inequalities,
have rational discussions, and focus on common issues (DeLuca & Peeples, 2006). After debate ensues, the
public is described as the carrier of public opinion, and "its function as a critical judge is precisely what
makes the public character of proceedings meaningful" (Habermas, 1991, p. 2). Habermas emphasizes the
importance of deliberative democracy within the public sphere, where citizens engage in reasoned dialogue
and debate to reach informed collective decisions. Political engagement that fosters deliberation, such as town
hall meetings, citizen assemblies, or participatory forums, contributes to the democratic process by enabling
citizens to participate actively in decision-making and policy formation. This, in turn, creates a public sphere
that provides an inclusive and accessible space where individuals from diverse backgrounds can participate
in political discourse and decision-making. Political engagement initiatives promoting inclusivity help ensure
marginalized voices are heard and represented within the public sphere.

Historically, public discussions about others' use of political power grew out of eighteenth-century bourgeois
society (Habermas, 1974, 1991). Habermas (1974) understood the bourgeois public sphere to be "the sphere
of private individuals assembled into a public body" (p. 54). The bourgeois public sphere coincides with the
social welfare state of mass democracy (Dahlgren, 1995). Within the public sphere, public opinion mediates
between society and a country's leaders, and public opinion affirms and guides the affairs of the state. Before
continuing, read this summary and watch this video discussing Habermas's book, The Structural Transition of
the Public Sphere.

The public sphere emerged in the 18th century along with the growth of coffee houses, voluntary associations,
and the press (Habermas, 1991). Habermas (1991) suggests that when people gather in these public places,
they express their thoughts in the public sphere. Essentially, the public sphere signifies a social space where
people assemble to express and form public opinion (DeLuca & Peeples, 2006). In the public sphere, citizens
congregate to converse about society and debate issues. Thus, Habermas's public sphere is characterized by
rational-critical debate (Breese, 2011). Habermas (1991) clarifies that events and occasions happening in the
public are "open to all, in contrast to closed or exclusive affairs" (p. 1). While congregating in the public sphere,
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1 | 193

citizens use communication to transmit information and influence those who receive it (Habermas, 1974). The
major discourses found in Habermas's model are means for the virtual representation of direct discourse. In
addition to coffee houses and voluntary associations, the press also played a role in the emergence of the public
sphere. This video features rare footage of Habermas discussing some of his theories.

The public sphere has taken on a new form in that it attracts public opinion because of the free press
(Habermas, 1991). Habermas (1991) describes the significance of the press as "developing a unique explosive
power" (p. 21). Habermas (1974) identifies newspapers, magazines, radio, and television as comprising the
public sphere, for these are mediums in which people can express their ideas, share opinions, and disseminate
the news. Even in the eighteenth century, newspapers were described as influencing party politics because those
publishing the news were seen as leaders of public opinion (Habermas, 1974). Despite the public sphere being
described as a place for open discussion, some marginalized groups have not been allowed to participate in the
public sphere (e.g., discussions in Calhoun, 1992).

   The power of the public sphere resides in communication acts such as debate and discussion. The
political public sphere is a space where citizens can access dialogue that addresses questions of common
concern (Dahlgren, 1995). It is during these discussions that public opinion can be formed (Habermas,
1991). Habermas envisions a public sphere that surfaces each time "private individuals assemble to form
a public body" (1974, p. 248). During this time, citizens discuss issues, with the mass media becoming a
chief institution of the public sphere (Dahlgren, 1995). Habermas (1991) contends that mass media, such as
television and advertisements, erodes the critical function of the public sphere, which was initially "made up
of private people gathered together as a public and articulating the needs of society" (p. 176). Habermas argues
that the mass media has caused the public sphere to lose exclusivity because less educated citizens have entered
the scene (Dahlgren, 1995).

   Dahlgren (1995) points out that the utility of the public sphere is valid and helpful because "it points to
those institutional constellations of the media and other for fora information and opinion" (p. 9). This public
sphere scholar also believes communication action is necessary for the public sphere. Communicative action
depends "on situational contexts, which in turn represent segments of the lifeworld of the participants in
interactions" (Habermas, 1998, p. 111). According to Habermas, speakers are constantly advancing claims
about the validity of their statements (Dahlgren, 1995). Like his description of the public sphere, Habermas
suggests that communicative action involves people coming together to discuss and respond to particular
societal crises. This coincides with the notion of the political public sphere. Habermas's view of the public
194 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1

sphere is the most fruitful (Dahlgren, 1995) despite its critics (DeLuca & Peeples, 2006; Fraser, 1992). As Fraser
(1992) notes, "... the public sphere is indispensable to critical social theory and democratic political practice"
(p. 247).

   Scholars have criticized Habermas's focus on a single public within the sphere (e.g., discussions in Calhoun,
1992). For instance, Fraser (1992) argues that feminist scholars should move beyond Habermas's original
claims and focus on multiple unequal publics. Following suit, scholars acknowledge that Habermas's selection
of the term "public" had exclusionary political implications that led to the suppression of women and
minorities (Hauser, 1998). Hauser (1998) also critiques Habermas's ideal rational communication model
while creating his "reticulate public sphere." Other critics, such as Deluca and Peeples (2002), contend that
political discourse exists in a televisual public sphere instead of a public sphere. Amidst the criticism, Habermas
(1991) acknowledges that he would have revised his original text. Shortly thereafter, he discusses the media's
role in promoting civic participation (Habermas, 1992). Despite its limitations, Habermas's notion of the
public sphere remains useful (Dahlgren, 1995). If you want to learn more about Habermas's idea of the public
sphere, check out this video:

In summary, political engagement and Habermas's understanding of the public sphere are interconnected,
as both involve citizens actively participating in public discourse, deliberation, and decision-making processes
about matters of common concern. By fostering democratic dialogue, accountability, inclusivity, and civic
participation, political engagement contributes to the vitality and effectiveness of the public sphere.

Civic Engagement in the Public Sphere: Activist
Movements

Now that you have a sense of civic engagement in the public sphere let's consider activism to be a type that
operates within the context of social movements. Activism is a prominent form of civic engagement within the
public sphere, characterized by individuals or groups actively advocating for social or political change. In this
section, we will focus on protest movements. Protest movements involve collective action to address specific
grievances, injustices, or social issues.

   Social movements are "struggles on behalf of a cause by groups whose core organizations, modes of action,
and/or guiding ideas are not fully legitimate by the larger society" (Simons, 1970). Social movements must
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1 | 195

choose between violent and nonviolent activities, legal and illegal ones, disruption and persuasion, extremism
and moderation, reform and revolution. Stewart et al. (2012) propose a variety of characteristics of social
movements, including

  · being conscious, organized, and lasting longer than a single protest;
  · being composed mainly of ordinary people;
  · protesting against something;
  · organized;
  · existing until it achieves its goal or is terminated and
  · emerging unexpectedly.

Social movements are also described as critical actors in traditional politics occurring within the public sphere
(Rauch, 2007) and are institutionalized collectives that maintain outsider status. While some scholars, such as
sociologists, study movement from an organizational perspective, others examine activists' rhetoric attempting
to produce social change (DeLuca, 1999). Social movements occur when a redefinition of reality is constructed
and filtered through rhetoric. Given our focus on symbolic action and civic engagement, I propose that the
study of social movements is an account of the social consciousness of society.

   Activists may disseminate their messages through speeches, pamphlets, and mass media. Sillars (1980)
proposes that a critic should focus time on exploring these message forms. As rhetorical critics, we should
remember to focus on messages in all shapes and forms. Even Sillars' definition of "movement" is critic-
focused. The scholar proposes that a critic be cognizant of problems that limit a social movement theory's
usefulness. Of the four issues, I found the problem "assume that movements are linear" most notable. I
selected this specific problem because I found Sillars' statement that writers see linearity as part of the criticism
of movement enlightening. He suggests that critics look for characteristics of the movement that define its
rhetorical nature. Taking such action should enable me to perceive what is rhetorically significant about the
event. Furthermore, Sillars advocates that a movement is "some combination of events occurring over time,
which can be linked in such a way that the critic can make a case for treating them as a single unit" (p. 19).

   Social movements devote significant portions of their persuasive efforts toward transforming perceptions
of the present. This is where symbolic action enters. Remember, when humans use symbols, we are engaged
in symbolic action. Symbols construct our versions of reality; as humans, symbols help us understand that
reality. This idea is exemplified in the photo below. The Black Lives Matter movement seeks to "eradicate
white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state
and vigilantes" (Black Lives Matter, 2024). An ideology manifests itself rhetorically through the ideas, values,
beliefs, and understanding that Black Lives Matter activists have when they see a clenched fist. Consequently,
activists in the photo use the clenched fist--a symbol--to depict the social movement's ideological
consciousness.

McGee (1980) and Cathcart (1978) state that social movements appear in public discourse. Social movement's
frames and strategies are affected by ideological positions and network connections to other social movements.
As such, another social force at work during a social movement is an ideograph. As was stated earlier in the
chapter, ideographs "do the work of ideology" (Enck-Wanzer, 2012, p. 4). People involved in a social movement
will search for words to communicate the urgency of a problem and the need to take action. The ability to
ascribe relevance to listeners' lives is necessary to transform perceptions of the present. For instance, a social
movement may use symbolic action, such as an ideograph, in its slogan, songs, images, or an image event.

   Symbolic action may also be present as social movements engage in storytelling. Let's revisit our discussion
of social reality. You may recall that our "reality is a social product arising from interaction, and
communication extends or limits realities" (Stewart et al., 2012, p. 141). Our culture's symbol system and our
interactions shape our reality. As humans, our ability to create, manipulate, and use symbols is what makes
us unique from other animals. Since virtually all human action is symbolic and the by-product of symbols,
it makes sense that the meaning arising from a symbol results from interaction in specific contexts. As was
discussed in Chapter 8, narratives can be a powerful means of altering perception in the present. For example,
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1 | 197

how do the Black Lives Matter activists in the photo above use storytelling to shape the audience's social
reality?

Social movements often expose a hegemonic viewpoint that molds a culture's social reality as false and argues
that something must be done to alter that reality. A protestor, for instance, will urge people to see their
environment as one that needs change. When people recognize a deficiency, they join a social movement to
convince others that their situation is intolerable and warrants change (Stewart et al., 2022). While altering
the social reality, people will use symbolic action to promote shared meanings, perceptions, and mobilization
within a social movement. The rhetoric of speeches, leaflets, pamphlets, newsletters, and social media posts
may be replaced by pickets, strikes, protests, sit-ins, and image events. Social symbols, such as gestures, acts,
signs, words, and signals, can stimulate action among people within a social movement or be used to recruit
others to join the movement. For instance, the clenched fist symbolized power, independence, pride, and self-
determination during the civil rights era. Within a social movement, symbols, such as a clenched fist, possess a
standard meaning and are a persuasive tool for expressing a thought or belief. Vox produced this video telling
the story behind the iconic silent protest at the Olympics.

  listened to their anthem bowing their heads and raising a fist with a black glove. Mexico City, Mexico,
  1968.

As with most forms of civic engagement, people can choose whether they want to participate in a social
movement. Contemplating the logic of collective action, Mancur Olson (1965) attached the common
assumption at the heart of group theory about the natural inclination of citizens to join action in their
collective interests. People who benefit from a social movement may not protest but rather "free ride" on
others' efforts (p. 53). Olson (1965) thought these people were rational - they would be "free riders" on
the efforts of others. He believed that to attract participants, movements must provide "selective incentives"
only to those who participate. Rational, self-interested individuals will not act to achieve common or group
interests. Even if all of the individuals in a large group are rational and self-interested and would gain if, as a
group, they acted to achieve their common interest or objective, they will still not voluntarily act to achieve
that common or group interest.

   When it comes to joining a social movement, social networks are seen as a precondition for the emergence
of a movement and an explanation for who is recruited. For instance, collective identity is a concept used
to get at the mental worlds of participants that might help explain participation: to devote time and effort to
protest. People must usually feel excited to be part of a larger group they think they can help. Now, remember
Olson (1965) argues that a rational person will not join a social movement and instead "free ride" on others'
efforts. Remember, activism as a form of civic engagement depends on ideological and social commitments
from members. As shown in the video below, Sam Peltzman at the Challey Institute discussed the legacy of
Mancur Olson's groundbreaking book.

In summary, activism encompasses diverse civic engagement practices within the public sphere, each aimed
at challenging injustices, advocating for change, and promoting social or political transformation. Social
movements employ various strategies, tactics, and forms of expression to advance their goals and amplify their
voices.

Civic Engagement in the Public Sphere: Political
200 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1

Engagement

Let's contemplate a second type of civic engagement--political engagement. This section will discuss rhetoric's
connection to political engagement by examining Dana Schutz's painting "Open Casket." The painting
reimagines the photo of Emmett Till in his casket following his horrific murder on August 28, 1955. When
he was 14, Till--a Chicago native--was killed by white men for allegedly whistling at a white woman during
his visit to Mississippi. The press's printing of images of Till's mutilated body and the acquittal of his killers
is credited as "having galvanized the Civic Rights movement in the U.S." (Muñoz-Alonso, 2017, para. 4).
NBC Chicago produced a docuseries about Emmett Till. In the segment, an investigative journalist traveled to
Mississippi to uncover unknown facts about Emmett's story.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=820#oembed-11

In 2017, Carolyn Bryant, who accused Till of flirting with her while she worked at her parent's grocery store,
disclosed that much of her testimony was false (Pérez-Peña, 2017). Six decades later, Diane Schultz painted her
interpretation of the iconic photograph. Schutz painted Till's face in the abstract (click here to see a jpeg file of
the oil on canvas). The smudges of paint were reminiscent of Till's face being left disfigured and unidentifiable
postmortem.

   "Open Casket" (2016) hung at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Schultz's painting
sparked conversations about cultural appropriation and prompted the question, "Do white artists have the
right to depict Black pain?" (Ejiofor et al., 2017, para. 1). The rhetor responded to the backlash by describing
her approach to depicting Till's disfigurement. She stated that the painting "is not a rendering of the
photograph but is more an engagement with the loss" (Ejiofor et al., 2017, para. 5).

   Schutz's painting also prompted backlash for its inclusion in the 2017 Whitney Biennial. Take a few minutes
to examine this image Scott W. H. Young captured and shared via Twitter. Parker Bright (the rhetor) wore a
shirt that read "Black Death Spectacle" while standing in front of the "Open Casket" and blocking the painting
from view (Sargent, 2017). The visual image of Bright obstructing others' views of the painting, coupled with
his shirt, advanced an argument that a white person was again using the Black death as a racialized spectacle
(Basciano, 2017). In this act of protest, Bright sought to shape the audience's social reality by using visual and
verbal symbols to represent it. Although this is an example of individual action, his rhetorical act contributed
to collective action that used rhetorical communication to develop solutions to political challenges (this is the
essence of civic engagement!).

   In this example, both rhetors were involved in political engagement. Schutz saw her painting as a response
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 1 | 201

to the number of African Americans killed by the police in recent years (Sargent, 2017). On the other hand,
Bright picketed the painting daily while barring visitors from viewing the rhetorical act. In both instances, the
rhetors possessed rhetorical agency by using a symbol--a body--to spark collective action. A body thus became
a symbol pregnant with meaningful intent that sought to persuade an audience. As such, both rhetors used
symbolic action to construct viewers' social realities.

Conclusion: Symbols, Symbolic Action, and Social Reality
in the Public Sphere

To review, symbols are objects, words, or images that represent or stand for something else, and their meanings
vary depending on context. Symbols have the power to evoke emotions and ideas and establish values. Symbols
construct our social reality by influencing how we perceive and interpret our environment. By understanding a
symbol's meaning and cultural frame, we better understand how symbols shape social interactions, identities,
and hierarchies that contribute to forming and reproducing a social reality. Symbols transcend language
barriers, resonate with people, and are practical tools for expressing identity, solidarity, or protest.

   Likewise, symbolic action uses symbols to convey meaning and communicate ideas. Symbolic action
provides a powerful means of communication that allows us to express complex ideas, emotions, or values
through visual rhetoric. This may be why we often see symbolic action at a protest or memorial site. Symbolic
actions shape and reflect our social reality by contributing to constructing meaning and identity. Analyzing
symbolic action, such as an activist's use of a symbol at a protest, helps rhetorical scholars understand the
intricate ways communication occurs within civic spaces. By examining symbols, we can uncover underlying
meanings, power dynamics, and discursive strategies individuals and groups employ to convey messages and
mobilize support.

   In closing, studying symbolic action provides insights into practical strategies for engaging citizens and
mobilizing collective action. By understanding how symbols resonate with different audiences and provoke
emotional responses, rhetors can design more compelling and inclusive engagement initiatives that inspire
participation and foster solidarity. Consequently, exploring symbolic action encourages creativity and
innovation in civic engagement practices.

CHAPTER 10: COUNTERPUBLICS

   Publics and Counterpublics

   Carlos A. Flores and Sarah E. Jones

The poster depicted in the above image was for a triennial exhibition with a neighborhood-based platform
that engaged "community organizing, conflicted politics, radical openings, and distressing developments"
that intertwined that location and its surroundings, and sought to "advance new contexts of liberation, care,
complexity, and dissent into the everyday spaces."

This chapter focuses on the relationship between theories of the public sphere and rhetorical theory. Engaging
in the study of rhetoric requires a thorough understanding of the public sphere, its impact on our
understanding of rhetoric, and the crucial role of audiences in this interplay. The first part of this chapter
presents a detailed history and foundational definitions of the public sphere. The second part explores critiques
and concerns related to the foundational concept of the public sphere, followed by the invaluable theory of
206 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

counterpublics. Finally, we conclude with a brief illustration of both publics and counterpublics through
several contemporary case studies.

Part 1: Defining Publics and Counterpublics

A key entry point to the concept of the public sphere is to envision it as a space of discussion and
argumentation, with relative emphasis on audiences. At its core, an argument is a communicative and
declarative act with the purpose of changing attitudes and behavior, which is a rudimentary element in public
spaces of deliberation and discussion. In their treatment of traditional argumentation concepts, Perelman and
Olbrechts-Tyteca (1969) assert that the quality of argumentation is best assessed by examining the audiences
that are being addressed. More specifically, in stating that "for all argumentation aims at gaining the adherence
of minds, and, by this very fact, assumes the existence of an intellectual contact" (p. 14), Perelman and
Olbrechts-Tyteca establish indispensable ground for the public sphere in terms of audiences needing to come
together in order to create and sustain rhetoric. Additionally, Thomas Goodnight's (1982) concept of
"argument spheres" was explicated to clearly situate the expectations of argument for both experts and lay
persons. For Goodnight, a sphere of argument symbolizes "branches of activity-the grounds upon which
arguments are built and the authorities to which arguers appeal" (p. 200). These three branches- personal,
technical, and public- establish the expectations for how arguments should be created and relayed to audiences
of various levels of knowledge, expertise, and lived experiences.

   These argument centric concepts run parallel to the public sphere's explicit conceptualization by
philosopher-scholar Jürgen Habermas in 1962. As he defined it, the public sphere represents the idea and
potential for individuals to discuss issues, topics, and matters of critical debate and importance. In a more
tangible sense, a public refers to an audience of individuals (voluntary or involuntary) who are the recipients
of rhetorical acts, one act being public opinion. Habermas drew from classical concepts such as the polis and
agora (the city-state and the marketplace, respectively) to develop the idea of the public, noting that these
are physical places where public activity occurs. However, public activity is not confined to these designated
areas, as a public act or event can range from participation in a courtroom to athletic competition. The
context or setting of publicness will shape and influence the type of public acts taking place. Habermas (1962)
argued that "publicity is the public carrier of public opinion; its function as a critical judge is precisely what
makes the public character of proceedings - in court, for instance - meaningful" (p. 2). Therefore, the public
sphere is often concerned with decision-making and actionable causes of state-sponsored structures and other
institutions responsible for producing and circulating local news.

   Based on Habermas's initial work, it stands to reason that anyone and everyone could participate in public-
sustaining activities. However, public participation is much more complex than meets the eye. If Habermas's
initial penning of the public sphere falls in the context of state-sanctioned activity and access to privileged
resources (e.g., print news), then it is also reasonable to assume that both barriers and challenges exist to
                                                                                               RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2 | 207

laypersons finding a way to participate. Thus, Habermas's conceptualization of the public sphere presents
important consequences for how we come to understand the communicative and rhetorical acts of
argumentation and deliberation, among others. In the following section, we detail some of the affordances and
drawbacks of Habermas's approach.

Affordances and Drawbacks of the Habermasian
Conceptualization

In its ideal form, the public sphere is open to all. According to Habermas, this is one of the self-understandings
of the public sphere--that there are ample opportunities to become "properly public" (p. 128), and to take
part in any activity relevant to the sustenance of a public. Thus, while the public sphere is not a concrete
concept, it takes concrete form (in people). In this way, Habermas's version of the public sphere is explicitly
linked to communication. Our understanding of the public sphere through Habermas is also historically
situated (both in the past and looking forward) and gives due credence to revolution (Habermas did not
endorse the deliberation argument theorists as "what it all boils down to").

   Despite these affordances of Habermas's principal conceptualization, there are important drawbacks. First,
Habermas is thought to have idealized the public sphere by rooting its conceptualization in monarchical states.
A necessarily critical perspective reveals that Habermas's public sphere tends to privilege the act of critical and
rational argument by those with access, status, and resources. This begs an important question: Who gets to
participate in the public sphere? Scholars including Hegel and Marx challenged Habermas on this level, as did
Negt and Kluge (1993). In their chapter, "On the dialectic between the bourgeois and the proletarian public
sphere," Negt and Kluge offered an exposé of the bourgeois ideology that motivated Habermas's idealization
of the public sphere. For Negt and Kluge, the use of dialectic in their work speaks to the use of competing
conceptualizations between the aforementioned bourgeois public sphere and its counterpart, the proletariat
public sphere. By adopting a Marxist perspective, both authors argue that focusing on the ideology of the
public sphere is, in actuality, a distraction from actual material conditions. Whereas the interests of those in
the bourgeois public sphere are given more focus and implementation, the interests of those belonging to the
proletariat public sphere are only made knowable if they are brought to the forefront as "living labor power" (p.
57). Among other trenchant critiques, they also challenge the degree to which the bourgeois order can be held
"in check"--"It cannot significantly be held in check by any separation of powers or procedural rules during
the political implementation of the bourgeois order'" (p. 54).

   A second (but related) drawback of Habermas's conceptualization lies in its discursive framing. Habermas's
conceptualization of the public sphere relies on colonial language but says little about colonialism itself. Marx,
for example, would argue that it is a delusion to think one can stand in for all of humanity as a classed
individual; that we ought to consider, "Who has the leisure time to become literate, to think, to take a horse and
carriage to the coffeehouse...?" Put differently, someone is making the products being bought, someone else's
labor is going on, and someone does not have the time to go to the coffeehouses or be invited to the salons. But
208 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

because coffee was this thing and coffeehouses were places--both symbols of empire-their existence and our
participation came out of forced labor. As a result, scholars have critiqued Habermas' writing of the emergence
of the public sphere for its failure to note how it was, at least in part, permissible because of plunder and forced
labor.

   Third, while Habermas was instrumental in conceptualizing the public sphere as a site for deliberation
and for the changing social worlds and imaginaries (starting from print media), the existence of historically
and geopolitically specific events and institutions made continued reliance on Habermas's conceptualization
difficult. This led to scholars "re-introducing" public sphere theory--"recast[ing] the public sphere in light
of global changes that have reorganized relations between nation-states and their peoples" (Bell, 2007, p. 2).
In the following subsection, we explore other scholars who have problematized the public sphere, how it is
constituted, and whose participation is awarded.

Beyond Habermas

John Dewey's "The Public and Its Problems" (published four decades before Habermas and, perhaps
consequently, less attributed) offers an equally compelling and arguably more flexible articulation of the public
sphere. Dewey's model of the public sphere is dynamic and emerges from the ground up, in contrast to
Habermas's view of the public sphere, which is more focused on institutions. At any time, we have multiple
publics at different stages of intensity, duration, and population, all different and in motion. A "public" can
emerge around very different issues using this formula. Thus, "the public" is a concept--a sense of collectivity
that has a lot of problems--and those publics self-articulate around various social issues. Where does "the
state" come into play? The state emerges when the public organizes itself and forms systems of governance and
formal positions, including officers. Thinking of this emergence in the form of an equation can be heuristically
helpful (though admittedly a bit reductive):

                     the state = the public + government/organization/regulation/officers
   Dewey's model is especially helpful for understanding the state's place within public sphere theory. If
the government is a material organization of the public (meaning, governance is a scalable principle of self-
organization), then it is clear that the state is not a goal, but a material outcome and consequence emanating
from the myriad activities undertaken by both the public and institutionally affiliated persons. This builds
off the argument by Greene (1998), who posited that "an articulation of a governing apparatus requires that
particular behaviors and populations become visible so that a program of action can intervene to improve
the happiness, longevity, and material welfare of a population" (p. 31). The ongoing actualization of the
state, which is brought about by said populations and representatives of governing apparatuses, must be
given careful attention when theorizing how the public sphere can be further imagined in our contemporary
societies. In the video below, Noam Chomsky (considered a founder of modern linguistics) discusses John
Dewey's ideas of a democratic society. Dewey is referenced numerous times in Chomsky's 2000 book, Mis-
Education.

In addition to Dewey's treatise on the public sphere, scholars such as Lauren Berlant, Nancy Fraser, and
Michael Warner have offered invaluable extensions to our understanding of the public sphere and its scope
for the citizens it seemingly represents. As a critical and political theorist, Berlant (1997) posited that many
of the issues rooted in discourses of citizenship and belonging in the United States (U.S.) point to the fact
that the "political public sphere has become an intimate public sphere" (p. 4). She cemented this claim further
by comparing the notion of an "intimate" public sphere in the present day U.S. to the intimate, bourgeois-
laden conceptualization coined by Habermas. She argued, "the intimate public sphere of the U.S. present
tense renders citizenship as a condition of social membership produced by personal acts and values" (p. 5).
More specifically, the social practices and values enacted within intimate and private settings are necessary
preconditions for participating in the public sphere. This, and many of the other claims Berlant offers are
within the context of Ronald Reagan's presidential administration, further animating Berlant's expansion of
the scope that public sphere theory can capture.

   Following a trajectory similar to that of Berlant, Nancy Fraser, a critical theorist, also pushed the bounds of
public sphere theory. She took particular issue with Habermas's idealized version of the public sphere-how it
excluded individuals from participating in public activity if they lacked access to resources, status, and power
in the public broadly. Rhetoric and public sphere scholars generally take care to label this version of the
public sphere, as made by Habermas, the "bourgeois public sphere." In her 1992 chapter titled "Rethinking
the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of Actually Existing Democracy," Fraser argued that past
iterations of the public sphere were not only bourgeois but also masculinist and needed to undergo "some
critical interrogation and reconstruction if it is to yield a category capable of theorizing the limits of actually
existing democracy" (p. 111). To that end, Fraser offered a fresh set of truths about the consequences and
opportunities of the public sphere: (1) the public sphere requires participants to set aside (or bracket) their
varied statuses to be considered "equal" participants in the public; (2) having multiple publics is detrimental
(not beneficial) to democracy, as others have argued; (3) only matters of public (not private) interest should
benefit the common good; and (4) a fully working public sphere necessitates a separation between society and
the state (pp. 117-118).

   Fraser's expansion of public sphere theory highlights how those who aspire to be included in the public are
marginalized from Habermas's original conceptual model of the public sphere (through formal and informal
impediments) and are thereby excluded from being part of the public (leading to ostracization and broader
social inequity). Indeed, it is a lofty assumption that two or more interlocutors can and should set aside their
210 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

statuses and positions of influence to be deemed as participants on equal footing in the public when this alleged
"bracketing" only serves as a structural obstacle to remind participants (specifically, those with less influence)
of the stakes they have in spaces of discussion, deliberation, and action. This bracketing, however, is an all too
common feature of what Fraser referred to as "stratified societies" or characteristics "whose basic institutional
framework generates unequal social groups in structural relations of dominance and subordination" (p. 122).

   Additionally, Michael Warner (2002b) presented a variety of criteria delineating the construction of publics
and counterpublics. For the constitution of publics, Warner outlined seven distinct criteria that are
indispensable for how we come to imagine the scope and boundaries of publics: (1) publics are self-organized;
(2) a public is a relation amongst strangers; (3) the address of public speech is both personal and impersonal;
(4) a public is constituted through mere attention; (5) a public is the social space created by the reflexive
circulation of discourse; (6) publics act historically according to the temporality of their circulation; and (7)
a public is poetic world-making. Taking all of these criteria together, the creation and circulation of publics
are best considered in relation to their placements in various social imaginaries, rather than confining them
into bounded spaces and places. Warner's treatment of publics is also accompanied by an examination of how
they take on the form of being "counter" or "oppositional," especially when accounting for what subordinate
statuses they carry (Warner, 2002b, p. 86). Given how often said statuses are subsumed in personal identities
and histories, both of which are brought to the forefront of modern political affairs, the constructions of
publics and counterpublics, as well as the dynamic between public and private matters, are complementary and
poignant expansions of Habermas's public sphere theory.

   "Where do we go from here?" one might ask. When those who are strategically and institutionally pushed
to the margins of society are not afforded meaningful opportunities to become members of their public
spaces and places, we must turn to counterpublics, which seek to define the outlets, resources, and settings for
marginalized individuals to convey and communicate their needs and interests in opposition to the forces that
attempt to contain them. We will explore this premise in the next section.

Counterpublics

Counterpublics can be thought of as alternative or oppositional publics: publics that perceive themselves
to differ significantly from or exist in conflict with the dominant public. (It should be noted, however,
that this reference to perception is not without controversy. Robert Asen (2000) argued that we should
consider material dynamics when determining a counterpublic because a definition of counterpublic that relies
on perception keeps it open to any community who perceives itself as being marginalized.) In addition to
Fraser, Warner, and Asen, various other scholars have worked to crystallize the scope of publics and rhetoric
broadly and extend the theorizing of counterpublics, including but not limited to: Daniel Brouwer, Karma
Chavez, Rita Felski, Gerard Hauser, Kent Ono, Catherine Squires, John Sloop, and Marcia Stephenson.
Collectively, these scholars have illustrated how marginalized persons and communities work to be seen as
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2 | 211

meaningful public agents in contexts such as citizenship and vernacular discourse, both of which help to push
the boundaries of theorizing publics and counterpublics in generative and malleable ways.

Features of Counterpublics

We now continue with defining and highlighting the key features of a counterpublic. As shown in the video
below, one key feature of counterpublics is that they leverage responses to hegemony (hedge-eh-moh-nee), which
refers to the dominance of an idea, ideology, institution, or economic distribution of capital. As explained by
Tom Nichols in the video below, the theory of hegemony is often attributed to Antonio Gramsci, whose work
has been used to characterize the public sphere as a space defined by hegemony.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=839#oembed-2

Fraser's conceptualization of counterpublic activity is constructive for understanding the hegemonic dialectic
between publics and counterpublics. In her influential 1992 chapter, Fraser framed counterpublics as "parallel
discursive arenas" in which members of subordinated social groups "invent and circulate counterdiscourses"
which allows them to "formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs" (p. 67).
In other words, counterpublics emerge as a response to exclusions of the public sphere (what Fraser referred to
as "dominant publics") and as a result, help "expand discursive space" (something very beneficial in a stratified
society). Take late 20th century feminism, for example. According to Fraser,

      ...feminist women have invented new terms for describing social reality, including `sexism,' `the double shift,'
      `sexual harassment,' and `marital, date, and acquaintance rape.' Armed with such language, we have recast our
      needs and identities, thereby reducing, although not eliminating, the extent of our disadvantage in official public
      spheres.

Counterpublics can be wide in scope and unique in function. A counterpublic may function first as space
for retreat or comfort and later, as a vessel for protest. This is what Fraser referred to as the "dual character"
of counterpublics in stratified societies. In one sense, counterpublics "function as spaces of withdrawal and
regroupment." In another sense, they also "function as bases and training grounds for agitational activities
directed toward wider publics" (p. 68). The dialectic between these two functions, Fraser argued, is precisely
where the emancipatory potential of counterpublics resides. Participation in publics and counterpublics are
not linear and one-note (e.g., solely protesting), but instead indicative of individuals' capacity for
demonstrating rhetorical action in various ways. The birth of a public also gives way to human agency-the act
212 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

of picking and choosing what issues one opposes or which counterpublics one joins (Brouwer, 2006; Warner,
2002a). Broadly, a public's capacity to evince agency paves the way for members to take up a participatory spirit
to act in ways that speak to their sustenance and prevalence in malleable and constitutive ways (Campbell,
2005). In turn, this affords them the benefit of participating in multiple publics through strategies and
methods that are accessible and meaningful in their own right.

   Like Fraser and these other scholars, there are other theoretical perspectives that can help us to understand
the communicative dynamics of counterpublics. The video below features Cheris Kramarae, a scholar of
women's studies and communication known for her work with Muted Group Theory. Muted Group Theory
originated in the field of anthropology, and posits that marginalized groups are often `muted' in public
discourse because there is no language to describe their experiences. In this video, fellow communication
scholar, Em Griffin, interviews Kramarae about Muted Group Theory and the function of power in language.
The conversation reinforces the significance of Fraser's notion of counterpublics as "parallel discursive arenas"
that "expand discursive space" and reduce disadvantage.

Counterpublics are not inherently synonymous with social movements. However, the two are commonly
connected for many reasons. According to Warner (2002b), when a counterpublic turns toward the state and
says, "We're going to engage with you," it becomes intelligible as a social movement. In other words, a social
movement is a counterpublic that addresses the state and may seek recognition in more or less explicit or
institutional ways. Recognition of a counterpublic may be legal - for instance, being recognized with rights of
citizenship - or refutative - in the sense that the state may acknowledge a counterpublic's existence but not its
legitimacy. As referenced in the previous section, Warner also maintained that publics and counterpublics are
not timeless. They can only act "within the temporality of the circulation that gives it existence," which means
that counterpublics' existence is limited by the circulation of discourse by and about them (p. 68). Finally,
although all counterpublics are publics, not all publics are counterpublics. Similarly, all social movements must
involve at least one counterpublic, but not every counterpublic will rise to the level of a social movement.

The Limits of `Counterpublics'

Given the features of counterpublics reviewed thus far, it would be easy to define counterpublics as composed
of certain types of people or constituted through particular events. However, Asen and Brouwer (2001) and
Squires (2002) have encouraged caution, arguing instead that the definition of "counterpublics" requires
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2 | 213

greater conceptual clarity. Asen (2000) has argued for definitional clarity by raising concerns about overly
fixing the core terminology of the public sphere and encourages critics to attend to "the discursive qualities of
counterpublics when considering how they set themselves against wider publics" (p. 437). If we are trying to
determine what deserves the notion of "counterpublic," then Asen would argue that we should look for a set
of dynamics rather than a meticulous set of persons, places, or things.

   While warnings about reducing counterpublics to identity (or places or topics, for Asen) represent valid
concerns, Stephenson (2002) reminded us in her work on indigenous counterpublic spheres that identity often
does matter to counterpublics and can be claimed as a strategic use. Indeed, "counterpublic" can be understood
less as a static, noun-like `object' or `thing' and more as an active, verb-like act of identity-making. In Felski's
(1989) essay on the feminist public sphere, she argued that feminism is both a public and a counterpublic
with internal, external, and collective functions that are important for identity-making. Internally, it is a space
of discursive opposition rooted in shared identity and solidarity in the mutual experience of gender-based
oppression and its effects. Externally, its goal is to spread feminist values throughout society. Collectively,
the space is rooted in the active social agent--women's everyday experiences--so overlapping subgroups are
coalitional. Also important to Felski's conceptualization of the feminist public sphere is the claim that no
space is free from the influence and power hierarchies imposed by ideological structures. McLaughlin (2004)
exemplified this principle when she argued that while feminists have indeed preserved the emancipatory
potential of the public sphere, we must push current boundaries and take a more transnational perspective.
In other words, we must consider how integrated global spaces shape women's lives and understand that not
everyone has the resources to divide their lives into private and public. McLaughlin felt that the public sphere's
failure to take a transnational perspective was not inherent, but a simple problem of imagination. For example,
if the `private' is seen as pre-political, we miss that the private sphere is actually structured by patriarchy; and if
we treat this as a problem of imagination, we have the agency to engage it. Whether we exercise our agency to
work inside or outside the institution, both are potentially radical.

   Much counterpublic theory in the last decade has focused on counterpublics as spaces of retreat and
strategizing--for example, Chavez's (2011) work on counterpublic enclaves and coalitions, calling back to
a social movement-based understanding of counterpublics. DeLuca and Peeples (2002) also introduced the
concept of "the public screen" to make sense of how mediated and online contexts are conducive in yielding
direct, counterpublic practices. Lastly, Jackson and Foucault-Welles's (2015) work on the 2014 hijacking of the
#MyNYPD public relations campaign highlighted the mediated iteration of counterpublics. When we move
counterpublics from physical spaces to mediated ones, what does counterpublic activity look like? The viral
2014 #YesAllWomen campaign (a response to #notallmen, a line often used to deflect feminist arguments
against misogyny and male violence) is another recent example. In the following section, we offer an extended
case study of counterpublic activity grounded in the uniquely American epidemic of school shootings.
   214 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

 Case Study: Counterpublics and the Students of Marjory
 Stoneman Douglas High School

  In February 2018, a teenage gunman carried out one of the most stark and tragic mass shootings in U.S.
  history at the time. Located in Parkland, Florida, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSDHS) was
  the site of a mass shooting in which former student Nikolas Cruz took the lives of 17 people (14 students
  and three school staff). The shooting sparked national mourning for the lives lost, as well as several demands
  for action so that future incidents could be prevented at other schools and public places broadly. From this
  tragedy emerged an organization and movement known as March for Our Lives (MFOL), founded by a small
  cadre of Parkland survivors who responded to the shooting by demanding concrete changes to gun legislation
  (March for Our Lives, 2024). MSDHS students X González1 and David Hogg were thrust into the spotlight
  through their activism and efforts to challenge the status quo of legislation and policy that led to this mass
  shooting. González and Hogg were both seniors at the time of the shooting. They rapidly became faces of
  the movement for stronger gun control legislation, often clashing with elected U.S. officials, members of the
  National Rifle Association (NRA), and even former President Donald Trump. González is most notably
  known for delivering a rousing and empowering speech, which is now colloquially known as the "We call BS!"
  address, a mere three days after the shooting took place. Hogg, in collaboration with González and other high
  school classmates, also founded the advocacy group Never Again MSD in anticipation of the 2018 midterm
  elections. The organization aimed to publicly support legislation and political candidates that vehemently
  opposed the status quo-policies and platforms that directly and indirectly favored gun ownership and a lack
  of gun control.

1. In their immediate activism following the Parkland shooting, González was represented by a different first name. González
  came out as nonbinary in May 2021 (using they/them pronouns) and re-emerged as "X." We honor their identity
  throughout the chapter.

Almost six years after this tragic day, González and Hogg graduated from college. As explained in the following
subsections, their rhetorical acts (and the Never Again movement writ large) have left a lasting impact on
American politics, offering an example of the relationship between the public, counterpublics, and their
respective rhetorics.

Youth as "Fighting Their Way into the Public"

As discussed earlier in the chapter, Habermas's idealization of the public sphere was motivated by bourgeois
ideology-it privileged the act of critical and rational argument by those with status, access, and resources.
But a public sphere that is contingent on material conditions like a certain class or legal status is limiting
in damaging ways. First, it means "the public" will always restrict certain members from attaining elected
positions and other forms of full democratic participation. Second, it significantly constrains prospective or
aspirational membership by "everyday" people and disadvantaged communities-those folks most likely to be
216 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

affected by rhetorics and policies of "the state" or state-like apparatuses (e.g., the agora in ancient Greece or the
courtroom).

   In the case of the Parkland youth, we are intrigued by how their voices have been strategically pushed to the
side despite being thrust into the national spotlight. Such a spotlight is often thought of and reserved for older
adults and people in positions of influence. Before the mass shooting at MSDHS, these young students did
not have access to institutional or formal means of public participation outside of their high school education.
Nevertheless, the Parkland youth launched March for Our Lives (MFOL) just one month after the tragedy
to energize and mobilize young students to generate meaningful change on the issue of gun violence. Their
mission statement affirms this commitment.

      Born out of a tragic school shooting, March for Our Lives is a courageous youth-led movement dedicated to
      promoting civic engagement, education, and direct action by youth to eliminate the epidemic of gun violence (March
      for Our Lives, 2024).

March for Our Lives (MFOL) led a series of events following the shooting, which allowed it to engage with over
two million voting-age youth. The most notable example was the 2018 march on Washington, D.C., which
brought out over 70,000 participants and sparked almost 400 auxiliary marches nationwide.

March for Our Lives (MFOL) has also been at the forefront of numerous other initiatives, such as
commissioning polling research to gauge young people's opinions on gun violence issues and legislation and
organizing a march in Texas following the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.

   Outside the scope of the formal organization, individual youth have exercised rhetorical agency in their
desire to be recognized and seen as members of the public. In his speech at the 2018 march on Washington
D.C., David Hogg called attention to the importance of making gun legislation and violence a voting issue:

      "When people try to suppress your vote and there are people who stand against you because you are too young,
      we say no more. When politicians say your voice doesn't matter because the NRA owns them, we say no more.
      When politicians send their thoughts and prayers, we say no more. And to those politicians supported by the
      NRA that allow the continued slaughter of our children and our future, I say get your resumes ready!"

At the core of this speech, Hogg made concerted efforts to encourage young persons (particularly those of
voting age) to set their critiques and sights on the very state that strategically chooses to ignore their position
as members of a public. By taking elected officials to task and mobilizing young people to engage with the state
broadly, Hogg pushed toward the possibility of a democratic society that has long excluded young people.

   Hogg's friend and co-conspirator, X González, is most notable for their prolific "We Call BS!" speech, in
which they both allude to the tragedy of the shooting and its effect on young people and take to task state
218 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

politicians (backgrounded by the U.S. Congress writ large) for allowing laws and conditions around firearm
procurement to continue.

González's ability to be deemed as a legitimate and worthy member of the public is on full display. First,
González noted at the start of their speech that they were relying on notes from their AP Government
class to deliver their address. Second, González exercised their political knowledge and claim-making abilities
throughout the speech-from calling out the NRA's harmful impact on the political process to calling out
former President Donald Trump for repealing an Obama-era regulation that prevented the sale of firearms to
persons with mental distress. In short, González positioned themselves as a legitimate political interlocutor and
member of the public through their address. Moreover, González demonstrated their agency by pushing back
against the state.

   In addition to their skill in political rhetoric, González used the speech as an opportunity to reveal young
people's power and potential. In reflecting on the haunting juxtaposition of the day's events and their
involvement in school activities, González declared:

      "Instead of worrying about our AP Gov chapter 16 test, we have to be studying our notes to make sure that our
      arguments based on politics and political history are watertight. The students at this school have been having
      debates on guns for what feels like our entire lives. AP Gov had about three debates this year. Some discussions
      on the subject even occurred during the shooting while students were hiding in the closets. The people involved
      right now, those who were there, those posting, those tweeting, those doing interviews and talking to people, are
      being listened to for what feels like the very first time about this topic that has come up over 1,000 times in the
      past four years alone."

Throughout their public address, González pushed against the perceptions, assumptions, and stereotypes that
come with possessing youthful identities. Harkening back to Dewey's idea of a more dynamic and organic
public sphere, we can see that the youth of Parkland and their rhetorical acts are carried out despite (not in
complement to) the very state and state-like institutions that have refused to do the necessary work to protect
students from school shootings (i.e., contending with the very laws that lead to these events in the first place).
The rhetorical acts of the Parkland youth are unique and extraordinary because the victims and survivors were
at or just under the age of 18 at the time these events unfolded - the age most often associated with "coming
into adulthood" and being afforded adult responsibilities (e.g., voting and enlisting in the military). The youth
affected by the shooting can therefore be seen as strategically negotiating their membership to both a public
and counterpublic that are complementary to each other. On the one hand, there is membership to a public
                                                                                                RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2 | 219

that is afforded through the aforementioned identity of adulthood. On the other hand, these youth have been
thrust into a counterpublic marked by their age and being minimized by more dominant publics for their age
and alleged naivete.

   In this way, Hogg and González (as well as their youthful colleagues and contemporaries) can be seen as
participating in two distinct counterpublics. First, these youth were made to justify their belonging to the
public sphere when many individuals and institutions simultaneously downplayed their stances and calls to
action, as well as chalked up their displeasures to students' young age and seemingly not knowing any better.
Drawing from Fraser's (1992) argument of why "bracketed" identities in publics are incommensurate with
the conceptualizations of publics that actually exist, these young individuals proved themselves capable of
illustrating how the power dynamics between themselves and the very persons and entities they were protesting
against were not conducive to a fully representative public sphere. By situating the identity category of "youth"
as a counterpublic, we can see how those outside the threshold of adulthood are often regarded by those who
think very little of their political and personal agency.

   Second, the Parkland youth were at the heart of a counterpublic born out of need, grief, and intimacy in the
wake of the mass shooting, reflective of Warner's (2002b) characterizations of how a public is capable of both
self-organization and deeply personal address. This counterpublic has become a significant force and legitimate
social movement enmeshed with American politics and the fight towards common sense gun reform. Yet, at
the time, this counterpublic was "written off" from the folds of public life due to the fact that many of its
members were minors. Both Hogg and González made it a stark point in their public addresses to situate their
youth not as an obstacle, but instead as an affordance - one that positioned them as legible and competent
members of the publics to which they sought to belong. They pushed for agentic, rhetor-centered discourse
and fought to justify their statuses as worthy political participants, despite being written off by detractors. We
view this as emblematic of the out-law in vernacular discourse, as articulated by Sloop and Ono (1997). They
argued that for out-law discourses, "the logic of the out-law must constantly be searched for, brought forth,
given the opportunity to disrupt operating discourses and practices that always work to enable and confine"
(p. 66). To that end, both Hogg and González sought to accentuate their youthful status so that publics far and
wide could conceptualize, in actuality, that burgeoning members of the public need not hold literal positions
of power, have inherited status, or possess access to resplendent resources.

Articulating Counterpublic Complexity and Multiplicity

At a town hall hosted by CNN, the Parkland youth met face-to-face with elected Republican officials and
leadership from the NRA, eager and prepared to take these individuals to task for what had happened at
MSDHS. González questioned NRA spokesperson, Dana Loesch, on the organization's position on "bump
stock attachments" and the difficulty (or lack thereof) in buying automatic weapons. Cameron Kasky (a
junior) challenged Florida Senator, Marco Rubio, to turn down future campaign donations from the NRA.
Ryan Deitsch (a senior) vividly narrated his experience doing active shooter drills to Senator Rubio, all while
220 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

expressing concern that he and other youth have to lead the fight for gun control. The event (and many others
following) evidenced how Parkland youth bore the burden of being seen as legitimate members of the public,
only to be rejected or minimized in their attempts. While the efforts of these young rhetorical agents have been
lauded and acknowledged by many, it is important to situate the scope of their actions within counterpublic
theory. As previously described, counterpublics are a necessary extension of the public sphere when the needs,
wants, values, and experiences of marginalized persons are not heard or affirmed by those in the dominant
public. We can apply this oppositional dynamic inherent to counterpublics to the case of the Parkland youth
and their various rhetorical acts. In doing so, we can examine how they accomplished and performed their
counterpublicity.

   In May 2018, a group of student protesters staged a series of "die-ins" at Publix supermarkets in Florida.
The purpose of these die-ins was to publicize the fact that Publix supported gubernatorial candidate, Adam
Putnam, who received financial backing from the NRA. Die-ins are a protest strategy dating back as far back
as the 1940s, in which people stage a non-violent demonstration in a widely public space to bring attention
to an issue of importance. This protest strategy has roots in the Civil Rights Movement, where staging die-ins
was used as a key method of voicing one's opposition to racial violence and force. The strategy is also used to
increase awareness and demand that dissenters be seen by the public at large. In the aftermath of the die-ins
by Parkland youth, a spokesperson for Publix announced the supermarket chain would temporarily "halt its
contributions" to Putnam's campaign while re-evaluating their plans (Associated Press, 2018, para. 5).

   Another rhetorical act was staged when students across the U.S. held school walkouts in the month
following the Parkland shooting. Over 3,000 walkouts were held at exactly 10:00 AM and lasted exactly 17
minutes - the 17 minutes a symbolic reference to the exact duration of the shooting at MSDHS. While the
time of day and duration of the walkouts were the same across the board, each varied in the dynamic actions
performed. Students in Washington, D.C., gathered outside the White House with protest signs and chanted
for stricter gun control. Never Again founder David Hogg amplified his message by livestreaming his walkout
in Florida. A neighboring school in Parkland, Cooper City High, created an installment featuring 14 student
desks and three podiums representing the students and staff whose lives were lost.

   As Asen and Brouwer (2001) explained, "counterpublics will differ with regard to density, complexity,
breadth, and access to resources and power; they may be episodic, enduring, or abstract" (p. 10). In other
words, counterpublics possess a critical flexibility-something unmistakable in this case study of the Parkland
youth. Through situations of public dissent and oppositionality, youth both near and far demonstrated their
ability to organize as dynamic and malleable counterpublic entities, their ability to go to great lengths to
demand validation for a public, and their ability to apprehend the attention of a state that tried to disregard
or minimize those attempts at validation. Even to this present day, the youth of Parkland (and the hundreds of
other young people who have experienced school shootings and other forms of gun violence) have continued
their activism and efforts to challenge the state, ensuring that their counterpublic positioning remains alive and
well.

Hogg and Gonzalez

One final line of inquiry in this case study comes from the publicness of both Hogg and González-both
rhetorical actors and key faces of the Never Again movement. As delineated below, both rhetors navigated their
being catapulted in the varied degrees of publicness in ways distinct to their activist aims and multifaceted
identities. Calling back to the argument that publics and counterpublics will vary in their complexity and
forms, we argue that the dynamic nature of counterpublics can be extended to individual members of the
public, such as Hogg and González.

   David Hogg has not been a stranger to the public spotlight following the events of Parkland. Since 2018,
he has been at the forefront of different activities and events, including but not limited to publishing the
book #Never Again: A New Generation Draws the Line with his sister, Lauren Hogg; being verbally accosted
by Georgia Congresswoman, Marjorie Taylor Greene, near the U.S. Capitol; declaring his intent to run for
Congress when he reaches the minimum age of 25; and more recently, graduating from Harvard in 2023.
Hogg's engagement with the public can be characterized as active and aggressive towards the persons and
entities that seek to discredit him and his validity as a public figure.

   Soon after the shooting in 2018, Hogg caught the attention of Fox News host, Laura Ingraham. The host
publicly shamed Hogg on Twitter (now known as "X"), making light of the fact that he was rejected from
the universities he was most interested in attending: "David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He
Applied and whines about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance rates.)."
The public call-out drew both attention and criticism from audiences who took issue with a national television
host using their platform to shame a young person. However, Hogg did not sit idly by during this attack on his
livelihood. Instead, he took to Twitter and called out Ingraham in a message stating: "sooo @ingrahamangle
what are your biggest advertisers. Asking for a friend. #BoycottIngramAdverts." Hogg followed this up with
another tweet containing a list of companies that provide advertisements for Ingraham's show, encouraging his
audiences to contact said companies to voice their displeasure over Ingraham's behavior and demeanor. The
list included notable companies such as Hulu, Nestle, Wayfair, AT&T, and Liberty Mutual, among others.
Between March 28 (the date Hogg's initial tweet was circulated) and April 2, 15 companies announced they
would remove their advertisements from Ingraham's show, with some companies offering up pointed PR
statements to accompany their action. For example, the spokeswoman for the furniture company Wayfair
stated:

      "As a company, we support open dialogue and debate on issues. However, the decision of an adult to personally
      criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our
      values. We do not plan to continue advertising on this particular program."

In the heat of the feedback, Ingraham shared a message on Twitter apologizing to Hogg, stating, "Any student
should be proud of a 4.2 GPA --incl. @DavidHogg111. On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize
for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland." Hogg rejected Ingraham's
222 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

attempted apology shortly afterward while also reiterating his goal in calling for the advertising boycott. He
asserted he would not stop until "you denounce the way your network has treated my friends and I in this
fight. It's time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children." Although this occurrence followed a similar
pattern with other Fox News broadcasters (e.g., Sean Hannity and former host Bill O'Reilly) who faced ad
boycotts, this was more pointed because Hogg seized upon the public's support to enact material change and
opposition towards a news network and its representative who had systemically denounced young people and
their gun control activism. As a rhetorical agent, Hogg demonstrated an uncanny ability to purposefully and
meaningfully mobilize the public sphere.

   In contrast to Hogg, X González took a completely different trajectory in navigating their surge into
the public light. It stands to reason that González became the most immediately recognizable figure of the
Never Again movement, particularly for their "We Call BS!" speech and engaging in a debate with NRA
representative Dana Loesch, among others. These occasions would be enough to imbue immense pressure on
any young person in the aftermath of tragedy. Indeed, González's account of this aftereffect signals how public
and counterpublic activity is not only direct and confrontational but can also be marked by moments of retreat
and reflection. In an article written for "The Cut" magazine, X poignantly shared how their involvement
with organizing after Parkland fundamentally shaped and altered their current livelihood and their renewed
approach to activism, their entry into college being a particular space of change.

   X González had expressed an overall desire to distance themselves from the identity with which they were
most associated at Parkland and in the early national spotlight. They would soon start their time at New
College in Florida, an educational space known to be friendly to queer, trans, and nonbinary students like
them. Recounting their initial entry into New College, X said an unnamed individual circulated an e-mail to
the student body asking that no one bother X so that X could have a regular college experience. "I still don't
know who did that for me," X wrote, "but I'm grateful." As a college student away from the spotlight, X found
a life removed from the pressures and expectations of public-facing activism.

   Having been the face of a blossoming counterpublic and rising to immediate acclaim, fame, and notoriety,
X González spoke from vivid personal experience when they acknowledged that such a trajectory would be
overwhelming for any young person. Given that stress and public pressure, X sought to find ways to shed
some of their previous identity and come into their own outside of the demanding spaces of Parkland. We find
X's efforts to build a life for themselves outside of their Parkland-rooted activism as symbolic of the critical
need for counterpublic participants to engage in rest as a counterpublic act. Indeed, as Fraser (1992) theorized,
counterpublics are not unidimensional in character-they can function as spaces of "withdrawal" (retreating)
or "regroupment" (strategizing) just as they can also function as spaces for "agitational activities" (protesting).
For many, that rest may also bring clarity. In that same article written for "The Cut," X explained:

      "In the queer space of New College, changing your pronouns, name, or presentation is a nonevent. I knew I
      wanted to go by a different name, something that would give me space and get me away from the identity thrown
      on TV screens that made people think they knew me. I settled on X (inspired by Malcolm X) and realized in the
                                                                                               RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2 | 223

      process that the reason I didn't like being known as Emma is partially because that person belongs to the public
      but also partially because it's such a feminine name. I realized then that I'm nonbinary."

González's retreat from the public eye is a profoundly personal rhetorical act. Specifically, their desire to come
into an identity wholly separate from the public's grasp over the name "Emma" was made possible by stepping
away from the confines of their public activism. In one of the more pointed turns of the article mentioned
above, X shared how they have returned to participating in activism once more, though not directly tied to the
issue of gun violence in schools. They recalled how March for Our Lives (MFOL) rallied together for another
demonstration to commemorate the anniversary of the shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida.
Their speech at this event was notably more profane than their previous public addresses and signaled a shift
in how they see themselves as a rhetorical agent who has come into their own.

      "All the other times I've given a speech, I've kept it PG. But this time, I could not have given less of a shit about
      seeming like a morally upright person. Me and my friends did everything we were supposed to, and shootings
      still happen every day. I have nothing to hide or reshape to get my point across. I have a handle on who I am now,
      and I know how I want to be perceived. The audience was with me. The failure of our government is all too easy
      to see. We needed to carry our voices over the lawn of the Monument through the halls of Congress and into the
      ears of our representatives."

Since the Parkland youths' ascent into the public sphere, it seems evident that X González's navigation
through that public sphere and all of its pressures has been drastically different from that of their friend and
co-conspirator, David Hogg. Both are capable rhetorical actors who have more than proven their capacity
for broadly participating in the public. However, González offers an invaluable reminder that public and
counterpublic activity need not be linear and direct. Instead, public and counterpublic activity can also be a
non-linear, fragmented, and deeply personal experience that expands how we conceptualize and wrestle with
the many forms that membership in such collectives can take on.

Part 2: Case Studies in Counterpublic Rhetoric

Below, we offer three additional case studies as prompts in hopes that their examples will sharpen, clarify,
and apply concepts during your continued instruction on public sphere theory. Beyond Parkland, other, less-
publicized events also reflect meaningful counterpublic resistance. As you read through each of the three
additional case studies below, consider the following: How do these spaces constitute counterpublics? What
systematic disruption of the public occurred? To what extent did youth in these spaces successfully apprehend
and sustain the attention of the state? Finally, what implications do these case studies have for public sphere
theory?
224 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

Case 1: The Fierce Five

In 2016, current and former members of the USA women's gymnastics team came forward to report
widespread abuse at the hands of Larry Nassar publicly. Nassar, a team physician employed by Michigan State
University and USA Gymnastics, used his trusted medical position to assault and molest over 500 gymnasts
under the guise of medical treatment. Over 150 women gave impact statements in court describing how they
sought treatment from Nassar for sports injuries as minors; instead, he sexually assaulted them and claimed
it was a form of treatment. The abuse spanned two decades but was ignored by the organizations mentioned
above, as well as the U.S. Olympic Committee. A subsequent lawsuit brought by 90 victims further revealed
that the FBI possessed credible complaints and corroborating evidence of Nassar's extensive abuse but was
"grossly derelict" in their duties-declining to interview gymnasts, failing to transfer the complaint to Nassar's
employers or report child abuse to relevant authorities, and lying to Congress (Casarez et al., 2022). The 2019
documentary "At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal" chronicles the criminal case and

The stories shared by current and former competitors, alongside the official results of the cases, served as
catalysts for a larger movement advocating for systemic change within USA Gymnastics and allied
organizations. The 2012 and 2016 Gold Medal teams, known respectively as "The Fierce Five" and "The Final
Five," became recognizable symbols of the movement. Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, and Gabby Douglas were
central figures.

Survivors like Aly Raisman and Simone Biles continue to engage in advocacy on behalf of victims of sexual
abuse and put public pressure on USA Gymnastics to focus on athletes' physical safety and mental well-being
(often citing their mental health challenges, including depression, as a result of the abuse they suffered). An
attorney who has represented Nassar survivors told ABC News, "The changes that matter to the athletes
honestly are because Simone insisted on it" (Lenthang, 2021, para. 31). Indeed, she and other survivors said
they were not satisfied with investigations. Until there are meaningful reforms, Raisman said, "we can't believe
in a future that's safe for the sport" (Lenthang, 2021, para. 22).

Case 2: Menstrual Equity

In 2015, we witnessed a sharp rise in public rallies, legislative activism, and community advocacy to end period
stigma and curb "period poverty." Period poverty refers to inadequate access to menstrual education, hygiene
products, and sanitation infrastructure. In addition to general health concerns, advocates say period poverty
contributes to chronic absenteeism, as well as mental and emotional stress. According to the Alliance for Period
Supplies, two in five (40 percent) of people in the U.S. experience period poverty. These problems are also
well-documented around the globe. The movement for menstrual equity was and continues to be led by teens
nationwide (Silva, 2022). Many youth leaders started mission-driven organizations to generate awareness of
period poverty and expand accessibility to menstrual hygiene products. For example, Nadya Okamoto founded
the non-profit PERIOD. when she was just 15 years old. The organization, whose impact is now global,
maintains a youth advisory council responsible for governance. It is tasked with providing strategic advice to
its Board of Directors and staff on decision-making and program design.
                                                                                               RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2 | 227

The inaccessibility of menstrual hygiene products is known to be due, in part, to the "tampon tax"-a local tax
(imposed by a state, county, or city government) collected on the retail purchase of such products. This sales
tax denotes menstrual hygiene products like tampons or pads as luxury items (as opposed to groceries). As a
result, these medically necessary products can cost an individual hundreds of extra dollars in taxes per year (on
top of the $6,000 they spend on the products before tax during their lifetime).

   Advocates have focused much of their efforts on repealing the "tampon tax" in numerous states, which
they argue constitutes a discriminatory economic burden-one that contributes further to issues like isolation
and infection. According to Period Law, 29 states are now tax-free thanks to volunteer attorneys, state-based
advocates, and national period equity organizations working to advance state and federal period equity policies
(sometimes via class action lawsuits). Meanwhile, 21 states are not tax-free, which advocates say allows local
governments to profit from people's periods. Period Law estimates that repealing the "tampon tax" in these
states would net $82 million in annual savings. In tandem with repealing this tax, advocates have lobbied for the
federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to cover the total cost of period products.

   Youth continue to be instrumental in advocating for changes to laws and policies involving essential
accessibility of period products in schools and prisons. Indeed, a core goal of the menstrual equity movement
228 | RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2

is to make period products freely available in all public school restrooms, prisons and jails, and restrooms of
public buildings. Concerning schools, they argue that period products should be available in all bathrooms
so transgender students are not excluded. As of 2024, 28 states and Washington D.C. have expanded access
to period products in schools with well over 100 bills being considered by other state legislatures (check out
this interactive map of menstrual equity legislation from the Alliance for Period Supplies). Teen-led groups are
also highly active in hosting local period product drives and establishing community-based period distribution
programs to meet individuals' immediate needs.

   Notably, advocates say the movement for menstrual equity does not exist in isolation. In a 2022 interview
with Stateline, Jennifer Weiss-Wolf argued, "There's so much regressive action happening in state legislatures
right now when it comes to abortion, when it comes to trans rights and health, when it comes to education,
that menstruation can't be sort of looked at in a vacuum... How can we make these laws even stronger,
more inclusive, and more far-reaching so that there is nobody for whom menstrual access is a barrier to their
participation in public life?" (Wright, 2022, para. 8). To learn more about the menstrual equity movement and
the youth propelling it, check out organizations like 601 for Period Equity, Help a Girl Out, and the Myna
Mahila Foundation.

Case 3: Climate Change

In the late 2010s and early 2020s, youth-led lawsuits against federal agencies and state governments were filed.
The subject of said lawsuits was climate change and the downstream impacts of present-day decisions that
demonstrably failed to regulate the destructive impacts of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases. While few of
these cases have gone far in the legal system or resulted in favorable outcomes for climate change activism,
their increasing frequency suggests momentum for climate justice. Below are a few notable cases, all of which
received representation from the non-profit public interest law firm, Our Children's Trust:

  · Juliana v. United States (2015) - The 23 youth plaintiffs from Oregon argued that the U.S. government
      "continued to use and promote the use of fossil fuels, knowing that such consumption would destabilize
      the climate, putting future generations at risk. By doing so, the plaintiffs argued, the U.S. government
      had violated their constitutional rights to life, liberty and property" (Rott, 2020, para. 3-4). The case was
      dismissed in 2020 when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the plaintiffs made a
      compelling case for action but "reluctantly" concluded that "such relief is beyond our constitutional
      power" (Juliana v. United States, 2020, p. 11). The plaintiffs were allowed to amend their complaint to
      seek a declaratory judgment, and in 2023, the case was officially revived by a federal judge and cleared for
      trial. In their decision, the judge wrote, "It is a foundational doctrine that when government conduct
      catastrophically harms American citizens, the judiciary is constitutionally required to perform its
      independent role and determine whether the challenged conduct, not exclusively committed to any
      branch by the Constitution, is unconstitutional" (E360 Digest, 2023, para. 6).
                                                                                           RHETORIC AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE PART 2 | 229

· Held v. Montana (2020) - In addition to representation from Our Children's Trust, this case also
   involved legal representation from the Western Environmental Law Center and McGarvey Law. The 16
   youth plaintiffs from Montana argued that a provision within the Montana Environmental Policy Act
   (MEPA), which "forbid[s] state agencies from considering the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions or climate change in their environmental reviews," violated youths' "fundamental right" to a
   "clean and healthful environment" as declared in the state constitution (Bookman, 2023, para. 3-4). On
   August 14, 2023, a judge sided with the youth plaintiffs when they ruled that "the state's failure to
   consider climate change when approving fossil fuel projects was unconstitutional" (Gelles & Baker,
   2023, para. 1). The landmark ruling was the first big win for the youth-led U.S. climate litigation
   movement. In the victory order, the state wrote that the plaintiffs successfully proved "past and ongoing
   injuries resulting from the State's failure to consider GHGs and climate change, including injuries to
   their physical and mental health, homes and property, recreational, spiritual, and aesthetic interests,
   tribal and cultural traditions, economic security, and happiness" (Held v. Montana, 2023, p. 86, lines
   18-22). The order went on to confirm the "causal relationship" between the state's permitted fossil fuel
   activities and the "resulting environmental harms," which plaintiffs proved disproportionately harms
   children and youth (Held v. Montana, 2023, pp. 87-88). The Montana attorney general swiftly appealed
   the decision, but Montana's Supreme Court denied the motion. The initial victory and more recent
   denial of the state's appeal not only marks a win for climate activism writ large but also represents a
   welcome spotlight on youths' desire and ability to fight for their future in legislative spaces.

· Genesis B. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency (2023) - The 18 youth plaintiffs from
   California have argued that the EPA "violated their constitutional rights by failing to protect them from
   the effects of climate change" in their uniquely lived spaces and circumstances (Brady, 2023, para. 1).
   Specifically, in allowing the burning of fossil fuels which produces carbon dioxide and warms the
   climate-noting the EPA's own 2009 finding that "carbon monoxide, a greenhouse gas, is a public health
   threat, and children are the most vulnerable" (Brady, 2023, para. 7)-the plaintiffs allege the EPA has
   been derelict in their explicit duty to keep the air clean and control pollution to protect the health and
   welfare of the nation's children. Like the amended complaint in Juliana v. United States, the plaintiffs
   seek a declaratory judgment.

Conclusion

In this chapter, we explained theories of both the public sphere and counterpublics in connection to the
broader study of rhetorical theory. The study of publics and counterpublics helps sharpen our understanding
of how rhetoric can be employed; this understanding then allows us to more effectively theorize how audiences
are subject to rhetorical acts and persuasive discourse. This conceptualization of the public sphere began with
the works of scholars such as Goodnight, Perelman, and Olbrechts-Tyteca, all of whom built off the theorizing
of Habermas's public sphere.

   In addition to the earlier conceptualizations of the public sphere, we have also shown how rhetorical
acts and discourse are, above all else, subject to elements of power, access, resources, and identity-elements
that serve to uphold those members of the public sphere who benefit from the status quo. Therefore, the
concept of a "counterpublic" is necessary to our study of the public sphere-its inclusion allows us to better
situate the study of rhetorical theory in ways conscious of audience, power, and oppositionality. This more
contemporary conceptualization of counterpublics can be attributed to the wide range of scholars (e.g.,
Brouwer, Warner, Hauser, Chavez), all of whom prioritized envisioning the multiplicity of socially imagined
spaces and collectives comprised of persons who sought to convey their interests, positions, and arguments that
are otherwise not in alignment with that of the dominant sphere. Both the argumentation-focused and the
critical iterations of the public sphere will prove to be indispensable as you proceed through your studies in
rhetoric broadly.

   Lastly, we augmented this explication of publics and counterpublics with a case study of young activists who
survived the 2018 MSDHS shooting in Parkland, Florida. The Parkland youth sought to convey their needs
and opposition to those in power through various rhetorical acts and situations, which sparked a nationwide
movement. We then presented three additional brief case studies involving USA Gymnastics and "The Fierce
Five," the movement for menstrual equity, and youth-led climate change litigation, which we prompted you to
explore using theories of the public sphere and counterpublicity.

CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE

An artistic rendering of the pivotal scene from Edgar Allan Poe's "The Purloined Letter"

This chapter discusses the relationship between rhetoric and narratives in three parts. The first introduces key
concepts related to narratives, including the inside/outside of narratives, form, genre, and narrative frame
theory. The second section of the chapter addresses Walt Fisher's narrative paradigm and the concepts
of narrative coherence and narrative fidelity. The final section [recording forthcoming] describes the
narratives that facilitate "speaking for others" and intersectional correctives to hegemonically white, cis-gender,
and upper-middle-class narrative point-of-view.

Part 1: Form, Genre, and Frame Theory

Narratives have many different components that make them rhetorically relevant. They are reflections of an
audience's values: a story is never just a story. They are about the people telling them, about ways of envisioning
the future, or about the contemporary problems that those tellers are confronted with.

Narratives are ways of shaping public memory or retelling events that have happened in the past. They allow
us to remember what has happened or to retell these moments as alternate futures. They organize how we
interpret public events that we encounter in our everyday lives. Many people have tried to make sense of the
Covid-19 pandemic by watching films like Outbreak or Contagion. Narratives also reflect a dominant ideology
because they reflect the values not just of the people who create them but of the people who read and watch
them, making them a part of their lives.

Inside and Outside

Narratives have an inside and an outside. The inside is usually talked about as the diegesis, and the outside
is usually talked about as the extra-diegesis. In a written narrative, the elements that occur in the timeline
of the story form the diegesis. Things that happen in the story but fall outside the scope of the story's events
are extra-diegetic. For instance, a story may be about characters whose lives were changed by September 11,
2001. The things that happen to these characters would be part of the diegesis. But if September 11, 2001
were not explicitly a part of the story, they would be extra-diegetic if those events occurred before the story
ever began. In films, diegetic and non-diegesis sound define what is available `inside' and `outside' the story. If a
character turns on a radio in a film, the sounds are audible to both the characters and the audience, then that
sound is diegetic. If ominous music plays and is only audible to the audience but not the characters on screen,
then that noise would be extra-diegetic.

In the opening moments of the film Jaws, the diegetic sound consists of the splashes of characters swimming
through the water; you can hear the water as if you were yourself swimming. But the extra-diegetic noise starts
when the familiar "Jaws" theme starts playing. It's not audible to the characters; it's only audible to the people
watching. For that reason, we can say that it is "outside" of the narrative.

Narrative Time

Narrative time describes the way that stories are ordered as a progression of events. Sometimes the order in
which the story is told is not identical to the linear progression of time. Narratives may begin in medias res,
where events are already happening or have already happened. They both happen step-by-step and as an overall
`arc' that connects the beginning to the end. They happen as brief moments of surprise and opportunity and
as the unfolding of deeply plotted events.

  · Fabula describes the chronological sequence of events in a narrative. Sometimes stories are told from
      beginning to end, without any detours. Not all stories are told linearly, however. Many stories involve
      flashbacks or prolepsis (a foreshadowing or flash-forwards). Sherlock Holmes, a detective fiction, is a
      story that is famous for taking the reader through a chronological sequence of events only to route them
      to an earlier moment in time when the detective explains their deductive reasoning. The fabula is the
      timeline that we would construct if we were to untangle all of the events in the narrative, creating a
      timeline that puts them back in their linear order from beginning to end. The sequence of
      the fabula may or may not correspond with how the narrator actually tells the story.

      In the example video above, a series of events unfolds "out of order," which only becomes apparent at the end. If we
      were to put all of these events into the first-second-third linear sequence in which they happened, this would be the
      fabula [Spoiler warning]: [extra-diegetically] the main character had and raised a child, they grew apart, and the
      child left, dramatically. Then [diegetically] the character made a bao bun and fanticized that the bao became a
      child, that she raised the bao, and eventually the bao decided to leave in dramatic fashion. She then eats the bao.
      As she is crying in bed, the main character's son returns and offers some pastries. The two eat the pastries and cry
      together. The final scene depicts the main character, her partner, her child, and her child's new partner all in the
      home making baos together.

  · Sjuzhet describes the re-presentation of those events in whatever sequence the narrative presents them.
      In other words, if the events in the narrative occur in first, second, third order, then that is the sjuzhet. If
      the narrative begins in the middle, returns us to the past, and takes us to the end, then that is
      the sjuzhet. If the narrative is a collection of different stories that start and end at overlapping times, then
238 | CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE

      that is the sjuzhet. It is time in the narrative voice of the story as it is told.

      In the example video above, the story begins with the main character making bao buns. The bao turns into a baby,
      which the main character cares for. The bao starts to grow. Over time, the bao grows apart from the main character
      until one day, the bao decides it is time to depart. They have a heated argument, and prevents the bao from leaving.
      She then eats the bao. As she is crying in bed, the main character's son returns and offers some pastries. The two eat
      the pastries and cry together. The final scene depicts the main character, her partner, her child, and her child's new
      partner all in the home making baos together.

  · Metonymy as a narrative trope describes the moment-to-moment slippage in a story. Every story is
      composed of one or many scenes. The metonymic movement of the story is how the story moves from
      scene to scene, from moment to moment over the narrative's duration.

      More traditionally, metonymy is a rhetorical trope, having to do more with speech than with narrative. It is often
      described as a "part" standing in for the object itself. For instance, the phrase "all hands on deck" substitutes a part of
      a sailor for sailors themselves. The phrase "the oval office" substitutes a part of the White House for the institution it
      represents. The key connection between narrative and rhetorical metonomy is the slip from part to object. In rhetoric,
      metonymy slips from one part of the object to a name by which it is more conventionally known. In narrative,
      metonymy slips from one moment of the story into another, which is different but related to the one that came before.

  · Metaphor as a narrative trope describes the overall slippage of a story, its total narrative arc. It is how a
      beginning transforms into an end, putting these two distinct moments into a concrete relationship with
      one another. For example, in the original Star Wars series, the narrative trope of metaphor describes the
      overall transformation of Luke Skywalker from a Tatooine farmer into a swashbuckling, empire-
      defeating, Oedipus-complex-confronting Jedi.

      As a rhetorical trope, metaphor puts A into a relationship with B such that some qualities of A are transferred
      onto B. Narrative does this with a central character, idea, or protagonist. If something lasts from the beginning to
      the end of a story, it will have some of the same qualities, but will also in most cases have dramatically transformed.
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE | 239

Metaphor as a transformation of beginnings into ends.

  · Kairos is a rhetorical term that signifies "the opportune moment." To be aware of and use kairos means
      that one has an awareness of their situation and has the ability to respond to it with words. In narratives,
      kairos signifies the sudden and the surprising. It is the organization of narrative as a "now," in the sense
      of an episode in a larger drama or a striking moment during which dramatic tension may resolve. For
      example, Dr. Megan Foley argues that the O.J. Simpson trial's news portrayal employed a "kairotic"
      temporality because it "seized the present moment to craft a usable past" about racism in the courtroom.

  · Chronos is a rhetorical term that describes the deep time in which events unfold. It is the overall time of
      the narrative and the past and future that extend beyond the narrative's boundaries. Dr. Emily
      Winderman argues that the TLC television show A Baby's Story uses a chronic temporality because each
      episode tells a story in which the viewer is led to anticipate the family's completion. The introduction of
      a newborn provides narrative resolution to birthing drama.

      Kairos is the time of contingency; chronos is the time of history. Kairos is a sense of time as occasion; chronos
      is a sense of time as duration. Kairos figures time as an episodic point; chronos figures time in a sequential line.
      Kairos emphasizes that rhetoric hinges on timely opportune moments; chronos emphasizes rhetoric's historical
      contextualization (Foley 2010, p.71)

Formal and Aesthetic Elements

Narratives also have formal and aesthetic elements. Formal elements are those that structure the
narrative. Aesthetic elements are those that occur in narrative because of the cultural context of the story. For
example, the plot is a formal narrative element because it places the characters on a path that will eventually
lead to some kind of resolution. There is typically one or more dilemmas that the characters must confront.
Their (in)ability to resolve this conflict is what brings the narrative to its ultimate conclusion. By
contrast, characters are often aesthetic elements of the narrative. Character development describes the actions
and relationships among actors in a story, which is often derived from a specific cultural context. Because
characters are often reflections of the time and place represented in the story, they will also reflect the values and
virtues of the time in which it is set. The professions of different characters can often seem dated or timeless.
In Oedipus Rex, the blind seer Tiresias is a strange character for a contemporary audience because it emerges
from a unique cultural context. A related figure that we might see in narratives today (e.g., economists, risk
assessors, or therapists) will likely appear similarly dated from a future point in human history.

Formal and Generic Elements

Narratives are also categorized and reshaped by genre or conventions that allow stories to be widely
recognizable and appreciated by wide audiences. Genres create a pattern of expectation, such that some of the
best stories make us question our expectations of what the characters will do or make us jump with a twist
ending. Both "form" and "genre" refer to ways of organizing narrative. So, what is the difference?

   Form and Genre are two important ways of describing the recognizable organization of narratives.
According to the description provided here, forms are the particular logical elements that may occur within a
given narrative, genres are arrangements of those elements as recognizable kinds of narrative.

   Forms are akin to the building blocks of narrative. They are durable, repeatable elements that may appear
as features within many different narratives. Form arrange symbols and organize language in ways that give it a
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE | 241

recognizable and repeatable order, like a figure of speech. Forms can build tension and alert you to the fact that
a "scary" sequence of events is taking place. In the video below, the musical form of "the four-chord song" uses
a similar sequence of notes, played at a variety of tempos, to create a range of different songs.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=184#oembed-7

Within narratives, forms are small-scale ways of arranging action and organizing language, giving these a
recognizable logical order. It can also be understood as a repeatable sequence or as a figure of speech. Forms can
be picked up and then used in a variety of different contexts. They are also ambivalent concerning the ethical
or political goals that they serve. Studying form alone cannot tell us which forms are correct or better or worse.
Instead, they serve a number of different purposes. When studying forms, we have to think about where and
how these forms are being used. The following video offers an excellent example of forms and how they may
be picked up, repeated, and recur in many different texts. Minimally, forms can accomplish two functions: (1)
they can create the same meaning using different messages, and (2) they can create different meanings using the
same messages.

   (1) Forms can create the same meaning across different messages. For example, the "distracted
boyfriend meme" may be understood as a form when we witness the same elements in a similar arrangement
within a different image or text. This meme has a precursor from The Killers, a film from 1946. When we
recognize the similarities between these images, we can see how a similar meaning occurs in very different
messages whose creation is separated by over 70 years. In a nutshell: form is a way to create the same meaning
across different messages.
242 | CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE

(2) Forms can also create different meanings using the same message. Often, memes are useful for exactly
this reason: they allow us to communicate various messages using the same format or template. The image
below is of Brittany Broski, the star of the "Kombucha Girl" meme. On the left, Broski's signature facial
expressions carry the captions "We need to have a talk" and "We need to have a taco." But this form, the very
same image, can carry a different meaning as well. The image on the left shows Broski's face both disgusted
at climate change and optimistic at the prospect of doing something about it. In this case, "Kombucha Girl"
produces a form that creates different meanings using the same message, the same template.

   Genres are names for categories of narrative. Genres emerge when some number of forms appear together as
a consistent feature among different narratives. They may also change over time, as different genres sometimes
merge to form new categories of common storytelling. (For example, "horror-comedy" and "dramedy" are
recent examples of how distinct genres of narrative have come together to create new formal unities).

   Genres are constellations of formal elements. They are not identical to form because they assemble forms
and materialize when several different forms cluster together. When we watch a horror film such as The
Shining, many formal features come together to create a widely recognizable contribution to the genre of
horror films. The music, images of large unoccupied spaces, characters running or limping across the screen
with weapons, the voice-over about people in isolation experiencing a mental breakdown, and of course Jack
Nicholson's changing demeanor all indicate that watching the film will be a frightening experience.

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=184#oembed-8

Genres also set audience expectations about coherence and resolution. When we watch a movie that belongs to
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE | 243

a certain genre, we have expectations associated with it. When those expectations are violated, different things
can happen: we might not enjoy ourselves because the movie isn't the one we hoped to see. It might create
a new genre by blending existing formal elements. Genres also structure the interpretation and reception of
public events according to the interests of a dominant culture and ideology.

   When the formal elements of a genre are re-configured, they create new kinds of stories. Below, you'll find
an example of genre expectation violation. Extra-diegetic elements like the music and the narrator's voice
interrupt what we would expect. If form describes the interchangeable, repeatable organization of narrative
elements, then genres describe a constellation of forms that cluster together to tell stories in recognizable ways.

Narrative Frames

Narrative frames are ways that public events are constructed through a narrative. Two critical communication
theorists use "frame" to describe narratives: Kenneth Burke and Shanto Iyengar.

Comic and Tragic Frames

Kenneth's frames are borrowed from Aristotle. They are the comic frame and the tragic frame. For Burke, the
same story can be told as a comedy or a tragedy. The difference lies in how we see the motives of the characters.

  · The comic frame is a viewpoint that would have you see others as mistaken rather than evil. In the clip
      below from Veep, Selena Meyer and her aides are incapable of doing their jobs, which is the main reason
      why you can see them as mistaken rather than as terrible people.

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=184#oembed-10

  · The tragic frame is a viewpoint that would have you see others as evil rather than mistaken as
      calculating or as deliberately as deceitful. Here's a similar clip from the television show "House of
244 | CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE

      Cards," representing the executive branch doing despicable things. The calculative and manipulative
      characters displayed here are deliberately immoral and are "tragic" because they are fully aware of the
      consequences of their actions.

Episodic and Thematic Frames

Shanto Iyengar's media frames account for how news stories are repeated and told in a political context. It is
traditionally understood in terms of the way that news stories are organized. The clip below captures both the
"episodic" and the "thematic" frame as they appear in the political campaign speeches of several candidates in
the 2012 presidential election.

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=184#oembed-12

  · The episodic frame depicts public issues in concrete instances or public events; the episodic "makes for
      good pictures." Its key characteristic is the snapshot or the close-up. It is about isolated events
      disconnected from a greater context. They are "human interest stories" that are reducible to the motives
      of individual actors. Something surprising has happened or is happening, but for no particular reason
      other than the psychology of the people involved.

      In the example above, the episodic frame condenses what we know about a person by using names like "Joe
      the plumber" or "Mayor Pete." It is about singular individuals and events and doesn't offer a larger context to
      develop their importance or relevance.

  · The thematic frame places public issues in some general context. They establish a history and structure
      that has allowed the events to occur the way they have. Often, thematically framed narratives take the
      form of a "takeout" or "background" report directed at the general outcomes of policy or event. The
      thematic frame would, for example, draw attention to conditions of gentrification as the reason for
      greater homelessness or stock buybacks as the explanation for mass layoffs. This mode of telling suggests
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE | 245

      some greater reason that would explain why things are as they are.

      In the example above, the thematic frame describes the structural and economic reasons for educational
      cutbacks, job loss, and health insurance. In the case of prisons, a thematic frame would point to the racial, social,
      and economic conditions that make such institutions profitable or which dispose certain communities to be
      policed at significantly higer rates.

Part 2: The Narrative Paradigm

A Lecture by Dr. Emily Winderman
   The narrative paradigm is Walter Fisher's theory of narrative. This section is about defining the narrative

paradigm and will contrast this framework with the rational world paradigm. Then when we think about
what makes a narrative persuasive. Rhetorically we will draw upon two key concepts: narrative coherence and
narrative fidelity.

What is a Paradigm?

A paradigm is a conceptual framework, a universal model that calls people to view events as an interpretive lens
for events around them. A paradigm is like a magnifying glass: different magnification levels might lead you to
see a similar phenomenon in different ways. The rational world paradigm is one magnifying glass among many
others that allow us to interpret and see and make meaning about what's going on in our world. So, it's not
belief-based, really, but more of a question of epistemology or how we know what we know. So how do we
know what we know? We know it through stories.
246 | CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE

      Haliclona cnidata at multiple magnifications. CC BY 4.0

In Ancient Greece, a philosophical paradigm was privileged over a rhetorical paradigm. That's why the
sophists really were castigated for their elevation of the rhetorical ways of knowing and being in the world.
Many people operate according to a scientific and rational world paradigm. Of course, that's not "everyone"
because people obviously can and do reject scientific facts. Such people are acting according to a different
narrative paradigm. Nevertheless, the national world paradigm tends to be privileged most in our society right
now.

The Narrative Paradigm

Walter Fisher developed the Narrative Paradigm, where he refers to humans as storytelling animals. The idea
of storytelling animals really just says that storytelling is so foundational to what it means to be humans that
it might as well be as if we were barking dogs (aka storytelling animals). He doesn't believe that stories are an
instrumental form of rhetoric that you either bring a list of statistics or a good narrative story like you may have
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE | 247

learned in your public speaking class. On the other hand, Fisher believes that all types of communication are in
and of themselves a type of story or narrative. So for him, the narrative is absolutely foundational to rhetorical
and communication. Humans are narrative beings who experience and understand life as a series of ongoing
narratives. So what is a narrative for Fisher? It's pretty similar to what you might expect. It's symbolic action
- words and or deeds that have sequence and meaning for all of those who live, create and interpret them.

   So first, what are the components of a story? There are characters: the protagonist and the antagonist. Some
people move the story along, and others perform a requisite amount of emotion. You also have rising action,
a climax, falling action, and finally, a moral to the story or a big takeaway that contains a lesson and should
impact our future actions.

Comparing Paradigms

Between the rational world paradigm and the narrative paradigm. On the rational world paradigm side, we
have that humans are rational creatures who make decisions based on arguments. The speaking situation
determines the ways that we make those arguments. Rationality is how we know what we know. Our
epistemology is a rational epistemology. We argue based upon good reason, and the world is considered a set of
rational puzzles to be rationally resolved. On the other hand, humans are storytellers. We make decisions based
on good reasons, which vary based upon any situation. History and culture determine those good reasons.
Narrative rationality (what makes a narrative quote on quote good or persuasive) is based on its coherence
and fidelity. That means the world is not a set of logical puzzles but rather a set of stories that are constantly
creating and recreating our lives.

Key Concepts: Coherence and Fidelity

Narrative rationality describes how to evaluate the worth of a story based upon standards of coherence and
fidelity. Coherence is how a story hangs together; fidelity is how, whether, and for whom a story `rings true'.

Narrative Coherence

Narrative coherence describes the degree of internal consistency within a story: characters act reliably, events
unfold in a manner that is expected, the story and the plot hang together with few contradictions. When a
character suddenly appears in different clothing because of poor editing, or when plot lines are dropped, it
draws the audience's attention to the absence of narrative coherence. Narrative coherence is the equivalent of
making an argument in the rational world paradigm. When the characters behave reliably, the story works, and
we trust the plot's consistency. We become extremely wary when details are left out.
248 | CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=184#oembed-13

The lack of narrative coherence appears in the above clip because many of the elements we might expect to be
present in a narrative, such as characters, plot, and resolution are absent. There appears to be no motivation
for the images nor any clear connection between them, save for the unsettling emotional experience that they
are designed to produce. As Gabe Lewis (the character in the above video played by Zach Woods) says: story or
narrative is itself comforting. A narrative that interrupts our expectations also disrupts the sense of pleasure we
get by connecting beginnings and ends or understanding a story's moral or purpose. Instead, it leaves us with
the impression that the narrative is incomplete, something has been left out, or that there is more to the story
than has been told.

Narrative Fidelity

Narrative fidelity describes how narrative "rings true" with a real-world set of experiences. It is similar to realism
in the sense that a narrative appears to capture an authentic experience or an actual event in a way that is
faithful to its source material. It also describes the consistency between the values embedded in a narrative
message and the values that the viewer, listener, or reader brings to their reading. Understood as the values
shared between an audience and a narrative, narrative fidelity to have several criteria:

 1. First, a set of shared values must be present in the narrative. For instance, a character must have
      the kinds of characteristics or experiences that an audience will recognize in themselves. Alternatively,
      even if audiences do not share the values of a protagonist, they may identify with the kinds of values
      associated with different characters' struggles or that arise as a result of the events that transpire over the
      duration of the story.

 2. Second, there must be a connection between shared values and the narrative plot. If shared
      values are embodied by a character or characters, the audience's assessment of these figures should not be
      incidental or haphazard, but driven by the organized action and resolution of the narrative's different
      events. For instance, a flashback may encourage an audience to identify with an otherwise unlikable
      character, or a character may undergo a set of trials that change their disposition in ways that make them
      more sympathetic to the reader/listener/viewer.

 3. Third, adherence to shared values must be tied to a specific set of outcomes or consequences.
      An audience must not only identify with a character, but their experiences must bear out the
      consequences of adhering to those values in ways that ring true for those watching, reading, or listening.
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE | 249

      Adhering to a shared set of values, such as loyalty, perseverance, or courage may result in hardships that
      nonetheless allow the audience to identify with the complexities of doing the right thing. Alternatively,
      breaking with such values may bring about consequences to demonstrate that sticking to one's
      principles is important -- or not as important as it is often touted to be.
 4. Fourth, there must be some measure of consistency between an audience's values and the values
      espoused by the narrative. In other words, a narrative's values must be relatable in the sense that they
      fit the contexts available to an audience. Whereas some narratives originating from cultural contexts or
      time periods that are distinct from our own may give us the impression that there is something
      timelessly true about the values espoused, others may feel alien to us because the context is so starkly
      different from the one we inhabit.
 5. Fifth, the values of a story must align with (or noticeably depart from) recognizable public
      morals. There should be a shared sense that the values captured by a narrative also resonate with or
      challenge the kinds of values that are shared by a wider group, or public, to which the reading/watching/
      listening audience belongs.

So when we affirm a story as having narrative fidelity, or when we say a story rings true, we affirm its shared
values and invite ourselves to be influenced by them. At minimum, we understand the kinds of values that
the narrative espouses and can relate when those values are rewarded. We may also be surprised or taken aback
when those values are challenged, dismissed, or revealed to be more complex than we might have initially
believed.

The above story is faithful to experience: the values in question concern the character's passion for chili,
which is relatable, heartwarming, and ultimately, tragic. For teachers like myself during the early years of the
COVID-19 pandemic, all the hard work, planning, and preparation that went into our courses had to change
at a moment's notice. Like Kevin (played by Brian Baumgartner), you too may put a lot of work into a task
or make elaborate plans only to have this work and labor unexpectedly vanish. Many of us can relate to the
experience of slipping on the metaphorical chili you've planned for days or weeks. Ultimately, narrative fidelity
is present here because Kevin's misfortune feels familiar; it is the way that his fiction rings true.

Part 3: The Problem of Speaking for Others

The final section of this chapter is about how stories are often told from a limited point of view that shuns
other perspectives, modes of storytelling, and experiences. A common criticism of the 1990s television
show Friends, for example, is that it depicted an unattainable New York City apartment, one with many
rooms, appliances, and neighbors who regularly interacted. The main characters of the show are all white,
and they lived in lavish circumstances. However, their jobs included a waiter (Rachel), a chef (Monica), a
musician/masseuse (Phoebe), an actor (Joey), an information technology (IT) manager (Chandler), and a
history professor (Ross). Consider the following passage from Juliet Schor's 1998 The Overspent American:

      Part of what's new is that lifestyle aspirations are now formed by different points of reference. For many of us,
      the neighborhood has been replaced by a community of coworkers, people we work alongside, and colleagues
      in our own and related professions. And while our real-life friends still matter, they have been joined by our
      media "friends." (This is true both figuratively and literally-the television show Friends is a good example of an
      influential media referent.) We watch the way television families live, we read about the lifestyles of celebrities
      and other public figures we admire, and we consciously and unconsciously assimilate this information. It affects
      us.

      When poet-waiters earning $18,000 a year, teachers earning $30,000, and editors and publishers earning six-
      figure incomes all aspire to be part of one urban literary referent group, which exerts pressure to drink the same
      brand of bottled water and wine, wear similar urban literary clothes, and appoint apartments with urban literary
      furniture, those at the lower economic end of the reference group find themselves in an untenable situation.
      Even if we choose not to emulate those who spend ostentatiously, consumer aspirations can be a serious reach.

      Advertising and the media have played an important part in stretching out reference groups vertically. When
      twenty-somethings can't afford much more than a utilitarian studio but think they should have a New York
      apartment to match the ones they see on Friends, they are setting unattainable consumption goals for
      themselves, with dissatisfaction as a predictable result. When the children of affluent and impoverished
      households both want the same Tommy Hilfiger logo emblazoned on their chests and the top-of-the-line
      Swoosh on their feet, it's a potential disaster.

Friends is not just unrealistic; it is one of many stories representing "everyday" people who ignore how
unattainable their living circumstances are. These kinds of narratives imagine a predominantly white and
wealthy America that does not exist in the United States, making debt creation a natural outcome.

The Problem of Speaking for Others

In the essay "The Problem of Speaking for Others," Linda Alcoff questions whether some circumstances
warrant a person to speak on someone else's behalf. She begins her essay by acknowledging that at the current
moment, "speaking for others is arrogant, vain, unethical, and politically illegitimate." (6). People speak from
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE | 251

specific positions of class, race, gender, culture, and ability, and a person's position cannot be assumed in
advance. Additionally, people in privileged positions speaking for historically oppressed peoples often make
matters worse, counterproductively perpetuating oppression. Prompted by the problems mentioned, Alcoff
generates two premises (15):

  · Premise 1: Positionality and context are always relevant to a message.
  · Premise 2: Certain contexts (which are always unpredictable, in some way or another) ally themselves

      with oppression or resistance to oppression, thus perpetuating inequality.

The first premise requires that the speaker's ethical obligation is to know the person with whom they are
speaking to the best of their ability, understanding that elements of their experience and history can and do
remain inaccessible. No amount of research reveals someone else's context. The second premise describes the
hierarchy of power; it deals with "rituals of speaking," which "are politically constituted by power relations of
domination, exploitation, and subordination" (15).

   Alcoff distinguishes between "speaking for" and "speaking about" and relies on this phrasing throughout
her essay. Alcoff insists that one cannot speak for (or on behalf of ) another person without speaking about
(or revealing one's own assumptions) them. Likewise, one cannot speak about another person without also
speaking for them (9). The novel American Dirt received such a negative reception when its first published
because its white author spoke about - and in the voice of - Chicano immigrants while using offensive
stereotypes and racist imagery. As Mariana Ortega argues, this kind of misrepresentation may stem from
"knowing, loving ignorance" on the part of white authors of western European descent. It may be, in other
words, that the intentions of the author are to be more inclusive or to center Black and Brown voices in their
work. However, if this "loving" work is also ignorant with respect to the experiences and positions of those
written about, then it is not "loving" because it still has harmful effects.

      Those guilty of this kind of loving, knowing ignorance have learned the main sayings of such well-known
      feminists of color as hooks, Lorde, and Lugones, and are aware of Spelman's claims about the problems of
      exclusion in feminist thought. They theorize and make claims about women of color. However, they do not
      check whether in fact their claims about the experience of women of color are being described with attention
      to detail and with understanding of its subtleties. In other words, this ignorance goes hand in hand with the
      production of knowledge about the experience of women of color. The result of this ignorance is that women
      of color continue to be misunderstood, underrepresented, homogenized, disrespected, or subsumed under the
      experience of"universal sisterhood" while "knowledge" about them is being encouraged and disseminated and
      while feminism claims to be more concerned and more enlightened about the relations between white women
      and women of color.

Alcoff also explains the problems of not speaking for others, including retreating, avoiding responsibility,
eschewing criticism, and maintaining immunity.

  · First, she argues that if people must tell their own stories (and themselves alone), then the result will be
252 | CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE

      "a retreat into a narcissistic yuppie lifestyle in which a privileged person takes no responsibility for her
      society whatsoever" (17). If one can only attest to one's own experiences (which she calls an "illusion"),
      then that assumes one person's life has no bearing on other people's lives (20).
  · Removing oneself from any situation in which one is either listening to or sharing one's story is not a
      neutral stance because it allows oppression to continue (20). She argues that "[t]he declaration that I
      `speak only for myself' has the sole effect of allowing me to avoid responsibility and accountability for
      my effects on others" (20). Alcoff calls out the problem of this avoidance: "it is both morally and
      politically objectionable to structure one's actions around the desire to avoid criticism" (22), yet the
      retreat approach allows just that--an immunity to criticism.

Alcoff then provides four suggestions that one should consider prior to speaking for someone else, including
the following:

  · Analyze why speaking for someone else is necessary, especially to avoid asserting dominance over the
      situation.

  · Consider our own positions- the stories we tell about ourselves and the racial, cultural, familial,
      gendered, and ethnic context we come from -- without using it as a disclaimer or an excuse.

  · "[R]emain open to criticism" (26)
  · Analyze the effects of the speech, "where the speech goes and what it does there" (26).

Intersectionality

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=184#oembed-15

Intersectionality refers to a framework developed by Kimberle Crenshaw to understand the ways that
structural forces, such as legal institutions, schools, and the health care system, create multiple and overlapping
forms of social oppression, specifically against Black girls and women. It is related to narrative because it
suggests that telling one's story may be more complex by the many structural factors contributing to their
experience. Specifically, gender and race may function in ways that dismiss credibility and ability. Such effects
render the experiences of Black women invisible and more subject to public scrutiny, disciplinary action, and
policing by the legal system.

   Kimberle Crenshaw theorizes intersectionality to account for identities at a structural level. (6) According
to Brittany Cooper, "intersectionality's most powerful argument is . . . that institutional power arrangements,
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 11: RHETORIC AND NARRATIVE | 253

rooted as they are in relations of domination and subordination, confound and constrict the life possibilities of
those who already live at the intersection of certain identity categories" (9). This arrangement of power affects
the kinds of narratives we can tell about Black, Indigenous, and other minoritized groups in several ways. On
the one hand, people who live at the intersection of marginalized race, gender, and class categories are more
subjected to harmful stereotypes and discrimination while the reasons for this unequal treatment are made
invisible. The stories that are told are often about them but "without" them, in other words, without including
their unique voices or perspectives. By contrast, other predominantly white and heterosexual-identifying
peoples are made "invisible" because this position is often unacknowledged or unspoken. Narratives are often
told from a white and western European perspective, although this positioning goes unacknowledged. As
Crenshaw argues:

      Because discursive constructions of whiteness are typically unmarked and unnamed in personal, academic, and
      public discourse, they present a constellation of challenges for rhetorical scholars who are interested in the
      ideological role of whiteness in intersecting discourses about race, gender, and class.

Importantly, intersectionality is not a research method because this understanding of the framework threatens
to disappear black women (19-20), deemphasizes racism (19-20), and "erase[s] the intellectual labor of
[intersectionality's] black women creators" (20). As an alternative, Cooper advocates employing
intersectionality "as a conceptual and analytical tool for thinking about operations of power" (21) and as "one
of the most useful and expansive paradigms we have" (21). It is a reasoning that should animate our reasons for
telling stories and understanding the complexity of Black women's experiences. It can also help us deepen our
understanding of the structural factors that place intersecting identities into difficult double-binds where they
are deprived of agency and power.

This chapter describes "visual rhetoric," and is divided into two sections. The first section is about "visual
culture" and adapts seven premises developed by Dr. Catherine Palczewski, John Fritch, and Richard Ice in
their textbook, Rhetoric in Civic Life. The second section is about four distinct genres of visual rhetoric: iconic
photographs, monumental rhetoric, body rhetoric, and image events.

   Several parts of the chapter below have been updated since the recording for this chapter was originally
created. Part 1 on Visual Culture and Part 2 on Genres of Visual Rhetoric have several updated examples that

Part 1: Visual Culture

The first section of this chapter answers the following question: In what ways is the contemporary U.S. a visual
culture? Visual cultures are scenes of shared public life where shared meaning is made using images, artwork,
and memes. Although social media platforms have made visual representation and persuasion a common
part of American public life, U.S. culture has a long history of commemoration, identification, and self-
representation through visual imagery. This section presents seven different ways that a visual culture has
manifested historically in the United States:

In a Visual Culture, Visual Rhetorics are Common and
              CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC | 257

Change Forms

First, visuals and technologies of visualization have been around as long as verbal rhetorics, and change forms.
Sometimes the images that define a culture shift in meaning over time and over different visual texts. The
examples below each capture a similar signature 1950s aesthetic but also demonstrate how the feelings, values,
and perspectives upon these aesthetics have shifted over time.

   Below, you'll find an example of a real estate advertisement recorded in the 1950s. The technologies used
to capture the video, though new at the time, are dated by their graininess and coloration: the quality,
sound, and definition of the video are clearly different from today's common digital standards. The video
also captures the values of the time in which it was captured. It depicts desirable housing and idealized
relationships commensurate with the anticipated viewing audience's wants and values: an upscale community
predominantly composed of single, white, and wealthy heterosexual families.

A second representation of these kinds of homes, families, and values is staged by The Stepford Wives, a film
first produced in 1975 and then remade again in 2004. Both The Stepford Wives (1975) and (2004) are horror
films about suburban life. Many of the features present in the above clip are again represented in the film
trailer below. However, The Stepford Wives replaces the sanitized home aesthetics, conformist sexuality, and
community idealism of the 1950s home with the premise about a sinister secret society.

The television series Them, which aired in Spring 2021, makes similar use of horror aesthetics in its depiction
of 1950s Compton, CA. This time, 1950s aesthetics combine with secret society motifs to tell the semi-
fictional story of the first Black family to enter this once predominantly white neighborhood. In The Color of
Law, Richard Rothstein describes the realities of 1950s home real estate and the unethical practices associated
with "white flight" from California suburbs:

      In 1954, one resident of a whites-only area in East Palo Alto, across a highway from the Stanford campus,
      sold his house to a black family. Almost immediately Floyd Lowe, president of the California Real Estate
258 | CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC

      Association, set up an office in East Palo Alto to panic white families into listing their homes for sale, a practice
      known as blockbusting. Soon, growing numbers of white owners succumbed to the scaremongering and sold
      at discounted prices to the agents and their speculators. African Americans, desperate for housing, purchased
      the homes at inflated prices. Within a three-month period, one agent alone sold sixty previously white-owned
      properties to African Americans. The California real estate commissioner refused to take any action, asserting
      that while regulations prohibited licensed agents from engaging in "unethical practices," the exploitation of
      racial fear was not within the real estate commission's jurisdiction. (Rothstein 2017)

Them dramatizes the above-referenced moment in time as a Stepford-esque horror-themed story of the
resistance that Black families experienced when confronted with the "secret society"-like behaviors of the
predominantly white suburbs.

   https://youtu.be/WL3Jz8fDgFI
   From 1950s real estate advertisements to The Stepford Wives to Them, there is a similar signature look and
feel to this bygone era. It is typified by a style of dress, a kind of home, and a kind of ritualistic social behavior.
Although the representations of this culture and belief system have changed over time, visualization still
remains a primary mode of capturing its look and feel.

Visual and Verbal Rhetorics Work Together in Visual
Culture

The second way that the contemporary United States is a visual culture is that visual and verbal rhetoric
work in conjunction with one another. A number of experts from a number of fields have said that there
are significant differences between "visual" and "verbal" culture. Some have also argued that we are moving
away from a primarily "verbal" (or literate) culture, defined by the circulation of information-as-words, and
toward a "visual" culture in which we prize photographs and moving images as ways of digesting and retaining
knowledge. The technologies available to us today make us multi-literate, rather than illiterate. For anyone
who's ever had to explain how to use the computer, tv remote, or phone to a relative -- or who have had to
ask others for this kind of help -- it's clear that the kind of `literacy' that more recent generations have isn't less
valid than the predominantly written cultures of the 20th century.
                                                                                                                  CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC | 259

   This new visual AND verbal literacy has generated its own languages; one example being the pictograms we
use to communicate today. Emojis, for instance, allow us to easily communicate that we are "running late,"
that it's "party time" or wish someone "good luck". But we can also imagine that these patterns of symbols
would be mystifying for someone who was not always enculturated to know them.

Visual Culture Elevates Presentational Symbolism

Third, the contemporary united states is a visual culture because it elevates presentational symbolism.
  · Presentational symbolism is "a direct presentation of an individual object" that "widens our
260 | CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC

      conception of rationality far beyond the traditional boundaries, yet never breaks faith with logic in the
      strictest sense."
An example of presentational symbolism is the difference between attending this lecture virtually and
attending it in person. The experience of a virtual and an in-person lecture is very different. Specifically,
the style and feel of the presentation are different. Your experience of what counts as "in-class" time is
different. You either control through camera covers and backgrounds or - because you're in a lecture hall with
limited movement space, you don't. Your experience of speech and persuasion is different depending on this
presentational context. Your sensory experience, whether in a space with other people or by yourself, is also
different.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=189#oembed-3

Visual culture elevates presentational symbolism because it tries to simulate the face-to-face experience as
a virtual experience. It tries to re-create face-to-face conversations (e.g. Zoom) or one-on-one debates (e.g.
Twitter) using technologies that allow us to symbolize our communication. Often, however, staging "debates"
or "face-to-face conversations" does not completely simulate the interpersonal experience. Other times, merely
simulating debates results in further polarization or otherwise fails to live up to the argumentative ideal of idea
testing or a true engagement with opposing ideas.

   Presentational symbolism also "produce a simultaneous impression of many elements," or a gestalt. Images
                                                                                                                  CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC | 261

multiply and proliferate. They also become increasingly complex, representing increasing magnitudes of data.
An example of this kind of presentational symbolism is the graphic representation of populations, like the
above map illustrates the "big picture" of viral outbreaks in the United States as a presentation of reality that
relies on a simultaneous impression of many elements.

Visual Culture is Where Rhetorical Reading Happens

Fourth, visual culture is the site of dominant, negotiated, and oppositional readings. These key terms
describe how we interpret the visual rhetoric we encounter and create new visual rhetorics in response.

  · Dominant Reading: the preferred, hegemonic reading. A reading in which a viewer takes the connoted
      meeting, and operates in the dominant code.

   The dominant reading is the preferred, hegemonic reading in which a viewer accepts the connoted meaning
262 | CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC

and operates in the dominant code. Depicted above is the famous "Flag Raising on Iwo Jima." It is also an
example of an "iconic photograph." The most literal, hegemonic interpretation of the image is as a celebration
of American teamwork in service of the shared goal of U.S. military victory. This is a dominant reading of
this image. According to Palczewski et.al., "by recognizing and accepting these connotations, we participate
in a dominant reading, in which what this means for the United States culturally is accepted and goes
unchallenged."

  · Negotiated Reading: a reading in which the viewer accepts some hegemonic meanings but recognizes
      exceptions. They understand the denotation but challenge the connotation.
                                                                                                                  CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC | 263

                 Image by JAM Project - CC BY-NC-ND 2.0

   The negotiated reading is a reading in which the viewer accepts some hegemonic meanings but also
recognizes exceptions to this meaning. The image both comprehends the "original" literal meaning while
challenging its connotation, or changing what it means for a specific audience. Depicted above is public
artwork from Sydney Australia that shows soldiers raising a McDonald's sign rather than the flag. Like the

original photograph, the image denotes a kind of military "victory," but one that ultimately supports America
as the land of capitalist corporations rather than as upholding civic virtue. The negotiated reading allows some
of the photograph's original meanings to be accepted -- the denotation of American victory -- while others
are challenged -- replacing nationalistic camaraderie with connotations of commercialism.

  · Oppositional Reading: a reading in which the viewer correctly decodes the denotational and
      connotational meanings of the text, but challenges it from an oppositional perspective.

The oppositional reading correctly decodes the denotational and connotational meanings of the text but
challenges it from an oppositional perspective. In other words, the image acknowledges the denotation of
"military victory" and the connotation of "civic virtue." But, at one and the same time, it also challenges
these by making the audience ask: "What kind of victory?" "What kind of virtue?" and "are these ultimately
redeemable?" Here is a parody of the flag raising at Iwo Jima. This political cartoon by Bill Day, published
during the Iraq War during the early 2000s, shows oil executives from Texaco, Exxon, Chevron, and
Halliburton raising an oil derrick -- and gas prices -- under a banner reading "mission accomplished."

"Mission Accomplished" was a phrase visually featured in a speech by George W. Bush, who had declared
victory in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003 while aboard an aircraft carrier. The image is oppositional because
it challenges the patriotic truthiness of Bush's speech. It suggests that our motives for victory were financial
rather than virtuous and that the "victory" that was sought might actually be reflected in harder times for
Americans at the gas pumps. The oppositional reading, therefore, acknowledges the denotation (or "victory")
and the connotation (or "virtue") by offering a rebuttal to the dominant reading on both fronts.

Visual Culture is a Stage for Presence

Fifth, visual images possess presence. Presence means that the image has an immediate impact on the viewer's
perception, or that it "acts on us" by bringing something before our eyes. The images on this slide are examples
of the way that presence does this kind of work, the way it brings something before our eyes. Each can be seen
two ways, but only by focusing on different parts of the image so that they come to represent a different object.

   The image on the left is either the face of an elderly woman or the face of someone looking away from
us. The middle image is the famous "duck/rabbit" which share an eye but have mouths that face in opposite
directions. The image on the right is either a chalice or two faces that point at one another. All of them "bring
something before us" by asking us to focus on specific elements of the image, like figure or ground, in order for
us as a watching audience to capture the representation. Only one version of the image can be "present" to the
viewer at a time.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=189#oembed-4

Another example of "presence" is the phenomenon of anamorphosis. Anamorphosis is a renaissance-era
drawing technique that allows an image to come together only when viewed from the proper perspective. Even
apparently haphazardly arranged materials, when viewed at the right angle can bring a portrait `before the eyes,'
acting upon us by making an immediate impact on our perception. When understood as the act of viewing
something at the proper angle, anamorphosis is what makes an image or idea "present" to the viewer.
266 | CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC

Visual Culture References Beliefs, Values, and Ideology

Sixth, visual images are points of common reference that illustrate and depict taken-for-granted beliefs, values,
and ideologies of a culture. According to rhetorical scholars Victoria Gallagher and Ken Zagacki, visual images
do the work of reflecting the culture that produced them. Some images, like the paintings of Norman
Rockwell, have, in their words, "evoke the common humanity of blacks and whites by making visible the
abstract forms of civic life in the lived experience of individual citizens, both black and white." According to
Gallaher and Zagacki, Rockwell's images did the work of reflecting American culture in three ways:

  · Rockwell's images disregarded established caricatures of Black Americans
  · Rockwell's images regarded its subjects as human individuals with unique narratives and identities.
  · Rockwell's images made abstract political concepts like "equality" or "fairness" knowable and concrete.

We'll talk about two images from Gallagher and Zagacki's article using the above listed criteria. The first is titled
"The Problem We All Live With," which depicts Ruby Bridges, the first African-American child to desegregate
the all-white William Frantz Elementary School on her way to her first class in Louisiana in 1960.

   The following background about Ruby Bridges is quoted from the website of The National Women's
History Museum:

      Born on September 8, 1954, Bridges was the oldest of five children for Lucille and Abon Bridges, farmers
      in Tylertown, Mississippi. When Ruby was two years old, her parents moved their family to New Orleans,
      Louisiana in search of better work opportunities. Ruby's birth year coincided with the US Supreme Court's
      landmark ruling in Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka Kansas, which ended racial segregation in public
      schools.

      Nonetheless, southern states continued to resist integration, and in 1959, Ruby attended a segregated New
      Orleans kindergarten. A year later, however, a federal court ordered Louisiana to desegregate. The school district
      created entrance exams for African American students to see whether they could compete academically at the
      all-white school. Ruby and five other students passed the exam. Her parents were torn about whether to let
      her attend the all-white William Frantz Elementary School, a few blocks from their home. Her father resisted,
      fearing for his daughter's safety; her mother, however, wanted Ruby to have the educational opportunities
      that her parents had been denied. Meanwhile, the school district dragged its feet, delaying her admittance until
      November 14. Two of the other students decided not to leave their school at all; the other three were sent to the
      all-white McDonough Elementary School.

      Ruby and her mother were escorted by four federal marshals to the school every day that year. She walked past
      crowds screaming vicious slurs at her. Undeterred, she later said she only became frightened when she saw a
      woman holding a black baby doll in a coffin. She spent her first day in the principal's office due to the chaos
      created as angry white parents pulled their children from school. Ardent segregationists withdrew their children
      permanently. Barbara Henry, a white Boston native, was the only teacher willing to accept Ruby, and all year, she
                                                                                                               CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC | 267

   was a class of one. Ruby ate lunch alone and sometimes played with her teacher at recess, but she never missed a
   day of school that year.

         "The Problem We All Live With" by Norman Rockwell

1. First, Rockwell's style of painting departed from typical ways that Black Americans were represented in
    editorial cartoons. Whereas a common way of representing diversity was in cartoons and using racist
    stereotypes, Rockwell painted Bridges and his other subjects as realistic characters in a three-dimensional
    space. His artwork sought to faithfully render events as they actually transpired in public settings
    without lampooning or satirizing the subject material. In the case of "The Problem We All Live With,"
    Rockwell places Bridges on a sidewalk, presumably on her way to school. In the background, the viewer
    can see the residue of a tomato.

2. Second, Rockwell recognized the particularity of his painted subjects: they tell a unique story and stand
    out from the other characters in the painting. Ruby Bridges is personalized in this image because she is
    the only figure who is fully within the frame of the picture. Her school materials make a striking
    contrast with the tomato, a reminder of the pro-segregationist protests that accompanied her attendance
    at William Frantz Elementary.

3. Finally, Rockwell's image made abstract political concepts like segregation and equality knowable. Ruby
    is depicted as "on her way" to a desegregated education, while in reality she was still segregated within
    the school. Although Ruby represented the political battle over the desegregated classroom, Ruby was
    not "free" in her learning environment, contained by American racism, law enforcement escorts, and a
    community that was reluctant to accept her (191).
268 | CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC

"New Kids in the Neighborhood" by Norman Rockwell. CC BY-NC-SA 2.0. Image by Peter E.

The second image is called "New Kids in the Neighborhood," which depicts a Black family moving into a
white suburb.

 1. As with the previous image, in "New Kids in the Neighborhood," Rockwell again disregarded racist
      caricatures of Black people by white artists. As noted earlier in this chapter, his illustrations also depicted
      the standoffish relationships between Black and white residents at a time when the suburbs were still
      popularly depicted as populated by an exclusively white middle class.

 2. Rockwell recognized characters in their particularity, this time through a juxtaposition of formal
      elements in the painting. The "new kids" are personalized based on their contrasting posture (standing
      straight and leaning forward/back). The color scheme on the left and right sides of the painting is also
      distinct. The "new neighbors" are dressed in pastels; they are holding a white cat and a baseball glove.
      The children to the white are drawn in a darker color scheme, one holding a black dog by a leash and
      another dressed as a baseball player. Gallagher and Zagacki state that the characters strike a "visual
      balance" and "show the things blacks and whites shared in common, despite racial and other
      differences" (186).

 3. Finally, "New Kids in the Neighborhood" made abstract political concepts knowable. Rockwell visually
                                                                                                                 CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC | 269

      portrayed a gap between the two groups of children. The disproportion in the numbers of children on
      each side gives a form to abstract concepts such as equality and material realities such as housing
      segregation.

Visual Culture is Immersive

Finally, the united states is a visual culture because visual forms of communication surround us, appearing in
multiple outlets all at once. According to anthropologist Clifford Geertz, culture is the historically transmitted
pattern of meanings embodied in symbols." In this case, these symbols are visual and work with the verbal to
construct a familiar world of meanings that gives us a sense of security. The popular 2012 film The Avengers, for
instance, depicts a transformed and futuristic military as desirable, transforming the popular Marvel superhero
franchise into a positive depiction of the military as morally righteous and technologically sublime.

Our visual culture is modeled after written culture, but it creates new, relational forms of communication
and gives us new ways of relating to one another. The ultimate purpose of understanding the specific pattern
of meanings and symbols that we use in our time, and how these unique forms of meaning-making also are
generative of who we call our family, our friends, and our communities.

Part 2: Genres of Visual Rhetoric

Although the rhetoric of visual culture changes dramatically over time, rhetoricans have pointed to several
different kinds of visual rhetoric that shape Americans' popular and political beliefs. These include iconic
photographs, body rhetoric, monumental rhetoric, and image events.

Iconic Photographs

Iconic Photographs are widely-circulting images that retain political significance in a visual culture. They are
made famous because they commemorate a specific moment in time and symbolize the values of the public
that it represents. Iconic photographs have four key features:
270 | CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC

  · They must be recognized by everyone.
  · They must be understood as representations of historically significant events.
  · They must be powerful objects of emotional identification and response.
  · They must be regularly reproduced or copied across a range of media.
First, iconic photographs must be recognized by everyone in a public culture. Each of the photographs marks
a specific moment in American public memory. The Flag Raising on Iwo Jima and the Times Square kiss are
widely recognized as associated with American public culture at the end of WWII because each uses a widely
recognized pose to depict American military victory alongside the American flag or iconic American locations
like Times Square. The Kent State photograph, depicting student resistance against military force in Vietnam
that resulted in military violence against students, similarly captures a widely recognizable moment that lasts
well beyond the moment when the photograph was taken.

                                 Alfred Eisenstaedt's "V-J Day in Times Square" (1945)
   Second, iconic photographs must be understood as representations of historically significant events. As
artifacts of American public culture, both "Flag-raising at Iwo Jima" and "V-J Day in Times Square" are
representations of wartime victory or post-war celebration that clearly mark the end of WWII. The Kent State
photograph is widely recognized as a representation of American culture and student resistance during the
Vietnam War.
                                                                                                                  CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC | 271

                                      Dorothea Lange's "Migrant Mother" (1936)
   Third, they must depict objects of strong emotional identification and response. The "ideas" depicted in
each of the photographs are highly charged, emotionally. Each represents a kind of emotional release, the
enthusiasm that comes with collective victory and success, the joy of being reunited with a loved one, the
grief, and anger that accompanies the taking of innocent life. In each case, the emotions are high key and
prominent to the viewer.

Finally, they must be regularly reproduced or copied across a range of media. Part of what contributes to
the recognizability of the photographs is the fact that they have been so widely circulated, reproduced, and
parodied.

Body Rhetoric and Enactment

According to the textbook, body rhetoric tries to capture the impact the human body has on the messages
that it communicates. "Who says a message and how a body is made present communicate as much as what
is said." Body rhetoric is rhetoric that foregrounds the body as part of the symbolic act. Enactment occurs
when the person engaging in symbolic action functions as proof of the argument they advance.
                                                                                                                  CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC | 273

Photo by Phiend. CC BY-NC-ND 2.0

The image that is shown here was taken on the day of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme
Court in 2018. It should be remembered that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court after
credible testimony from a number of women, including Dr. Christine Blasey-Ford, emerged that Kavanaugh
had sexually assaulted them. During the protests that occurred during his confirmation, body rhetoric, or
rhetoric that foregrounds the body as part of the symbolic act, consisted in the way that the crowd of
protestors gave public anger a communicable form. Following the vote that confirmed him and just before his
swearing-in, a contingent of protesters descended on the Supreme Court. Bodies poured onto the stairs with
chants such as "Whose Court? Our Court" and "Arrest Sexual Predators, Not Protesters."

   The second way that body rhetoric occurred during this event was as enactment, as protesters used their own
bodies as examples of what they were protesting. Occupying the prohibited stairways and chanting through
the swearing-in, this protest was capped by the iconic image of a white woman who climbed the statue called
"Contemplation of Justice: sat in her lap, and held up a fist and a small handwritten sign reading "#MeToo."
This image is an example of enactment, which occurs when the person engaging in symbolic action functions
as proof of the argument they advance. The #Metoo slogan, the protestor with the raised fist, and Lady Justice
are embodiments of who still remains silenced by protections accorded to privileged white men.
274 | CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC

Monumental Rhetoric

The textbook brings monuments, memorials, and museums together as a unique genre of visual rhetoric.
This is because "controversy often arises over monuments and memorials," which mark famous locations or
commemorate the dead -- and because they "direct people's views of themselves." We assure ourselves of a
national or family identity when we visit sites with special significance. Visual Rhetoric is concerned with the
way that certain sites are places where shared meaning is made, and how this shared meaning is transmitted in
the representation of a place, as well as the experience of `being there.' Monumental Rhetoric guides people
in their thinking about facts from the past, how to act in the present, and what possible futures to
seek. They sustain what a public remembers about its own historical events, and make arguments about how
to think about the identities of particular groups of people.

"Ground Zero - New York City" by www.davidbaxendale.com, CC BY-ND 2.0

As an example, the 9/11 memorial in New York City demonstrates how this kind of memory -- which is
about the past, present, and future -- is built into visual representations and the experience of being there.
According to your textbook, "The Freedom Tower at Ground Zero, now called One World Trade Center, did
                                                                                                                  CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC | 275

not open until 2015. Disagreement over the form of monumental structures at the site delayed construction
until 2006. The final monument does a lot of representational work by commemorating the dead and creating
a symbolic reminder of September 11th. Here is a description of the structure from rhetorical critics Nicholas
S. Paliewicz and Marouf Hasian Jr.:

9/11 Memorial and Museum by Paul Sableman. CC BY 2.0
      "The footprint of the memorial is the hollowed-out remains of the former Twin Towers. Here, in their vacancies,
      they are a key part of `reflective absences,' the massive architectural counters that channel the symbolic water.
      Each footprint is nearly an acre in size and, from their peripheries, cascades of water pummel downward to the
      basin 30 feet below. The water then moves its way towards the epicenter of each footprint where it drops another
      30 feet only to be pumped and recycled all over again. The names of those who perished on 9/11 are etched on
      bronze parapets that surround the reflecting pools. While the North Pool contains the names of victims from the
      North Tower, the 1993 bombing, and Flight 11, the South Pool has the names of those from the South Tower,
      the First Responders, Flight 93, Flight 77, the Pentagon, and Flight 173. Like graveyard tombstones, the granite
      names of those who lost their lives may offer a sense of connectedness between the visitor and the dead. At the
      same time, the water produces an aesthetic of peace and tranquility that might relieve any lingering trauma from
      9/11. For many commentators and visitors, the water is said to be a healing feature of the Memorial, a material
      reality that influences how one contextualizes 9/11."
276 | CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC

Rhetorical scholar Joshua Gunn calls the commemoration of 9/11 "a cultural performance of witnessing, a
longing to return to, and escape from, the violent scene." The endlessly flowing pools also remind viewers that
they are not just healing waters but also open wounds. They capture loss while also reminding attendees of
the towers that used to stand in the footprint of the memorial. This loss is created because the falls are built
downward, a physical reflection of the towers that once stretched upward. Like a tower where a viewer from
up-close would have to strain to see the top, the pools are built so as to create the illusion of an endless waterfall,
where you would similarly strain to see the bottom.

"GROUND ZERO NEW YORK" by ERIC SALARD, CC BY-SA 2.0

As an example of monumental rhetoric, the memorial offers us a version of the past, present, and future which
are captured in the intentional design of the monument as well as the kind of experiences that can be had by
people who pass through it. As a reminder of the past, it tells us about the tragedy of the towers' destruction,
as well as who was lost in the event. As a monument suited to present-day concerns, it allows visitors to
                                                                                                                  CHAPTER 12: VISUAL RHETORIC | 277

remember, express grief, and see their own reflections in the lists of names. As a vision of the possible future, it
seeks to communicate a sense of loss as a reminder and warning for what might come next.

Image Events

Image Events are staged acts designed for media dissemination. Often protests are made for "pictures."
Recently, controversy erupted over the way that the National Archives blurred and censored protest signs
from the Women's March in Washington. Protests are also carefully controlled events, often involving the
securing of permits and the supervision of the police. Protests are therefore either choreographed or not; the
way they are captured as organized or disorganized, as having a story or not, dictates how they are reported and
remembered.

The video above tells the story of the "original" image event, which was staged by Greenpeace on July 27, 1975.
Developed by Greenpeace activists who wanted to stage protests in a publicly visible way that could be widely
circulated, the "Mind Bomb" was a way to publicize the social movement to save the whales. The problem
with image events is that their staging can be genuine or disingenuous. If we were to compare the tactics of
Greenpeace to say, the television show "Whale Wars," which was canceled after facing significant legal troubles,
we can see that strategically staged protests can serve the interests of social movements and also line the pockets
of people who want to exploit this imagery for their own benefit. As an example of how image events can create
authenticity or mislead, take a look at the two videos below. These videos document the "Occupy Wall Street"
protests as an example of "perceived authenticity," a movement that is real or "grass-roots" rather than fake or
"astro-turf," while the Pepsi ad capitalizes on the aesthetics of movement authenticity, using images of artists
and people gathering in the street for the cynical purpose of selling a corporate product.

Reviewing the Genres of Visual Rhetoric

  · An iconic photograph can take many forms, but it would not be something with personal meaning like
      a family photograph, a random picture of a politician in front of a well-known building, or a well-taken
      picture of a monument at sunset. It must be published and circulated; it must be well recognized as
      commemorating a historical moment or event. However, the meaning of an iconic photograph isn't an
      image where everyone agrees on what it means. Instead, it's possible that people forget what it means,
      and for people to remake its commonly accepted meaning.

  · Monuments commemorate and create history. The architecture and movement through a monument
      are also a part of its rhetoric. Visitors are guided to perceive objects from a new perspective because of
      the symbolic and embodied design of memorials.

  · Bodies can be the proof of an argument, and can be an argument. Bodies can also make the argument
      that their own speech has been restricted. When a person's body is an example of the argument they are
      making, it is enactment.

  · Finally, image events take the form of representations of an instance of social protest. Multiple
      photographs or video summarizes a movement, such as news footage of the National Womens' March,
      would be examples of an example of image events.

PART 3: POWER

When we understand rhetoric as a function of power, it means that we acknowledge the effects that speech and
representation have over a person, a community, or a public. As Kenneth Burke reminds us, rhetoric unites and
divides; it allows a person to see their likeness in another person and it enables them to view their difference
from others as a rationale for dissociation, alienation, and dehumanization. As theory, or a lens through which
to see the world, rhetoric also offers us something more than a technique by which powerful agents exercise
their influence. It also offers us a way to analyze how power is distributed, exercised, pooled, and deployed;
it allows us to see that power is often not a matter of one person, institution, or group exercising unilateral
control over a situation, but a complex coordination of many agents who wield leverage and control over a
means of producing representations for a mass public. Often, power's exercise is not felt but apprehended
after the fact. The chapters collected under the heading of "power" are intended to offer frameworks for
understanding different forms of communicative hierarchy and the subtle ways they exercise social control.

Why these Chapters?

Chapter 14 introduces the concept of ideology, a system of organized beliefs and actions that guide human
activity according to a hierarchical structure of economic and governmental interests. Rhetoricians have
engaged the topic of ideology in many different ways, as captured by this supplemental resource document.
Ideology is rhetorical because it can be communicated through speech, as a function of widely
disseminated representations, or as a complex coordination of institutions and technologies that produce
communication across many domains of public life. The chapter investigates these distinct registers by
exploring the concepts of persona, agency, and speech acts, creating a layered sense of how ideology textures and
guides human action in ways that are beyond the conscious perception of those who are moved to act by it.

   Chapter 15, Latine Rhetorical Theory (by Robert Mejia and Diana I. Martínez), explores what it means
to rethink rhetorical theory as Latine rhetoric, drawing from the theoretical foundation of Gloria Anzaldúa.
Latine rhetorical theory is much more than a widened scope of identity or representation. It accounts for
a wholesale conceptual transformation of the core terminology, spaces, and relationships used to describe
the situated experience of a population that resists generalization or capture by racially whitened systems of
thought.

   Chapter 16, on Settler Colonial Rhetoric(s) offers a unique perspective on rhetoric as a structure that
stretches across millennia, adapting to the particular power structures of a given era. Settler colonialism not
only shapes consciousness, attachments to land, and the narratives we tell. It also infiltrates such popular story-
forms as science fiction, which allow those who are the historical benefactors of settler colonialism to imagine
themselves on the receiving end of violence that their ancestors perpetrated.

   Chapter 17, on the Rhetoric of Secrecy and Surveillance describes a ubiquitous situation in which
everything that is important must be packaged in rhetorics of hiddeness, concealment, and revelation. Secrecy
is a phenomenon attached to ancient imperial governments that continues to be used for the efficient
management of populations. Even as secrets seem to spread to every domain of public life, keeping spectators
on the hook for the next `drop' of information, controlling interests intensify their grip over consumers, non-
citizens, racially marked bodies, and those who refuse conformity with hegemonic gender norms through
newer and more expansive technologies of watching.

   Finally, Chapter 18, on Digital Rhetoric(s), discusses the ways that rhetoric is well-suited to describe our
ever-more digital age. Although it may seem as though new technologies change everything and that old tools
for analyzing and conceptualizing communication may have gone out of date, there are many lessons, terms,
and concepts that remain very timely for understanding the false promises made by entrepreneurs and the
threat of imminent destruction posed by cutting edge technologies. Ultimately, the more things change, the
more they stay the same: new media is inhabited by the rhetoric of old technologies and old biases, which are
coded in subtle ways even when new communicative forms are branded as `neutral'.

This chapter is about ideology and myth. It will connect the theory of the sign to the concept of ideology. The
first part of the chapter will cover the materialist theory of ideology, offering some background on some of
its major features, including value and exploitation. Then it will discuss the transition from the theory of the
"sign" to "myth." Finally, it will explain the ideograph as an example of how rhetorical scholars have adapted
it.

people and the hierarchies between them.

                   A formal distinction between (Hegelian) Idealism and (Marxist) Materialism

One common way that Marx's materialist theory of ideology is often summarized is as "flipping Hegel on
his head." In other words, Marx conceived of his own project as a transformation of the Hegelian "idealist"
framework. In Hegel's worldview, the world is composed out of ideas. The "psychic" or "ideational" world of
the "soul" takes precedence and shapes the ways in which individuals understand themselves, and determines
the physical world which is just an expression of logic and consciousness. In a crossed-out portion of The
German Ideology, Marx summarizes this position himself:

      Hegel completed positive idealism. He not only turned the whole material world into a world of ideas and the whole
      of history into a history of ideas. ... All the German philosophical critics assert that the real World of men has
      hitherto been dominated and determined by ideas, images, concepts, and that the real world is a product of the
      world of ideas. This has been the case up to now, but it ought to be changed. ... According to the Hegelian system ideas,
      thoughts and concepts have produced, determined, dominated the real life of men [sic], their material world, their
      actual relations. (crossed-out portion of The German Ideology, p. 30)

Marx's view is the opposite of Hegel's. He argues that the world is materialist in the sense that there is an
objective reality outside or beyond our ideas about it. The purpose of Marx's project is to demonstrate that
our empirical, material reality determines our conceptual, ideational experience of that world. More concisely,
how the individual "subsists" or provides for themselves determines culture. Economic structures organize
this physical, material life to create our "psychic," (internal, cognitive, or mental) life and correspondingly, the
relationships that exist between human beings.

      If in all ideology men and their relations appear upside-down as in a camera obscura, this phenomenon arises
      just as much from their historical life-process as the inversion of objects on the retina does from their physical life-
      process. (Marx, The German Ideology, p.42.)

The "camera obscura" quotation is especially famous because it also "flips" Hegel's established hierarchy in
which "ideas" determine "material" existence. It may look that way, but in fact, the material world generates
and constrains our ideational, mental life. The metaphor of the camera is also deeply significant because it
288 | CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY

invokes a connection between our consciousness and the technologies available to describe it. For Marx, we are
all little cameras: looking at the world as if our ideas created what was in front of us, when in fact, the world
creates and limits what we can -- and cannot -- think and do. If in Hegel ideas are determinative of the real
world, in Marx, the real, material world is determinative of our ideas. The camera is therefore more than a
metaphor; it is a way of using rhetoric to describe how the invisible part of human vision creates the limit of
what can be thought.

The formal relations of materialism as represented through the visual metaphor of the camera obscura.

Ultimately, the "flip" that we will be attentive to is the "flip" from idealism to materialism, paying close
attention to the way that actual, real, and lived experience creates social consciousness. This is also how the
materialist theory of ideology links to our previous weeks' discussions: the theory of ideology argues that our
material conditions determine the signs we use, the symbols we share, and how we imagine and represent
ourselves to ourselves, for instance, as free and independent from the systems that we are a part of.

What is Ideology?

In this class, we will define ideology as the religious, artistic, moral, and philosophical beliefs contained within
and perpetuated by a society or culture, and which are determined by the material circumstances that occasion
                                                                                                      CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY | 289

them. Ideology may also be explained in terms of an economic structure in which material is hoarded by a
ruling `superstructure' to produce the collective consciousness of the proletarian `base'. According to Marx, in
any society, the ruling ideas are those of the ruling class. According to Ziyad Husami, however, even if this is
true, this does not mean that other modes of collective consciousness do not ALSO exist, and that contained
within these other ideas are other notions of justice that would render the whole of capitalist ideology unjust
or immoral.

   Basic premises of "ideology." Marx's theory is often (over-)simplified in the following way: (1) Ruling classes
control the material organization of the world (2) Ruling ideas are imposed on lower classes, who internalize it
and (3) Each `class' has its own ideology. For that reason, ideology is often called a theory of class consciousness.
It describes our consciousness as a function of class hierarchies. Stuart Hall specifically expands upon the idea
that ideological consciousness is particular to distinct groups of people, refusing a blanket characterization
of the proletariat as a single homogenous group. Different people internalize ideology differently, even if it
is the *same* ideology that they have internalized. Let's watch this old-timey cartoon about Marx's theory of
class consciousness, and which also helps us to connect the theory of the ideology to some ideas we're already
familiar with, namely, the theory of the sign.

Labor Value and Labor Exploitation

Marx distinguishes between three kinds of value, "exchange value," "labor value," and "use value" in the
following way.

  · "Exchange value" is the price of a commodity, and represents the purchaser's ability to command labor,
      to compel its production.

  · "Use value" describes the tangible features of a commodity that can satisfy some want or need. Use value
      serves social needs, but it does not represent the social relations of production.

  · "Labor value" or "labor power" is the value of the labor required to produce a commodity. The value of
      labor covers not just the value of wages but the value of the entire product created by labor.

Capitalism functions by hoarding "exchange value" at the expense of "labor value." Although it's sometimes
presumed that the exchange value of an item -- the price we pay -- is equal to its labor value -- or the
cost of producing it -- wealth depends upon extracting a greater exchange value from a commodity than the
labor value used to produce it. Ideology would consist, in this case, in the convictions that arise because of
contradictions like this one, and how individuals reconcile the fact that their labor is less valuable than the cost
of the goods and services that they produce.

   In Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1884, Marx theorizes labor not to be liberating, but as a
source of estrangement. The logic of estrangement is rooted in political economy, more specifically a labor
theory of value.
290 | CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY

   Additionally, under capitalism's designations of private property, workers add value to raw materials via their
labor, creating commodities to be bought and sold. For Marx, labor cannot liberate as it is inherently coercive.
Individuals must work to survive, and in doing so generate profit for their employers. Marx argues that labor
estranges the individual from their material, physical experience in four ways:

  · (1) It estranges them from the product of their work; such that the producer of consumer goods
      doesn't relate to what they make as a "craftsman" but instead as an "interchangeable part" in the
      production process.

  · (2) estrangement from the activity of production; such that they do not have control over their
      labor schedule, the procedure for `making' goods, the rules of the organizational hierarchy to which they
      belong, or the parts of the production process that are separate but related to their own.

  · (3) estrangement from species-being; meaning that they lose touch with other people who may
      inhabit other jobs or live in different places who have a related existence related to their own work. If we
      can imagine a worker at a "General Mills" factory who thinks of themselves as opposed to another
      person in their own position at "Nestle," that gets us close to this kind of estrangement. What these
      folks can't recognize is the fact that they are in the same or a similar position.

  · (4) estrangement of "man to man." Beyond identification with other people who occupy similar or
      related positions, labor estranges us from other people in general, regardless of where they stand or what
      their social position is relative to ours. We become less available because labor stifles our ability to relate
      to one another, to empathize, to see others as part of a common community.

Work does not help an individual come to understand the world, and their place in it, but actually obscures it,
entrenching them within a partial and illusory version of it. Marx is explicit that liberation requires revolution,
or, practical change to things in the physical world. Marx reaches this conclusion in The German Ideology, in
which he lays out a materialist conception of history.

      "The production of ideas, of conceptions, of consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the material activity
      and the material intercourse of men [sic] -- the language of real life" (42).

From Sign to Myth

As discussed in earlier chapters, the theory of the sign is often attributed to Ferdinand de Saussure, whereas
the theory of the symbol is attributed to the 20th-century rhetorician Kenneth Burke and the 19th-century
philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (pronounced `purse'). As we have discussed, Saussure is known for
connecting the theory of the sign to general rules of language, whereby the sign gives a form to shared social
meaning and its transformation.

                                                     The sign is the unity of the signifier and signified.
                                                     The signified is the implied concept.
                                                     The signifier is the sound-image.

Ferdinand de Saussure's schema of the sign, with the signified (concept) over the signifier (sound-image)
and arrows to indicate the mutual dependence of the terms upon one another.

The theory of ideology takes the relationship between the "conceptual" or "ideational" meaning (or what the
sign represents for us) and the "material" signifier (or the verbal and visual expression used to convey it) and
translates it as the distinction between base and superstructure.

   The superstructure is the world of ruling ideas or concepts; it is the site where ideology's meanings exist.
These meanings depend on a material `base' -- the classes and culture who produce these meanings, which
are extracted from them, commodified, and sold back to them. Often "superstructure" is translated as "ruling
class" whereas "base" is rendered as the "proletarian" or "laboring" classes.

   In the last chapter, we discussed how the sign gains its force and value through its differential relationship
to other signs. A sign is a sign by virtue that it is not other signs, that it means something in its difference
from other signs that inhabit its (langue) sign system, and which evolve through individual speech acts (parole).
This is, for instance, how Michael McGee and Roland Barthes conceptualize the ideograph, which at a given
moment of time draws its meaning from a field of related ideologically charged signs.

   Below are two different diagrams for myth as a function of the sign. The sign, composed of a signifier and a
signified (or first-order elements). When they combine to form a sign, it is what Roland Barthes called "second-
order signification." Myth operates at the level of "third-order signification" and describes is what happens
when the sign is elevated above other signs, or when it wields control over a larger sign system. Myth also
292 | CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY

describes a representation's ideological force. A given sign can acquire an additional meaning or signification,
acquiring the weight of "myth" as part of a system of representations that organize popular beliefs. This
belief structure can be (for instance) religious, nationalistic, colonialist, or capitalist. When ideology operates
through the logic of the sign, it means that the concepts implied by our language contribute signifiers to a larger
reservoir of shared meaning-making that defines our relationships to governing (e.g. colonialist, imperialist, or
capitalist) structures.

                         Image from Roland Barthes' Mythologies.

Barthes's demonstration of second-order signification is a magazine cover whose mythic signification is about
French colonialism in Algeria occurring at the time of his writing.
                                                                                                      CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY | 293

   Barthes describes the cover in the following way:

      I am at the barber's, and a copy of Paris-Match is offered to me. On the cover, a young [child] in a French uniform
      is saluting, with his eyes uplifted, probably fixed on a fold of the [French flag]. All this is the meaning of the picture.
      But, whether naively or not, I see very well what it signifies to me: that France is a great Empire, that all her sons,
      without any discrimination, faithfully serve under her flag, and that there is no better answer to the detractors of
      an alleged colonialism than the zeal shown by this [child] in serving [their] oppressors.

The second-order, or sign value of the image is that the signifier, the saluting boy in a beret, corresponds to the
concept of the child-soldier. The third order, or mythic sign value of the image, is what it means "to Barthes":
That this "child-soldier" is not coded as just any soldier but as a sign of French national-colonialism in which
294 | CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY

the recruit is a ready and willing participant in their own colonization. As third-order signification, the viewer
knows that the child salutes the French government and implies that national ideals of extractive, invasive
warfare are worthy of being upheld because this colonized, militarized child supports it.

      The whole of France is steeped in this anonymous ideology: our press, our cinema, our theatre, our popular literature,
      our ceremonies, our Justice, our diplomacy, our conversations, our remarks on the weather, the crimes we try, the
      wedding we are moved by, the cooking we dream of, the clothes we wear, everything, in our everyday life, contributes
      to the representation that the bourgeoisie makes for itself and for us of the relationships between man and the world.

Disavowal

Let's look at another example of myth, dramatized in the film "They Live," which is explained in this
documentary hosted by psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. In the film, the main character, "John Nada" awakens to
the mythic value of the signs around him. They no longer signify things like "money" or "relaxation," but
instead start to signify directly at the level of myth, they are written over with the true, exploitative meaning
that they would otherwise conceal.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=152#oembed-1

As the video shows, the theory of ideology is about more than just the commonly accepted meanings attached
to commercial objects. It is about the larger system or structure that creates and determines those meanings,
and how attached to those meanings we as individuals become. Ideology also explains the idea that we convince
ourselves out of what these third-order signs *actually* or *really* mean. This is called disavowal. When we
cultivate beliefs that give us an escape from the reality that we inhabit, we are disavowing reality. Disavowal is
like refusing to put on the glasses or to reject reality because we know we can't handle it.

   Disavowal is the way that the subject "knows very well" how they act in the service of ideology but
"nonetheless" act in ways that work against their own self-interest, in the service of capitalism, or both at once.

      What they do not know is that social reality itself, their activity, is guided by an illusion, by a fetishistic inversion.
      What they overlook, what they mis-recognize, is not the reality but the illusion structuring their social activity. They
      know very well how things really are, but they are still doing it as if they did not know (p.32).

Another example of disavowal is purchasing products that claim to be "green" because we are aware that
consumerism destroys the environment but need to be reassured that our own personal consumption is not
                                                                                                      CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY | 295

the problem. Disavowal is a way that ideology produces more symbols, as ways to justify its continued existence
and self-perpetuating.

   Lastly, the process of "putting on" the glasses, of awakening to the mythic signification of objects, is called
"de-mystification." Demystification is the unveiling of myth and the revelation that reality is not what we once
perceived it to be. It is what happens at the end of the clip when the actor "wakes up" to the world as it is.

The Ideograph

In "The Ideograph: A Link Between Rhetoric and Culture," Michael Calvin McGee adapts Barthes' theory
of "myth" to rhetoric. McGee explains that the real problem occurs when scholars maintain that "myth" and
"ideology" are conflicting ideas. The ideograph is a model that brings together "ideology" and "myth" and that
basically repeats the theory of myth we have just discussed. It accepts that individuals have the potential to
control power through symbol-use, and acknowledges the strong influence of power over individuals. McGee
argues that

      "ideology in practice is a political language, preserved in rhetorical documents, with the capacity to dictate
      decision and control public belief and behavior" (p. 5).

Ideographs, which are used within this language, expose interconnected "`structures'" of public motives" that
represent diachronic and synchronic formations of political consciousness.

      [These synchronic/diachronic formations] "control `power' and influence [...] the shape and texture of each
      individual's reality" (p. 5).

McGee writes that the only way to diminish power is through prior persuasion, conditioning the meaning of
an act before it takes place. Individuals are "conditioned" mainly through certain "concepts that function as
guides, warrants, reasons, or excuses for behavior and belief" (p. 6). The result is a "rhetoric of control" that
suggests persuasion will be effective on an entire community (p. 6). The words that become the vocabulary of
this rhetoric (like "liberty," "freedom of speech," and "rule of law") form the basic units of ideology -- McGee
calls these ideographs. They signal certain accepted propositions to all members of a community. Ideographs
are not invented but become part of people's real lives as "agents of political consciousness" (p. 7). Ideographs
unite and divide nations because they are a definitive part of the social and material conditions into which
various individuals are born, and one community will have accepted a set of ideographs that differs from others.
In accordance with McGee's "A Materialist's Conception of Rhetoric," ideographs represent a usage that is
social and material, but cannot represent pure thought or truth.

   Ideographs are like signs because they exist within synchronic and diachronic timeframes. Considered
rhetorically, as forces, ideographs are synchronic, meaning that they describe the way that people actually
use them `on the ground' or in practice. At the synchronic level, say, at the start of the 21st century, an
ideograph like "equality" might clash with other ideographs like "freedom," "liberty," and "rule of law" and
296 | CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY

"confidentiality." Through the emergence of various situations, they may conflict with other ideographs and
through this conflict may change its meaning, as can be seen with Nixon attempting to alter the meaning of
the ideograph "confidentiality" in relationship to "rule of law."

But diachronically, "equality" shifts depending on when we are describing it. It is, in McGee's words
"paramorphic," meaning that even when the term changes its signification, it retains meaning in relation to
its historical meanings, its meaning in relation to all of the previous meanings that it might once have had.
The diachronic dimension references the usage of an ideograph throughout time. Individuals look through an
ideograph's usage historically to locate "touchstones" and "precedents" that help judge what is an acceptable
use of that ideograph. As McGee writes, meanings may evolve, but the current meaning of an ideograph is
                                                                                                      CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY | 297

determined in part by its past context of use. For example, Patrick Henry's explanation, "give me liberty or give
me death!" may have been fabricated by the historian William Wirt.

   Overall, McGee argues that understanding both the vertical and horizontal dimensions of ideology are
necessary -- we must see ideology as a "grammar" (diachronically) to know what changes have happened, and
also as a "rhetoric" (horizontally) to know how present situations alter the relationships among ideographs.

Part 2: Agency, Persona, and Speech Act

In this chapter, we'll cover the following: agency, persona, and speech act theory. I'll try to connect ideology to
each of the terms, and again at the end of the recording. Let's start by defining the three core concepts in this
recording, and provide an explanation of how ideology is involved.

How is Ideology related to Agency, Persona, and Speech
Act?

  · Agency, or "the capacity to act": Ideology limits the capacity to act, or otherwise informs the motives
      `behind' why a speaker or an audience acts in the way they do in relation to a claim.

  · Persona, or "the implied speaker/audience": Ideology is the shared substance of identification produced
      through a speaker's invocation of their own position, the audience's position, as well as excluded,
      "eavesdropping," and "collusive" parties.

  · Speech Act, or "an utterance that performs as an effect of being stated.": Ideology is the thing that is
      brought into existence through speech acts as a relationship and hierarchy between different speakers and
      audiences. Speech acts also have the ability to transform the subjectivity of the speaker or those spoken to/
      about.

Three Kinds of Rhetorical Agency

Agency is often defined as "the capacity to act." When rhetoric enters the picture, it poses the following
questions: who has the greatest capacity to act: the speaker/rhetor, the listener/audience, or the speech/text?

      Rhetorical Agency "is the capacity to act, that is, to have the competence to speak or write [or engage in any form
      of symbolic action] in a way that will be recognized or heeded by others in one's community." (p. 211)

(1) Rhetor-centered Agency: Speakers have the capacity to create and adapt to audiences.
   This is a traditional understanding of rhetorical agency rooted in the "intentional" framework of

representation. Because the speaker creates a world of representations and symbols for the listening audience,
298 | CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY

they are understood to have the greatest agency. A speaker can create the impression of a threat or danger,
they can calm an audience's fears, and they can construct a shared reality that they and their audience may
inhabit together. Adapting to an audience is often understood in terms of the speaker's ability to be creative or
inventive. If agency lies with the rhetor, then we understand the speaker to be deliberately crafting appeals for
the heterogeneous audiences (i.e. of varied composition) that they might encounter. Adapting to an audience
can also take the form of double meanings (see also: the fourth persona and the eavesdropping audience) where
some members of the audience are more "in" on the message of the speech than others.

   (2) Audience-centered Agency. Audiences have the capacity to act because they may accept or
refuse the meaning offered by a speaker, and the effectiveness of a speech is ultimately determined by
whether an audience acts in accordance with the worldview set out by the speaker.

   A great speech is only as great as the effect it has on an audience, and that audience's willingness to pick
up the message and run with it. Because an audience may refuse to act (e.g. not going out and voting in
the face of a speaker's urging) or act in ways that contradict the speaker's message (e.g. wearing face shields
instead of masking) the audience is understood to have the greatest power when it comes to rhetoric because
they interpret and act on the rhetoric that is set before them. Additionally, different audiences are differently
enabled in the world, depending on whether they possess capital, resources, or ability. Different audiences
are marked by race, gender, embodiment, class, and age. For that reason, an audience has agency when it is
empowered to be an agent of change, and when there are few constraints (i.e. obstacles or limitations) that
would prevent them from acting on (or against) what a rhetor offers in their message.

   (3) Text-Centered Agency: A speech, text, or another form of rhetoric has the greatest capacity to
act because it will travel in ways that neither a speaker nor an immediate audience can control or
comprehend.

   Once spoken, written, or otherwise drawn into existence, rhetoric has a life of its own. Consider, for
instance, a popular meme template that circulates widely. The original "text" (e.g. the "spider man pointing"
meme") may be drawn out in ways that could not have been anticipated by the "rhetor" (e.g. the animators and
creators of the meme in 1967) or the "audience" for whom it was created and who interpreted it. Because the
message took on a viral life of its own, the message itself has the greatest capacity to act.
                                                                                                      CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY | 299

   By this understanding of agency, meaning is not "eternal," it does not last forever and it changes over time.
Likewise, humans are not isolated from one another or from history because the sum total of interactions is
what lends a given instance of rhetoric form and meaning. Rhetorical agency in this sense is perhaps better
understood as existing within a larger system of interactions.

   This form of agency is also embraced by the posthumanist tradition, which rejects the human agent as
the primary source of change. Instead, that agent is a participant in the larger network of which they form a
part. Agency occurs not solely within the realm of human intention or the direct result of human action but
somewhat outside of human control.

   Let's consider an example, George W. Bush's "Bullhorn Speech" in the wake of September 11, 2001, and
think about how the different kinds of agency describe what is happening in the video.
300 | CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY

  · Rhetor-centered agency in this video might describe the intentions of the speaker, their willful
      crafting of a speech. In this case, we are talking about George W. Bush, who presumably came with a
      speech and with an intended message for the audience: we care about first responders. However, the fact
      that he loses control over the message also suggests that rhetor-centered agency might not be the best
      way to account for the communication that is happening.

  · Audience-centered agency in this video describes how the audience changes, adjusts, and re-assembles
      what "George" is saying to them. It is less what the speaker intended and more what the audience hears
      and how they respond. This is a better way to think about this speech, perhaps, because there is a clear
      moment when the speaker loses control of the message. Instead, the audience reacts based on what they
      *think* they heard, and not George's intended message.

  · Text-centered agency is perhaps the best way to explain this clip, and consists in the idea that it is
      neither the speaker nor the audience that is `in control' or has the ability to act, but rather the signs and
      symbols that are being cited. The phrase "I can hear you" is what has agency here. It can be addressed to
      a person or to a group. It can have multiple meanings, literally, your words register on my eardrums, or
      figuratively, your desires and wishes are known to me. The message controls the possible reactions to the
      situation.

Agency and Ideology

Given that agency describes "the capacity to act," ideology limits the capacity to act, or otherwise informs the
motives `behind' why a speaker or an audience acts in the way they do in relation to a claim. Ideology seems to
limit our agency. The beliefs we adhere to create a window upon the world that reminds us of what is and is
not possible, what we can and cannot do, what is and is not acceptable. If we adhere to the idea that upward
mobility is the only way to "make it" in the world, then this belief may limit the jobs we take, the opportunities
we seek out, or even our willingness to step away from the positions we have. The belief guides us to act in
certain ways while restricting us from behaving in others. When, for instance, we disavow the world around
us, or subscribe to beliefs that exist to justify the ideological system we inhabit, ideology limits our ability to
think and act in the world because those actions work in service of this ideology. However, de-mystification
creates the perception that we have agency because we gain the ability to read signs and symbols in a way that
we previously did not. With demystification, we gain a capacity to read, see, and understand, and therefore, to
also act differently with respect to the reality that we perceive.
         CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY | 301

Persona

In Rhetorical Studies, the word "persona" is a way to describe the characters conjured by a speech or speaker.
Only in the case of the "first persona" does it refer to the "character" of the speaker themselves, or the kind
of individual that the speaker makes themselves out to be. In all other cases ("second," "third," "fourth," and
"eavesdropping") the word persona refers to the audience that the speaker creates. It describes, for instance,
how the speech creates a vision of who the audience is for the listening audience, generating an identity with
which to identify (second persona). It also describes those audiences who are excluded, omitted, or hidden by
the speech (third, fourth, and eavesdropping persona) but which are nonetheless hailed by the speech.

1. The First Persona "is the author implied by the discourse." (p. 213) There is no one author to attribute
    the concept of the first persona because it was for a long time assumed that the intentions of the speaker
    generated the audience's imagination of itself as well as the speaker's own authoritative speaking
    position.

2. The Second Persona is "the implied audience for whom a rhetor constructs symbolic actions." (p. 213)
    The second persona is, in a way, an `original' form of ideology criticism because it was developed by
    Edwin Black as criticism of the anti-Communist John Birch Society, which metaphorically linked
    communism to cancer to constitute an audience of like-minded individuals who would take up the
    society's conservative stance and aggressively paranoid mindset.

3. The Third Persona refers to the "audiences not present, audience rejected or negated through the speech
    and/or speaking situation." (p. 214) These are the audiences excluded, but who are necessary for the
    speech to exist at all. A commemoration speech about the building of the White House that does not
    acknowledge the history of enslaved persons who labored to build it is an example of this kind of
    speaking -- the audience may or may not be present as hearers, but they are both crucial, necessary for
    the speaker to make their address and at the same time, deliberately omitted as a means of dehumanizing
    this audience or pitting them against those people who are being addressed.

4. The Fourth Persona "is an audience who recognizes that the rhetor's first persona may not reveal all that
    is relevant about the speaker's identity, but maintains silence in order to enable the rhetor to perform
    that persona." (p. 217) The scholar who develops this theory, Charles Morris, uses the example of mid-
    twentieth century FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who publicly conveyed messages about a "sex crime
    panic" while subtly dropping cues in his speeches that only a `knowing' audience would be able to
    decipher or know. These messages conveyed messages about Hoover's own gender, which gay listeners
    would be `in' on but would be unable to vocalize or address. The fourth persona is this "collusive
    audience," who is `in' on the speaker's message but who act as a silent party for their dog whistles or
    doublespeak.

5. The eavesdropping audience "is an audience whom the rhetor desires to hear the message despite
    explicitly targeting the message at a different audience." (p. 217) This can be for two reasons: (a) To
302 | CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY

      limit room for response by, or the agency of, the eavesdropping audience or (b) To allow the
      eavesdropping audience to feel empowered because they are not being criticized even as they hear
      criticisms made against others.

The eavesdropping audience is most often credited to Gloria Anzaldua, who "addresses a specific group
of women, `third world women,' not all women (and not to any men). She linguistically and symbolically
reinforces this address in the first and last sections by opening with "Mujeres de color," thus placing first-world
women (and men) in the position of reading mail unintended for them. They become the eavesdroppers. The
letter moves first-world women (and all men) to a borderland when it does not address the letter to them, while
it empowers "Mujeres de color" by literally addressing them as the primary subjects. First-world women are
written about. Men are just absent; they are not written to, nor do they write. Men and first-world women are
uninvited eavesdroppers and, hence, suspended from a critical position. They are reminded of their difference.
They are reminded that they constantly tokenize third-world women and deny differences among women. The
letter reverses power relationships so that first-world women are allowed access without input, a condition
"Mujeres de color" often experience. (p.218)

   As a final note about these different kinds of persona, there are circumstances when there are multiple
personas at work in a single speech or written work. For example, Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from
Birmingham Jail" is addressed to multiple audiences: It is explicitly addressed to "My Dear Fellow Clergymen"
-- meaning white moderates, who comprise a direct second persona, the implied listeners or readers of this
document. It also indirectly speaks to all Black people in the United States as King attempts to persuade them
to risk their bodies in nonviolent civil disobedience in civil rights protests. This is the audience who is invited
to "eavesdrop" on the conversation. White moderates appear unwilling to act, so it is other African Americans
who must be persuaded to push for social change. (p. 219)

      "Like King, [black readers] can view themselves as agents who need not and will not suffer the indifference of
      white moderates, who can break free of external restraints without losing self-restraint, and who can work from
      within American society to make fundamental changes in the way they conceive themselves and are conceived
      by others." (Leff and Utley)

Let's consider another example: an anti-child abuse advertisement that is designed for reception by multiple
audiences. In this case, the advertisement is the "speech" or "rhetoric" that constitutes a variety of different
characters.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=152#oembed-3
                                                                                                      CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY | 303

The first persona is the persona of the speaker or crater of the advertisement. It consists in their intended
meaning as well as the position of the "socially responsible company," who is authorized to act on behalf of
suffering children.

   The second persona is the implied audience of the message, the person or people to whom the advertisement
is addressed. The implied audience is the adult who is reading the ad, and who sees themselves in the way that
the company would like. This reader might, for example, recognize that harm done to children is invisible, and
supports the idea of a socially conscious company doing something about it.

   The third persona is the excluded audience of the message who is nonetheless necessary for its existence. It is
the fact of the person who abuses or harms children, the person who cannot or is not "persuaded" to stop this
abuse, but who must exist for the advertisement to also have meaning.

   The fourth persona is, finally, the audience who "colludes" with the speaker, who is `in' on the message even
if no one else knows it. It is a message within the message for the hearer, for whom it was designed. This is the
child, who alone is able to see, hear, or read the message for its subversive meaning. In this case, the child may
also be the eavesdropping audience, whose relative inconspicuousness allows them to be empowered because
they are not being criticized even as they hear criticisms made against others.

Persona and Ideology

Persona, or "the implied speaker/audience" is implicated in ideology because creating a persona requires that
we identify with an ideology. This means that a shared system of belief is necessary to create a shared impression
of the speaker, audience, as well as "eavesdropping," and "collusive" parties. In that sense, persona describes
the ideological disposition the speaker would like the audience to have, as well as the ideological disposition
shared by the audience and speaker. It is a way of talking about the common ground established between these
characters, and how that "ground" creates the conditions of exclusion or nonparticipation. One may be part
of the same ideological belief system or be a part of it by virtue of being excluded from it. Ultimately, persona
allows us to think about the expression of ideology as the relative position of the audience to a message that
influences their system of belief and representation.

Speech Acts

The theory of speech acts is typically attributed to J.L. Austin, a British ordinary language philosopher. His
schema of the locution (shown below) offered important and widely cited distinctions between the constative
and performatives, and within the category of performatives, illocutionary force, and perlocutionary effects.
304 | CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY

J.L. Austin's Schema of Locutionary Utterances.

The locution is the most general category of an utterance. It is, for our purposes "any" utterance or instance of
speech. A locution may be constative or performative.

   A constative utterance is what we most often understand as "denotation," "reference" or literal meaning. To
call an utterance "constative" makes the assumption that the thing said corresponds with a real thing in the
world. There is no room for subjective interpretation with the constative utterance; things mean what they
mean regardless of the context they occupy. In the example suggested below, "that's an interesting hot dish,"
the word interesting literally means "provoking curiosity or interest." Free from context, "that's an interesting
hot dish" is a way of describing your contribution to the potluck as novel,

   A performative utterance is one that depends upon context for its meaning. Traditionally, it corresponds
with the "connotative" or "subjective" meaning of an utterance. But it is also much more than that: when
we talk about the performative, the words have an interpersonal force for the people it is addressed to. If we
said a performative utterance in one context, it would not necessarily land the same in another. It also lands
differently, depending upon the person to whom it is addressed. If I said "that's an interesting hot dish" to
someone from Georgia, where I went to school, it likely wouldn't bother anyone. But if I were to say the same
phrase to a guest in Minnesota, it would land with the force of an insult.

   To explain the unique consequences of the performative, Austin divides the performative into two
kinds: illocutionary force and perlocutionary effect.

   The performative's illocutionary force refers to statements that have an effect `as stated', or the doing of
something as one states it. "I pronounce you both married" is an example because there is something done
                                                                                                      CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY | 305

in the saying of this phrase: it transforms two people from being "engaged" into a family unit with a special
personal, religious, and legal significance. One way to think of illocutionary force is as
the immediate consequences of the speech act. In the case of "that's an interesting hot dish," it transforms the
relationship between the cook and the recipient by serving up an insult at the moment.

   The performative's perlocutionary effect refers to consequences not immediately experienced when the
speech act is spoken. It may be thought of as a distant or long-term effect of the speech act. Marriage confers
a number of long-term consequences that are not immediately felt: a shared bank account, expectations with
respect to in-laws, new habits of communication. In the case of the "hot dish," the statement might strain the
relationship between the people involved, or it might provoke the hot-dish maker to seek revenge.

   Example: "That's" an interesting casserole/hot dish"

Utterances               Definition                              Examples
Constative
Performative             Denotation, meaning free from           "Interesting" as a denotation.
                         context
Illocutionary (force)                                            "Interesting" as connotation.
                         Subjective meaning or connotation,
Perlocutionary (effect)  meaning dependent upon context.         "I now pronounce you married" or
                                                                 "The jury finds the defendant
                         Responds to the speech act as stated.   not-guilty," both of which transform
                         The performance of an act `in' saying   the subjectivities of persons.
                         something.
                                                                 The performative force is "Insult"
                         The consequential effects upon the      Changes to tax filings of the
                         feelings, thoughts, or actions of the   expunging of criminal records.
                         audience, or of the speaker, or of the
                         other                                   The performative effect is "Revenge"

Up to this point, we've been considering performatives that "work," or that have the intended consequence.
When I say, "that's an interesting hot dish," and you hear sarcasm, that's a felicitous performative or one
that hits its mark. But speech acts don't always work the way we intend. When a speech act does not have the
performative effect its speaker anticipates, it is called an infelicitous performative. Let's watch this example:

One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=152#oembed-4

What does Michael misunderstand about speech acts? He doesn't understand that "declaration" is a legal and
bureaucratic act, not just one you can speak into existence. It's a speech act that doesn't hit the mark because it
306 | CHAPTER 14: RHETORIC AND IDEOLOGY

can't be addressed the way he does. As illocution, it cannot make him into a bankrupted subject (he did that to
himself) and as perlocution, it cannot entitle him to the benefits he seeks by claiming this legal status.

Speech Acts and Ideology

Speech acts, or "utterances that perform as an effect of being stated" are related to ideology because ideology
creates many kinds of effects through speech. In fact, ideology reproduces itself through speech acts. Speech
acts also have the ability to create and misidentify the subjectivity of the speaker or those spoken to/about,
thereby subjecting them to repressive or hegemonic ideologies.

   A famous example of the speech act is the hail of the police. As you are walking down the street, the police
call out "hey you," and your back is turned to them. The phrase "hey you" is the speech act. The consequences
are significant because the recognition -- even the incorrect recognition -- that you are the person being called
out, or that you are the "subject of the hail" is the consequence of ideology. That is the system or structure that
has to exist even before those words were said. Ideology calls you into being as a subject, as someone who exists
in the same system of power and hierarchy. The illocutionary effect is to turn around in the moment, but the
perlocutionary effect is to recognize yourself as subject to the law. This is called interpellation.

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=152#oembed-5

Interpellation has many different kinds of effects. Rhetorical scholar Maurice Charland explains that "a
people" come together when people write up founding documents. These documents are performative speech
acts; they include the American Declaration of Independence or the Canadian Constitution of the Peuple
Quebecois. Each of these is performative because they had short and long-term effects for not just one person,
but a specific group of people: they named themselves as independent or separate from an existing governing
entity. Judith Butler, author of Gender Trouble and Excitable Speech, returns us to the police, saying that these
kinds of speech acts often aren't as explicit as a "hey you." Instead, they may take the form of legal arguments
or personal injuries that can deny the person named of their gender identity. Butler calls this kind of speech act
a "violating interpellation," in which a person is made less-than through ideologically-driven institutions and
actors.

This chapter discusses the emergence of Latine rhetorical theory and criticism in the field of communication.
Though the field of communication has long been hostile to Latine-oriented rhetorical theories,
methodologies, and topics, Latine scholars and non-Latine scholars have worked to bring Latine rhetoric,
concepts, and topics into the field. Though the full range of Latine rhetorical contributions is beyond the
scope of this chapter, we offer the rhetorical concepts and methods of the prominent Chicana feminist Gloria
Anzaldúa and groundbreaking theologian Gustavo Gutiérrez. In doing so, we develop the nepantla rhetorical
methodology and rhetorical methodology of radical hope to illustrate the value Latine rhetorical theory and
criticism holds for Latine and non-Latine students and scholars of rhetoric alike.

   Key Theoretical Terms: Latine rhetoric, Chicana feminism, Gloria Anzaldúa, nepantla, Gustavo
Gutiérrez, radical hope

   As discussed in Chapter 2: The "Origins" Of Rhetorical Theory, the field of rhetorical studies holds a
troubling past that continues to shape the discipline. For much of its history, the study of rhetoric focused on
the formal speaking practices of political or religious leaders. Definitions of rhetoric as the "art of persuasion"
(Aristotle 384-322 BC) or "the art of speaking well" (Quintilianus circa 35-100 AD) have long influenced the
field and supported this emphasis on public figures. It is only recently that the field of rhetorical studies has
expanded to consider rhetoric as a world-making practice. The implications of this newer, more inclusive, and
productive definition, however, have not yet been fully appreciated.

   To better understand and appreciate why the understanding of rhetoric as a world-making practice matters,
this chapter is structured as follows: (1) we explain how the history of rhetorical studies led to the exclusion
of women and non-white people; (2) we explain how Latine scholars and non-Latine scholars worked to bring
Latine rhetoric, concepts, and people into the field; and, (3) we discuss the work of Gloria Anzaldúa and build
upon her work to offer a nepantla rhetorical methodology; (4) we discuss the work of Gustavo Gutiérrez and

  build upon his work to offer a rhetorical methodology of radical hope. Our aim is for this chapter to introduce
  students, professors, and practitioners of rhetoric to two crucial Latine theorists of rhetoric.

 Part 1: The History of Rhetorical Studies and Why it
 Matters

  For most of its history, the field of rhetorical studies has defined rhetoric as some variation of the art of
  persuasion and speaking well. In the negative sense, this led some, such as Plato (circa 427-348 BC) to associate
  rhetoric with empty language or simply saying what people want to hear. In the more positive sense, others,
  such as Plato's student, Aristotle (384-322 BC), saw this art of speaking well as a virtue (something good)
  that if studied and practiced ethically could lead to a better society. This definition continued to undergo
  refinement and transformation throughout history with a focus on religion (Augustine, 354-430), politics
  (Rabanus Maurus, circa 780-856), and the communication of reason itself (Francis Bacon, 1561-1626). This
  notion of rhetoric as some variation of the study and art of persuasion and speaking well continued with the
  establishment of the academic discipline of communication studies in the twentieth century.

     The careful reader will notice that the history offered above focuses on the field of rhetorical studies and
  not the everyday practice of rhetoric. The reason for this distinction is because rhetoric has always been a
  world-making practice. However, from the days of Plato to the present, the field of rhetorical studies has long
  been concerned with policing the practice of rhetoric. As the very first issue of The Quarterly Journal of Public
  Speaking (the oldest journal in the field of rhetorical studies) wrote in 1915:

        In the earliest formal education recorded, what held the foremost place? Rhetoric. And what was rhetoric? It
        was oral discussion. [....]. On down through the centuries it came, and the first half of the nineteenth century
        saw in the United States the forum, together with the [public lecture hall], flourishing in hundreds of thousands
        of communities. The years between 1840 and 1850 could turn out tens of thousands to hear the debates
        between the Little Giant [Stephen A. Douglas] and Old Abe; they could fill halls to suffocation to hear Sumner
        and Curtis; they could sustain an active interest in the debating club or literary society, in many a country
        schoolhouse and village hall. [....].

           Then came the Civil War. [....]. Then there entered the new era of state schools, organized and graded systems;
        new subjects into the curriculum; new social and educational interests; the period when there is too much
        reading of the lighter sort, too much work, too much play, a thousand and one avenues for self-expression [...]. In
        the place of [the forum and public lecture hall] we have the community dance hall, the movies, and the traveling
        show. 1

  Just as Plato had condemned the Sophists (Ancient Greek educators) for teaching a form of rhetoric that

   312 | CHAPTER 15: LATINE RHETORICAL THEORY

  challenged traditional authority, so too did the modern field of rhetorical studies embrace a similar critique of
  society. Early twentieth-century scholars of rhetoric established what we now know as the modern discipline
  of communication studies with the objective of restoring formal, public deliberation to what they believed was
  its rightful place.

     The 1915 research agenda promoted by this new field of communication studies, then known as the
  National Association of Academic Teachers of Public Speaking (NAATPS), offers insight into what they
  believed was needed for rhetorical studies to return to its rightful place:

        How does good English function as a means of securing, recording, and communicating experiences?

        What part do perceptions, images, ideas, thoughts, feelings, and purposes have in determining men's
        experiences?

        The structure, functions, and development of audiences, including such topics as: The crowd, the mob, the
        society, and the army.

        The development of speech in the child and in the race.

        An interpretive study in the light of modern methods of great orators and orations of the past.2

  This research agenda promoted monolingualism, patriarchy, whiteness, and an adherence to tradition
  (particularly that of European history). This program, the NAATPS argued, would "teach and does teach men
  and women to think, seriously, enthusiastically, happily, to a certain extent effectively."3This had the added
  benefit of making the field "orthodox," which the NAATPS believed would help improve the standing of their
  work "in the academic world."4

     The modern field of rhetorical studies began with this desire to reclaim its historical position as a critical
  discipline of study. To work its way back to the center, the field recreated its own mythic past from the Ancient
  Greeks and Romans to the present. In doing so, the field sought validation from other established academic
  disciplines and elite political circles and developed its own nativist, ableist, racist, patriarchal, and classist
  research and teaching agenda. This foundation is troubling on its own. What came next made it worse: World
  War I, World War II, and the Cold War.

     On April 6, 1917, two years after the establishment of the NAATPs, the United States declared war on
  Germany and joined the Allied forces in World War I. The Great War was devastating in scale and scope,

  leaving millions dead, countries in disrepair, and the redrawing of national boundaries. This alone would be
  noteworthy. The massive global scale of the war required the mobilization of the populations of entire nations,
  which led countries to leverage their established and emerging media and communication technologies "in
  ways they had never been used before to propagandize entire populations to new heights of patriotism,
  commitment to the war effort, and hatred of the enemy."5 Public address, as well, was given a role to play in the
  war effort as the US Committee on Public Information (which was established to "sell the war to America")
  sponsored a National Speakers Bureau to promote Liberty bond sales.6 Countries that had previously
  neglected their public-facing communication initiatives began investing heavily in communication research.

     By the start of the Cold War, patriotic fervor and substantial federal funding had led to the massive
  institutionalization of communication departments across the country.7 Rhetoric faculty who had just left
  English departments to establish their own academic departments found themselves joined by social scientists
  in new departments of speech communication, which was reflected in the changing of the name of the
  National Association of Academic Teachers of Public Speaking to the Speech Communication Association in
  1970.8 Though the merging of humanistic and social scientific traditions into a single discipline led to some
  tension, the effect it had on rhetoric was an upsurge in imperialistic rhetorical studies.9

     This is not to suggest that everyone in the field of rhetorical studies happily welcomed this nationalistic
  trend. Rather, the point is that the field of rhetorical studies' celebration of the Greek tradition combined with
  the patriotic fervor that followed The Great War and World War II through the Cold War meant that, with
  few exceptions, Black rhetoric, Latine rhetoric, Asian rhetoric, women's rhetoric, and more, were ignored and

   have continued to be marginalized for most of the history of rhetorical studies. With the exception of one
   rhetorical study on "Old-time Negro Preaching,"10 published in 1945, it would not be until 1968 with Parke
   G. Burgess "The Rhetoric of Black Power" that the field of rhetorical studies' flagship journal, the Quarterly
   Journal of Speech (QJS), would begin publishing rhetorical analyses of Black rhetoric.11 An analysis of Asian
   rhetoric would appear earlier, in 1949, with "The Rhetoric of Japanese War Propaganda," and then only
   appear sporadically, even to this day.12 Women's rhetoric appears in 1937, primarily due to the scholarly efforts
   of Doris G. Yoakam, then mostly disappears until the 1960s and 1970s.13 Latine rhetoric does not appear in
   QJS until 1994, with the publication of "Ethnic Heritage as Rhetorical Legacy" by John C. Hammerback and
   Richard J. Jensen.14

      The point of this history is not to suggest that Latine rhetoricians or scholarship did not exist prior to
   the publications listed in the previous paragraph--as Latine rhetoric has long existed--but rather that the
   field of rhetorical studies' sociocultural norms, political economic interests, and mythologization of the Greeks
   has had lasting impacts on the rhetorical landscape, including gatekeeping the entrance of minoritized voices.
   As it pertains to this chapter, for the vast majority of the field's history, the discipline of rhetoric has been
   inhospitable to Latine rhetorical criticism, theories, and practices. By Latine rhetorical theories and practices,
   we mean the following: (1) rhetorical criticism or analysis produced by scholars invested in understanding
   the meaning and impact of communication produced by Latines; (2) rhetorical theories produced by scholars
   rooted in Latine philosophies, cultures, communities, geographies, and experiences; and (3) the rhetorical
   practices of Latine people. This definition is inclusive of the men (Latino), women (Latina), and non-binary

   geographies, cultures, and territories of Latin America, Central America, Mexico, and various Caribbean
   countries, such as Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. We use the term Latine, instead of Latina,
   Latino, or Latinx, as we believe the non-binary nature of Latine is the most inclusive and builds upon the
   existing conventions of the already-existing gender-neutral terminology of the languages most common to
   Latine countries, Spanish and Portuguese.

  Part 2: How Latine Rhetoric has been Studied in the
  Field of Communication

   The 1960s and 1970s were an era of substantial social and political upheaval within the United States. Women
   and Ethnic Minorities across the United States demanded social, political, and economic rights, and these
   demands also extended to academic institutions. The first Women's Studies, African American Studies, Asian
   American Studies, and Chicano Studies programs and departments were established during the late 1960s and
   early 1970s. These demands likewise placed pressure on existing academic disciplines, such as Communication
   Studies, to engage with the histories, interests, and needs of these communities. As it pertains to Latine
   Rhetoric, the field of communication followed the lead of Chicano Studies, focusing first on the rhetoric of
   politicized Mexican-American communities (i.e., Chicanos) in the American Southwest.

      The earliest publications on Latine Rhetoric focused almost exclusively on, as Michelle Holling documents,
   explaining why the field of communication needed to understand the historical and geographic conditions
   that led to the politicization of Mexican-American communities (i.e., what factors contributed to someone
   becoming a Chicano). This emphasis on understanding the conditions under which Mexican-Americans
   became politicized as Chicanos, and thus began producing Chicano rhetoric, is not surprising, considering
   that Lloyd F. Bitzer's "The Rhetorical Situation," which shifted the field of communication towards studying
   the context of rhetorical production, was published in 1968. (See also Chapter 5: The Rhetorical Situation).
   Lloyd Powers's 1973 article in The Southern Journal of Communication, for example, set out to understand the
   topoi, or "eminently suitable `places'" that Chicano speakers "go to to seek arguments suitable to a Chicano
   audience."15 He identified these shared rhetorical resources as (a) the feeling of oppression, (b) La Raza,16 (c)

   the robbery of the conquered people, (d) Huelga,17 and (e) Aztlán.18 Powers believed that these five "major
   presuppositions" comprised the broad totality from which Chicano identity, and thus rhetoric, emerged.
   Powers's descriptive terminology was limited in ways similar to "the rhetorical situation": both conceived of
   the rhetor as subordinate to the context in which they found themselves. Hence Powers's conclusion that
   "underlying the communication of the Chicano qua Chicano is always a feeling of being oppressed" and a
   "pervasive feeling of being a member of a special people."19 Nonetheless, his work (and that of others during
   this era) was important for positioning Chicanos as mediators of change and, as Holling argues, for bringing
   the work of Chicanos to the field of communication.

      Scholarship on Latine Rhetoric in the 1980s built upon the foundation established in the 1970s and
   continued to emphasize Chicano (i.e., Mexican-American male) rhetors. With few exceptions, scholars of
   Latine Rhetoric during this era focused exclusively on the public rhetoric of Mexican-American men. The
   rhetoric and social contexts of political activists, such as César Chávez and Reies Lopez Tijerina, garnered
   particular interest during this period. Though important figures, the overwhelming emphasis on male rhetors,
   had the effect of erasing the centrality of Women, Indigenous, Afro-latine, Queer, and other groups who had
   been part of the Chicano and Latine community, movement, and rhetorical tradition all along. For example,
   while César Chávez was being canonized as a key public figure within the discipline of communication, the
   critical contributions of his longtime colleague and collaborator Dolores Huerta were absent, if not erased.

   The prevailing use of classical rhetorical methodologies or updated variations of those traditions throughout
   the 1980s, with its emphasis on identifying and uplifting great, timeless orators (read male), could not conceive
   of such a designation extending to Latinas. Referred to in the popular press as Chávez's girlfriend rather
   than the Vice-President of the United Farm Workers labor union, it would not be until Stacey Sowards's

   Ethnicity, and Class: An Examination of Dolores Huerta's Rhetoric" in Communication Theory that
   Communication Studies would receive a sustained analysis of Huerta's rhetoric.20 So though this era of what
   Holling (2008) terms the "decade of [Latine rhetorical] integration" greatly expanded the field of Latine
   rhetorical studies, the studies "produced a narrow interpretation of what and who were associated with
   Chicano rhetoric" and led to the under-examination and obfuscation of "the contributions of Chicanas within
   the very organizations led by Chávez, Tijerina, and Gutiérrez" and other male Latine rhetors spotlighted during
   this period to this day.21

      Fortunately, this began to change in the 1990s with the publication of Lisa Flores's 1996 The Quarterly
   Journal of Speech article "Creating Discursive Space through a Rhetoric of Difference: Chicana Feminists Craft
   a Homeland," which served as the first communication publication to critique the sexism of the Chicano
   movement and introduced the rhetorical strategies of Chicana feminists to the field. Flores's article marked a
   sharp break from prior analyses of Latine rhetoric in that her emphasis was on how "Chicana feminists use
   their creative works as a tool in the discursive construction of a space of their own" that "runs counter to that
   created for them by either Anglos or Mexicans".22 As Holling (2008) notes, the decade prior to Flores' article
   tended to endorse "rhetorically accepted modes of criticism that left unquestioned the assumption of a unified
   `Chicano rhetoric' and Chicano identity that glossed over internal tensions within the movement."23 "Creating
   Discursive Space" was also emblematic of the move in the 1990s towards a more complex account of how
   "ethnic and historical origins informed a text, [the] socio-political relations shaping the production of text(s),
   authorial reflexivity, and the need for critics to resist static constructions of identity that are easily unsettled."24
   Scholarship from this decade tended to emphasize how Latine communities--in all their vernacular and
   fragmented beauty--were rhetorical agents and theorists in their own right.

      This theoretical shift was accompanied by a critical institutional shift, which makes sense considering the
   heavy emphasis on Chicano and Latine political organizing during this (and the preceding periods). As Alberto

   González, Bernadette M. Calafell, and Roberto Avant-Mier note, the "shift away from traditional rhetorical
   methods" that took full force in the 1990s and embrace of Latine culture "allowed for the development
   of a new critical vocabulary" that changed the way scholars approached Latine rhetoric and institutional
   organizing.25 This is most evident in two distinct but related important academic events in the history of Latine
   communication studies: the establishment of the Speech Communication Association's La Raza Caucus in
   1990 and the Latina/o Communication Studies Division for the same association (now known as the National
   Communication Association) in 1997. The establishment of these two institutional homes--the first focused
   on advocacy and the second focused on "the dissemination of scholarly work" (though both do serve as
   platforms for both)--provided Latine scholars with a space to explore opportunities (such as mentorship
   and sharing of research) that existed at best in a limited capacity elsewhere. These two academic homes have
   provided Latine scholars with the space needed to push the boundaries of what constitutes Latine rhetorical
   studies--which is exactly what we see taking place over the next two decades.

      Latine rhetorical scholarship produced from the 2000s to the present has continued the shift away from
   emphasizing elite speakers and passive audiences towards analyzing the spaces, identities, and movements
   created by and about Latine communities. In the 2000s, which Holling refers to as the "decade of
   repoliticalization," this manifested primarily in terms of analyzing political and social movement rhetoric and
   unpacking the rhetorical construction of Latinidad itself.26 The more recent decade, 2010 to the present,
   continues some of this trend but with notable differences. Recent scholarship has placed greater emphasis
   on reclaiming the cultural, political, and intellectual histories and realities that were obscured or prohibited
   throughout much of our history within the field. Contemporary Latine rhetoricians have taken the task of
   coming to terms with what historically could and could not be studied, how it was to be studied, and who
   could be studied. Contemporary Latine rhetoricians have been working to show that Latine rhetoricians and
   rhetorical scholars have been producing rhetorical theory and practice throughout the history of the field.
   Latine rhetoricians have worked to imagine what Latine landscapes would look like if we took seriously how
   issues of racism, sexism, discrimination, colorism, ableism, and other systems of domination affect and are
   embedded within Latine communities. Latine rhetoricians have likewise looked to reclaim our histories with
   and connections to Indigenous, Queer, Afro-Latine, and other marginalized groups both within and outside
   of Latinidad.27

   The harm inflicted on Latine rhetoric and rhetoricians continues to be felt due to the field's historical and
   ongoing reverence for conventional rhetorical traditions and overwhelming marginalization of rhetoric
   produced by women and racialized minorities. Nonetheless, Latine rhetoricians and Latine rhetoric have
   created a space and vocabulary of their own. Terms such as Latinidad, Latina/o/x/e, borders, nepantla,
   testimonio, autohistoria-teoría, theories of the flesh, and other key concepts have become common and
   productive theoretical parlance for the field. The challenge "is getting those outside [Latine Communication
   Studies] to see the importance of the work, not simply for what it illustrates about Latina/o identities, but
   about Communication Studies itself."28 The rest of the chapter aims to confront this challenge by spotlighting
   the history and critical contributions of two important Latine theorists, Gloria Anzaldúa and Gustavo
   Gutiérrez.

  Part 3: Latine Rhetorical Theory: Key Concepts,
  Methods, and Theorists

   This section discusses the critical contributions of Gloria Anzaldúa and Gustavo Gutiérrez. This section is not
   meant to serve as an exhaustive list of Latine theorists, concepts, and methodologies. Rather, it offers a primer
   on important Latine theorists for those looking to learn more about Latine theories, methods, and scholars.

      Before continuing, however, it is necessary for us to define what we believe constitutes the core tenets of
   Latine rhetorical theory. Our conception of Latine rhetoric builds upon the important review undertaken
   by Claudia Anguiano and Mari Casteñeda of the theoretical progression of Latine communication studies. 29

     320 | CHAPTER 15: LATINE RHETORICAL THEORY

   Though the study and practice of rhetoric extends beyond the field of communication studies, Anguiano and
   Casteñeda offer a compelling set of tenets that can be adapted to articulate what constitutes Latine rhetoric
   and rhetorical theory. These tenets should not be understood as compulsory or constituting an exhaustive list.
   They are nonetheless helpful for understanding several critical interests of Latine rhetoricians and rhetorical
   theorists.

      The tenets offered by Claudia Anguiano and Mari Casteñeda consist of: (1) centralizing the Latine
   experience; (2) deploying decolonizing methodological approaches; (3) acknowledging and addressing the
   racism faced by and perpetuated by the Latine community; (4) resisting literacy-colorblind language/rhetoric
   toward Latines; and (5) promoting a social justice dimension.30 To this, we would add that Latine rhetorical
   theory intervenes upon existing epistemological frameworks to illustrate why Latine perspectives matter for
   our understanding of the world. Latine rhetorical theory conceives of Latine as more than "artifacts" or
   "topics" of study. Latine rhetoricians and rhetorical theorists make claims on the nature of the political,
   economic, social, cultural, spiritual, environmental, etc., so that, we argue, our understanding of the world is
   incomplete if we remain ignorant of Latine voices, perspectives, and theories.

  The Rhetorical Concepts and Methods of Gloria Anzaldúa

   This section discusses the critical contributions of Gloria Anzaldúa, an essential and influential Latine theorist.
   It concludes with a discussion of some important considerations to keep in mind when engaging with Latine
   rhetoric.

  Gloria Anzaldúa: Biography and Key Concepts

   Gloria Anzaldúa was born in the Rio Grande Valley, South Texas, in 1942. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in
   English, Art, and Secondary Education from Pan American University, then earned a master of Arts in English
   and Education at the University of Texas at Austin. She started her Ph.D. program at UT Austin but left
   when she was ABD (all but done with dissertation) to move to Santa Cruz, California, to become a public
   intellectual. She regularly spoke about how UT Austin did not accept her queer identity and that this impacted

   her decision to leave.31 During her life, Anzaldúa was a prolific scholar and public intellectual whose co-edited
   book, This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (1981, with Cherríe Moraga), was a
   landmark publication--indeed, one of the most cited collections of feminist writings.32

   Her scholarship nonetheless remained ignored by the field of communication until Lisa Flores's 1996 article
   in The Quarterly Journal of Speech. Even today, outside of Latine scholars (within and outside the field
   of communication), most scholars engage with Anzaldúa's work at a superficial level, often as a passing
   reference.33 This is despite her many national and international honors and awards received throughout her
   life. Anzaldúa was well aware that she had become tokenized by "whites" and despised that her work was often
   treated as a "mere referencing and not a deep exploration"34 and that, even then, her voice was being used to
   silence other women of color: "I had grown frustrated that the same few women-of-color were asked to read or
   lecture in universities or classrooms, or to submit to anthologies and quarterlies. Why weren't other women-
   of-color being asked?"35 Anzaldúa attributed this to the "old divide-and-conquer strategy" whereby "ethnic
   groups are thrown a few crumbs in the form of teaching positions, grants, decision-making in hiring, etc." and
   encouraged "to fight each other for them."36.

     322 | CHAPTER 15: LATINE RHETORICAL THEORY

      These experiences and others informed her theorizing and politics. She embraced the concept of mestizaje
   ("mixed-blood, mixed culture"37 and wrote regularly of her discomfort with labels, whether they be associated
   with "race, gender, class, sexuality, or any of the traditional categories".38 The mestizaje, according to Anzaldúa,
   is an identity extended to those who live in the borderlands:

          neither hispana india negra española
             ni gabacha, eres mestiza, mulata, half-breed
             caught in the crossfire between camps
             while carrying all five races on your back
             not knowing which side to turn to, run from;
             [....]
             To survive the Borderlands
             You must live sin fronteras
             be a crossroads.39

   To be mestiza, then, was not an inherently celebratory identity or mode of existence for Anzaldúa, but rather a
   necessary means of survival.

      Though Anzaldúa positioned the mestiza as an anti-racist subjectivity, it is important to note that the
   concept has been critiqued for its indebtedness to the influential Mexican philosopher, politician, and
   eugenicist, Jose Vasconcelos. He believed that, if "accomplished according to the laws of social well-being,
   sympathy, and beauty," the act of mestizaje "will lead to the creation of a [new race] infinitely superior to all
   that have previously existed.40 While acknowledging that Anzaldúa's "account of "mestizaje subjectivity was
   clearly formulated as an anti-racist project, as she highlights rather than avoids issues of racial hierarchy within
   Latinidad," Juliet Hooker compellingly argues that her "highly selective reading [...] is arguably emblematic
   of the distorted, or at least extremely partial, use of Latin American philosophical sources in Latino political
   thought" and that "there are important caveats about the anti-racist potential of the mestizaje that [Anzaldúa]
   fails to consider."41 Indeed, the "laws of social well-being, sympathy, and beauty," of which Vasconcelos writes,

   are rooted in what he describes as an "aesthetic eugenics" or "selection of taste" in which only the most
   beautiful from each of the races would reproduce.42 The result, according to Vasconcelos, will enable the "the
   Black [to] be redeemed, and step by step, by voluntary extinction the uglier stocks will give way to the more
   handsome. Inferior races, upon being educated, would become less prolific, and the better specimens would go
   on ascending a scale of ethnic improvement, whose maximum type is not precisely the White but a new race
   to which the White himself will have to aspire."43 Failing to recognize this history of mestizaje can "serve to
   obscure existing racial hierarchies within Latino communities and continue to render invisible the existence of
   black and indigenous Latinos within Latinidad."44

      If conceived in critical terms, and not as a romanticized, superior, "fifth race," the concept of mestizaje,
   particularly mestizaje consciousness, remains useful for thinking through the racial politics and experiences
   of Latines. Instead of celebrating Latin America's supposed progressive history of racial mixing, a more
   productive approach would be to "tread a similar path to the one gestured to by Anzaldúa's brief comments
   on how cross-racial solidarity among Latinos and other subordinated racial groups in the USA could be forged
   on the basis of exploring each group's internal hierarchies and knowing each other's histories."45 This would
   shift the notion of mestizaje from a romantic concept to one that demands awareness of the ongoing history
   of sexual violence committed "against Black and Indigenous women in the process of [racial] mixing."46 It
   would require that we "highlight the experiences of those groups rendered invisible by traditional narratives
   of mestizaje, such as black and indigenous Latinos."47 It would also require "plumbing the fissures within
   Latinidad--especially those produced by national/regional/and social class hierarchies"--to understand how
   Latine contribute to the theory and practice of race within and outside the United States.48 As Raquel Moreira

   argues, "we cannot properly honor Anzaldúa's intellectual legacy [...] without reckoning with the aspects of
   their formulations that might contribute to our [Latine] community's anti-Blackness."49

      With these criticisms and recommendations in mind, we can now return to the concept of mestiza
   consciousness, not as an innate, celebratory identity but rather as a critical orientation towards the "breaking
   down of paradigms [...] the straddling of two or more cultures" and the work of "creating a new mythos--that
   is a change in the way we perceive reality, the way we see ourselves, and the ways we behave--la mestiza
   creates a new consciousness."50 This creation and living of this new, anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-ableist, anti-
   colonial consciousness is difficult and "a source of intense pain," and to better understand why this is so, it is
   necessary to turn to the rest of Anzaldúa's methodological repertoire: nepantla, Coyolxauhqui imperative, and
   Autohistoria-teoría.51

  Nepantla

   The concept of nepantla is "a Nahuatl word for an in-between space, el lugar entre medio. Es una palabra
   indígena que se refiere a tierra de en medio, a un lugar no-lugar."52 Anzaldúa came to this term when
   considering the reception of her initial conception of the physical, psychological, and sexual borderlands,
   which was so critical to her notion of the mestiza consciousness. Though her conception of the concept in
   Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza emerged from her experience with the physical border of the
   U.S.-Mexico border, the specificities of this particular border were not central to her argument; psychological
   borderlands can be present anytime two worlds meet:

          The psychological borderlands, the sexual borderlands and the spiritual borderlands are not particular to the
          Southwest. In fact, the Borderlands are physically present wherever two or more cultures edge each other, where
          people of different races occupy the same territory, where under, lower, middle and upper classes touch, where
          the space between two individuals shrinks with intimacy.53

   Some began to romanticize the concept, perhaps due to a cursory reading of intimacy, and began to

   inappropriately adapt her work as being a celebration of unproblematic multiculturalism--when throughout
   her writings she consistently notes that the borderlands are "not a comfortable territory to live in, this place of
   contradictions. Hatred, anger, and exploitation are the prominent features of this landscape."54

      The concept of Nepantla offered Anzaldúa a way of stepping away from the sanitized uptake of borderlands
   and attempting to correct the problematic, uncritical celebration of mestiza consciousness. Mestiza
   consciousness, like the borderlands, is not a peaceful psychic space; its awakening and existence is "a source of
   intense pain" precisely because its "energy comes from continual creative motion that keeps breaking down the
   unitary aspect of each new paradigm."55 This demands a constant state of self-reflection and self-critique as its
   objective is to "reclaim one's voice [...] in order to name a source [...] of oppression, even within one's own
   psyche."56 This journey towards mestiza consciousness is the path of conocimiento (self-knowledge). To better
   understand the connection between nepantla, conocimiento, and mestiza consciousness, it is now necessary to
   explore this space of nepantla and articulate the process of a nepantla rhetorical methodology.

  Towards A Nepantla Rhetorical Methodology

   The rhetorical intervention offered by Anzaldúa is that of understanding how the art of speaking of one's
   self into existence is a necessary means of survival--especially for those who live within Nepantla. When the
   whole world is designed for one's existence (i.e., those who are dominant members of society), then the art of
   speaking well or world-making is directed outward. When there is no space for one's existence within the world
   (i.e., those who are subordinate members of society), then the rhetorical target must in part be one's self. To
   better illustrate why this is so and how Anzaldúa's philosophical concepts can be assembled into a powerful
   rhetorical methodology of the self (and community), this section is dedicated to outlining the three stages of
   a nepantla rhetorical methodology: (1) el alma atrapado (the trapped soul); (2) el recuerdo (the memory); and
   (3) la imperativa Coyolxuhqui (the Coyolxuhqui imperative).

   El Alma Atrapado

   The first step of nepantla is that of recognizing un alma atrapado, that one's soul is trapped. This entrapment
   may be physical, psychological, or spiritual in origin, but the entanglement of the three leads to a severe sense
   of unease: the sense that one has been broken. This sense of brokenness must cut across all three planes

     326 | CHAPTER 15: LATINE RHETORICAL THEORY

   (physical, psychological, and spiritual) for it is that shattering of one's self that constitutes passage into the
   borderlands. This linkage, then, though real, necessitates rhetorical reflection to (a) understand that one's soul
   has been harmed and (b) make sense of how one found themself in this nepantla space. Rhetorical knowledge
   and skill as an act of world-making and meaning-making is critical for the borderlands are an "in-between
   state characterized by chaos and disorientation where individuals experience dissociations, breakdowns, and
   buildups of their identities."57 Lacking rhetorical knowledge and skill, one may, like a poor soul in the presence
   of a terrible evil, become enchanted and mistake the silver-tongued words of dominant society for reality.
   Rhetorical knowledge and skill, thus, is a means of seeing through the illusion and reconstructing the scene of
   the crime against one's humanity.

   El Recuerdo

   The second step of nepantla is listening for el recuerdo, the memory. The listening for the memories that haunt
   this space is directed both inward and outward. Inward, in the sense of granting one's self the dignity to feel and
   remember what has happened to it, what has been lost, what has been moved, what, perhaps, has been gained.
   Outward, in the sense of listening for the voices and searching for the traces of those who exist (or once existed)
   in this space alongside you. Rhetorical knowledge and skill are assets for both forms of el recuerdo. Regarding
   the first, listening inward, experience and mastery of language, logical reasoning, metaphors, euphemisms, and
   other forms of symbolic creation, control, manipulation, and erasure can help one to remember the self that
   once existed. Regarding the second, listening outward, these same rhetorical skills can help one to recognize
   the other physical, psychological, and spiritual entities that walk alongside and against you in this space. The
   gathering of these memories from within and without are about gaining deeper insight into one's positionality
   within the nepantla space and remembering that the loneliness they may feel is an illusion, a rhetorical artifact,

La Imperativa Coyolxuhqui

used on the original engraving.

The third step of nepantla is that of enacting la imperativa Coyolxuhqui, the Coyolxuhqui imperative. La
imperativa Coyolxuhqui is the process of reassembling one's self. The reassemblage, however, is not idealistic
in the sense of reconstructing one's self in the image of one's prior self, as the effect of nepantla is that one
can never return quite the same as before. Likewise, it would be a mistake to conceive of this imperative as
     328 | CHAPTER 15: LATINE RHETORICAL THEORY

   one of growth, for though growth is a possibility, so too are other outcomes, such as diminishment, decay, or
   even stasis. La imperativa Coyolxuhqui is rather "an ongoing process of making and unmaking" without "any
   resolution, just the process of healing."58 The concept comes from Anzaldúa's interpretation of the fate that
   befell the Aztec moon goddess, Coyolxuhqui. According to the Aztecs, Coyolxuhqui was a beautiful deity
   who, as punishment for leading a revolt against her mother, the earth deity Ctlcue, was dismembered by
   her brother Hutzilpchtli, the Aztec sun god (and god of war). Anzaldúa retells this story as an example of
   how "the male-dominated Azteca-Mexica culture drove powerful female deities underground by giving them
   monstrous attributes and by substituting male deities in their place, thus splitting the female Self and the
   female deities."59 La imperativa Coyolxuhqui, then, is the collective act of reassemblage: of one's self and one's
   community. Rhetorical skill is valuable here, for this act of reconstruction means pushing back against the
   narrative weight of society and (re)telling a better story of you and your community.

      The point of this nepantla methodology--(1) el alma atrapado (the trapped soul); (2) el recuerdo (the
   memory); and (3) la imperativa Coyolxuhqui (the Coyolxuhqui imperative)--is to enable the rhetor to offer
   a more authentic, honest account of society, their individual and communal positionality within it, and to
   work towards the more ethical remaking of themselves and the world. It is an ambitious, endless task, for the
   world does not sit idle, awaiting the completion of your reassemblage. It is far more likely that one will never
   leave one's nepantla space. Though this may seem fatalistic, and, for many, the experience will be devastating,
   resulting in extreme poverty, health disparities, political disenfranchisement, and more, the concept of nepantla
   also offers hope. The hope that even if I do not survive, the memory and trace of my existence might be
   the strength needed for another to continue living, the strength needed for another to work towards the
   reassemblage of themselves and the construction of a better, more ethical future. That, even if I never achieve
   conocimiento (consciousness) of the totality of my condition, the glimpse or fragment that I captured may be
   the shard or piece needed for another's conocimiento.

      In this sense, the nepantla rhetorical methodology differs from conventional rhetorical methods in that it
   is a collective methodology whose success is contingent upon the collective efforts of those who have come
   before and those who will come after. Even in failure, failing to recognize the entrapment of one's soul (el
   alma atrapado), for example, the echo of one's existence may serve as the critical memory (el recuerdo) for la
   imperativa Coyolxuhqui. Rhetorical expertise is an asset, to be sure, but it is no guarantee of one's survival nor
   success, and it is not a precondition for one's participation. In this regard, the nepantla rhetorical methodology
   we have outlined above pays homage to the voices of those whose contributions to the rhetorical tradition as
   lay theorists and practitioners are all too often erased and forgotten. As an inclusive rhetorical methodology,

   though it emerges from the unique experiences of Latine communities as articulated by Gloria Anzaldúa, we
   believe it can be of value to anyone who finds themselves in (or needing to enter) a nepantla space, whether
   they are Latine or not.

  Gustavo Gutiérrez: Biography and Key Concepts

   Gustavo Gutiérrez was born in Lima, Perú on June 8, 1928. His experience with a severe case of the bone
   disease osteomyelitis--for which he was bedridden and confined to a wheelchair from the ages of twelve to
   eighteen--led him to pursue a degree in medicine from the University of Perú (Lima)60. After earning his
   medical degree in 1950, he elected to pursue his other, primary passion, theology, and become an ordained
   Catholic priest. His faith had sustained him throughout his struggles with osteomyelitis and so he left Perú to
   study philosophy and psychology at the Catholic University of Leuven (Belgium) and theology at the Catholic
   University of Lyon (France) and Gregorian University (Rome). He was ordained in 1959 and returned to his
   hometown, Lima, Perú, shortly thereafter.61 An influential theologian and philosopher, his landmark book,
   A Theology of Liberation: History, Politics, and Salvation (1971) is considered the foundational text of Latine
   liberation theology. This book, and his subsequent theological work, had a profound impact on Catholicism,
   Christian theology, and Latin American and U.S. politics. After Gutiérrez's passing on October 22, 2024,
   Pope Francis said, "Today, I think of Gustavo. Gustavo Gutiérrez. A great man. A man of the Church."62.
   His scholarship nonetheless has been and continues to be ignored by the field of Communication, except for

      Liberation Theology's emphasis on the fundamental humanity of the poor and political solidarity led Pope
   John Paul II and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (the future Pope Benedict XVI) to label him a radical and called for
   him to be investigated by the Catholic Church's governing body. Indeed, the Congregation for the Doctrine
   of Faith, which was led by Ratzinger, "issued two instructions on liberation theology, in 1984 and 1986, both
   critical of some of its aspects,"65 including "an allegedly Marxist view of history, a selective reading of the Bible
   to focus on material redemption, and a class-driven concept of theology."66 He was never disciplined, however,
   due to the intervention of "the legendary German Jesuit theologian Father Karl Rahner," who wrote a letter to
   the Church stating that "the Theology of liberation that [Gutiérrez] represents is entirely orthodox."67 Indeed,
   Gutiérrez's theology of liberation "would enter the mainstream of the Church" as, in 2007, Ratzinger himself
   (now Pope Benedict XVI) would say that "the preferential option for the poor is implicit in the Christological
   faith."68 That said, Pope Benedict XVI's "embrace" of liberation theology would be interpreted through his
   conservative valorization of poverty as enrichment--which is in stark contrast to Gutiérrez's understanding of
   poverty as death "early and unjust."69 The point, for Gutiérrez, is not to ask what the poor can teach us (as

   Pope Benedict XVI saw it) but rather to stand in "solidarity with the poor" in order to "fight the causes of
   poverty."70

      Latin American Liberation Theology, as espoused by Gutiérrez and others, likewise had a profound impact
   on the politics of Latin American nations and is critical for our understanding of U.S. history and foreign
   policy. In 1979, for instance, the Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional, a socialist political party in
   Nicaragua (also known as the Sandinistas) overthrew the Somoza dictatorship. The Catholic Church had long
   enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with the Somoza dictatorship. The Somoza dictatorship needed
   the Nicaraguan Catholic Church to legitimize their repressive government, which they did by teaching that
   "Christ was poor. He came to teach us to suffer."71 In return, the Somoza dictatorship granted the Church
   "gifts of money and land" and "almost total control of the education system."72 The advent of Latin American
   Liberation Theology, however, inspired "many Catholic students, religious workers, and priests [...] to opt for
   the poor themselves by going to live in the poor barrios of the cities or by going to work in the rural areas."73
   This experience led Nicaraguan liberation theologians to support the Sandinistas during the Nicaraguan
   revolution. The United States opposed the socialist policies of the Sandinistas and, in 1981, President Ronald
   Reagan ordered the CIA to support militant oppositional groups (known as the Contras) with overthrowing
   the new Sandinista government and, in 1986, The Military Construction Appropriations Act included $100
   million in aid for the Contras. 74 The Contras were well-known for their systematic violations "of the most
   basic standards of the laws of armed conflict, [...] launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians, selectively
   murdering non-combatants, and mistreating prisoners."75 When Congress resisted funding the Contras in
   1983, Reagan illegally ordered his staff to continue to fund the Contras through "third countries and private
   sources," resulting in what is known as the Iran-Contra Affair.76

      Understanding the influence Gutiérrez's work had on the course of global theology and history matters not
   only for our understanding of the past but also that of the present. As the Latine feminist and postcolonial
   scholar, Chela Sandoval has compellingly argued, Western societies are in fact lagging behind the oppositional
   consciousness that "has been most clearly articulated by the subordinated, marginalized, or colonized Western
   citizen-subjects who have been forced to experience the so-called aesthetics of `postmodern' globalization as
   a precondition for survival."77 That is, as it pertains to this chapter, Gutiérrez's theology of liberation speaks
   against the authoritative political systems that are presently in operation across the globe, because those systems
   were first developed and enacted against those in Latin America, Africa, and other territories considered a part
   of the Global South.

      Indeed, Gutiérrez formulated the precepts of his Theology of Liberation upon his return to Perú after
   having lived in Europe for nearly a decade. The contradictions between his theological education in Europe
   and the material conditions in Peru were stark. As he would write in his landmark text, A Theology of
   Liberation:

          For a long time, as a result of a Latin American cultural tradition imposed by colonization, theology as practiced
          among us simply echoed the theology developed in Europe. Latin American theologians had recourse to
          European theology without any reference to its intellectual and historical context, with the result that then their
          theology easily became a set of abstract propositions. Or else they made a painful effort to adapt European
          theology to a new reality [...].

             All this reminds us that [Liberation Theology] is explicable only when seen in close conjunction with the
          life and commitments of Christian communities. This connection was present at the historical beginnings of
          liberation theology in the 1960s and is still fully operative today.

             [....]
             In liberation theology [...] I was moved by the witness of those who were beginning to commit themselves
          ever more fully to the process of freeing the poor from the various servitudes from which they suffer.
             This commitment reflected the experience of the oppressed themselves, who were beginning to become the
          agents of their own destiny. During the 1950s and 60s we saw the first steps being taken in conscientization, and
          we saw the poor beginning to organize themselves in the defense of their right to life, in the struggle for dignity
          and social justice, and in a commitment to their own liberation.78

   thought and the lived experiences of his Peruvian friends, family members, and parishioners that Gutiérrez
   recognized the need for an alternative theological and philosophical tradition. Though not an exhaustive list,
   we discuss several key rhetorical precepts of Gutiérrez's theology of liberation in the next section.

  Gustavo Gutiérrez: Towards A Rhetorical Methodology of Radical Hope

   The rhetorical intervention offered by Gutiérrez is that of understanding how communication can operate
   as a means for producing radical hope. His rhetorical intervention must be understood as an onto-epistemic-
   ethical movement grounded in the material, intellectual, social, cultural, and spiritual transnational histories
   (past, present, and future) of the oppressed. Though it emerged in response to Western imperialism and
   intracontinental domination, Latine Liberation Theology is a utopian project rooted in the fundamental
   power, beauty, and dignity of the transnational subaltern. To better illustrate why this is so and how Gutiérrez's
   theological and philosophical concepts can be assembled into a powerful rhetorical methodology of radical
   hope, this section is dedicated to outlining four stages of liberation rhetoric methodology: (1) radical solidarity;
   (2) the critique of precritical consciousness; and (3) radical hope.

   Radical Solidarity

   The first step of liberation rhetoric methodology is radical solidarity. Radical solidarity means that our first
   commitment is towards that of the oppressed, "along with the protest against the conditions under which they
   suffer." 79 This solidarity necessitates working with and alongside the oppressed, not as saviors, but companions
   in the struggle against oppression of all kinds. Indeed, as was true in Gutiérrez's time, many of us are moved by
   his writings because so too many of us are oppressed. In saying this, we must be careful not to conflate our lived
   experiences with those of others who may suffer more or less, or differently than us, but rather to recognize
   that our struggle for liberation is impossible "without following the development of the most urgent problems
   and without attending to factors that enable us to locate these problems in a broad and complex international
   context."80 This requires engaging in a diverse range of conversations and listening to the collective experience
   of marginalized individuals. Lest this be coopted by those who would distort liberation theology to privilege
   the experiences of those who feel "marginalized" by the loss of previously held political power, Gutiérrez
   defines oppression as "the one marginated from society, the member of the proletariat struggling for the most

79. Gutiérrez, A Theology, p. xxv.

80. Gutiérrez, A Theology, p. xxiv.
     334 | CHAPTER 15: LATINE RHETORICAL THEORY

   basic rights; the exploited and plundered social class, the country struggling for its liberation." 81 Rhetorical
   knowledge and skill, thus, means recognizing one's shared humanity across similar and different experiences of
   oppression.

   The Critique of Precritical Consciousness

   The second step of liberation rhetoric methodology is that of working to critique precritical consciousness.
   Building upon the work of another influential Latin American philosopher, Paulo Friere, Gutiérrez argues that
   liberation requires that "the oppressed reject the oppressive consciousness which dwells in them, become aware
   of their situation, and find their own language."82 This step requires consideration of the political, economic,
   social, cultural, spiritual, and other factors that

     1. influence how oppressed people are taught to see themselves and their oppressors,
     2. condition how oppressors are taught to see themselves and the oppressed, and
     3. produce the material circumstances that led to the uneven development of society (e.g., the production

         of the oppressors and the oppressed).

   As with the first step (radical solidarity), so too does this step necessitate dialogue and engagement with a
   diverse range of marginalized individuals and scholarship. The point is not to valorize any and all opinion,
   as "naïve awareness" is the dominant operational consciousness in oppressive societies, but rather to work
   through conversation and social analysis to identify the real causes of oppression.83 This process was in effect
   during the Nicaraguan Revolution (discussed above) when conversations between liberation theologians and
   lay Nicaraguans led to a mutual critical awakening: the shift in theological perspective helped free the priests
   and the masses from theological compliance to the Somoza dictatorship. Lest this be perceived as a one-way
   influence, we must remember that the proximity of priests to the oppressed exposed contradictions within
   their own theological trainings, and so the critical awakening was mutual. Rhetorical skill at this stage, then,
   necessitates the analytical skill and sensitivity to recognize the elements that structure contemporary society.

   Radical Hope

   The third step of liberation rhetoric methodology is that of working towards radical hope. It is all too easy for

   conventional rhetorical analysis to operate in apocalyptic terms, as a diagnosis without a solution, which can
   lead to a sense of hopelessness and disengagement with the world. In contrast, Gutiérrez builds on the work of
   the German Marxist philosopher, Ernst Bloch, to situate hope as critical to human liberation: hope offers an
   "ontology of what `is not yet' [and] is dynamic, in contrast to the static ontology of being, which is incapable
   of planning history."84 This radical hope is predicated on the "negation of injustice, in the protest against
   trampled human rights, and in the struggle for peace and followship." Radical hope is a hope for the future
   grounded in the present, taking "shape in daily events with their joys to experience but also with their injustices
   to eliminate and their enslavements from which to be liberated."85 Radical hope, as Gutiérrez articulates it,
   "does not exist in a moment [rather] we must create it."86 This means standing in solidarity with the subaltern
   and oppressed "as friends to criticize and to help change their present circumstances."87 This means saying to
   ourselves and the oppressed, our "conditions could change, perhaps not tomorrow, but it is possible."88 This
   radical hope is a promise, an unapologetic commitment to the creation of utopia, today. This may seem an
   impossible task, but from the perspective of liberation theology, the alternative--keeping things as they are--is
   untenable. Keeping things as they are is to say: "we are content with the suffering of others because lessening
   their suffering is too hard." Rhetorical skill at this stage, then, necessitates the analytical skill to understand the
   difference between impossible and difficult, the skill to inspire hope that the work of creating a better society
   begins today.

      The point of this liberation rhetoric methodology--(1) radical solidarity; (2) the critique of precritical
   consciousness; and (3) radical hope--is to enable the rhetor to operate as a vehicle for the creation of a more
   just society. Like nepantla methodology before it, so too is liberation rhetoric an ambitious task as there is
   much suffering in the world. Though this may be depressing for some, the point is not to save the world
   (though that is its end goal) but rather to make the world a better place for someone or, if possible, many
   someones. If, as Gutiérrez believed, the face of the divine is visible in the face of the oppressed, we "betray
   and sin against the Spirit" if we fail to honor and uphold the fundamental humanity of the other.89 Liberation
   rhetoric's goal is to articulate the fundamental humanity of the oppressed, illustrate our shared solidarity,

   and offer a means of real hope for the future. Though Latine Liberation Theology emerged from the unique
   experience of theologians like Gustavo Gutiérrez, we believe it can be of value to anyone experiencing
   oppression and/or committed to the creation of a more just society, whether they are Latine or not.

   This chapter built upon the work of Michelle Hollings, Bernadette Calafell, Lisa Flores, and other influential
   Latine communication scholars to outline the historical development of Latine rhetorical studies. Echoing
   their work, we believe this history is important for understanding how the field of communication has
   obscured the existence of Latine rhetors and hindered the ability for those interested in Latine rhetoric to
   pursue the topic. Even today, though there is an abundance of Latine rhetorical scholars producing exceptional
   work, it is rare to encounter our work in classes on rhetoric. Lisa Flores offers the following reflection in an
   influential 2016 article in the Review of Communication:

          Writing as one of the few for so long, today, I feel joy--if not relief--every time I encounter a new essay or book
          that is part of the growing dialogue on race and rhetoric in the field. And yet, too often, this work flourishes in
          the spaces between, outside, and beyond the `canon,' tokenized in readers or syllabi in that familiar pattern of
          one is enough. I want more.90

   Latine scholars are not alone in this frustrating feeling of marginalization, as the ongoing association of rhetoric
   with the West, particularly the Greeks, has impacted the production and reception of Black rhetorics, Asian
   rhetorics, Indigenous rhetorics, and others as well. That this chapter exists here, as part of a rhetoric textbook, is
   exceptional in its rarity. We do not take our inclusion lightly and our hope is that this chapter inspires students
   and emerging scholars to explore the rich theoretical and empirical work being done by scholars operating in
   the field of Latine rhetorical studies.

This chapter is about "the settler [colonial] situation." The first section of the chapter introduces some of the
defining concepts related to settler colonialism, describes the role of rhetoric, and offers several examples of
how this "situation" continues to arise within popular narratives today. The second section is a lecture by Dr.
Michael Lechuga entitled "Incomunicable," which discusses the ways that the university itself is implicated in
an ongoing settler situation.

       remains US Federal property and that Indigenous peoples have been banned from traveling
       there since the 1965 "Operation Sailor Hat" bombing tests. The island was transferred to the
       jurisdiction of the state of Hawaii in 1994, and the Hawaii State Legislature established the
       Kahoolawe Island Reserve to restore and oversee the island and its surrounding waters. As of
       the time of the lecture's recording in Fall 2021, Kahoolawe can be used only for native
       Hawaiian cultural, spiritual, and subsistence purposes.

Part 1: Defining the Settler Situation

Last week we talked about the rhetorical situation. The rhetorical situation accounts for why what is said
is said, what this speech responded to, and its effects. If the rhetorical situation creates a specific historical
account of a single moment of speech, then the settler situation describes a specific set of characteristics (e.g.
motives, narratives, relationships). These characteristics, in turn, describe a general set of power relations that
have shaped communication across a range of contexts. According to Lorenzo Veracini, who coins the phrase
"settler-colonial situation":

      The settler colonial situation is characterised by a settler capacity to control the population economy as a marker
      of a substantive type of sovereignty ... [and] is associated with a particular state of mind and a specific narrative
344 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

      form. Under these circumstances, the possibility of ultimately discontinuing/decolonising settler colonial forms
      remains problematic. (Settler Colonialism: A Theoretical Overview, 12)

According to Veracini, the settler-colonial situation is primarily one that manages a "population economy."
This means that settler colonialism facilitates the mass displacement of people and mobilizes them in on behalf
of capital. After being displaced, governing this population's "economy" means to discover, extract, and hoard
the value stolen from Indigenous lands. After this process is complete and the land is rendered unusable, the
settler moves on to a new frontier for extraction and conquest.

       Poster for For All Mankind, a television show about a fictional resource war fought over the moon.
   Veracini also explains that the settler-colonial situation describes a long-term and widely-held way of
thinking. The settler-colonial mindset has ongoing concerns with existential threats and maintains a paranoid
fear of ultimate decolonization. Settler anxieties include worries about the degeneration of the settler social
body, apprehensions about the debilitating results of climate, remoteness, geopolitical position, racial
contamination, demographic imbalances, and concerns about the possibility that the land will ultimately turn
against the settler project.
   When we are thinking of the settler-colonial situation, we are also thinking about a moment that organizes
our rhetoric. If the rhetorical situation describes an arrangement of exigence, audience, and constraints, the
settler-colonial situation describes a different mode of arrangement, sometimes called an assemblage. Unlike
the rhetorical situation, the settler situation is not a concept that emerges from the traditional Greek canon
of thought. In fact, experts and scholars who study settler colonialism often critique Aristotle because of his
documented defenses of slavery, wartime violence, and class elitism. As described below, the assemblage of
settler colonialism "arranges" peoples, technologies, psychology, and networks of power. The sections below offer
an overview of each of these elements.
                                                                                           CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 345

Settler Colonialism Arranges Peoples.

These people include indigenous and exogenous peoples, or the original inhabitants of a place and the people
trafficked by settlers. It also includes migrants, immigrants, emigrants as different ways of describing the
movement of peoples. Migrant references the general fact of this movement,
while emigrant and immigrant are legal terms designating one's status relative to the land left behind or the
"new" lands toward which one travels. Settler colonialism also constitutes the identity of the settler, which
takes a variety of different forms. The settler may, for instance, take the form of the institutional figures of
authority that enact forced migration from indigenous lands, police protests, protects the property of the
settler from indigenous claims, and patrol the entry in and out of borders. In American popular culture,
the settler also takes the form of "heroic" figures such as the cowboy, the fighter pilot, and the time-traveling
father figure.

                                        Trailer for Wild Wild Country (2016)
   The above trailer from the documentary Wild Wild Country offers one illustration of how people are
arranged by settler colonialism. On the one hand, it shows how the Rajneesh community settled in Antelope,
Oregon, where they were received with hostility from Antelope residents. However, as the descendants of
European families that displaced these residents ignore their own status as "settlers" and that they occupy
lands stewarded by the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the
Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, and the
Nez Perce Tribe. They are astonished that the Rajneeshis - a group who, as "people of like persuasion," are
like them - would migrate to and settle the Antelope area. According to these residents, the Rajneeshis threaten
to "literally wipe out the culture" of the existing white inhabitants. The irony, of course, is that the settler
ancestors of these present-day residents perpetrated the very same `wiping out' that they now fear.

Settler Colonialism Arranges Technologies.

The settler situation also promotes the creation and distribution of specific kinds of technology, such as those
intended to make migrants and borderlands more visible for purposes of policing. These technologies include
databases, drones, cameras, weapons, vehicles, and structures. They involve the support of corporations,
government agencies, and political parties. Together, they create a site of significant financial and human
346 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

investment dedicated to maintaining boundaries predicated on an imagined threat posed by those foreign to
the nation. As Dr. Michael Lechuga explains:

      Those living along the border between México and the United States (US) might never see a physical, 2,000-mile
      long wall between the two nations. If there is a border wall, it will likely be a virtual wall. I say this for two
      reasons: frst, the US has invested tens of billions of dollars in the latest surveillance technologies over the last
      three decades, to create a network of sensing devices to track the movements of migrants across that border (Ofce
      of the Inspector General, 2005; US Customs and Border Protection, 2015a). These include seismic sensors
      buried in the desert, infrared cameras mounted on Hum-Vs and Predator Drones, and biometric face scanners at
      ports of entry. With most of that technology already in place, a physical wall that spans 2,000 miles seems both
      redundant and unrealistic.

Settler Colonialism Arranges Psychologies.

Settler psychologies are developed to justify and prolong colonial governance. One of these psychological
dispositions is called disavowal, which takes the form of the statement "I know very well [I am doing X] but
nonetheless [I will continue doing it because of Y]." As discussed in Chapter 6, disavowal is a way of cultivating
beliefs that give us an escape from the reality that we inhabit. For example, a person may join a company with
the intent not to compromise their values. However, when confronted with a situation where those values are
tested, they may tell themselves, "I'll just wait until I get a promotion or have greater stability, and then I'll act
according to what I know is right." That is disavowal: that person "knows very well [that they are not acting in
accordance with their values] but nonetheless [they are able to justify continuing to act in the same way].

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=198#oembed-2

                                    "Follow the Frog" as an example of disavowal
   A settler disavowal takes the form of a justification in which "I know that [my actions] perpetuate settler
colonial governance, but nonetheless [I will continue acting ways that perpetuate it]." In the "Follow the Frog"
video clip above, the brand leverages disavowal as their major sales pitch: their customers know very well that
[commerce is destroying the rainforest] but they nonetheless will [continue engaging in commerce because
colonialist efforts to help the rainforest are doomed to fail]. The ad presents no other option: either buy more
responsibly sourced products or engage in savior-ism to rescue the Earth's precious resources. Because the latter
is unreasonable, there is no choice but the former.
   Disavowal can also appear in subtler ways. Choosing to call nations or continents "under-developed" is
disavowal: it reveals that the user knows very well that there are deep, entrenched inequalities between different
                                                                                           CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 347

nations but nonetheless situates blame on those countries for a lack of development. A preferable term might
be "over-exploited," which puts the onus back upon "developed" nations for their role in producing economic
and inequalities.

Settler Colonialism Arranges Networks of Power.

One key function of the settle colonial assemblage is to use the conduits of capital, communication, and power
to create and re-create the conditions of its own existence, perpetuating itself into the future. To accomplish
this goal, the settler-colonial assemblage will elevate its own narratives about indigenous people to displace their
authentic or original culture and traditions.

The video above addresses the public dispute over the former University of Illinois mascot, the fictional
"Chief Illiniwek." As the speaker notes, even the indigenous drumbeat is inauthentic and perpetuates colonial
myths initiated by Hollywood producers. The settler situation arranges power by seizing control of a dominant
narrative and restricting representation to favorable settler types.

What's Rhetorical about Settler Colonialism?

Settler Colonialism is not rhetorical in at least one important way. In "Decolonization is not a metaphor," Eve
Tuck and K. Wayne Yang take issue with the way that words like "decolonize" are used in vague or abstract
ways. Decolonization is not the same as an institution's equity and inclusion initiatives; classrooms and syllabi
cannot be "decolonized" by admitting a more diverse student body or adding a certain number of Indigenous
authors. Decolonization, they argue, is about the repatriation of land. For that reason decolonization is not
a metaphor; it cannot be the vehicle for a tenor other than the restoration of land to its former Indigenous
inhabitants.

   The Settler Situation implicates communication in other ways. For instance, Settler Colonialism exercises
control over shared cultural meaning-making, elevating the colonist's preferred modes of communication
while erasing the traditions, language, and beliefs of the colonized. In The Semiotic Conquest of
America, Tzvetan Todorov writes that "the efficient conquest of information was always what brought about
the downfall of the Aztec Empire." The systematic elimination and replacement of Indigenous language by
Cortes and European colonizers was a way of destruction of the historical record, forcing it into secrecy. Cortes
348 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

was motivated "to control the information he received" both in order to eliminate the indigenous knowledge
he encountered and to take advantage of "how others [namely Indigenous peoples] were going to perceive
him." The destruction of the archive is evident because Cortes understood the myth of Quetzalcoatl's return
-- and then positioned himself as its architect. For example, "the idea of identifying Cortes with Quetzalcoatl
definitely existed in the year immediately after the conquest," but not before. Negative erasure is the removal of
myth, the removal of history from the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas; the destruction of this archive.

Narrative Allegories of Settler Colonialism

The Settler Situation is not just a way to account for the past dispossession of Indigenous lands. It is also
a very present element in popular cinema narratives. Science fiction in particular uses narrative elements
to recreate fictional scenarios that depict the conditions of settler colonialism. Often, aliens "invade" earth
(e.g. Independence Day, Battle Los Angeles) and exact a kind of colonial violence over humankind. Other times,
films depict "the border" or "frontier" as the site of apocalyptic danger (e.g. Terminator: Dark Fate, Logan).
The word "allegory" refers to the ways a given narrative may invoke a scenario beyond itself, playing out real-
world situations and power dynamics as a fictional re-imagining of our shared future.

                                        Opening scenes of Men in Black (1995)
   Allegory is, for instance, what allows the above narrative to play on the double-meaning of the word "alien."
In the above clip from Men in Black, border patrol agents pull over a van of migrants, presumably to detain
them. As soon as the passengers disembark, a pair of suited men whose jurisdiction exceeds the border agents
appear. Seizing control of the situation, one of the men begins to interview the passengers with short greetings
in Spanish. After encountering the one passenger who appears unable to understand the agent's greeting, they
release the other passengers and detain the "alien." During the interrogation, it is discovered that the odd
passenger is an extraterrestrial, and upon charging at the border agent, is promptly vaporized.
   The segment carries a number of settler-colonial themes. The agents, for instance, uphold a myth that all
the migrants would speak the same language by vetting the true alien based on whether they speak Spanish. In
fact, there are a number of Indigenous languages that migrants might speak, including Nahuatl, Maya, Otomí,
Mixteco, Zapoteco, Totonaco, Chol, and Mazateco. The agents also illustrate how the settler presumes that
"alien" life is inherently disposable, vaporizing the alien to protect the border patrol agent despite the patrol's
refusal to take instructions from a higher authority.

The Frontier and the "Settler Hero"

The US-Mexico border is frequently the mythic backdrop for imagining the outcomes of settler colonialism as
a technological dystopia. When the threat doesn't come from beyond a literal, physical border, it comes from
a temporal (or time-based) border beyond the horizon of present perceptions: an apocalyptic future.

   The western is an example of a popular literary and cinematic narrative that features a cowboy as its
protagonist. Dr. Michael Lechuga describes this character as a more general type that recurs across different
narratives (e.g. Star Wars, Westworld), and calls this frontier figure "the settler hero":

      Settlers do not see themselves as extenders of a particular (European or US) state sovereignty, they "see
      themselves as founders of political orders, they also interpret their collective efforts in terms of an inherent
      sovereign claim that travels with them and is ultimately, if not immediately, autonomous from the colonising
      metropole." Settler identity is characterized by "permanent movement and sovereign capacity." Settlers reject an
      imperial colonial persona for a uniquely mobile, individualized, and exploitative sovereignty that is produced in
      that denunciation of the colonial order. In rejecting the colonial metropole, thus, the settler seeks to acquire yet
      "unsettled lands" (terra nullius) on which to create a new political and economic formation.

                                     Theatrical trailer for Law and Order (1953)
   In the film Law and Order, the "settler hero" is a white and masculine figure who occupies a dangerous
territorial town and is self-authorized to use violence in order to bring residents and Indigenous peoples
into compliance with his authority. The trailer describes the American West as a "wild," "magnificent," and
"untamed" frontier that was also the site of gratuitous danger and violence. It presents "heroes" in the form
of "lawmen" who alone are allowed to use violence to quell violence. This iconography, in turn, informs how
a subset of American voters have repeatedly projected this role onto political figures such as Ronald Reagan,
who claimed to bring order or balance to the "wild west" of American politics.

Settler Colonialism and the Future

When the mythic "frontier" of settler colonial narrative is not a literal spatial border (e.g. the border between
civilized/uncivilized lands, between nations, or between the Earth and Space), it is a time-border, imagining
a dystopic future for the current settler situation. In this case, the settler's imagined "enemy" comes from the
future and must be extinguished to ensure a livable human future. Often, the agencies of this dystopia are
350 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

the technologies developed by the settler themselves, which have spiraled out of control and now threaten the
whole settler way of life that birthed it.

                                   Theatrical Trailer for The Tomorrow War (2021)
   The alien-invasion genre of science fiction often stages a settler-colonial situation in which an enemy
threatens to perpetuate colonial violence against humankind. The proposed solution of these films is that the
only solution to human genocide is similar to colonial violence. In the example of The Tomorrow War shown
above, the main character travels to the future where he meets his much older daughter, who is fighting
the "tomorrow" war against a band of monstrous aliens. Ultimately, to win the war and save his daughter's
life, the protagonist discovers that he must kill the alien "queen." The film thus guarantees his daughter's -
and humans' -- future by eliminating the "alien" other's ability to reproduce and inhabit the planet. This
is by no means the only solution presented by the film, which argues that the "future war" begins due to
anthropogenic climate change, which releases the aliens from a thawed Arctic glacier. In other words, The
Tomorrow War presents colonial violence as a reasonable alternative to dramatic climate action, which it
depicts as destined to fail.

Part 2: Incomunicable

A(n Audio) Lecture by Dr. Michael Lechuga from the University of New Mexico
   Below, you will find the written transcript of Dr. Lechuga's talk. I recommend listening to the audio and

following along with the written transcript.
   Thank you so much for joining us for this, and what I think is a very exciting speaker series and I'm

really humbled and excited to introduce you to Dr. Michael Lechuga. Dr. Michael Lechuga is an assistant
professor at the University of New Mexico. He researches Latinx communication studies, rhetoric, vibration,
and settler colonial studies, as well as affect studies, Latinx futurism, surveillance, and film studies. Dr. Lechuga
is also writing his second book, Alien Affects, which illuminates the complex relationships between Hollywood
alien invasion film industries and the industries tasked with securing the Mexico-U.S border. I also think
it's important to speak a little bit about the context of Dr. Lechuga's talk today, Incomunicable: How the
University Participates in Settler Colonialism, and how he came to this topic. So, from my understanding,
interested in imagining and creating this decolonial university, as well as inspired by Dr. Erick Torrico, speaking
                                                                                            CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 351

about the colonial encounter and how that is marked with the rendering of the `other', hence,
Incommunicado.

   The decolonial university in Incommunicado brought Dr. Lechuga into this research about this compulsory
indigenous erasure in the U.S. at large, which is, of course, a large part perpetuated by the coloniality of U.S.
higher education. So, I hope that was a good introduction of your talk, Dr. Lechuga. I'm really excited, and
I guess you can go ahead and get started with your talk, Incomunicable: How the University Participates in
Settler Colonialism.

   Well, thank you very much for that great introduction. Of course, thanks to the I-4C Collective, for
organizing this lecture series here at Arizona State, and for inviting me to participate. I want to thank all of my
friends, of course, at the Hugh Downs School of Communication, but especially Professor Amira de la Garza,
for thinking that my ideas would have an audience here. I'm also grateful to the group of graduate students
who I'll be getting the chance to meet with at the end of today's talk. I know that your time is valuable, so I
really do appreciate that.

   I resist making land acknowledgments, like the ones at my university, and Arizona State, and that other
universities have written, which are admittedly just a first step in recognizing Native sovereignty. Some, like
Howie Echo Hawk, a native comic and activist, have criticized the performance of land acknowledgment,
insisting that it serves really nothing more than an empty gesture. So, as a Mestizo, I insist on only
acknowledging Native lands, Indigenous peoples, Indigenous ways of knowing, and Indigenous practices
of world-making, but I also recognize my role in participating in indigenous erasure. For me, part of this
recognition will take the form of a donation, of the honorarium, for today's talk, to the Red Nation, a
group of activists with a chapter in Albuquerque who are `dedicated to the liberation of Native peoples from
capitalism and colonialism.' They offer ways for Latinx and Mestizx peoples to build coalition in liberating
Native peoples from the entanglements of white settler modernity on this continent, and especially in places
like Albuquerque, where those material inequities are most pertinent. Their mission is based in education and
media justice, so I think that it aligns a lot with the mission of what many of us in communication studies
already do. So maybe instead, consider this a land disacknowledgement. I disacknowledge the centrality of
settler colonial land use, settler colonial citizenship norms, a single settler worldview, the practices of settler
worldmaking, which, too often, become practices of settler world breaking. And all of these practices are found
in nearly every aspect of our daily lives here in the United States. In reality, this is the focus of my research,
in general: How to disavow the centrality of settler knowledge production. For today's talk, I will be speaking
specifically on how the university is implicated in this process. I'll start with a few examples.

   So, last month, one charter grade school in Ogden, Utah allowed parents to opt out of the Black History
Month curriculum. They claim that parents were allowed to exercise their civil rights by denying their children
a part of U.S. history that would contextualize the violent colonial presence of european descendants on this
continent. The Montessori school later backtracked. They said that in the future they would work with parents
on an individual basis, which really only means that they'll continue to allow folks to opt out of this practice,
but really not make it public. In addition to this, 5 states in the United States now, Iowa, Arkansas, Mississippi,
352 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

Missouri, and South Dakota have introduced legislation to defund public schools that teach the 1619 Project.
As many of you know, the 1619 Project is a curriculum developed in collaboration with Nikole Hannah-
Jones of the New York Times magazine. It centers the arrival of enslaved peoples from the continent of Africa
that were sold to settlers, ushering in a 400 year project of exploitation. When the previous President of the
United States tried to strip the Department of Education funding from schools who taught the curriculum, he
argued that this would "teach students to hate their own country". Now, for many folks in Arizona, this might
sound familiar. In 2010, Governor John Brewer signed SB 2281, a law that essentially banned ethnic studies in
Arizona Public Schools. The bill was a combination of then State Superintendent of Instruction Tom Horn's
attack on the Tucson school districts who developed a Mexican-American curriculum for the large number
of Mestizx and Latinx learners in the district. Horn argued, also successfully, that ethnic studies would train
non-white learners to "hate America". So, for me, the goal of all of these examples seems to be punishing school
districts who teach a history of decentralized white settler paradigm, and to silence the voices of those who
were colonized, with the goal of reproducing the same sets of relationships between white settler citizens and
those they subjugated in the name of colonization. The idea that somehow these curricula teach students to
hate America shows the primary preoccupation with U.S. education, in my opinion - That teaching students
to love the myth of what America is & rendering all others silent is what we would consider education. This is a
practice of rendering others `incommunicable', or incommunicable. This is a dark side of communication, and
really this dark side of communication is central to colonial power. I and others argue that making sense of this
dynamic really should be the responsibility of scholars in our field, communication studies, but in humanities
in general. We shouldn't assume that our ways of knowing the world are always productive.

   To sort of frame this idea of `incommunicado', or rendering folks and lands incommunicable, I turn
to Erick Torrico, whose conception of the five communications that pertain to coloniality are imagined
through a sort of taxonomy that I'll share with you. For Torrico, the first form of communication, or colonial
communication, would be what he described as `pre-colonial communication'. This is not very much studied
in our field. It would require, really, an investment into the study of native languages. I also think it would
require an epistemology of relationship with the natural world. Isabel Altamirano-Jiménez, a Zapotec scholar,
discusses that land was not empty when colonizers arrived, rather, it was pristine precisely because of the
symbiotic existence enjoyed by Indigenous groups with their environment. The knowledge produced as a
result of this relationship is widely ignored in the humanities. I would argue that this is a form of
communication networked through ecosystems that can tell us just as much about our human condition as,
perhaps, other approaches to communication.

   The second area Torrico describes is the communication of colonial encounter. This is where the Indigenous
natives as well as the land stewarded by the Indigenous are rendered `incommunicable'. This action of
rendering one incommunicable justifies the dehumanization of Indigenous others by colonizing groups, and
the exploitability and extraction of economies that are put into place by these colonizing groups. In the field
of rhetoric, José Ángel Maldonado writes that incomunicación has long been a tool for political isolation:
"Language, among other forms of communication, is at the center of who is, and who is not, sought to be
                                                                                           CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 353

worthy of humanity." And in reality, this is what remains a primary tool dispossession by settlers, and the
seller government, in the United States. This is our foreign policy, our immigration policy, our environmental
policy, and today I'm going to talk about how this has become the U.S. education policy and university systems
around the country.

   The third kind of communication, quickly, is communication that pertains to colonialism, or what Torrico
calls colonial communication: the modes by which a colonizing group distributes and maintains control over
the political, social, and economic hierarchies. Walter Mignolo refers to this as the rhetoric of modernity. In a
recent forum in communication and critical cultural studies, I also describe how this form of communication,
or what we call rhetoric, the form of communication that celebrates public address, that celebrates presidential
rhetoric and the rhetoric of the descendants of white settler colonizers, is, in reality, a celebration of this third
kind of communication that Torrico refers to as colonial communication.

   The fourth type of communication, and I think one that many of us in these circles are familiar with is
decolonial communication. It's communication that speaks to the resistance of coloniality. Still centralizing
colonialism in its power to shape new futures, but resisting that power. So Tuck and Yang remind us that
colonization is not a metaphor, and, thus, the decolonial communication should strive for a deprogramming.
Too often, though, especially for those who claim to do colonial work simply out of the happenstance of their
identity or out of the start of orientation of being interested in the kind of work are really just doing it as
a metaphor, and I think rather we should think about the coloniality as a practice of strategizing the end of
colonial power through the material recognition of Inidigenous sovereignty. For me, this means nothing short
of land back. I look to Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz's work, especially her book, Indigenous Peoples' History of the
United States, as an exemplary work of this type of decolonial research.

   Finally, there's a communication beyond the constraints of the colonial, or what Torrico calls `comunicación
humanitario', humanitarian communication. This kind of communication is a future-looking orientation,
and it can imagine the ends of colonialism into a bifurcated, multiple future for sovereign peoples. It's a world
where new modes of subjectivities and relationships with lands and waters and air is one that's symbiotic,
one that returns to what Altamirano-Jiménez referred to as this perfect symbiosis. This is not necessarily post-
colonial, because I think that carries within a certain set of assumptions and connotations, but it is, again,
``comunicación humanitario', or one that exists in a human world beyond colonialism.

   For me, then, the importance of this sort of taxonomy is one that, when we render things as
`incommunicable', I think that it's important to think about the metaphor of a hard drive. So, when we
delete something from a hard drive, we don't necessarily make it disappear from that. It's etched into the hard
drive. When you delete something from your computer's hard drive, you're actually deleting the pathway,
the language coding that connects the interface with the information. So, when something is rendered
`incomunicable', it's not necessarily disappeared, or it hasn't been removed from the face of the earth. Rather,
the pathway, the knowledge, the ways of knowing that part entailed in that are erased. And reconnecting might
be just a matter of finding those pathways again.

   And so, despite what appears to be a chronological list of five communications, I think it's also important
354 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

to consider that these are all layered and interwoven into one another. I mean, to see an example of this, look
no further than the university, a place where a few, or maybe even all five of these kinds of communication
are happening at the same time. So when one part of the university might be working on a project, the
preservation and revitalization of Native languages, while someone down the hall is teaching a course on real
estate speculation. Yet, somebody else is down the hall teaching another class on decolonial approaches to XYZ
in terms of paradigms. There are many types of communications for Torrico that happen simultaneously, but
I'm here to suggest that while these sort of happen in multiple ways, and talk with each other, the university
system in the United States really is primed to reproduce a specific type of settler communication, settler
colonial communication. This is really the brand of American universities today, and the characterization of
those universities to sort of disavow the history of Indigenous removal, and then to promote an epistemology
of U.S. settler colonialism, I think, is part of how we come to grapple with that history, and also where we
need to make these interventions. So, in other words, producing a single colonial worldview, and rendering
all others `incomunicable', is at the heart of what many of our public universities do today. And for me, this
ongoing project, which is sustained by numerous modes of production in the university, especially those that
pertain specifically to knowledge production, are in need of interrogation. Institutions of state learning that
are implicated in this process of rendering peoples and lands incomunicable are guilty, if they are built from the
wealth made off of stolen land, and if they are actively pursuing a single-universal worldview.

   So to make this case, I want to talk briefly about the legacy of land-grant universities in the United States,
and how the perception of higher education today is really shaped by this legacy. For those of you who attended
last week, we were privy to an amazing performance by an amazing group of scholars who sort of introduced
us to this idea of how disposition of Native peoples begot the land-grant university, and how many of the
institutions that we're connected to are, in some ways, networked to those original land grants. The Land-
Grant Act of 1862, for me, is an example of a federal policy enacted to benefit individual citizens, and U.S.
citizenship directly. It is often referred to as the Morrill Land-Grant Act, named for Justin Morill, a Vermont
senator who enacted the bill. It was originally proposed in 1857, and it took 5 years to pass, mostly out of
objection from Southern states, and from some others who thought the bill lacked other elements of training,
like engineering and military training. But the demand for agricultural colleges at the time was so high, that
Morrill persuaded others to enact. I think that ironically, though, the reason why food, or agriculture was
such an important mechanism at the time was because of the insufficient ability for settlers to use and create
a symbiotic relationship with the land. They were destroying land faster than they could produce the food to
feed the growing number of settlers, and the panic spurred Justin Morrill to write this bill. Also, 5 years later,
in the midst of the Civil War, actually, where we have no congressional members from Southern states, the
vote passed and became a congressional act. The bill basically took Native lands that were seized, or obtained
through treaty, and sold them, along with the mineral rights and extraction rights. In order to find agricultural
colleges and universities in each of the, what at the time was 34 states, but now is in all 50 states. Each state
was granted 30,000 acres of land by the United States government, and, along with agricultural education,
the bill did implement engineering and military training as part of the core curriculum, added to the classics
                                                                                           CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 355

curriculum that was taught at private universities at the time. So, while most states in the West seized and sold
lands within the state borders, for example, like New Mexico and Arizona's land-grants were built on lands sold
and seized from within New Mexico and Arizona respectively, other universities like Cornell, MIT, and Penn
State used the sale of unceded lands in places like Wisconsin, California, and the Dakotas, to profit students
back East. So, in many cases, land-grant universities still own the script, which is the rights to the mineral and
the land. And these scripts can be sold for somewhere upwards of 10 to 20 times the original amount. The
plated amount is sort of an investment that is still continuing to pay off dividends for universities, and again,
these dividends are off the backs of stolen land. Signed the same year that the Homestead Act was signed, again
both of these represent the direct transfer of Indigenous lands and value extracted from those lands to the
hands of private citizens. If you add to that, the training that's offered by these universities, then, not only are
citizens being - are profiting off of the land, but then are being trained to further develop that land in a way
that benefits settler colonialism.

   I'm going to post a link here, in the chat, and if you get a chance, I really encourage you all to check out
LandGrabU.org. The authors -- Lee and Ahtone -- in that project describes in detail how through cession of
land, the term used to describe the forced forfeiture of land, usually through a manifestation of violence, led to
the investment in what we now call land-grant universities. According to the researchers, there's vast evidence
suggesting that the act was actually intended to fortify U.S.'s capacity to dispossess Native peoples from lands,
which affected almost 215 Indigenous tribes. The effort transferred the value of more than 10.5 million acres
of land, and, into revenue, the United States would eventually use to build universities with the mission of
educating farmers, engineers, and soldiers. The website, which again I shared the link with you all, it details not
only these large transfers, but it goes into the sale of each parcel of land that was dispossessed and how they
have directly impacted each states' land grant. The sheer volume of land, and the amount of money that was
made from that transfer is just astonishing. But when seen at the individualized, localized level, you get a sense
of how many dispossessions had to take place in order for, what we consider our modern university system,
to even be operating. Some of the most notable examples of land-grants include the University of Arizona,
New Mexico State, the University of Minnesota, the University of California, Texas A&M, dozens of others
that are Research I universities, some of which maybe some of us work at. And so for some state systems
like Minnesota and Michigan, that land-grant is really central to the state's agricultural and scientific military
medical training, but for most states, like New Mexico, this mission has been networked through the state
systems. So, nearly all states whose public education system is networked in this way, has distributed the land-
grant mission to all of its public universities, right? This mission, this quest for universal vision for knowledge
production, again, contributes to the dispossession of lands of Native peoples, renders both Native peoples
and lands incomunicable.

   I think that we can see this and the way that it operates in our colleges, in our universities. For today's
agricultural college, the goal has been to teach the methods of turning land into profitable food sources,
a process that renders lands, again, `incomunicable', destroying what Altamirano-Jimenez describes as that
symbiotic harmony. Engineering schools, their goal is to build the machinery of future colonization, whether
356 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

that be tools of war, tools of exploration, tools to terraform lands once stewarded by Native peoples into
permanent settler encampments, right? The goals of engineers are not to meet the lands of the environment,
the goals are to meet the demands of the settler imaginary that continues to grapple with a crumbling
environment, begot by settler imaginary, and as a settler imaginary builds more technologies, we see those
technologies really just turn into more coloniality. Medical schools were built to extend the lives of settler
classes, to ensure the production and reproduction of settler populations. Law schools reproduce settler
sovereignty by teaching generations of lawyers to maintain jurisdiction over Native lands and people. Business
schools teach us how to protect and multiply white settler wealth, I mean even in the social sciences we
oftentimes reproduce settler classifications of race and gender and ability, thinking that we're doing critical
or decolonial work. When scholars use these elements as variables, really they end up just recreating the same
distinctive differentiates that motivate white settler colonial population productions in the first place. I even
look at museums, and other archives that we hold at universities, where the practice of rendering something
archivable is really, sort of like a cultural taxonomy. It's about rendering something dead, or unalive, and then
categorizing it within our own single vision of what history is. These practices of our modern university really
all participate, for me, in this spirit of a land-grant, which has been modelled in higher education through the
state university system. The model is driven really by a single ideological motive: reproducing settler colonial
logics, the economic machinery, social values, and legal framework for the advancement of the settler project.

   But I don't think this has to be the case; and in fact, the spirit of the I4C Collective has been to push
us, to think about what this university might look like, or other universities might look like if we were to
really invest our creative capital and our collective intelligence into bringing about this change. For me, this
change looks like the pluraversity, not the university. Boaventura de Sousa Santos, a Brazilian author, who
writes in his book, The End of the Cognitive Empire, that while Foucault describes the difference between
knowledge and ways of knowing in his project in archaeology, the critique of knowledge by Foucault and
others, and the attention paid to that critique has really left little room for the celebration of ways of knowing
the world; multiple ways of knowing the world. For de Sousa Santos, this dynamic is embedded in the erasure
of what he calls, "epistemologies of the South". The innumerable ways of knowing the world which fall outside
of the singular colonial epistemology of the North: "The epistemologies of the South affirm and valorize
the differences that remain after the hierarchies have been eliminated. Rather than abstract universality, they
promote pluraversality, a kind of thinking that promotes decolonization, Creolization, or Mestizaje through
the intercultural translation." So, rather than reproducing a single ideology of colonial knowledge production,
why not make a university into a space where learners can engage with a wealth of possibilities, that multiple
ways of knowing the world might offer. This is not just thinking about interdisciplinarity, though. Because,
for me, interdisciplinarity ties multiple strands of the same colonial network together to reproduce that same
network. We should really be thinking about the possibilities of opening up the university to new ways of
knowing the world, and not just rendering the world knowable. This is an important distinction, I think,
between the university and the pluraversity. And this word bills primarily on scholars like Arturo Escobar, and
others like Walter Mignolo and Katherine Walsh, to develop a notion of pluraversity that not only embraces
                                                                                           CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 357

multiple ways of knowing the world, or Southern epistemologies, but also celebrates the multiplicity of
cultural orientations to the natural world. In my opinion, the notion of the pluraversity is not simply about
transforming the university, which means transforming the land and the capital and the people, into a site
where multiple worlds can be sustained. What if we were able to use the capacity, use this energy of mobilizing
change, to really tackle one of the biggest crises facing humanity today. So, that said, I'll sort of end my talk by
advocating for one specific way that beneficiaries of the university, you and I, can leverage our power to change
the coloniality embedded within the university.

   First and foremost, I think that the university must become a site of reconnection to the natural world.
In our time of global crisis, when Western thought has severed our connection to the environment, it's really
time to transfer the university into a place where reconnecting to the natural world is embedded into every
aspect of the institution. Just to be clear, studying the natural world is not the same thing as rebuilding the
connections. We have been studying the natural environment for decades, and despite that, very little has
been done to push people back into connection with the environment. In fact, I think that things have really
only gotten worse. For me, the pluraversity must support efforts to connect people with lands at all levels,
including an investment in Indigenous ways of relating to the natural world. From agriculture to astrophysics,
the pluraversity should be a site where multiple ways of knowing the world, and really knowing the cosmos,
are rejuvenated and taught, not just from a single Western orientation of science, but from multiple ways of
understanding and knowing nature and the cosmos. Business schools should not be teaching students how to
invest in stock futures, but rather should be teaching about the economic value of symbiosis with nature. We
should be investing in natural and environmental futures, and we shouldn't necessarily be thinking about the
value that's implicit in minerals and extraction, but we should really be thinking about the value implicit in the
human capacity to build networks in nature. I feel that every aspect of the university will ultimately transform,
and, for me, rendering the natural world comunicable, communicable, is its new mission. Mignolo and Walsh
describe this as relationality: "Relationality doesn't simply include other practices or concepts into our own.
Relationality is what some of Andean Indigenous scholars, including Nina Pacari, Fernando

   Huanacuni Mamani, and Felix Patzi Paco, refer to as vincularidad. Vincularidad, or relationality, is the
awareness of the integral relation of an interdependence on all living organisms, of which humans are only
a small part, with both territory and the cosmos." Vincularidad, for me,refers to both the sovereignty and
the interconnectedness of multiple systems that all contribute to what we know as the natural world. This
concept recalls Altamirano-Jiménez's work, where she describes the need to "center the ontological relationship
between the human and non-human worlds, but also engage actions that uphold and maintain Indigenous
relationality." Right, so it's not, for her, just about recognizing that connection, but about foregrounding
that connection. Vincularidad demonstrates a commitment to a recovery, it demonstrates a commitment
to a rejuvenation of knowledges that have been erased. But not erased off of the earth, simply rendered
`incomunicable'. We have the capacity through this type of research to render, then again, that natural world
communicable. I think that this is really the spirit of what Erick Torrico described as `comunicación
humanitario', and in reality, for me this is what the humanities in general should be striving for.
358 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

   I just want to briefly mention that as part of my research on vincularidad and relationality, I've been working
with a group of scholars here at UNM to develop a pilot study on multi-user virtual environments. As part of
this study, we are going to be testing Altamirano-Jiménez's hypothesis. We anticipate that folks who participate
in this environmental simulation who are willing to embody the natural environment, will start to develop
relationships with other users within the simulation. We anticipate that the strategies that folks develop in
the virtual simulation can be carried over to folks who are living in the real world, and our hope is that these
epistemoligies, especially Indigenous feminist epistemologies become foregrounded as ways for us to think
about restructuring our research focuses, not only in the humanities, but across the university.

   So, I'll end by saying that commitment to a new vision of vincularidad, or relationality of higher education,
can foreclose the practices of rendering peoples and lands `incomunicable', which have been present in U.S.
public university systems for roughly 150 years. In conceptualizing the pluraversity in the United States this
way, my hope is to shift away from the land-grant model of the university towards a conception of a land-back
university, right? So on one level, this means organizing behind a mission of promoting Indigenous sovereignty,
as la paperson or Wang Yang writes about in A Third University is Possible - I completely agree with this.
But on another level, I strongly urge us to think about how reassembling the energies and the resources of
our institutions, can really tackle the most imminent crisis facing humans today, and that's global climate
catastrophe. Let's imagine together for a second that we can live in a future where students in our institutions
learn to connect again with a world that has been rendered mute by the settler colonial project in the United
States, rather than simply participating in that process of rendering it `incomunicable.' So, I invite all of you
into dialogue about these ideas through a question and answer session, but before I just wanted to say thank
you all so much for attending, thank you to the organizers of this event for having me and allowing me to share
my ideas. It's really been an honor, thank you.

Part 3: Post-, De-, Anti-, and Settler-Colonialism

In his article, "(Re)Bordering the Civic Imaginary: Rhetoric, Hybridity, and Citizenship in La Gran Marcha,"
Josue David Cisneros describes reactions to "anti-immigrant, anti-Latino discourse" to illustrate "how
protestors enacted US citizenship, simultaneously drawing undocumented immigrants into the US national
community and challenging the very process of bordering endemic to citizenship." ("La Gran Marcha," p.28)
Protestors, in other words, used a rhetoric that performed citizenship and questioned the governing way of
separating citizens from non-citizens. For that reason, rhetoric offered a way to resist colonialism. As used by
the protestors, it established the fact that the protestors belonged as citizens while resisting the definitions of
belonging that purposely excluded undocumented immigrants from citizenship.

   There are several terms that describe different kinds of rhetorical resistance toward colonialism. These
include post-colonialism, anti-colonialism, de-colonialism, and settler-colonialism. Althoug there is
substantial overlap between these terms, each designates a unique orientation to "the colony" and the larger
                                                                                           CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 359

system we call "colonialism." As Lorenzo Veracini explains in the quotation below, there are two different
connotations for the term "colony." A colony is both (1) a political unit of organization that is ruled by a
group originating from outside of the colonized territory (i.e. exogenous) and (2) the self-reproduction of the
exogenous group within a colonized territory. Different terms foreground different aspects of "the colony." For
example, the term settler-colonialism captures both of these connotations.

      "Colony" as a term can have two main different connotations. A colony is both a political body that is dominated
      by an exogenous agency, and an exogenous entity that reproduces itself in a given environment (in both cases,
      even if they refer to very different situations, "colony" implies the localised ascendency of an external element --
      this is what brings the two meanings together). Settler colonialism as a concept encompasses this fundamental
      ambiguity. As its compounded designation suggests, it is inherently characterised by both traits. Since both the
      permanent movement and reproduction of communities and the dominance of an exogenous agency over an
      indigenous one are necessarily involved, settler-colonial phenomena are intimately related to both colonialism
      and migration. And yet, not all migrations are settler migrations and not all colonialisms are settler-colonial: ...
      settler colonialism should be seen as structurally distinct from both."

      Veracini, "The Settler Colonial Situation"

Why is it that "not all migrations are settler migrations and not all colonialisms are settler colonial"? On the
one hand, migration something distinct from the act of settlement. Whereas migration describes the natural
phenomenon of movement across territory and geography, settlement implies an act of possession and
dispossession in which territory and geography are improperly claimed as one's own. Moreover, if migration
describes a shift in location, settlement describes the additional gesture of displacing and dehumanizing
the inhabitants of a settled territory. Displacement and dehumanization are ways of justifying the settler's
presence, and seek to craft the settler's identity as native to settled lands while removing the land rights of
original, indigenous inhabitants.

On the other hand, "not all colonialisms are settler-colonial" because the act of settlement adds unique features
to colonization, such as the settler-hero and a settler-mythology. Colonialism also takes a number of forms, as
does the resistance to it. The sections below (on post-colonialism, de-colonialism, anti-colonialism, and settler-
colonialism) describe different ways of thinking about colonialism and the resistance to it. In the United States
especially, it has been convention to think of colonialism as a historical era or something which occurred in the
distant past (e.g., "the colonists at Plymouth Rock," "colonial Williamsburg"). However, many if not most of
the descriptions below imagine colonialism as an ongoing project that has changed forms over time.

Post-Colonialism

Post-colonialism often describes colonialism as a specific historical occurrence tied to the imperialist expansion
of Western European nations and the United States. Colonialism, by this understanding, would encompass
(for instance, ) Spanish and British settlements in the Americas, the Atlantic slave trade commonly known
as the Middle Passage, and European colonization of the Caribbean, the West Indies, Africa, and India.
The prefix "post-" sometimes suggests that colonialism is primarily a historical phenomenon that occurred
in the past. For that reason, activists, historians, and critics who identify with the "post-colonial" label are
occasionally burdened by the assumption that they write from a point in time after colonization, as if it has
already transpired and seek to take stock of its aftermath(s).
                                                                                            CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 361

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=198#oembed-7

This is not, however, the only way that post-colonialism can be or has been defined. The "post-" prefix may also
signal a "beyond" to colonialism. This acknowledges that the way colonialism manifests in our present-day goes
"beyond" the forms it once took. Post-colonialism is necessary, in other words, because to describe the historical
forms of colonialism is not sufficient to account for its evolution and influence. Rhetorical and post-colonial
scholar Raka Shome defines post-colonialism in the following way in the essay "Postcolonial Interventions in
the Rhetorical Canon: An `Other' View":

      Postcolonialism is the "critical perspective that primarily seeks to expose the Eurocentrism and imperialism of
      Western discourses (both academic and public). . . ." (Raka Shome, "Postcolonial Interventions" p. 41)

In other words, if we now live at a point in time "after" or "beyond" colonialism, then post-colonialism seeks
to capture the residue of colonialism that remains stuck to academic and public discourses. To read as a post-
colonial critic means to pay attention to the way that so-called neutral or objective ways of describing
contemporary life, politics, knowledge, industry, etc. are still steeped in a Eurocentric perspective and/or
imperialist values. For instance, when classes in politics and philosophy only teach thinkers like Plato, Aristotle,
Locke, Rousseau, Bentham, and Hobbes, this betrays a Eurocentric bias insofar as it centers European
philosophies that gained currency because of the colonial powers that elevated them. Alternatively, if we pay
attention to the way that military culture is celebrated in popular culture - or how expensive and deadly
military campaigns are justified in the name of America's exceptional democracy - this points to a
imperialist bias in which the continued strength of the American empire is supported through common, even
ignorable, rhetorical forms.

   One frequent (but incomplete) characterization of post-colonialism is that it is primarily an scholarly or
academic way of understanding the consequences of colonialism. This is especially true of the way that post-
colonial critique has been adopted and applied within literary studies, which maintains that the colonial
destruction of culture is morally wrong, and that contemporary institutions' default preference for a Western
canon of literature and philosophy contributes to this destruction. Often, this understanding of post-
colonialism relies upon de-mystifying or de-bunking celebratory narratives of colonization. Such narratives
are primarily designed to assure settlers and their descendants that colonization is justified while diverting
attention to the generational traumas caused by this system.

   Two prominent and important post-colonial critics who fit this description include Edward Said and Gayatri
Spivak. Edward Said famously theorized Orientalism, which refers to a fantasy of otherness projected by white
and western cultures onto peoples and cultures considered "primitive" or "foreign," and which often have little
362 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

to no correspondence with reality. It refers to a patronizing attitude that essentializes societies as static and
underdeveloped, enabling "Eastern" cultures to appear simultaneously exotic and threatening. By representing
an "other" as feminine, weak, and vulnerable, Orientalism is a fictional lever that allows the Western "self" to
imagine itself as masculine, rational, and strong. Gayatri Spivak is a critic of the deconstructionist tradition
who most famously theorized the subaltern, or everything that (and everyone who) has limited or no access
to the means of speech and/or representation, which are controlled by a system of cultural imperialism.
Similar to the concept of the proletariat, the subaltern refers to a category of personhood that exists within a
subordinated position within a cultural hierarchy, and whose speech cannot be heard because there are no
channels to access it. These theorists enable us to ask questions like:

  · Are there any popular forms of speech and representation that are not influenced by the history of
      colonization?

  · Are most allegedly "objective" renderings of non-western cultures in the United States actually
      westernized fantasies about non-western cultures?

  · For whom do we speak when we speak out against the lasting influence of colonization?
  · How do we know that speaking "on behalf of" is not a form of colonial violence?

Decolonization and De-Coloniality

Decolonization refers to the program of undoing the historical harms wrought by colonialism, past and present.
According to Walter Mignolo, there are two movements to decolonization: one of "unveiling" the damage done
by colonial governance another "simultaneously affirming the modes and principles of knowledge that have
been denied" (Mignolo, "DELINKING: The rhetoric of modernity, the logic of coloniality, and the grammar
of de-coloniality," p.457). De-coloniality is also interested in the future, insofar as it "means working toward a
vision of human life that is not dependent upon or structured by the forced imposition of one ideal society over
those that differ" (Mignolo, p.459). It is also different from post-colonial critique because it seeks to go beyond
diagnosing the lingering traces of colonialism in contemporary speech, representation, and policy by engaging
in specific, goal-directed actions. If post-colonialism is about diagnosing, de-bunking, and de-mystifying the
assumption that colonization is just a thing of the past, then de-colonization asks what it is that can and must
be done now in order to reverse continuing actions that perpetuate the colonial project, today.

      "the programmatic of de-coloniality moves away and beyond the post-colonial. ... The de-colonial shift, in other
      words, is a project of de-linking while post-colonial criticism and theory is a project of scholarly transformation
      within the academy." (Walter Mignolo, "DELINKING" p. 452)

One important way to understand decolonization`s orientation toward doing is by ensuring that the act of
decolonizing refers to something specific, and not an abstraction. According to Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang,
"decolonization is not a metaphor" because this term cannot be loosely applied. Instead, it must refer to
                                                                                           CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 363

the repatriation of lands stolen from Indigenous peoples. For that reason, a syllabus or a classroom cannot
be "decolonized" by adding readings written by Indigenous authors, much in the same way that a land
acknowledgment does not "decolonize" but merely acknowledges the fact of colonization, that it has
occurred. Decolonization requires an action, one that ensures that the lands that have been seized from peoples
are restored to them. As Tuck and Yang write:

      "Decolonization specifically requires the repatriation of Indigenous land and life. Decolonization is not a
      metonym for social justice." (Tuck and Yang, "Decolonization is not a Metaphor," p.21)

In other words, decolonization cannot be a metaphor, nor can it be a metonym. It cannot be substituted to
describe something other than the repatriation of lands; it is not a shorthand for social justice or institutional
equity and inclusion practices. Most of all, decolonization is not just rhetoric in the sense of empty speech or
flowery language. The point is that it must be literal.

   However, this formula also teaches us something important about rhetoric because colonization can and
does happen when people seize control of de-colonizal terminology in ways that dilute its meaning or claim
it on behalf of the descendants of settlers who merely wish to assure themselves that they are doing the right
thing. In other words, when people use the term decolonization inappropriately - that is, without having a
concrete action attached that "takes into consideration Indigenous people(s) and the return of their land" (p.7)
that rhetorical use language is an act of colonization: it takes a term of art designed to support the territorial and
life-giving struggle of Indigneous people and co-opts it on behalf of colonization's historical benefactors.

Anti-Colonialism

Like decolonization, anti-colonialism is a position that seeks the available means of dismantling colonial systems
and patterns of action. Tuck and Yang describe it as both a way of celebrating empowered, once-colonized
subjects who seize denied once-denied privileges from the city, the state, and the nation. It is also a practice of
"following stolen resources," keeping track of where and how they change hands among members of a settler
class. One useful way of understanding anti-colonialism is by setting it alongside post-colonialism. As Robert
J.C. Young argues,

      "Whereas post-colonialism has become associated with diaspora, transnational migration and
      internationalism, anti-colonialism is often identified exclusively, too exclusively, with a provincial nationalism."
      (Young, "Colonialism and the Politics of Postcolonial Critique")

In other words, if post-colonialism is a term associated with bringing to light the consequences of removing,
dispersing, and re-settling peoples away from their homelands, then anti-colonialism is sometimes associated
with the movements of colonized and formerly-colonized peoples to reclaim their homelands, which can
take shape as a kind of national allegiance. For instance, rather than colonized French Algeria, anti-
colonization might argue for a more Algerian Algeria, one that restores a homeland to the peoples dispossessed
364 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

of it. Young also calls anti-colonialism "a de-centered network" that exceeds national boundaries and unifies a
large number of peoples in a common struggle against military occupation and western imperialism:

      [Anti-colonialism is] a complex constellation of situated local knowledges combined with radical, universal
      political principles, constructed and facilitated through international networks of party cells and organizations,
      and widespread political contacts between different revolutionary organizations that generated common
      practical information and material support as well as spreading radical political and intellectual ideas. (Young,
      "Colonialism and the Politics of Postcolonial Critique")

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd5Pz8KJeU4
Among the most famous cinematic depictions of this colonizer/colonized dynamic is the film The Battle of
Algiers, which tells the story of colonial France's military incursion into Algeria and the resistance to it.

One example of an anti-colonial theorist is Frantz Fanon, who was an author, movement leader, and a
practicing psychiatrist. Fanon devoted his life to treated peoples who were subjected colonization and the
psychological effects of racism. In Black Skin, White Masks, Fanon argued that the dominant colonial culture
identifies melanated skin with impurity, and spreads this false myth by scrupulously avoiding contact with
people of different races. For instance, Fanon's concept of "epidermalization" maintained that "Black children
raised within the racist cultural assumptions of the colonial system can partially resolve the tension between
contempt for blackness and their own dark skins by coming to think of themselves, in some sense as white."
(Fanon, "Foreword," p.ix) For that reason, colonization had material, physical, and psychological effects. The
last of these took shape as existential dread and different kinds of neurosis. As a practitioner of psychiatry,
Fanon's program of activist engagement took the form of treating people who were subjected to these effects of
colonialism, finding lived and practical ways of resisting the forces imposed upon them on a routine, everyday
basis.

Settler-Colonialism

The final form of colonialism reviewed here is settler-colonialism. Settler-colonialism is unique for the way that
the settler plays a central role, writing themselves as a protagonist in the story of colonization. According to
Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang, "settler-colonialism is different from other forms of colonialism in that settlers
come with the intention of making a new home on the land, a home-making that insists on settler sovereignty
over all the things in their new domain" (Tuck and Yang, "Decolonization is not a Metaphor," p. 5). It is not
a moment in history in the sense of something long past or even that is happening right now. Instead, it is a
repeatable pattern that repeatedly organizes narratives, psychology, and a land-economy.

   The focus of settler-colonialism upon narratives and psychology makes it similar to anti-colonialism in the
sense that it engages both the psychological violence exacted by settler-colonists and the means of undoing or
undermining it. Lorenzo Veracini argues that a key aspect of the settler-colonial situation is the way that it
installs negative affects (i.e., bad feelings) in both colonizers and those people who they colonize. However, the
                                                                                           CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 365

settler's experience of these feelings is both a way of maintaining their own fictional innocence and establishing
their own victimage. This is because a feature of the settler's psychology is that they imagine themselves as
always at risk of being subjected to colonial violence:

      Indeed, ongoing concerns with existential threats and a paranoid fear of ultimate decolonisation can be seen as a
      consistent feature of the settler colonial situation. Besides Indigenous revenge, other neurosis-generating settler
      anxieties include paranoid fears about degenerative manifestations in the settler social body, apprehensions
      about the debilitating results of climate, remoteness, geopolitical position, racial contamination, demographic
      balances and concerns about the possibility that the land will ultimately turn against the settler project.

      In the settler colonial situation, therefore, disavowal is also directed at denying the very existence and persistence
      of Indigenous presences and claims. Sources frequently refer to Indigenous people as `shadows', figures lurking
      in thickets, and the recurring construction of various mythologies portraying dying races should be refered to
      a specific settler need to finally disavow Indigenous presences. (Lorenzo Veracini, "Settler Collective, Founding
      Violence and Disavowal: The Settler Colonial Situation," p.368)

In other words, settler colonialism embraces and weaponizes the psychology of disavowal (or the "I know very
well but nonetheless"). The settler and their descendants often "know very well" that they are historically
the perpetrators of colonial violence. "Nonetheless" their anxieties about the decline of contemporary culture
and its causes deflect this historical anxiety and the need to make right by endlessly posing the threat that
the current form of settler culture will be overturned or destroyed - often by the very people that settler
colonialism has displaced and dispossessed.

   A key difference between settler colonialism and post-colonialism, decolonization, and anti-colonization is
that it takes the form of a structure. How is this different from the other understandings introduced above?

  · Post-colonialism often understands colonization as a historical phenomenon that has changed over time,
      with lingering and distant effects on the present-day.

  · Decolonization refers to practices that carry the specific goal of repatriating lands to those peoples who
      have been historically dispossessed of them.

  · Anti-colonialism refers to movements that seek to dismantle colonialism through strategic maneuvers
      and assertions of sovereignty on the part of peoples historically subjected to colonial governance.

  · Settler colonialism is a structure in the sense that it is a whole framework of representation that seeks to
      re-shape and replace understandings of land and indigeneity through a character or persona called "the
      settler."

As Patrick Wolfe argues, settler colonialism is "a structure and not an event": it has consistent and repeatable
formal features that recur across different time periods, each time taking on different characteristics,
characters, narratives, and representations. As discussed above with the concept of the settler hero, the
American settler-colonist in the 18th century who lands at Plymouth Rock is very different from the cowboy
366 | CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S)

who settled American West. However, both concoct false stories about Indigenous peoples as submissive and
subservient and at the same time, violent and dangerous.

One example of the false myth about Indigenous peoples that still circulates in the United States today is
about Squanto (born Tisquantum) of the Patuxet, who "freely" helped English colonists to survive winters.
However, the common telling of that story also erases the fact that before lending assistance to English
colonists, The British enslaved Tisquantum, who was forced to travel to Spain and Britain, and eventually
returned to their colonies. In the three years that he was gone, diseases brought to the Americas by
colonists were estimated to have killed over 90% of the Tisquantum's tribal community. After his return,
Tisquantum had little choice in serving as a go-between between Massasoit, who led the Wampanoag
Confederation, and the British colonists.

Ultimately, settler colonialism is unique from the other categories of colonialism presented here, in other words,
because of the way that it theorizes a specific and systematic transformation of Indigenous culture. This
transformation consists in labeling objects and peoples as its `own', and then codifies these relationships into
law as enforceable through policing and state violence. Some of the features of this structural transformation
include:

  · Settler colonialism transforms land into property, restricting human relationships to land to that
      between a land-owner and property.

  · Settler colonialism restricts knowledge about land and cosmology, either destroying or (literally) burying
      them, causing a reversal of history.

  · Settler colonialism seeks to make the settler "more native" than Indigenous peoples while erasing the
                                                                                           CHAPTER 16: SETTLER-COLONIAL RHETORIC(S) | 367

      genealogy of Indigenous peoples. It also produces the fictional narrative that the settler is at risk of being
      displaced or removed from their fictive "homelands".
  · Settler colonialism seeks to make make the telling of Indigenous history impossible and less important
      than the settler's traditions and histories.
  · Once a territory has been colonized and its resource economy has been extracted, settler-colonists blame
      Indigenous and (formerly) enslaved peoples for the damage done and seeks a new territory to colonize.

Having come full circle, this chapter opened with a discussion of what a "settler colonial situation" is, offered
a reflection on the way that even the contemporary American university system is complicit in this situation,
before finally discussing some variations upon scholarly and lived understandings of colonialism. Ultimately,
colonialism is complex and sprawling phenomenon, one that is not simple to explain or capture, but which
all-encompassing and everywhere, difficult to ignore once it enters your awareness.

This chapter is about the Secrecy Situation. The first section defines this "situation," covers key terms related
to secrecy rhetoric (e.g. arcanum, secretum, surveillance, and sousveillance), and considers how these
concepts are relevant to the documentary "The Great Hack." The second section offers a short history of
famous conspiracy theories and how they have been a recurring feature of western European and American
history. The final section considers how rhetoric offers useful concepts for identifying and describing secrets.

Part 1: Secrecy Rhetorics

Secrecy creates a "situation" in two ways.
   On the one hand, secrecy is a spectacle. The term "spectacle" describes how a public's attention is steered

from one scandal or emergency after another. The spectacle demands all of our attention but makes it
impossible to focus upon just one thing that is happening. As Guy Debord writes, "With consummate skill,
the spectacle organizes ignorance of what is about to happen and, immediately afterward, the forgetting [of
what has happened]. The more important something is, the more that it is hidden." That's the logic of the
spectacle: secrets keep us tuned in because there is always another revelation or scandal to grab our attention.
Often, this resonates with how "rhetoric" is described in public life. Rhetoric is often understood as the
medium for keeping and communicating secretly, using words and images to create the impression of absence,
heighten suspense, and grab public attention.
                                                                     CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 371

   On the other hand, secrecy creates rhetorical situations of coded communication. When a secret exists
between two or more people, keeping the secret means communicating in public with purposeful double
meanings or by not communicating at all. When secrets are brought out into public, they separate members of
an in-group from an out-group. Joshua Gunn describes the word "shibboleth," a famous secret password, as
an example of this relationality in Modern Occult Rhetoric:

      the Ephraimites and the Gileadites are warring, and the latter defeats the former. The Gileadites fashion a
      blockade to catch fleeing Ephraimites and establish a password to let their friends through. Each escapee is asked
      to pronounce the word "shibboleth," ancient Hebrew for "ear of corn." In the dialect of the Gileadites the word
      was pronounced with a "sh," while the Ephraimites pronounced it with a "s."

The shibboleth is a secret password, a covert mode of communication used to constitute, separate, and police.
Passwords and surveillance technologies serve a similar function today. By enlisting secrecy, communication
forges social bonds and creates novel configurations of knowing and not knowing.

Linguistic Roots of Secrecy: Arcanum and Secretum

In sum, the secrecy situation is both

  · a general curated, immersive, and addictive experience of culture by a public trained to expect secrecy at
      every turn and

  · the particular relational experience - both intimate and oppressive - of holding privileged knowledge
      together with others.

The contemporary word "secret" is related to two terms developed in the Roman
empire: arcanum and secretum. These describe distinct but related ways of thinking about secrecy, specifically
the secrets that a ruling class or government keeps relative to a wider public. These forms of secrecy are modes
of political time management.

  · Arcanum comes from the noun arca, which means chest, coffin, or treasury. It is a secret that is not
      available because it has been buried, put under wraps, removed, or locked away from visibility or use.
      The defining characteristic of the arcanum is that its contents are inaccessible. As a mode of time
      management, the purpose of the arcanum is to control information indefinitely. The arcanum Imperii is
      the secret of state. These kinds of secrets restrict the flow of information by walling it off and making it
      inaccessible.

  · Secretum comes from the verb secenere, which means "to sift apart." It is a secret that arises due to the
      social separation between the suspicious and the ruling class who is `supposed to know' some hidden
      truth. The defining characteristic of the secretum is that it is always part-in and part-out of public view.
372 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

      Some aspects of the secret drip into the public's awareness, while other aspects remain outside of it. As a
      mode of time management, the purpose of the secretum is to innoculate or propagandize by gradually
      allowing the secret into the open. However, the secretum never comes out all at once. Instead, it
      maintains a balance between knowing the secret and knowing that we do not know it.

Subjective and Objective Secrets

Next, let's think about a different conceptual pairing that describes two very different kinds of rhetoric
used to communicate information about secrets. These are subjective and objective secrets, offering a functional
difference between kinds of secrets that demand different kinds of institutional response. What this means is
that subjective and objective secrets must be protected differently and fit into different categories in terms of
the kinds of information that they contain.

Subjective Secrets            EXAMPLES

· Compact, or expressed with  "Loose Lips Sink Ships"
   brevity.

· Transparent, or readily
   understandable.

· Changeable, or can be
   revised.

· Perishable, or short-term
   public memory.

Let's start with subjective secrets, which contain four key features. Subjective secrets are compact, or expressed
with brevity, transparent, or readily understandable, changeable, or can be revised, perishable, or live in short-
term public memory.

   During World War II, the temporary position of a ship or service persons would be a subjective secret.
The secret is easy to understand, it is brief, temporary, and if necessary it can be changed. Another example
is the World War two era phrase "loose lips sink ships". This phrase contains an argument that implies a
civic obligation, shut up about your work if you want the nation to stay safe. It's reasonably easy for us to
understand that even at the distance of 70-80 years when it first circulated. It is also easy to think up variants
on this phrase such as "snitches get stitches" or "see something say something". Each communicates a message
about secrecy for the moment in which it was shared in public.
Objective Secrets  CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 373

                                Nuclear Fission

· Diffuse, or expressed in many
   words.

· Technical, or unavailable to lay
   audiences.

· Determinable by individual
   deduction.

· Eternal, or long-lasting public
   memory.

Next, let's consider objective secrets. Objective secrets also have four key features, they are diffuse or expressed
in many words, they are technical, or unavailable to lay audiences or audiences that do not have the required
expertise, they are determinable, by individual deduction, and they are eternal or live in long-lasting public
memory.

   An example of an objective secret would be nuclear fission. Nuclear fission is the process of splitting the
atom, this process is not an easy or simple thing to explain but requires many words. It is not easily understood
by non-technical audiences, but someone who is sufficiently informed could in theory come up with these
ideas on their own with enough research. Finally, fission never stops being dangerous. Like the existence
of UFOs/UAPs, it is a long-term secret, kept because its potential effects do not dissipate over time.

Anamorphosis as Metaphor for the Secret

In Chapter 9: Visual Rhetoric, we covered the concept of anamorphosis as an example
of presence. Anamorphosis describes a visual shift in perspective and a shift in what an observer knows.
Historian Martin Jay tells us that, traditionally, anamorphosis describes a visual technique employed by
painters that "allows the spectator to reform a distorted picture by use of a non-planar mirror." (48) The
English language inherits anamorphosis from the Greek terms ana (again) and morphe (form). It
conventionally refers to a painting technique for manipulating perspective through purposeful distortion. A
famous example of anamorphosis is the Renaissance painting shown below, The Ambassadors (1533) painted
by Hans Holbein the Younger.
374 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

Hans Holbein the Younger, "The Ambassadors" (1533)

Looking the painting head-on, there is one disproportionate element: the large and distorted shape that covers
the lower half of the canvas. But from the proper angle, the distortion is revealed as a skull. The spectator can
see it fully and upright only as they move away from the canvas's center. Head-on, the painting overflows with
representations of knowledge. It is littered with mandolins, measuring devices, scrolls, and globes. `Viewed at
an angle,' however, the skull adds an extra element, one that carries an important significance for the viewer.
The skull tells us that something was missing when we first glanced at the image. Anamorphosis describes the
visual transformation of the skull, moving from an unintelligible blob to a recognizable form, once viewed
                                                                     CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 375

from the corrected perspective. The skull offers an analogy for the logic of secrecy: hidden meaning is only
available when the audience to this painting shifts their perspective.

   Anamorphosis need not be a visual phenomenon. There are many scenarios where secrets lie in plain sight,
right in front of us, and it isn't until the audience's perspective shifts that we recognize ourselves as in the
presence of a secret. In the clip below from the film Searching, the protagonist (played by John Cho) has
recently lost his daughter. He's done everything in his power to find her using the resources of the police
and has to the best of his ability scoured all of his daughter's social media postings. At the moment that he
submits commemorative materials for his daughter's funeral, he notices something that he had not before: an
anamorphic image that had been part of the social media profile that his daughter had been using, and which
he had found after her disappearance.

                             Example of anamorphosis from the (2018) film Searching.
   In the first instance, the main character saw the stock photo image as insignificant, much as a viewer
approaching the skull of The Ambassadors for the first time. There was no reason to question whether or not
the person that his daughter had been chatting with was using their own authentic image. However, after
coming to find out that the image is a stock photo, there is an anamorphic shift such that the meaning of these
previous conversations changes. It suddenly becomes possible that his daughter was catfished, and it renews the
main character's drive to find his missing child. Looking at the image from a different angle produces a different
meaning. In the first instance, the character saw the image, not knowing what it meant. Then, anamorphosis
occurs, changing the meaning of the image and changing the course of events in the film.

Whistleblowing, Leaking, and Stove-Piping

The term secretum describes how some secrets are "open," existing between what is known and what is
unknown, separating information between those who rule and those who are ruled. The umbrella
term secretum also captures how secret information trickles from an official source into the public. Three
common terms describe this movement of secrecy: whistleblowing, leaking, and stove-piping. Each is
defined below and paired with an extended example of how these terms work together:

  · Whistleblowing is when a member of an organization circumvents or goes around the institutional
      hierarchy to reveal compromising information about wrongdoing. If you are working in a group if you
376 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

      catch someone cheating on an exam and you report it to the instructor, that would be an example of
      whistleblowing. You circumvented the institutional hierarchy in some sense by going around your
      relationship with this other person in order to report it to the instructor. Because the secret is
      attributable to you because you revealed it to them, you would be the whistleblower.
  · Leaking occurs when secret information is shared with a third party to preserve the anonymity of an
      original source. If you were to catch someone cheating on an exam then pass that information to another
      person in the class who then passes it on to the instructor, that would be leaking. That way you would
      have shared that information with a third party, this other friend, who would have then passed it along
      in order to keep your identity a secret.
  · Stove-piping is when confidential information is released strategically to polarize public opinion. If you
      have a grudge against someone and then intentionally whistleblow or leak information that is false or
      incorrect to get them in trouble, that would be stove-piping. This term describes when information is
      labeled as a secret - likely with significant inaccuracies - to serve some personal or political goal.

Surveillance and Sousveillance

The last two key terms related to secrecy that we'll consider here are surveillance and sousveillance.

According to Steve Mann, Jason Nolan, and Barry Wellman, surveillance is the observation of interaction or
behavior by a nonparticipant in the interaction. It can also be explained in terms of three functions.

  · It is a form of social control or a way to encourage restrictions on behavior.
  · It is a mode of capitalist participation or a way to harvest information for the purposes of individual,

      corporate, or partisan enrichment.
  · Finally, it is a demand for disproportionate transparency from the subject under observation. In this

      case, information must be known for public safety or security, such as viral tracing data or essential
      national security information.

It's important to note that surveillance technologies have been with us for a long time, like other secrecy
functions of government, it is embedded in the history of official government institutions like prisons. One
of the famous prison building structures used for state surveillance is the panopticon. Before electricity or
film, the panopticon created a system of visual surveillance within the prison. The idea of the panopticon is to
exercise discipline through a visual arrangement of space, a guard in a central watchtower polices every cell and
every cell may be seen at a moment's notice with minimal patrolling. It also encourages watching among the
incarcerated, each of whom has a different limited window upon the other cells in the prison. It illustrates that
surveillance is a function of government and, like "loose lips sink ships", that it is an ideology related to policing
                                                                     CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 377

that people freely adopt. The question is why do we feel obligated to surveil and who is disproportionately
surveilled relative to others?

Sousveillance describes techniques of looking back. It is a mode of watching that turns surveillance
technologies back on the watchers. When we think of transparency watchdogs, or people turning cameras back
on scenes of police violence, this is sousveillance or the act of looking back. The image above is an installation
called "inside/out" by the French artist JR. It depicts a large photographic mural that was sent on the ground
along the Pakistani border and was meant to be captured by drones flown by Americans flying overhead. This
look-back is intended to make the persons who are typically watched into watchers, reversing the conventional
dynamics of state surveillance power.

Public Consciousness of Surveillance

Let's consider an example of how surveillance is represented and how the public is trained to understand
it. As we stated before, surveillance is the observation of interaction or behavior by a nonparticipant in the
interaction. It is also a form of social control, a mode of capitalist participation, and a demand for transparency
on the part of citizens. In the late 1990's early 2000's, surveillance was figured as a powerful policing tool,
and digital surveillance technology was still in early development. This trailer conveys the message that corrupt
378 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

institutions will misuse surveillance tools that are intended to protect people from violence. Let's watch the
clip and consider its relation to the concept of surveillance.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=212#oembed-2

The film Enemy of the State tells the story of a district attorney, played by Will Smith, who accidentally
comes upon a video of a political assassination in the United States. He is forced into hiding and is publicly
scapegoated by the individuals played by Jack Black and Jon Voight, who plotted this assassination and who
run a secretive government agency. Smith befriends a conspiracy theorist played by Gene Hackman, who
enables him to avoid capture while attempting to clear his name.

   Surveillance, the observation of one or more parties by another party not present in the communication
exchange, is a major feature of the film. It also satisfies the three criteria of surveillance described above:

  · Surveillance is depicted as a form of social control because Smith and Hackman are openly policed by a
      secretive agency that resembles the NSA.

  · Smith participates in capitalist surveillance because he is most exposed when shopping with credit cards
      and on camera.

  · The film ultimately demands disproportionate transparency by repeatedly exposing Smith to scrutiny
      and harm, despite his character's record of government service.

Ultimately, it makes the case in 1999 that someone must watch the watchers and that more public transparency
would ensure that people in charge of our surveillance tools are not also corrupt. Surveillance makes our
actions are more and more available for policing and raises the likelihood that surveillance systems will
malfunction or fall into dangerous hands. The need to look back is therefore deeply urgent.

Weaponized Speech and the Information Bomb Metaphor

When organizations leak large amounts of information into the public about corrupt institutions in
governments, the act of looking back becomes connected to demands for transparency. This idea of
sousveillance of the look back is what brings us to Stahl's article which asks when and how does speech become
weaponized? In his words, how can we speak about speech in an era of information warfare that has allowed
notions of war and public communication to meld to a significant degree?
                                                                     CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 379

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=212#oembed-3

Metaphor is the foundation for understanding Stahl's article, Weaponizing Speech. Metaphor criticism is the
selection of a narrow vocabulary for events that are occurring in the world. It places A in terms of B where A
is the tenor, the literal thing to which we refer, and B is the vehicle, the rhetorical screen that shapes how we
see that literal object. In this case, we tend to see the tenor of speech through the vehicle of the weapon. As
Stahl writes, a terrorist threat relies upon a transfer of meaning in which the state uses the sign as a tactic of
information warfare. It communicates rhetorically, using metaphors. Stahl several examples of how the media
has used metaphors in order to talk about terrorism.

      "Media coverage comprises the `oxygen' of terrorism... likening terrorism to a living organism that disappears in
      a conflagration."

Here the vehicle is oxygen and the tenor is media. Media organizations are the literal thing to which coverage
refers, while metaphorically, these act as the accelerant for terroristic activities because of the way that they
circulate harmful messages.

      Stahl also argues that mass media depicts terrorism as "noise and untranslatability" because "a terrorist's speech
      cannot be speech."

In this case, noise is the vehicle used to convey the tenor of terrorism. Because the literal event of terrorism
cannot be understood as meaningful within the military framing of events, it must be instead understood as a
distortion.

   The Information bomb stages a similar metaphor. In this case, the vehicle, the I-bomb, metaphorically
conveys a literal object, speech that reveals a state secret.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=212#oembed-4

The metaphor of the information bomb circulated following the 2010 Wikileaks information releases, which
initiated a wave of discourse fusing the frames of cyber-terrorism and weaponized journalism. The
organization released enormous caches of military ground reports and diplomatic cables that exposed the mass
380 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

deaths of innocent civilians, the use of torture and assassination, and the general failure of the U.S. military
strategy in Afghanistan. Perhaps more significant than the revelations themselves however was the fact that as
one journalist put it, virtually all of Washington declared WikiLeaks' disclosures (e.g. of diplomatic cables) as
acts of treason.

      The conversation routinely pushed the disclosures into the frame of war, weaponry, and terrorism. The loudest
      voice in the Republican party was that of New York congressman Peter King, incoming chair of the house
      committee on homeland security who demanded that Wikileaks be put on the official state department list
      of terrorist organizations. In addition to describing the leaks as catastrophic and sabotaging our system, King
      made sure to characterize the information in weaponized terms. "They are providing the weapons to terrorist
      organizations giving them information which they can use to kill off Americans to compromise America's
      standing around the world. The time bombs are out there and they are going to go off and by then it is going to
      be too late."

The information bomb (or I-Bomb) is a metaphor for an allegedly dangerous information release. It exposes a
secret by disclosing information as if it were a weapon, a bomb that explodes with unpredictable effects. It is, as
Stahl describes it, weaponized speech, a metaphor in which spoken, written, or otherwise recorded information
takes on the characteristics of a hypothetically destructive force or warlike threat. Sometimes, weaponized
speech is a form of propaganda designed to create the impression or perception of a threat, encouraging a
heightened military or police response while minimizing uncertainty over whether the anticipated, destructive
effects will actually materialize.

   Next, let's consider a clip that illustrates a different instance of the I-bomb than is considered within Stahl's
article. The video below is a trailer for the Netflix documentary The Great Hack. Like Stahl's article, the film is
concerned with the weaponization of information.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=212#oembed-5

The Great Hack offers an example of the I-bomb because it is also seeking to describe a strategic use of speech
and language that is weapon-like in nature. The Great Hack also offers an example of surveillance: Cambridge
Analytica fostered social control of public opinion enabled by a profit motive. Finally, The Great Hack it
created a demand for transparency in the form of the documentary `look back.' From a later point in time, we
as an audience are invited to see the secrets that were once exposed and the destructive effects they had.
                                                                     CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 381

Concluding image of "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"

Are secrets permanent and enduring and are specific measures needed in order to protect that kind of secret or,
are they temporary and changeable? Ultimately, secrets are ways of accounting for how information moves into
the public. Secrecy isn't just an arcanum, locked away like the arc of the Covenant at the end of Indiana Jones.
It is a mode of strategic time- and information management that establishes a concrete relationship between
those presumed to be "in the know" and the public who is supposed to believe in these institutions. It stages
the relationship between rulers and the ruled, or in the case of The Great Hack, between corporations and
consumers.

Part 2: Conspiracy Rhetoric

One of the reasons to study the rhetoric of secrecy is that it helps us to understand the logic of conspiracy
theories. Conspiracy theories are common ways of creating a spectacle of secrecy in public and personal
communication. They also describe how secrets acquire a specific kind of performative force when they
circulate in public. Conspiracy theories use rhetoric to attract audiences and capture them within a web of
faulty reasoning.

   Although it may seem like conspiracy theories are especially prevalent today, they have a long history in
the United States. This section offers a short history of conspiracies, offering some context for how and why
conspiracy thinking has been part of America's common sense for the past two centuries.
382 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

Legal and Rhetorical Definitions of Conspiracy

According to the United States federal legal code, a criminal conspiracy is an agreement by two or more people
to commit criminal fraud through illegal actions. Importantly, the plan to commit conspiracy does not have to
be conducted in secret to be punishable by law - conspiracies can and do happen out in the open. The Mueller
Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election cites two conspiracy
statutes in discussing whether to bring charges to Donald J. Trump for election interference involving the
Russian government and WikiLeaks in 2016. One of these, 18 U.S.C. § 371, creates an offense ...

      ... "[i]f two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the
      United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose."

As a kind of rhetoric, conspiracy theories are a repetitious form of disinformation that produces a paranoid
mindset in an audience. For example, Peter Knight describes post 9/11 "outrageous conspiracy theories" as
an "infinite regress of suspicion" in which "the location of the ultimate foundation of power is endlessly
deferred." (193) Many conspiracy theories resemble a "slippery slope" fallacy of reasoning in which secret
information is presented as an unfolding pattern of exposure. Richard Hofstadter calls a common rhetorical
organization of conspiracy theories in the 20th century "the paranoid style":

      The typical procedure [of the paranoid style] is to start with defensible assumptions and with a careful
      accumulation of facts, or at least of what appear to be facts, and to marshal these facts toward an overwhelming
      "proof" of the criminal conspiracy. It is nothing if not coherent - in fact, the paranoid mentality is far more
      coherent than the real world, since it leaves no room for mistakes, failures, or ambiguities. It believes that it is
      up against an enemy who is as infallibly rational as he is totally evil, and it seeks to match his imputed total
      competence with its own, leaving nothing unexplained and comprehending all of reality in one overarching,
      consistent theory.

It's this "mentality" that Hofstadter identifies in the late 1950s, and which he argues has emerged out of major
events in the past two centuries. These `events' include the anti-masonic movement, the rise of evangelical and
political demagogues in the United States, and the mainstreaming of Joseph McCarthy, Robert Welch, and
the anti-communist John Birch Society.

The Anti-Masonic Movement (early 19th century)

The Freemasons are a secret society with a long medieval and European history. They are commonly associated
with secrets because of the use of esoteric symbols, rituals, and hierarchy. Although their social and political
significance has declined substantially over time, they still remain commonly associated with secrecy and
conspiracy theories.

In the United States, the Freemasons were influential in the 18th and 19th centuries. Their activities were
only partly secret because the fact of their hidden activities was public knowledge, particularly with the anti-
Masonic movement. According to rhetorical and social movement theorist Leland Griffin, this movement
emerged in the early 1800s. Here is how Griffin sets up the context for the fraternity of freemasons in the early
19th century:

      "The conflict between secrecy and democracy would appear to be a recurrent phenomenon in our national
      history. Indeed, since the flowering of the modern secret society in the eighteenth century, anti-secretism as a
      state of mind has been an enduring fiber in the pattern of Western culture. In countries where the totalitarian
      climate prevails, the spirit of anti-secretism readily suppresses the secret order by the application of brute force.
      Where the question of suppression is left to the arbitrament of public opinion, however, the spirit of anti-
      secretism relies on persuasion. Throughout the century following the Revolutionary War, sentiment against
      the secret society was strong in America. During this period three attempts to arouse Public Opinion to the
      destruction of secret societies - and the Masonic Society in particular - may be noted. The second of these
      movements, which flourished from 1826 to 1838, roughly spanning the Jacksonian period, was by far the most
      noteworthy of the three." (145-146)

We might note the following three points about this long passage:

 1. Griffin, who is writing in 1958, has no better word than "anti-secretism" to describe the counter-
      movement to the freemasons, which refers fundamentally to a movement-like injunction for the masons
      to disclose their secrets to the public. In fact, the word "transparency" is a recent addition to our
      political, legal, and public vocabulary. As recently as the 1960s, politicians, and academics referred to
      "disclosure" instead of "transparency" as an important feature of a healthy political sphere.

 2. The Masons are a significant group at the start of the 19th century, and that they dwindled in stature
      over time thanks to the efforts of a counter-movement of "anti-masons."

 3. Anti-secretism "relies upon persuasion" and is therefore rhetorical. As Griffin notes, "the most
      significant figure in the band of aggressor rhetoricians was the political orator." (152)

In the fall of 1826, a rumor was circulated among Freemasons of western New York. Allegedly, a former
member of the lodge at Batavia, a bricklayer named William Morgan, was planning to publish the secret
signs, grips, passwords, and ritual of Ancient Craft [Blue Lodge] Masonry. Morgan was imprisoned on a false
charge and abducted from his cell by a small band of Masons. He was then taken to an abandoned fort above
Niagara Falls. Shortly thereafter, all historical trace of him vanishes. Morgan's disappearance triggered a public
384 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

backlash in many states which Griffin describes as the "anti-Masonic movement," which sought to expose the
Freemasons as a not-so-secret criminal conspiracy.

   When attacking the Freemasons, the anti-Masons relied upon "a `fund' of public argument via various
channels of media circulation, such as newspapers, tracts, public lectures, and sermons. In response, the
Freemasons used rhetorical strategies that fell into two categories:

  · The first strategy the Freemasons used was to counter-attack "the character and motives of Anti-masons.
      This strategy was a disaster. Griffin argues that it led the anti-Masons to extend their agenda to the
      complete destruction of Freemasonry itself, and later, "the destruction of all secret orders then existing
      in the country."

  · The Freemasons' second rhetorical response ... [was] "`dignified silence' in the face of the opposition's
      attack." According to Griffin, "states began to pass laws against extra-juridical oaths. Lodge charters were
      surrendered, sometimes under legal compulsion but often voluntarily, Phi Beta Kappa abandoned its
      oaths of secrecy, Masonic and Odd Fellows' lodges began to file bankruptcy petitions, and membership
      rolls in the various orders began to dwindle to the vanishing point."

Ultimately, the anti-Masonic movement disappeared, but the Freemasons remained. They have persisted
through the late 20th and early 21st century, although their membership and public influence have diminished
significantly. According to Joshua Gunn, the Freemasons were once a powerful organization because they
laid claim to an "inexhaustible secret." The community was sustained through the secrecy enmeshed with
the organization's hierarchy, its sacred rituals, and its guarded texts. But in the 20th century, in a flawed
effort to get more members into the organization, the Freemasons began publicizing these texts. In this case,
secrecy held that organization together and transparency pulled it apart. To sustain a public, the inexhaustible
secret requires "a continuous dynamic obligation and commitment, achieved by a fetishized object whose
information, meaning, or symbolism can never be fully revealed." By giving up on secrets, the Masons also `gave
up' on what bound them together.

The Dreyfus Affair (late 19th - early 20th century)

The second example of early-20th century conspiracy theories is the Esterhazy Scandal, more commonly
                                                                    CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 385

known as the Dreyfus Affair. On July 24th, 1894, Major Esterhazy, a French officer, offered to sell important
French military secrets to the German military attache in Paris, Lieutenant Colonel Maximilian von
Schwartzkoppen. Esterhazy gave him an artillery manual and a memorandum he had written on the subject
of the new short 120 millimeter cannon being developed by the French, French troop positions and
modifications in the battle order of artillery units, and plans for the imminent invasion and colonization of
Madagascar. Shortly after it was received by the German attache, this information was leaked back to the
French through planted French spies at the German embassy. After making incorrect deductions about where
the information could have come from, a Lieutenant Colonel in the French army created a list of artillery
officer trainees. The name "Alfred Dreyfus" was quickly singled out.

                                                 Portrait of Alfred Dreyfus

Dreyfus was a Jewish artillery officer. Those above him in the chain of command were openly anti-Semitic and
Dreyfus was the only Jewish trainee. When news of his arrest was leaked, it was explained that Dreyfus had just
finished training in the general staff, which is why he could obtain so much information. The evidence that
resulted in his conviction was also markedly racist: it made Dreyfus the subject of suspicion because he was
Jewish. Even Dreyfus's handwriting did not match the handwriting on the leaked document from Germany.
He was imprisoned on devil's island in French Guiana where he spent about five years. Widely publicized
around the world, the Dreyfus arrest strongly intensified antisemitic attitudes in France and Europe. The word
"Dreyfusard," a supporter of Dreyfus's innocence, would have a familiar reference to the scandal in the early
20th century. Some famous supporters of Dreyfus included Queen Victoria, Henri Poincare, Mark Twain, and
the Pope.
386 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

While he was in prison Dreyfus naively believed in the army's ability to establish his innocence. He was
unaware of the efforts to free him, his enemies in the general staff, and was convinced that high-ranking military
officials were making efforts to find the real traitor. In 1896 new evidence emerged that identified the real
culprit as Ferdinand Esterhazy. When officials suppressed the new evidence, a military court unanimously
acquitted Esterhazy after a trial that lasted only two days. The army put additional charges against Dreyfus,
which were based on forged documents. During this time, French novelist, playwright, and journalist Emile
Zola published six open letters on Dreyfus's behalf. In 1898 he published the famous letter titled "Je Accuse!,"
- which was itself followed by seven more letters. This public pressure on the government to return to the case.

In 1899 Dreyfus returned to France for another trial. The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year
sentence, but Dreyfus was pardoned and released. In 1906 Dreyfus was exonerated and reinstated as a major.
He served during the whole of World War I. He ended his service at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and died
in 1935.

   The case is instructive for the way it communicates the role of racist ideologies in conspiracy theories. Max
Horkheimer, who wrote "The Authoritarian Personality" in the wake of World War II, sought to establish a
social-scientific basis for measuring and identifying the core traits of the anti-Semitic ideologies.

      The Authoritarian Personality (1950) "seeks to discover correlations between ideology and sociological factors
      operating in the individual's past." It is about "hitherto largely ignored psychological aspects of fascism" by
      focusing "upon the consumer, the individual for whom the propaganda is designed." It aims "to discover
                                                                    CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 387

      what patterns of socioeconomic factors are associated with receptivity, and with resistance, to antidemocratic
      propaganda."

Horkheimer finds that antisemitism is characterized by contradictory attitudes that cannot be easily reconciled.
For example, anti-Semitic ideology made Dreyfus out to be both too strong and too weak, too secretive and
also too intrusive, as assimilating both too much and not enough. Dreyfus was accused on the basis of having
fabricated his own handwriting. It was the contradictions of his character that were the telltale evidence that led
him to be imprisoned. Dreyfus's story is a warning because it was such a widespread source of misinformation.
It also demonstrated how both racism and conspiracy theories were intertwined at the outset of the 20th
century.

Part 3: Psychoanalysis and Secrecy

When we learn a secret, we receive a very specific kind of knowledge, one that is somewhere between staying
unknown and becoming known. Secrets stay unknown because they concentrate knowledge among a limited
number of people, restricting who is "in the know" to limit the flow of information. However, secrets also
characteristically leak out of closed groups. It is difficult to keep a secret because it is not always apparent what
or how we will unconsciously communicate what we wish to hide. Freudian slips and accidental references
often give the secret away.

What is Psychoanalysis?

Psychoanalysis is the study of the unconscious and is most often associated with the theory and practice of talk
therapy: a patient speaks their symptoms aloud, which an analyst interprets. In the Freudian tradition, the
unconscious is often thought of as repressed memories or thoughts that have been pushed out of the conscious
mind but which return with a vengeance, haunting our everyday lives. This is one of the ways that
psychoanalysis theorizes the secret: as a quantity that we know in our unconscious, but which is not present to
the conscious mind.

   Later traditions of psychoanalytic thinking resist the idea that the unconscious is deeply repressed "inside"
of the patient. Instead, secrets live "on the outside," in everyday speech and our own under-noticed behaviors.
388 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

This "outside" unconscious emerges as language choices and the metaphors we use, as well as the automatic
assumptions we make of others and ourselves. We carry our history in the way we carry ourselves in the world
and project a learned, more-or-less functional worldview.

                       On the philosophy and practice of psychoanalysis as the talking cure.
   A key weakness of psychoanalytic thinking is that it sometimes emphasizes individual,
ideational explanations above collective, structural explanations. For example, a psychoanalyst may point to a
patient's psychology or their need to reframe a situation before granting that deeper causes like structural
racism and income inequality are important contributing factors to their emotional distress. For this reason, a
more responsible version of psychoanalysis must seek a wider frame that is both individual and collective; both
ideational and material.
   Finally, speech (or talk) is the key point of overlap between psychoanalysis and rhetoric. Like rhetoric,
psychoanalysis credits speech with the power to transform a person's ideations - for better and for worse. Talk
therapy allows some patients to recognize their symptoms as real secrets that they have kept from themselves,
rather than dismissing or ignoring them. Talk cultivates awareness. For that reason, psychoanalysis is about
knowing, anticipating, and building habits. It allows us to grow bigger around our secrets by giving them
oxygen and making space for them in our lives.

Secrets are Rhetorical Repetitions

Rhetoric is also about speech and talk, adding the element of repetition. Before the word rhetoric was invented,
a close equivalent was poetry, which was spoken aloud and remembered through repetition and meter. When
the Greek sophists practiced persuasion, they departed from the oral performance of poetry that often reported
important events. Instead, their rhetoric made speech an event. Frequently, they repeated especially compelling
speeches and arguments, binding the invention of rhetoric to a kind of repetition. Even when understood as
"figures of speech," rhetoric is often an organized form of repetition:

  · Anaphora repeats the sounds at the beginning of words.
      A similar sequence of sounds and persuasive propaganda are instances of anaphora.

  · Asyndeton is the repeated omission of conjunctions between clauses, resulting in a hurried rhythm or
                                                                    CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 389

      vehement effect. Vini. Vidi. Vici. (I came. I saw. I conquered)
  · Epiphora repeats words positioned at the end of a sentence. I want pizza, he wants pizza, we all

      want pizza!

Secrets are also recognizable because they are forms of repetition. We may know a secret is kept when a
conspicuous action rises to the level of a pattern. For example, we may know that someone is planning a
surprise party if they repeatedly divert from the topic each time a birthday is brought up. Often "twist"
endings rely on us repeating the past, seeing new significance in details that seemed mundane at first. When we
read for repetition, we also read rhetorically because we seek to understand under-noticed patterns that are part
of our everyday life.

In the above clip, the character Michael Scott is terrible at keeping secrets, and threatens to disclose sensitive
information through his repetitious behaviors. Jim struggles to prevent his secret from coming out while
Michael repeatedly drops hints that reference Jim's secret (e.g. "the P situation," "he is in love with one of
his co-workers who is engaged"). Indeed, he is so bad at keeping secrets that he eventually transforms into
Jim, seeking to "repeat" him perfectly. These instances of repetition are what add up to a secret, making it
increasingly apparent to all of those who are `out of the know' that something has been hidden from them.

Those who are Supposed to Know and others who
are Supposed to Believe

Like rhetoric, secrets have several different types of audiences. They are the "subjects supposed to know" and
the "subjects supposed to believe." Whereas the "subjects supposed to believe" are those who know that the
secret exists by virtue of some other, higher authority, the "subjects supposed to know" are those who are
presumed to have access to the secret.

   Publicly known secrets are often described as "open." Open secrets are those that are not fully or officially
acknowledged but are nonetheless known and believed by a public who knows them to be true. Scandals are
often open secrets before they become common knowledge. Other times, conspiracy theories try to create the
appearance of an open secret by alleging that something is hidden when, in fact, there is no secret there at all.
All secrets, open or otherwise, create a division between those who are "supposed to know" and those who are
"supposed to believe."
390 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

  · Those who are "supposed to know" are the keepers of the secret. For many people, it is an aspirational
      position or one that they revere. Other people imagine themselves as the "supposed to know" as a
      fantasy of mastery. The subject supposed to know is the star of outlandish conspiracy theories, assumed
      to be authorities with access, power, and privilege. The subject "supposed to know" is supposed to know
      "the truth" about something utterly secret to us, whether it be about extraterrestrial life, a highly
      specialized form of knowledge, or a family recipe. In the traditional psychoanalytic setting,
      the therapist is often depicted as the subject "supposed to know," or who is supposed to have the faculty
      of seeing what the patient cannot.

  · Those who are "supposed to believe" are those who perceive themselves to be out-of-the-know, or who
      do not have the secret. They may be aware that a secret exists, and if so, they are meant to believe that
      some people in the first group (those "supposed to know") have access to it (even if they do not). Those
      "supposed to believe" are certain about one thing: they know that they do not know, and therefore invest
      in the "subject supposed to believe" as the likely source of all the answers. In the traditional
      psychoanalytic setting, the patient is often depicted as the "subject supposed to believe," or who is
      supposed to desire access to the secrets guarded by the subject "supposed to know."

Ultimately, secrets are sustained by the belief of those people who are "supposed to believe" in the other group,
who is "supposed to know." Even if we do not have all of the answers, secrets are sustained by the belief that
some other authority [e.g. a parent, professor, therapist, political representative, etc.] surely does have all the
answers. In psychoanalytic theory, these "subjects supposed to know" are instances of the superego or the big
Other, a psychological position from which we judge our own actions and which authorize our own judgment
as accurate, moral, or legitimate.

Ego, Id, Superego

                                  The Freud Museum on the Ego, Id, and Superego
   The concept of the superego is part of a famous triad that includes the ego and the id. This framework is
meant as a way to understand how the unconscious operates as a negotiation between different elements
of an individual's psyche. The following taxonomy is from the Freud Museum in London, with textbook
commentary in the brackets:
                                                                     CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 391

  · The id is the realm of appetites, wants, and passions that do not take `no' for an answer. [This can also
      be thought of as the `need to know' of the secret in the sense of a demand that it be let out or be released.]

  · The superego is connected to morality and social norms, built out of identifications with one's parents
      [and other big Others] , and can be extremely cruel. [This can also be thought of as the imagined
      position of those who are `supposed to know,` the secret and are presumed to restrict our access to it.]

  · The ego faces the task of finding a balance between the demands of the id and the superego. That's why
      the ego is the seat of the `defense mechanisms' - there are so many dangers to avoid! [The ego describes
      the negotiation between the subject's `need to know` and their imagination of those `supposed to know,`
      and all of the problems that arise because of it.]

Secrets = Knowledge Organized by Rhetoric

There are many official methods for "reading" secrets that seem to fall outside of the disciplinary boundaries of
rhetoric, if only because of the way that they make secrets into a mathematical problem. One famous example
is the prisoner's dilemma, a hypothetical problem about the probability of two (or more) conspirators reporting
their companion(s) - revealing the secret of the conspiracy - under interrogation. The prisoner's dilemma
has been used to map the probable behavior of wartime combatants, economic competitors, and diplomacy
among nations. However, as the video below explains, although these models may calculate statistically
reasonable outcomes actual or real-world results do not always correlate with these mathematical probabilities.

Psychoanalysis and rhetoric can also help us to understand the organized features of secrets, showing
us formal characteristics that may not be apparent to us at first glance. One example is Edgar Alan Poe's short
story, "The Purloined Letter," which is one of the first examples of detective fiction.

392 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

                A YouTube video explaining the plot of "The Purloined Letter" in greater detail.
   The story starts when a police officer, representing the Queen, bursts into the office of Auguste Dupin,
a private investigator. This representative explains that the Queen has had a secret letter stolen. The theft
occurred in a "royal boudoir," where the King was also present. The contents of the letter are so sensitive that
the Queen had wished to keep it secret even from the King. However, the crafty minister D- entered the royal
chambers, saw the Queen was trying to hide the document, and took it, replacing it with a fake.

The arrangement of characters in the first scene of The Purloined Letter

This is where the police get involved: they have staked out the Minister and have been unable to locate the
letter, despite using state-of-the-art technology. Believing that Dupin will have better luck, the police task
                                                                    CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 393

him with finding the letter. Dupin visits the Minister D- for a social call, and very quickly spots the letter:
it is crumpled up on the Minister's mantlepiece, laying in plain sight. He purposefully forgets an item at the
Minister's apartment and returns the next day. While Dupin is in the apartment, he stages a diversion in the
square below and - while the Minister's back is turned, replaces the stolen letter with a decoy of his own. The
secret letter thus returns safely to its destination, and the reader never learns what it says.

Reading "The Purloined Letter" rhetorically illustrates how there is an organization and form to the secret at
the story's center. The story is partitioned into two scenes where the letter is "purloined" among three different
characters. The first `scene' occurs in the boudoir between the King, the Queen, and the Minister D-. The
second occurs in the Minister's apartment, between the police, Minister D-, and Dupin. By breaking the story
394 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

down in this way, we can see that the secret is composed of three different "perspectives" or "points of view"
with respect to undisclosed information:

 1. The first position is that of the King and the police: they are "dupes" who are entirely ignorant of the
      letter's concealment. They represent the force of the superego, the laws that we impose upon ourselves,
      which is both all-powerful and disconnected from that which it sets out to govern. The letter is so secret
      that it does not even occur to them that it exists, or if they are aware that it exists, they are unable to see it
      when it is laying in plain sight.

 2. The second position is that of the Queen in the first scene and the Minister D- in the second. They are
      the "keepers" of the secret, the ones who possess the privileged information and make every effort to
      conceal it and keep it out of wider view. They represent the ego, the conscious self who is divided
      between obedience to the law and unrepressed instincts of the id.

 3. The third position is that of Minister D- in the first scene and Dupin in the second. They are the
      "perceivers" of the secret, the ones who are able to recognize what the second position is trying to
      conceal and, seizing the advantage, shift a balance of power. They represent the instincts and agency of
      the id, which captures how urges related to the body's physical functions (e.g. seeing, eating) become
      automatic behaviors.
                                                                    CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE | 395

Most often, secrets are thought of as "hidden content," in the sense that we want or need to know what those in
positions of power or privilege have concealed from us. The story shows us how secrets are not hidden content,
but a form or structure. For one thing, at no point do we ever learn what is in the purloined letter. Instead, we
learn how and among whom the letter moves, and how the structure of not knowing, knowing, and seizing
upon the secret may continually reproduce itself.

   Ultimately, rhetoric and secrets are connected in several ways. Deciphering "talk" may allow us to perceive
those things others have hidden - and which we keep hidden from ourselves. Identifying the "superego" may
396 | CHAPTER 17: THE RHETORIC OF SECRECY AND SURVEILLANCE

enable us to name the authorities in our lives or those who "have the secret." Finally, the formal features of
narrative unmask secrets as nothing more than positions we take with respect to privileged information: not
having it, having it, or of unbalancing these power dynamics.

CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)

The content of all new media is old media.

This chapter completes the unit on rhetoric's "situations" by discussing the digital situation of rhetorical
communication. It is divided into three sections: The first discusses what the Digital Situation is. The second
defines two keywords, "algorithm" and "big data." The final section, on digital dystopia and algorithms of
oppression, describes how rhetoric helps us to understand the problems generated by profit-focused digital
technologies/platforms. There are two videos that accompany the third section that I also strongly
recommend.

   To allay any confusion, there is no chapter 13 in the un-textbook. Much like the floors of some buildings,
the chapters skip from chapter 12 (on "the secrecy situation") to chapter 14 (on "the digital situation"). My
(admittedly superstitious) reasoning for this otherwise puzzling decision is that I would just prefer not to end
this textbook on a '13'.

Part 1: Defining Digital Rhetoric

Digital Rhetoric describes the language we use and the practices that have become invisible/normal concerning
technology. The basic premise is that the words and techniques we use to monitor and model human behavior
have consequences. This chapter answers the questions: which words, phrases, and language choices define
the "digital situation" of rhetoric? What techniques or strategies are part of the digital situation? What are its
practical and lived effects?

   Beyond offering this core definition and answering the questions above, this chapter explains how digital
rhetoric also describes the way that words about technology and techniques of measurement are used to model
human behavior, the way that digital technologies retain the trace of earlier communication technologies, and
the destructive effects of the terminology used to categorize technology and digitally-enabled measurement
techniques.
400 | CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)

What is the "Digital Situation"?

The "digital situation" describes the effort to situate the theories and methods of rhetoric to the new
environment of digital communication. According to rhetorical scholars Damien Smith Pfister and Michelle
Kennerly,

      The invention of writing, like the invention of print and digital media after it, did not signal the end of oral
      communication, though it did transform oral norms and many of the practices that accompanied oral culture.
      However, even in digital contexts, oral communication merits continued attention because, as the scholar of
      media and rhetoric Marshall McLuhan famously claimed, "the `content' of any medium is always another
      medium. The content of writing is speech, just as the written word is the content of print, and print is the
      content of the telegraph.

The digital era also corresponds with the invention of computational technologies, operating systems, and
internet-enabled connectivity is often described as a wholly new historical situation, one that marks an
important departure from previous technological ages. The beginning of this "situation" is often located
somewhere between the 19th-century invention of difference and analytical engines and the 20th-century
development of computerized cryptography, and features western European inventors such as Ada
Lovelace, Charles Babbage, and Alan Turing. However, many early computational technologies retain the
trace of older technologies. Some, like the analytical engine, were powered by steam, while others, like the
Turing machine, are no more complicated than a basic calculator. Additionally, the word "computer"
originally described a class of professional mathematicians, like Dorothy Vaughan, whose work was crucial for
space travel in the 20th-century. Practitioners like Vaughan, who were subjected to vicious discrimination and
have been long overlooked in the history of the digital age, offer a window into how allegedly "new" forms of
media retain older forms of technology and the cultural assumptions that surrounded them.

In the case of the digital era, many `new' technologies have strong resemblances to their older antecedents and
the discriminatory patterns of thought that characterized them have not disappeared but instead, have changed
forms. For example, in Plato's Phaedrus, which is one of the few ancient Greek works in the philosophical
tradition that references the term rhetoric, he describes an ancient skepticism to a different form of technology:
writing. In that dialogue, the character-teacher Socrates argues that speech is superior to writing because it
captures the living intentions of the speaker and the liveliness of the spoken encounter. Writing confines
                                                                                                              CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S) | 401

the communication of knowledge to the dead letter, where it is mummified and separated from its original
source. When such sources are absent, they cannot resolve the conflicts over interpretation, misuse, or
misunderstanding. Writing, he also argues, is a crutch for memory, and weakens the mind by diminishing
our capacity for retaining information. In many ways, this criticism of writing resembles criticisms of those
brought up in the early digital era. As one pundit argued of Gen Z in 2019:

      They are bright, innovative, confident in their skills on all manner of digital screens and devices: This is
      Generation Z, many of whom have little notion that they have begun to short-circuit some of the essential
      cognitive and affective processes that produced the digital world they inhabit. Furthermore, no small number of
      these young humans would grimace if asked to read this last sentence with its multiple clauses and syntactical
      demands. Reports from university and high school instructors like Mark Edmundson describe how many
      students no longer have the patience to read denser, more difficult texts like classic literature from the 19th
      and 20th centuries. I am less concerned with students' cognitive impatience than with their potential inability
      to read with the sophistication necessary to grasp the complexity of thought and argument found in denser,
      longer, more demanding texts, whether in literature and science classes or, later, in wills, contracts, and public
      referenda. The reality is that our young people are changing in ways that are as imperceptible to them as to most
      adults, particularly in how, what, and why they read--the cornerstone of how most humans think for the last
      few centuries with the spread of literacy.

                             Chris understood the effects of technology ... back in 1993.
   In the digital era, the more things change, the more they stay the same. According to the author quoted
above, people residing in wealthy, technology-consuming nations are on the precipice of a landmark
generational change, with less memory of a pre-digital environment and more default, early-age engagements
with digital technologies. The author's fears about Gen Z's reading habits resemble Socrates' fears about
"memory" in the sense that both technological shifts are suspected to alter the course of human development.
However, what neither author captures is how technologies like writing were - and computers are - unequally
distributed among a social hierarchy of different peoples. While it may be true that Gen Z's reading habits
may be changing, that may not be fully representative of the digital situation, such as for people who reside
in exploited technology-manufacturing countries, for those who cannot afford such technologies, for those
ignored by the design process, and for those targeted by surveillance. In the digital situation, many new media
technologies retain traces of the social world of which they were a part, including the discriminatory policing,
sexism, and racism that also characterized earlier eras of technological innovation and change.
402 | CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)

Effects of the Digital Situation

So, what difference does the "digital" make? What's "new" about new media? What are the consequences of
the digital situation for rhetoric and rhetorical forms of communication?

(1) The first consequence of the digital situation is that
rhetoric about digital technologies is saturated with profound
optimism and anxiety.

Because the digital age also increases the quantity of information with which we are routinely engaged,
anxiety is rhetorically rendered as short-lived neologisms like information overload, the short-lived too-much-
                                                                                                             CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S) | 403

information effect, information anxiety, and infobesity (Bawden and Robinson, "The Dark Side of
Information," 181-5). As media theorist Mark Andrejevic claims, "we have become like the intelligence
analysts overwhelmed by a tsunami of information or the market researcher trying to make sense of the
exploding data `troves' they have created and captured."

   One reason that this information creates such anxiety is that it implicates enormous populations with the
release of sensitive information. Those who have had their information compromised share an experience
of anxiety at a mass level. 164m LinkedIn passwords in 2012, 427m MySpace passwords in 2013, 1b Yahoo
accounts in 2013, 40m credit card imprints from Target in 2013, and 25gb of user information from Ashley
Madison in 2015. This continual, successive leaking moves at multiple more-or-less perceptible speeds.

   The metaphor of information "leaks" is deeply rooted in the metaphor of information-as-fluid. The rapid
growth and proliferation of digital technologies leads Gregory Seigworth and Matthew Tiessen to describe
them as pools for data aggregation and plasma: more-than-liquid currency flowing in rapid transnational
currents. James Gleick calls the information revolution of the 20th century a "flood" to compare the cascade of
"dictionaries, encyclopedias, almanacs, compendiums of words, classifiers of facts, [and] trees of knowledge"
to the rising tide of digital technology running from Charles Babbage to Sergei Brin. Klaus Theweleit writes
that "the powerful metaphor of the flood engenders a clearly ambivalent state of excitement. It is threatening
but also attractive ... [and] causes many things to flow: every brook and stream, still waters; floods of papers,
political, literary, intellectual currents, influences. Everything is in flow, swimming upon this wave or that, with
or against the current, in the mainstream or in tributaries."

(2) The second consequence of new digital technologies is that
humans are imagined to be automatic choice-making
communication machines, much like computers and other digital
technologies.

This is most apparent in the recognition accorded to the work of behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and
Amos Tversky and their probabilistic theory of "heuristics" - mathematical rules of irrational human behavior
- explained in the book Thinking Fast and Slow. A heuristic is a mental shortcut for reasoning that, when
misapplied, may consistently predict erroneous human behavior, when given the proper set-up and context.
An example of a heuristic is the "hot hand fallacy," in which multiple consecutive successful outcomes -
such as basketball free throws or gambling bets - seem to increase the probability of subsequent successful
outcomes. Whether the "hot hand" is in fact a fallacy is a matter of popular dispute.

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=191#oembed-3
404 | CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)

The "hot hand fallacy," as depicted by NBA Jam, a videogame on the Sega Genesis platform

According to (other) behavioral economists Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein, authors of Nudge:
Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness:

      Unfortunately, people do not have accurate perceptions of what random sequences look like." ... "Players who
      have hit a few shots in a row or even most of their recent shots are said to have a "hot hand," which is taken by all
      sports announcers to be a good signal about the future. ... It turns out that the "hot hand" is just a myth. Players
      who have made their last few shots are no more likely to make their next shot (actually a bit less likely). Really.
      (27-8)

Other common examples of "heuristics" include anchoring and availability. The anchoring heuristic describes
the approximations we make when we guess quantities or relative sizes. A person will typically begin with
an "anchor" - a point of reference with which they are familiar - and guess from there. For example, when
guessing the population of Madison, Wisconsin (~254,000) a correct guess may depend upon where you
currently live. A resident of Chicago who knows the Illinois city has a population of 2.7 million but that
Madison is significantly smaller might divide this number by 3, leading to a guess of 900,000. But someone
who lives in Minneapolis, population 430,000 might, following the same logic, guess in the neighborhood of
143,000. Although the Minneapolis guess is still wrong, it is still significantly closer to the correct amount.

   The availability heuristic describes a guess in which our ability to think of a relevant or vivid example may
lead us to overestimate the risk of one event over another. If you are able to think of an example of something
going awry, you may be more likely to be frightened, invested, and/or concerned than if such examples are not
so readily available. For example, easily imagined causes of death such as tornadoes might be thought to cause
greater devastation than other threats, such as asthma attacks. Similarly, recent events have a greater impact on
our risk-based behaviors than those that occurred earlier in remembered time or recorded history.

One significant flaw in the humans-as-computing-machines metaphor is that it encourages ways of thinking
that are mathematically precise but divorced from a larger social context where the effects of design vary
greatly depending upon race, ability, gender, and class. In "A Culture of Disengagement in Engineering
Education," Erin A. Cech argues that engineering education, in particular, embraces the mentality that the
world presents problems that can be solved by making the correct design choices, using decontextualized
reasoning in which a solution employed under one specific set of circumstances will necessarily work in
another, analogous context. The effect of this kind of abstraction is to ignore peoples' unique experiences
of digital technologies and to generalize the communities where technological interventions are leveraged as
`solutions'. As Cech argues:

      "Disengagement may mean that things like public welfare considerations get defined out of engineering
      problems, excluded from the realm of responsibility that engineers carve out for themselves." ... "Disengagement
      entails bracketing a variety of concerns not considered directly `relevant' to the design or implementation of
      technological objects and systems, such as socioeconomic inequality, history, and global politics."

One example of this kind of disengagement is the proposal for "Amazon Go," a fully automated retail location
run by the larger Amazon.com parent company. In 2016, Amazon.com introduced the idea of a worker-
less store where Amazon customers would use a digital scanning system to gain access to a store and to pay
for items. As advertised, this concept offered a seamless customer experience in which they could quickly
walk in and out with what they needed. The advertisement features a diverse array of customers, seemingly
406 | CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)

promising access to anyone who might wish to shop there. However, critics of Amazon Go quickly pointed
out a number of flaws in the idea. The store, for instance, employs an intense form of customer surveillance to
police shoplifting and the automation of the retail space effectively eliminated a number of jobs. Even before
the creation of this warehouse/store, Amazon was credibly accused of having exacerbated housing insecurity.
Having and gaining access to such a store would create even more visible divisions between those with food
and housing, adding layers of difficulty for those without consistent housing - who would be prohibited from
entering the store during inclement weather -- and for those who wished to use electronic benefits transfers
(EBT) and other food vouchers. By eliminating jobs and promising access only to those who could afford a
membership, such locations would contribute to worsening problems of gentrification by eliminating lower-
paying jobs and by making housing insecurity more visible - all the while promising easier, faster access to food
and other basic needs.

(3) The third consequence of the digital situation is related to the
idea that every new technology bears the trace or residue of an
older one.

According to Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin, "the content of new media is old media." This phrase
refers to the way that technology evolves, and how each "new" technological form retains the residue of the
technologies that came before it. Remediation: Understanding New Media (2000), Bolter and Grusin argue
media forms undergo a living evolution. Each new media form relies upon its predecessors for its meaning
and its shape. PowerPoint, for instance, retains the "slides" from the images carousel and transparencies used
on overhead projectors. The first computer programs were "written" upon punched paper cards, which were
modeled after the Jacquard loom, which used interchangeable, patterned plates to create complex fabric
designs.
                                                                                                             CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S) | 407

                   them online here: https://open.lib.umn.edu/rhetoricaltheory/?p=191#oembed-5

   The trace of old technology in the new is called a skeuomorph. The punched card, for instance, retained a
similar form and function to the `cards' of the Jacquard loom. The floppy disk retained a similar function
to the punched card, which was similarly inserted into computer equipment as it was read by a computer.
The CD and the DVD retained a similar form and function to the floppy disc, which became the `new' data
storage devices read through optical technologies. Other common skeuomorphs include the standard "save"
icon, which resembles a floppy disk, the "trash" or "recycle bin," which may not in fact remove data from
the hard drive, or the common "folder" image, which in many cases looks like a folder that might be used in
a filing cabinet. These images and representations are residues of earlier, related technologies of storage and
transmission. They remind us of old physical storage media even as files are stored in virtual spaces, such as
"clouds" and "servers."

                                   Ever considered why the "save" icon is this funny
                                   square-like shape?

As N. Katherine Hayles explains in the (1999) How we Became Posthuman:

      A skeuomorph is a design feature that is no longer functional in itself but that refers back to a feature that was
      functional at an earlier time. The dashboard of my Toyota Camry, for example, is covered by vinyl molded to
      simulate stitching. The simulated stitching alludes back to a fabric that was in fact stitched, although the vinyl
      "stitching" is formed by an injection mold. Skeuomorphs visibly testify to the social or psychological necessity
      for innovation to be tempered by replication. Like anachronisms, their pejorative first cousins, skeuomorphs are
      not unusual. On the contrary, they are so deeply characteristic of the evolution of concepts and artifacts that it
      takes a great deal of conscious effort to avoid them.
408 | CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)

                                     Imitation wood car siding: Pining for the days of
                                     wooden vehicular transportation?

Skeuomorphs are the bits of new technology that remind us of its older versions. They are not just accidental
features, unnecessary designs, or weird nostalgia; they are also a necessary part of technological evolution
whereby already-familiar aspects of technology inhabit and inform the creation of the new. Recalling these
aspects of technology - their superfluous but also essential features - is an important part of how they
communicate across time.

Part 2: Keywords for the Digital Situation

This section introduces two key terms for the digital situation: algorithm and big data. As discussed in the
previous section, these terms carry the weight of the old even as they symbolize what is `new' about the digital
situation and the transformative technologies it delivers. An important feature of these terminologies is that
the older meanings and functions attached to media technologies still inform how we understand new media
technologies. Rhetoric informs this understanding of media because it is similarly an "older" vocabulary that
informs how many "new" techniques of persuasion and social action take shape in the 21st century.

Algorithm

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term algorithm originates from Arabic as a poor translation
of the name al-Khwarizmi, the Persian author of a groundbreaking mathematical text on Arabic numerals. As
cultural studies Ted Striphas explains in his essay, "Algorithmic Culture":

      [The] manuscript, Al-Kitb al-Mukhtaar f isb al-jabr wa-al-Muqbala (The Compendious Book of
      Calculation by Restoration and Balancing) is the primary work through which the word algebra itself, adapted
      from the Arabic al-jabr, diffused through Moorish Spain into the languages of Western Europe Incidentally, the
      word appearing just before al-jabr in the Arabic version of the title, isb, though translated as calculation, also
      denotes arithmetic.
                                                                                                             CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S) | 409

There is a similiarly complex history and evolution to the development of the term "algorithm." It signifies
the conceptual discovery of the zero and its incorporation into the number system. Even "zero" has a complex
past because it has migrated across cultures and languages. Zero comes from sunya, the Sanskrit word for `void.'
This term migrated into the Arabic context as sifr, which means `empty' and is the root from which the
modern term cypher derives.

The Babylonian system of notation and the function of "0" within their number system. From Seife, Zero:
The Biography of a Dangerous Idea, p.15

According to Charles Seife's Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea, zero's earliest known function is
as a placeholder to symbolize a blank place in the abacus. It was used to distinguish between numbers like "61"
and "3601," which the Babylonian system of written notation would otherwise represent identically. Zero is
an exceptional digit, appended to existing number systems to indicate separation or distance between known
values. Much like their disdain for rhetoric, the ancient Greeks "so despised zero that they refused to admit it
into their writings, even though they saw how useful it was." (19) It poses an exception to the rule of number,
both more and less than any other. It has extra characteristics relative to other numbers because it begins the
number system, it is also less because, unlike other digits, it has no value and does nothing to increase or
subtract from them.

   The history and development of algorithms from a mathematical system of calculations into a proprietary
technology is part of the reason why they seem to exercise a covert form of control over what we know and the
decisions we make. As rhetoric and algorithm expert Jeremy David Johnson writes,

      The alchemic mysticism of algorithms is due in large part to their opacity, hiding from view how they govern
      networked reality. Democratic governance in networked spaces seems increasingly out of reach, particularly
      as algorithmic systems become "black boxes" hidden from public view. In response to exploits and security
      concerns, and with the promise of more cash, many central tech developers have closed off the code to their
      systems. (Information Keywords 2021, 35)

Algorithms are mysterious for a number of different reasons. They originate with a system of arithmetic that
410 | CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)

seems divorced from a contemporary context in which mathematical protocols dictate how we search, find,
and consume data. They have evolved into "black box" technologies, whereby the contents of a given algorithm
is impossible to know because it a private and protected trade secret. Finally, they seem to wield secret control
over our lives because they seem to exercise an invisible influence over us, steering our attention in ways that we
do not perceive in the moment.

Contemporary scholars and scholarship define algorithms in the following way: as procedures and protocols
written in programming langauges that curate our experience of digital content. Algorithms present this
content in addictive and appealing ways while drawing their power from the aggregative power of data analysis.
They dictate how we encounter information at a variety of levels. Algorithms shape how we present ourselves
and circulate on social media platforms as well as the security of our purchases, platforms, and passwords.
According to Chris Ingraham, "algorithmic rhetoric" describes three `levels' of persuasion enabled by this
digital infrastructure.

   The macro-rhetorical level of algorithmic rhetoric "requires attention to the circulation of discourse that
contributes to elevating the status of algorithms as valuable technologies. The stakes here are epistemological,
having to do with what counts as valid knowledge claims." (70) At this level, algorithms are conceptualized in
general terms and celebrated for what they can (possibly) make known. It is a level of big claims, speculative
investments, and dangerous idealism about the digital future. As Ingraham writes, "the macro-rhetorical
invites us to think about how algorithms now "structure the planet" and come to "affect everything and
everyone," whether we know it or not." (72)
                                                                                                              CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S) | 411

The prefix "Meta" signifies "above it all." And nothing says "above it all" like Sweet Baby Ray's.

The meso-rhetorical level of algorithmic rhetoric describes the choice-making that goes into the "The meso-
rhetorical requires attention to identifying the category of technological operations we call "algorithms" as
rhetorically constituted. The stakes here are ontological, having to do with the algorithm's nature." (70) Often,
the meso-rhetorical level of algorithms is a "black box." As Frank Pasquale explains, the phrase "black box"
often has a double meaning:

      "[Black boxes] can refer to a recording device, like the data-monitoring systems in planes, trains, and cars. Or it
      can mean a system whose workings are mysterious; we can observe its inputs and outputs, but we cannot tell how
      one becomes the other. We face these two meanings daily: tracked ever more closely by firms and government,
      we have no clear idea of just how far much of this information can travel, how it is used, or its consequences.
      (The Black Box Society, p.3)

In other words, the meso-rhetorical level of algorithms describes the debates about what algorithms are, what
is or is not included within their parameters, and how much of their protocols remain hidden or secret. The
ability and correctness of employing algorithms to track and sell consumer data, for instance, would constitute
a series of choices made by programmers in the interest of defining what an algorithm is.

The micro-rhetorical level of algorithmic rhetoric concerns their impacts and effects upon audiences. "The
micro-rhetorical requires critiquing the repercussions and implications of algorithmic rhetoric in its particular
instantiations." (70) Such implications range from impacts upon communities to effects for a nation or
population. In April 2009, Amazon.com garnered public attention for mis-categorizing a large library of
literature. Cultural studies scholar Ted Striphas explains how the saga unfolded from the perspective of author
Mark R. Probst in his essay, "Algorithmic Culture":

      Hoping the matter was a simple mistake, he wrote to Amazon customer service. The agent who emailed Probst
      explained that Amazon had a policy of filtering `adult' material out of most product listings. Incensed, Probst
      posted an account of the incident on his blog in the wee hours of Easter Sunday morning, pointing out
      inconsistencies in the retailer's policy. The story was subsequently picked up by major news outlets, who traced
                                                                                                              CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S) | 413

      incidences of gay and lesbian titles disappearing from Amazon's main product list back to February 2009. In a
      press release issued on Monday afternoon, a spokesperson for Amazon attributed the fiasco to `an embarrassing
      and ham-fisted cataloging error'. More than 57,000 books had been affected in all, including not only those
      with gay and lesbian themes but also titles appearing under the headings `Health, Mind, Body, Reproductive
      and Sexual Medicine, and Erotica'. An Amazon technician working in France reportedly altered the value of a
      single database attribute - `adult' - from false to true. The change then spread globally throughout the retailer's
      network of online product catalogs, de-listing any books that had been tagged with the corresponding metadata
      (James, 2009b). This was not homophobia, Amazon insisted, but a slip-up resulting from human error amplified
      by the affordances of a technical system.

Big Data

The general term used to describe the transition to a mode of data analysis concerned with processing,
analyzing, and monetizing large volumes of information is big data. The term captures a shift in how
knowledge is defined and mobilized, one that is largely quantitative in nature and emphasizes the role of
correlations - the probabilistic association of different data points or sets - over causation - the linear, one-
after-another sequence of events in which the determinants of some phenomenon B are associated with some
initating event A. According to Viktor Mayer-Schonberger and Kenneth Cukier, the authors of the 2014
book Big Data: A Revolution that Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think,

      "big data" refers to things one can do at a large scale that cannot be done at a smaller one, to extract new insights
      or create new forms of value, in ways that change markets, organizations, the relationship between citizens and
      government, and more. (6)

It is difficult to conceive of the size and scale of "big data," or the extent to which analyzable bodies of
information have grown in the 20th and 21st centuries. The expansion of data concerns our ability to map
the universe and the genome, as well as the storage and transmission of information via commonly used search
engines like Google. It implicates events like cyberattacks, where the quantity and sensitivity of the information
that is hacked or leaked consistently increases over time. It also concerns the kinds of networks that are formed
and made possible through forms of digital connectivity, which are both employed in ways that promote
community and that foster "networks of outrage" that unravel into baseless conspiracy theories and public
violence. As rhetorical scholar Damien Pfister writes:

      These phenomena are all enabled by the underlying abundance of information that encourages the creation of
      echo chambers or filter bubbles, which, in the wake of the events of 2016, have been understood as sites where
      "alternative facts" have ushered in "post- truth" politics. The anxieties around this outburst of proto- fascist
      emotion are warranted at the same time that they may be somewhat misplaced: truth has always been slipperier
      than philosophers and politicians have assumed, and today's neo- fascist revival can be traced to liberalism's latest
      crisis as a public philosophy and a widening rich/poor gap as much as information abundance. (Information
      Keywords 2021, 27)
414 | CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view

                     Sometimes, a large quantity of information leads nowhere in particular.
   The `bigness' of big data is also connected to rhetoric in other ways, namely through the
terms megethos and copia. These terms describe how speech may create the impression of tremendous size or
volume.
   The term megethos describes how rhetoric creates the impression of tremendous importance or magnitude.
In his 1998 article, "Sizing Things Up," rhetorical scholar Thomas Farrell claims that "magnitude has to do
with gravity, the enormity, the weightiness of what is enacted, a sense of significance that may be glimpsed and
recognized by others." Megethos is what lends this gravitas to events, speech, and language. It is an aesthetic
or presentational form that is traditionally focused on vision and what can (or cannot) be properly `taken
in' at a glance. One example of megethos is the framing and reporting of "mega-leaks," whereby huge troves
of information are released into public. In the case of the Panama Papers released by the International
Consortium of Investigative Journalists, megethos consisted in the sheer volume of the documentation. In
2016, Lisa Lynch and David Levine explained this "mega-leaking" in the following way:

      The Panama papers consisted of "11.5 million files covering 40 years' worth of transactions from over 14,000
      law firms, banks and incorporation agencies that had hired the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca to assist
      in creating offshore companies for purposes of tax avoidance. ... Though the documents were not released en
      masse, a total of 400 journalists from 76 countries pored through them using a purpose-built database and a
      customized social network that allowed them to communicate their findings securely. During the course of the
      investigation, which took over a year, all the journalists and their media outlets respected an embargo agreement
      that kept their findings secret until a pre-arranged collective deadline. (1)

As the authors also argue, the mega-leak is double-sided. On the one hand, it promotes a kind of openness
and accountability that would have been impossible in earlier times, creating a site for transparency and public
oversight. On the other hand, it also means that the "trove of information" that comes with mega-leaks has
no pre-determined system or agency of analysis. Instead, "search and analysis functions fall to the public,"
making the significance of huge information archives difficult to assess and slow to reach a wider global public's
attention.

   Copia is a rhetorical term that describes the strategic creation of size through a pattern of repetition. It is a
way of generating an impression of size or magnitude by enumerating all of a given object's features, so much
so that it is apparent to the reader or audience that there is still more to tell about the topic that has not yet
been enumerated. Copia describes endless, limitless plenitude, a kind of "whole" or "totality" that is alluded
to but never perceived. When, for instance, the historian and philosopher Michel Foucault (1970) describes
                                                                                                              CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S) | 415

the creation of new knowledge in medieval Europe, he calls this information "plethoric and poverty-stricken."
Although there was a lot of information, it was un-searchable and disorganized due to the protocols used to
generate it. Sometimes, copia is described as a way to account for the rhetorical power of lists, which may make
compelling arguments through a gratuitous enumeration of a given topic, performing magnitude through an
excess of detail. A famous example is Francois Rabelais's 16th-century text, Gargantua and Pantagruel, which
makes significant use of this trope.
416 | CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)
                                                                                                              CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S) | 417

The title-page of a 1532 edition of "Pantagruel." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargantua_and_Pantagruel

As rhetorical scholar Thomas Conley (1985) explains in his article, "The Beauty of Lists: Copia and
Argument,"

      In a similar way, the "treatise" on the virtues of the herb "Pantagruelion" amplifies the stock epidectic topoi:
      first, a careful and detailed description of its appearance, its usefulness, ways of preparing it, and its inestimable
      virtues, both quotidian and those of the grander sort; then, famous incidents in history, both real and mythical,
      in which it played an important part; its role in the achievements of human ingenuity; its fortitude and strength;
      comparisons with other plants and with the gods and goddesses themselves, all documented with references to
      Pliny, Theophrastus, Galen, and various Arabian writers. "Pantagruelion," of course, is hemp. The praise of
      Pantagruelion, that is, is an extended encomium on "rope." (98)

Another famous example of copia comes from the famous courtroom scene of a 1944 noir film, Double
Indemnity. During the scene, detective Keyes questions an expert witness, Mr. Norton, the owner of the
Pacific All Risk Insurance Company. Keyes's line of questioning, copied below, seeks to undermine Mr.
Norton's assumption that the claim is invalid due to the circumstances of a suspicious death:

                                    Copia verborum in the film Double Indemnity

      You've never read an actuarial table in your life, have you? Why there are ten volumes on suicide alone. Suicide:
      by race, by color, by occupation, by sex, by season of the year, by time of day. Suicide, how committed: by poison,
      by firearms, by drowning, by leaps. Suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison, such as corrosives, irritants
      , systemic gases, narcotics, alkaloids, proteins, and so forth. Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high places
      , under the wheels of trains, under the wheels of trucks, under the feet o f horses, under steamboats. But, Mr.
      Norton, of all the cases on record, there's not one single case of suicide by someone jumping off the back end of
      a moving train. (also cited in Joan Copjec, Read My Desire, p.164)

The questioning relies on the copia trope because it provides a list of information as a kind of rhetorical proof
that Mr. Norton's suspicions are unfounded. By enumerating all of the different ways that the insurance
company has quantified and categorized risk, Keyes arrives at the conclusion that Norton's proposed
explanation of events is highly improbable. In keeping with the theme of "the more things change the more
they stay the same," rhetorical vocabularies function today as in the past. Terms like megethos and copia help to
distinguish between the kinds of magnitude and the `bigness' of big data.
418 | CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)

Part 3: Digital Dystopia and Algorithms of
Oppression

The digital situation is particularly representative of the way that rhetorical modes of communication can
uphold existing hierarchies of power while also claiming to be wholly new or different from what has come
before. This is especially the case with racist computer engineering terms, the way that optical technologies are
designed for white skin pigmentation (such as this widely reported racist soap dispenser), and the regressive
gender dynamics of Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Assistants (AI/VA) commonly used in the home and
workplace. Taken together, these aspects of the digital situation illustrate how the unbridled optimism for
what technologies can or might do to create a better world is a flawed perspective. Key critics of digital
technology insist that manufacturers and consumers take into account the structural inequalities that inhabit
new and digitally organized systems of communication.

Problems with Racist Computational Metaphors

One significant problem with the terminology used to designate computer hardware and software is that it
carries the residue (or skeuomorph) of racist distinctions used to segregate and distinguish between differently
raced populations. A key problem is that this terminology is often presumed to be neutral and objective, in the
sense that these names denote components and processes and are not intentionally discriminatory. However,
this language still carries a destructive and dehumanizing force even if those who employ the terminology have
forgotten or choose to ignore their original significations.

      In June [2020], against the backdrop of the Black Lives Matter protests, engineers at social media platforms,
      coding groups, and international standards bodies re-examined their code and asked themselves: Was it racist?
      Some of their databases were called "masters" and were surrounded by "slaves," which received information
      from the masters and answered queries on their behalf, preventing them from being overwhelmed. Others used
      "whitelists" and "blacklists" to filter content.

Ultimately, a core issue is that existing terminologies flippantly reference historical dynamics of oppression as
metaphors for the ways that storage and retrieval devices are organized, or otherwise, repeat a longstanding bias
that associates "whiteness" with virtuous activity while consigning "Blackness" to the opposite. This kind of
terminology supports unconscious biases and registers as a kind of linguistic violence because it implies that
such distinctions are not serious or should be ignored when they are, in fact, deeply impactful.

   A related criticism of these kinds of terminologies is that the effort to rename is good, but does not go
far enough. Whereas corporations like Google and Intel have committed to more inclusive language and
naming practices, this linguistic `fix' does not necessarily address the deeper structural issues of representation
and discrimination that are a part of Silicon Valley's corporate culture. One example is Timnit Gebru's
                                                                                                              CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S) | 419

expulsion from Google following her letter concerning the racial biases of the optical face-recognition artificial
intelligence being developed at the company. According to Gebru, the company's reluctance to acknowledge
the racist problems with its technology went beyond language choices or even facial recognition alone. The
letter signaled that the larger environment of Silicon Valley characteristically espoused anti-racist values while
producing technologies that reinforced existing racial biases. According to the MIT Technology Review:

      On December 2, 2020, Timnit Gebru, the co-lead of Google's ethical AI team, announced via Twitter that the
      company had forced her out.

      Gebru, a widely respected leader in AI ethics research, is known for coauthoring a groundbreaking paper that
      showed facial recognition to be less accurate at identifying women and people of color, which means its use can
      end up discriminating against them. She also cofounded the Black in AI affinity group, and champions diversity
      in the tech industry. The team she helped build at Google is one of the most diverse in AI and includes many
      leading experts in their own right. Peers in the field envied it for producing critical work that often challenged
      mainstream AI practices.

      Online, many other leaders in the field of AI ethics are arguing that the company pushed her out because of the
      inconvenient truths that she was uncovering about a core line of its research--and perhaps its bottom line. More
      than 1,400 Google staff members and 1,900 other supporters have also signed a letter of protest.

In other words, the metaphors used to describe computational technologies (e.g. "white-hats" and "black-
hats") are a symptom of a deeper, structural problem in which the terminology and the function of digital
technologies work to uphold conditions of structural inequality. Changing the language is a crucial step to
changing these beliefs, but it is not sufficient to see just how deeply rooted and widespread racism is within
contexts of digital design.

Problems with Programmed Gender Dynamics

Gender is represented by digital technologies such as the "virtual assistant," which reproduces relational
expectations where women are assigned submissive or subordinate social roles. In "Asking more of Siri and
Alexa," digital rhetoric scholar Heather Woods explains how Apple, Amazon, and other corporations reinforce
regressive expectations about femininity and servitude by using voices and encouraging communicative
patterns where technologies - many of which have a distinctly feminine voice as a default setting. Artificial
Intelligence/Virtual Assistant technologies do the work of "digital domesticity," which "mobilizes traditional,
conservative values of homemaking, care-taking, and administrative "pink-collar" labor. By making artificial
intelligence-based products in the image of such traditionalist roles, the digital situation reproduces
"stereotypical feminine roles in the service of augmenting surveillance capitalism." Virtual assistants are sold as
a matter of consumer choice, being sold on the belief that the technology will enable them to do more things
or free themselves from burden by spending money. However, these technologies often work the other way.
420 | CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S)

By collecting user information for future monetization, virtual assistants also serve the financial goals of the
company that manufactured it.

   The unique rhetorical term that Woods lends to the feminine personification of AI/VA is persona. When
rhetoric is understood as speech, persona refers to the constitution of an audience through the intentional
choices of the speaker. Woods describes persona as a kind of mask, "a communicative strategy for imagining the
self and the audience as connected in a particular, shared way."

      The domestic sphere is one theater in which femininity has undergone technologically-mediated modifications
      whilst mobilizing traditional performances of persona. New arrangements of domesticity at once rely upon
      stereotypical identities of femininity while slightly altering them (White, 2015, p. 19). The concept of "digital
      domesticity" has been used by scholars to describe the re-articulation of "prototypical motherhood" (Chen,
      2013, p. 511) in the blogosphere and, more generally, domesticity has served as a key organizing metaphor for the
      rise of "smart homes" (Spigel, 2001). Chen's study of "mommy bloggers" demonstrates how possibly liberatory
      practices (namely: blogging about personal experiences of mothering) are disciplined by constraining language
      practices. This foreclosure of radical politics constitutes a reentry into what Chen calls "digital domesticity,"
      characterized by traditional norms of stereotypical femininity. As implied by the term, digital domesticity
      signifies the reworking of femininity through technological mediation.

The "particular, shared connection" invoked by AI/VA is one that should remind us of a long history in
which feminine-presenting persons occupy a de facto subordinate role. Because the default settings of AI/VA
are vocally feminized, programs like Siri and Alexa perpetuate this hegemonic and repressive way of thinking.
However, AI/VA also cultivates unequal forms of gender relationality as a way to generate capital, enriching
the technology companies who profit from the user's intimate relationship with the virtual product. If AI/VA
is imagined as a proprietary profit-generating surveillance device, then it is one that is purchased by choice on
the promises of relief and the technology's relationship to its users.

Problems with Unequal Digital Infrastructures

The third collection of problems with profit-forward digital platforms and technologies concerns the effects
that they have at a wider population level. According to media scholar Zeynep Tufecki, the consumer-forward
focus of digital technologies means that ethical considerations often fall to the side in favor of imagining new
ways to get more clicks and likes. As a consequence of this kind of design, technology companies ignore the
potentially addictive qualities of their digital environments, preying on people who are vulnerable to gambling
                                                                                                              CHAPTER 18: DIGITAL RHETORIC(S) | 421

or are unaware of how to keep their information secure. As Tufecki argues, digital platforms are "persuasion
architectures," updated forms of familiar information systems like check-out counters and automated roadside
speedometers. However, unlike these earlier forms of technology, newer digital platforms seek out exploitable
psychological weaknesses on the part of consumers in the effort to turn a profit.

The problems with digital infrastructures also run significantly deeper, particularly when we consider the
default assumptions that search engines encourage and reinforce. In Algorithms of Oppression, digital media
scholar Safiya Umoja Noble describes the way that Google's allegedly neutral search platform reinscribes
destructive gender roles through the "pornification" of women and girls - in other words - encouraging search
results that reduce people to sexualized commodities. In the process, search engines also erase realistic and
professional representations of women, Black people, and immigrant populations. Rather than prioritizing a
social or public good, "Google biases search to its own economic interests - for its profitability and to bolster
its market dominance at any expense" (27) As Noble explains:

      Knowledge of the technical aspects of search and retrieval, in terms of critiquing the computer programming
      code that underlies the systems, is absolutely necessary to have a profound impact on these systems.
      Interventions such as Black Girls Code, an organization focused on teaching young, African American girls to
      program, is the kind of intervention we see building in response to the ways Black women have been locked
      out of Silicon Valley venture capital and broader participation. Simultaneously, it is important for the public,
      particularly people who are marginalized - such as women and girls and people of color - to be critical of the
      results that purport to represent them in the first ten to twenty results in a commercial search engine. They
      do not have the economic, political, and social capital to withstand the consequences of misrepresentation.
      If one holds a lot of power, one can withstand or buffer misrepresentation at a group level and often at the
      individual level. Marginalized and oppressed people are linked to the status of their group and are less likely to
      be afforded individual status and insulation from the experiences of the groups with which they are identified.
      The political nature of search demonstrates how algorithms are a fundamental invention of computer scientists
      who are human beings - and code is a langauge full of meaning and applied in varying ways to different types of
      information. Certainly, women and people of color could benefit tremendously from becoming programmers
      and building alternative search engines that are less disturbing and that reflect and prioritize a wider range of
      informational needs and perspectives (Algorithms of Oppression, 25-26).

SHORT PAPER 1: THE ENCOMIUM

The encomium is one way that we can try to understand the sophists' way of understanding rhetoric as a
way of creating or constituting social reality. Sometimes the sophists' creation of a shared fantasy is described
as a "deception," in which the speaker misleads the audience into believing false information. Other scholars
have claimed that what the sophists did was not "deception," but rather that they "[placed] all possible
representations of reality on equal epistemological footing," creating the opportunity to compare different
kinds of knowledge. (2001, 58-59).

   Why did Helen even need to be rescued in the Encomium? Because it was a popular and misogynistic myth
among the Greeks that Helen had been the `cause' of the Trojan war. They attributed the start of the war
specifically to the fact that Helen, wife to Menelaus, had been taken by Paris of Troy immediately after the
Trojans and Greeks had signed a peace treaty.

   The Encomium of Helen "rescues" Helen from this blame, but it does so in a way is itself deeply
misogynistic, that is, in a way that also reduces her freedom or agency. By Gorgias' account, Helen is a passive
object who cannot be made to assume responsibility for a path she could not herself have chosen. Helen is
redeemed, in his eyes, because she can be made a non-agent; she cannot be responsible for her actions because
her only option was to acquiesce to more powerful forces.

      "either by will of fate and decision of the gods and vote of Necessity did she do what she did, or by force reduced,
      or by words seduced, or by love possessed."

The encomium of Helen is both a rescue of Helen and a rescue of rhetoric. If the speech can rescue Helen, it
shows something about the way that words can create a shared social reality, how rhetoric can move people and
constitute a new common sense.

   Assignment Instructions
   For this assignment, students should compose a 2-page long encomium that performs a rescue of a topic that
has been disparaged or ignored and that deserves a new or fresh take. Encomiums can range from the serious to
the comedic; they can seek to shed light on serious conditions of social inequality or injustice or, alternatively,
they can give a boost to a celebrity, job, or hobby that is usually ridiculed as unserious or eccentric. I have
provided examples of each I encourage students to research their encomia, which should include a bibliography
or works cited of 3-5 sources. If students are seeking a template for how to organize their ideas, please consider
the materials provided below.

 1. Select your topic on the basis of its legitimately unfair public treatment or its relative inconspicuousness.
428 | SHORT PAPER 1: THE ENCOMIUM

 2. Establish the popular reasons why this topic has been scrutinized, how it has been judged, and why such
      judgments were rendered.

 3. Finally, systematically refute these reasons by placing your subject in the best possible light.

***Observations and Advice***

 A. Be sure to provide sufficient information to justify the fact that the topic has been "unfairly disparaged"
      (underrated, minimized, trivialized, belittled, undervalued). Just because it's your favorite (movie,
      restaurant, band) does not mean it's been treated unfairly. Similarly, "everyone knows that X is bad" does
      not provide adequate grounding for celebrating the topic. This is where you may need additional
      evidence. This completes only half of what the encomium is: proving that the topic has been disparaged,
      and then rescuing it.

 B. Evidence can be used (a) to show that the topic has been unfairly treated and (b) to show what is
      redeeming or worthy of reconsideration. I've also gotten questions about a few topics that are too
      specific, such that there doesn't seem to be much evidence to support it. For example, if you're rescuing
      an underused hashtag, there may not be a lot out there. The solution in such cases is to broaden the
      topic as appropriate. Instead of rescuing one film that did poorly at the box office, rescue films that do
      poorly at the box office. That opens a range of examples and evidence.

 C. The assignment asks for "credible" evidence, which may seem like an ambiguous term. Credible means
      that it comes from a source that has some authority on the subject. It means that you can consider a
      wide range of sources, including newspapers, magazines, news organizations, widely circulated blogs,
      academic sources, advertisements, speeches, even social media. If you'd like to cite a reddit thread or a
      tweet with a LOT of likes that makes your point, be my guest. For the purposes of this assignment,
      credible means that shouldn't be the main or only evidence that you provide in the paper.

 D. Be careful not to interpret "encomium" as "satire." Instead of truly rescuing a topic, some encomiums
      from previous semesters only pretended to rescue a topic while, in fact, roasting (or insulting) it.
      Unfortunately, the absence of a rescue (i.e. if it is only a "rescue" in scare quotes or sarcastically) means
      that it is not an encomium. An encomium is different than satire because it sets out reasons that
      something has been disparaged or `beat up' and then systematically rescues this person, object, or idea
      from this bad reputation. This is the gist of the Encomium of Helen as well as the examples considered
      in class/the assignment document, which rescue people or ideas that have gotten bad press and deserve a
      second look (immigrant refugees, heelys, etc.). An encomium works if the speaker's/writer's reasons for
      rescuing the topic convincingly address the arguments against it. With satire, the speaker takes on a
      disingenuous role that is meant to mock or insult the person, object, or idea represented. A satire works
      if the audience is in on the speaker's/writier's ruse and can successfully understand the speech or writing
                                                                                                             SHORT PAPER 1: THE ENCOMIUM | 429

    as a criticism of the topic.
E. As mentioned above, a key problem with the encomium speech is that the "rescue" doesn't match the

    "reputation" described. This common issue describes an imbalance in the speech. This imbalance can
    happen in at least two ways.
     A. The blame can be so egregious or overwhelming that a rescue isn't possible. This is when the

          "negative" part of the speech outweighs its "positive" redemption. Someone may pick a topic for
          which a bad reputation has been rightly earned but the "rescue" simply doesn't address the
          reputation or tries to present new information that does not seek to change the reader's perspective
          on what we already know. For example, a celebrity who gained an early advantage because they are
          wealthy cannot be redeemed by claiming they are "good at performing" because the rescue doesn't
          match up with the accusation.
     B. The wish to rescue can be so overwhelming that it is difficult to find negative aspects of the topic.
          The rescue may be about someone or something that the author really likes but then the "blame"
          may be nonexistent or imagined. This is the "fanny pack" problem: many folks might really, really
          like fanny packs and argue that they're coming `back in style' or that they are unfairly disparaged.
          But there must be evidence that the fanny pack is or was unpopular -- which may be hard to come
          by. There might not be sufficient evidence that they have been disparaged or the author may just
          presume that they have a bad reputation. Ultimately, you also have to prove that a negative opinion
          about the object or item exists.
F. As a final guideline, there are topics we should refuse to rescue, especially when the "rescue" is made for
    the sake of provocation or entails a justification of racism, sexism, misogyny, xenophobia, violence, or
    other offensive premises (e.g. the `rescue' of the glass ceiling). Submissions seeking to rescue such
    principles will receive a failing grade. Students may reach out to Prof. Hallsby directly if you have any
    further questions regarding the earned grade for this assignment if the submitted paper falls into this
    category.

Encomium Activity 2: Name, Explain, Prove, Conclude.

For this activity, we will break into small groups to generate topics for the encomium paper and provide
feedback that will help narrow the topic and develop new claims. My hope is that it starts you on the path to a
well-developed topic.

 1. Begin by creating a list of topics generated by the group. Perhaps you have already decided on a topic.
      Perhaps you need an opportunity to idea-test something that you've been working with but aren't sure
      about. Perhaps you don't have a sense of what you want to write about. Start with the topics that folks
      have already decided upon, then brainstorm other topics with the group.

 2. Go through the narrowing process: is the topic too broad or too narrow? In class, we talked about
      "fashion" as being a topic that was too broad and "an under-noticed release by a favorite artist on
      SoundCloud" as too narrow. Ultimately, each essay will have to find reasons why the topic has received
      an unfairly negative reputation and then redeem your topic from this criticism.

 3. Separate the thesis from the supporting arguments. How would you phrase an encomium thesis for
      each of the topics? What are the supporting claims? Think about the research-heavy arguments of the
      essay in the following way (but not necessarily this order):
       1. What are the arguments or attitudes against the topic? What evidence is there that this opinion
432 | SHORT PAPER 1: THE ENCOMIUM

            exists? Why does this/their opinion matter?
       2. What are the corresponding positive arguments? Does each of the claims that stands in favor of the

            topic match up with one of the arguments or attitudes against it? How does the positive argument
            overcome the negative claim against it?
 4. Brainstorm evidence for arguments a and b. Who are opinion leaders on this topic? What are
      authoritative sources? Why are these sources the most respected, widely accepted, or authoritative on
      this topic? Can you explain this relevance when you cite this source?
 5. Take some time to organize your claims

  · Name it: what is the supporting argument?
  · Explain it: describe its significance or connection to the larger thesis.
  · Prove it: cite your key evidence
  · Conclude it: what's the connection between the evidence and thesis, summarize the `take-away'

Overview on Topical Organization of Speeches/Essays

How to organize an Encomium main point about Jorts, or jean-shorts.

 1. Name it: Despite their reputation, jorts are an environmentally friendly option.
 2. Explain it: Jorts extend the lifespan of worn jeans by giving them a second life.
 3. Prove it: The past two years, I have not had to buy or throw away any shorts.
 4. Conclude it: Jorts are a long-lasting option that don't end up in the landfill.

Stasis Theory

 2. The meaning of the issue (definition) Can we agree on the topic?
 3. The seriousness of the issue (quality) So what, who cares?
 4. The plan of action (policy). What do we do next? How do we do it?

Speech in Defense

 1. Proem (preface or preamble), exordium (introduction), and argument (thesis).
 2. Narratio, upon which all opposed sides likely agree.

 3. Determine sections for cutting and unnecessary language.
 4. Assess whether the different sections are balanced .

Topic/Organization Example

Generate Topic Ideas: Vaccination, Medicine, Popular and public responses to infectious diseases, historical
events related to medical discoveries.

   Narrow Your Topic:

  · Unclear: Vaccinations
  · Vague: The History of Cholera
  · Specific: The Great Stinks of 1880 and 1858

Main and Supporting Arguments:

  · Main Argument: The Great Stink of 1880 in Paris and the Great Stink of 1858 in London have the
      reputation of, well being smelly and unpleasant times. But they also coincided with important
      developments in the history of medicine and popular culture.
          Supporting Argument 1: For example, the Stinks coincided with a turning point in the history of
            medicine when people ceased to believe that diseases were transmitted by smell and instead began
            to understand that it was transmitted by germs.
          Supporting Argument 2: Another reason why the Great Stink was important is that it was also part
            of the way that perfume became popularized in the modern era. With great need comes great
            demand!

Evidence for your Claims:

  · Evidence for Supporting Argument 1: According to historian David S. Barnes, the "Great Stink" of Paris
      occurred at a time when the science of medicine was changing, but popular opinion had yet to change
      with it. People still believed that infectious disease was transmitted through smell, as they had during the
      medieval "plague" or "black death".

  · Evidence for Supporting Argument 2: Additionally, although there is no proven cause/effect relationship
434 | SHORT PAPER 1: THE ENCOMIUM

      between the mass availability of perfume and the great stink of 1880, Eugénie Briot explains that the
      production and distribution of perfumes in France expanded dramatically in the last two decades of the
      19th century.

Now, Name it, Explain it, Prove it, and Conclude it:

Supporting Argument 1:

  · Name it: (from above) The Stinks coincided with a turning point in the history of medicine when
      people ceased to believe that diseases were transmitted by smell and instead began to understand that it
      was transmitted by germs.

  · Explain it: Whereas pre-enlightenment understandings of disease explained their in terms of "putrid
      odors" or "decaying smells," the development of germ theory throughout the 1900s posited that
      organisms caused infection, creating new courses of treatment.

  · Prove it: (from above) According to historian David S. Barnes, the "Great Stink" of Paris occurred at a
      time when the science of medicine was changing, but popular opinion had yet to change with it. People
      still believed that infectious disease was transmitted through smell, as they had during the medieval
      "plague" or "black death".

  · Conclude it: Even though the Stinks, well, stunk, they still are important for the way that they mark an
      important transformation in the history of medical knowledge.

Supporting Argument 2:

  · Name it: (from above) Another reason why the Great Stink was important is that it was also part of the
      way that perfume became popularized in the modern era. With great need comes great demand!

  · Explain it: Paris is historically significant for originating modern perfumery, which is often thought to
      be a marker of elevated status or class, when in fact it also had a very practical role in creating a
      breathable space around the wearer.

  · Prove it (from above) Although there is no proven cause/effect relationship between the mass
      availability of perfume and the great stink of 1880, Eugénie Briot explains that the production and
      distribution of perfumes in France expanded dramatically in the last two decades of the 19th century.

  · Conclude it: Today, we may wonder why someone's perfume or cologne is so strong. But back in the
      1880s, these strong, musty smells kept the big Stink at bay.

Encomium Activity 3: Workshop for Short Paper 1

About this activity: Today we will collaboratively `grade' two examples of encomia to think about how to edit
and improve the speeches/essays you have started to write. We will also break into groups so that you might
share your developed ideas with others in the class.

How is the Encomium Graded?

The rubric includes the following grading criteria. You should use the criteria for the introduction,
organization, and examples to guide your break-out discussion. The criteria below are graded on the following
scale (2 = Excellent/Exceptionally Clear; 1.6 = Satisfactory/Clear; 1.2 = Unsatisfactory/Unclear; 0 = content
missing)

  · Introduction: The introduction contains a clear attention getting device, thesis, purpose, and preview
      statement. The thesis specifically offers a "rescue" of the topic at hand.

  · Organization: The topic sentences of the body paragraphs clearly relate to the thesis and reflect the
      mission of the encomium to "rescue" a disparaged topic.

  · Examples: The essay offers well-cited examples in their rescue of the concept(s), people, or object(s)
      defined in the essay. These examples also support the "rescue" of the central topic, or otherwise establish
      that the topic has been unfairly disparaged.

  · Clarity of Writing: The essay has a clear `flow' from beginning to end, is clearly proofread and contains
      minimal typographical or grammatical errors.

Encomium Sample 1 (for class evaluation purposes)

Athens is a small town known for some great things: the music, the downtown scene, the culture, and the
history. But what is something that Athens is really known for? Their food; the local restaurants that people
come from all over to eat and experience. One of these amazing restaurants that is overlooked is the delicious
Chinese restaurant, Happy China. People need to stop going to these overrated and boring restaurants in
Athens. It's time people experienced Happy China's buffet because their low prices, their atmosphere, and
their service all get a C- rating on Yelp.

   The prices are low cost but there is SO much food. First of all, a meal is only $4.99 there.. That means you
can go through the buffet 10 times and still only pay $4.99 for your entire meal. Sure you may not fit into your
pants when you walk out, but you will be full for days. There are even 4 different serving bars, 2 for hot foods,
1 for cold food, and 1 for dessert. The chicken and egg rolls may upset your stomach/make you nauseous but
that is completely normal, you just need a few practice visits to the restaurant.

   As many of you know Athens really is known for their 5star and diverse restaurants. But people still need to
give these 2 star restaurants a chance, they have so much to offer too.. sure their food, atmosphere, and service
may not be up to par but they do serve food. Happy China is the closest thing Athens has to real-authentic
Chinese cuisine, despite it's low quality food, atmosphere, and service it is NOT to be avoided. It's located on
Broad Street, so next time you're downtown don't go to those restaurants everyone's always talking about, go
to Happy China!

While libraries have been around for many years, in today's society they are extremely under-appreciated, and
are not given the praise they deserve. Public libraries have provided everyone from kids to adults with resources
438 | SHORT PAPER 1: THE ENCOMIUM

for a long time, however, many of these magnificent sources of knowledge are dying out because people are
forgetting how useful they truly are. Since the creation of the internet, libraries have received unfair treatment
because people would rather search something up on Google and hope they have accessed a credible source,
than go to their local library and have a guaranteed credible source. Libraries have always been a place you could
rely on to find resources for school papers, but they also have other resources that can be fun for everyone too.
Libraries are underrated because people do not take advantage of the movies for rent, the equipment for rent,
and the impact they have on our historical record.

   I believe that libraries are treated unfairly, because they have so many amazing resources that people disregard
simply because they are viewed as old fashioned. Libraries are viewed as being for old people because the
younger generations have the internet, and they feel like libraries are inefficient and useless. People do not see a
need for libraries because they have cell phones and laptops that have access to the internet. Because kids today
have access to the internet, they feel like libraries no longer have a real purpose. Young people today are taught
that they have access to all the information in the world, and because of that they feel that libraries are now
unnecessary (Jackson, Peter). In the same vein, many people feel that because they have all of the information
they could possibly need on the internet it is inefficient to do research in libraries because it is a waste of time
to look through all of the books in libraries. Most people also feel that libraries are useless now because a lot of
information of important findings and events are now stored online, and because they are stored online, we no
longer need to keep a physical record of that information anymore.

   There are also many reasons why libraries are important and underappreciated. There are many reasons
that libraries are incredible resources that are undervalued, and reasons why more people should be taking
advantage of all that they have to offer. Libraries contain a multitude of valuable resources, with credible
information that can be used for many things, from research papers to broaden your perspective of the world.
When going to the library there is no need to worry that the source you are gathering information from was
written by an author, who did not research well. Every book in libraries went through revision to be checked
to make sure it was created appropriately, and this is why more people in schools need to take more advantage
of the libraries. Another reason libraries should be more appreciated is because they have more than just books.
There are a lot of different things you can rent in libraries from movies to equipment like VHS players and slide
projectors (Bowen, Mercury). These resources are even more forgotten than the books that libraries are known
for. Renting movies can be a great economic choice for people who do not have the money to pay for all of the
different streaming platforms you need to have today, just to see some older movies. I also think that there is
not enough emphasis on what libraries do for maintaining our records of the past. Many people miss out on all
of the other amazing resources that libraries have that aren't books, like movies and equipment.

   I believe that libraries deserve more credit for all of the resources they have, and the service of maintaining
our record of history by just having the large resources of information about the past that it contains. Libraries
deserve better, and more people need to realize how useful they are.

Sample Encomium

Attention-Getting Device: In 1942, FDR marred the United States' reputation by beginning an internment
program for Japanese Americans, allegedly as a "protective measure." On November 18, 2015, Roanoake
mayor David Bowers argued that "President Franklin D. Roosevelt felt compelled to sequester Japanese foreign
nationals after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and it appears that the threat of harm to America from ISIS now
is just as real and serious as that from our enemies then." Bower is not alone. He and others have noted that
refugees pose a terroristic threat - inviting the enemy into our own hopes.

   The attention getting device offers an opportunity to include a citation.
   Thesis: What you're putting into the essay. But in spite of the negative publicity that migrants and
refugees have received in the United States, I will argue that these people deserve to be rescued - from political
violence and from the violence of language.
   Purpose: What your audience should get out of the essay. By the end of this essay, I hope my audience
will reconsider how they talk about `refugees,' and begin to approach this important topic with compassion
rather than fear.
   Preview: In this essay, I will address two misconceptions that will "rescue" the emigrating refugee from
the unfair reputation that they have received: first, I will address the false belief that refugees are or may
be terrorists, and second, that the incorrect assumption that refugees are "swarms" of people who threaten
America's borders.
   Main Point 1: Refugees from other nations are very unlikely to be terrorists.

· Evidence that shows people describing refugees as terrorists, threat, etc.
· Evidence that shows why these descriptions are false, exaggerated, etc.

Main Point 2: Characterizing refugees as "swarms" makes hatred toward minoritized migrants in the United
States more likely

· Evidence that shows people describing refugees as "swarms" alongside rhetoric that describes how we
   need to secure our borders provokes public violence.

· Evidence that shows how this hurts, and does not help, the United States' relationship with other
   nations.

[These main points would be developed in greater detail in a fully-written-out encomium essay, and would also be
supported by external evidence cited in the works cited/bibliography.]

   Review: In this essay, I have addressed two misconceptions: first, that refugees are or may be terrorists, and
second, that characterizing refugees as "swarms" helps us to secure our borders.

   Purpose: I have done so in the hopes of quelling irrational fears about refugees, and to urge an alternative
way of thinking about these people in need.
440 | SHORT PAPER 1: THE ENCOMIUM

   Thesis: As I have argued, these people deserve to be rescued - from the violence of the Middle East and
from the violence of Americans' language.

   AGD: As for David Bowers, on November 20th, 2015 he apologized for his earlier remarks, saying that
he did not anticipate the international attention that his comments would bring. But Bowers' apology is not
enough. What we need is fewer apologies and more compassion - as well as a willingness to see refugees for
what they are: people.

   Like the introduction, the conclusion is an opportunity for 1-2 citations supporting your argument.

SHORT PAPER 2: ANNOTATION
ASSIGNMENT

For this assignment, students will read and annotate an academic essay from rhetorical studies. You should
write up your short paper in the style of a detailed annotation that should answer the following questions. The
answers may be bulleted or numbered. Students should focus on fully answering each of the questions rather
than providing a narrative flow. This exercise is intended to model (1) the practice of reading academic essays
in rhetorical studies and (2) creating notes and annotations to help recall the important or salient points.

  · Please keep your short paper 2 assignment to no more than 2 pages (not including the bibliography of
      works cited).

  · Please do not turn in a marked up copy of the academic article.
  · Please number your answers. Additionally, I would like folks to either restate each numbered question as

      part of the answer or to begin each answer with the numbered question in their document. This will
      help your graders to keep track of which question you are answering.

Requirements/Prompts to Answer:

       1. What is the central claim/assertion/thesis of the essay? This statement should reflect the
            author's core assertion about how rhetoric functions in the cases described in the article.

       2. What is the author's definition of rhetoric? Based on context clues and citations in the
            essay, how is rhetoric being defined?** Your answer should make clear why this definition is the
            best fit, possibly making reference to the way that the word rhetoric is used in the article. You may
            also want to draw upon the definitions of rhetoric we have considered over the semester and justify
            why this definition fits with the understanding of rhetoric provided in the essay.

       3. Based on the units we've considered in this class, how does the author understand
            rhetorical criticism? What is the ultimate purpose of the essay? Your answer should make
            clear the unique advantage of doing criticism using rhetorical terminology. What does rhetorical
            criticism do? What should the reading audience of this article learn?
              1. According to the author, the value of rhetorical analysis is that it ...
                    1. Explains how persuasion works in the context of [gun violence; conspiracy theories;
                        twitter celebrities]
                    2. Unveils the way that power works in spaces that are supposedly equal, accessible, and
                        democratic.
442 | SHORT PAPER 2: ANNOTATION ASSIGNMENT

                    3. Allows us to understand the effects/impacts of speech for a specific audience.
       4. What elements of the author's theory or analysis are uniquely rhetorical? Are there any

            specific key terms or words that mark the theory or contribution that qualify it as
            "rhetoric"? I recommend looking for the specialized rhetoric vocabulary in the article that
            resonate with or appear in the content from the textbook or the supplemental readings for the
            course. Make sure you draw attention to the rhetorical terms that appear in the article and then
            explain how they fit into a larger conception or definition of rhetoric (such as that provided in
            question 2).
       5. Who is the author in conversation with? Who are the people that the author cites the
            most, builds upon, or takes issue with?** Look at who the author is citing to build their
            argument about rhetoric. Whose work do they build upon in the sense of adding concepts,
            terminology, or detail to an existing argument or literature? Alternatively, who do they disagree
            with and whose ideas do they wish to revise?
       6. What does the author contribute to this conversation? What is it that they bring in the
            way of a new idea, concept, terminology, or kind of analysis? What is the difference that this
            article seeks to make in terms of adding new knowledge to a conversation about rhetoric? Is it a
            theoretical addition, in the sense of new concepts, terms, ideas, or frameworks? Is it a topical
            addition, in the sense that a set of existing concepts, terms, ideas, and frameworks may be stretched
            to explain new cases that have not been heretofore considered?
       7. What are other key terms not already mentioned in annotations 1-6 that are especially
            important to understanding this essay? Why were they important to the overall meaning
            of the essay? Without repeating earlier questions, look to words that were challenging to you in
            your reading but which seemed important for understanding the overall meaning of the article.
            What additional terms beyond those already mentioned did you need to look up? How are they
            related to the central understanding of rhetoric in the essay?
       8. How might the essay help us to understand circumstances beyond those described in the
            essay? Draw upon a specific example that this framework might help to illuminate that goes
            beyond what is contained in the essay. If you were to draw upon the ideas of rhetoric developed in
            the essay, what concrete cases might you draw upon? What kinds of other real-world examples did
            this article remind you of?

**these are good candidates to cite other articles to answer this question, for instance, from the
bibliography of the essay you are annotating. Please note that the citations you are seeking may be
cited in the articles for the assignment, so use the references/bibliography of the article you have
selected as a resource when answering these questions.**

   In this assignment, you should plan to cite 3-5 sources. These sources should be drawn from what the author
of the article cites as support or evidence for their claims. These citations appear in the bibliography of the
                                                                                               SHORT PAPER 2: ANNOTATION ASSIGNMENT | 443

essays listed below. It would be most helpful for establishing the definition of rhetoric, rhetorical concepts, and
the conversation entered. Of course, sources may be cited for any of the questions so long as they are relevant
and help to answer the question. Please do not cite sources arbitrarily or "just because," there must be a good
reason for the citation.

   Please select one of the essays from the list below. These essays' central contribution regards rhetoric and
rhetorical theory, and are published in journals recognized for contributions to rhetorical studies. One detailed
annotation is also provided on the following page.

   Please note that you must select one article from this list for your annotation. Annotations of articles that
do not appear on this list will receive a grade of "0."

Example of an Article Annotation.
   Michael Lechuga (2020) "Mapping migrant vernacular discourses: Mestiza consciousness, nomad thought,

and Latina/o/x migrant movement politics in the United States," Journal of International and Intercultural
Communication, 13:3, 257-273.

       1. What is the central claim/assertion/thesis of the essay? Michael Lechuga makes the assertion
            that the tensions between Latinas/o/x immigrants and the US come in three forms. With its
            emphasis upon the movements of national identity, migrant identity, the fear anxiety associated
            with criminality, this essay is not a quantitative stance on immigration or the rhetoric that is seen in
            politics. It is an analysis of how the migrant vernacular has now to be decrypted to better
            understand how rigid state borders have impacted their identity and how they navigate the space
            they occupy. It presents the case that the act of immigration is a fundamental right that anyone
            should have. That the way in which we close and shut our borders is rooted in a fundamental idea
            of a nationalist view towards the world in the US. The essay aims to help enlighten the audience
            that being in a country state with borders is not the natural way. In a culture that has historically
            embraced nomadism, new forms of nomadism are emergent.

       2. What is the author's definition of rhetoric? Based on context clues and citations in the
            essay, how is rhetoric being defined?** Rhetoric is the tool that searches for the most effective
            means of illustrating your point of view or making the most persuasive argument that moves
            people. The author is defining rhetoric as an art of communication, that rhetoric must go beyond a
            monocultural thought process. Rhetoric must get beyond the rigidity of one language with one
            mode. Rhetoric must be versatile and adaptive, it is not stagnant. The nomad has no one place, no
            one identity, no one way to think, the nomad can be bilingual, polyamorous, it does not matter.
            Rhetoric becomes not just the language as the mode, it is the thought, the action, the touch. It
444 | SHORT PAPER 2: ANNOTATION ASSIGNMENT

            becomes fluid because in the nomad state there are no barriers. Rhetoric must transcend language
            and ascend to ubiquity in fluidity.
       3. Based on the units we've considered in this class, how does the author understand
            rhetorical criticism? What is the ultimate purpose of the essay? Lechuga sees rhetorical
            criticism as a means of giving the nomadic view more latitude. Lechuga also aims to express the
            agency that rhetorical criticism gives migrant populations. It allows the critique to become
            omnipotent. They are not embedded in their own truth of the nation-state, or in the nomad. They
            are beyond both; they are outside their own prejudices and preconceived notions based on their
            story and the story written. Lechuga says "It- gives agency to those communities on the margins by
            studying how they negotiate identity through vernacular discourse, not just the domination
            discourses". Rhetorical criticism takes away the idea of the author as the authority. It takes the
            power away from the dominating discourse, it gives rise to the discourse that surrounds what
            identity is and how nomads are negotiating it.
       4. What elements of the author's theory or analysis are uniquely rhetorical? Are there any
            specific key terms or words that mark the theory or contribution that qualify it as
            "rhetoric"? What struck me as most overtly rhetorical about this essay were the stories from
            Anzaldua and the statement by Guizar. It was through stories of people that we saw the deeper
            meaning of writing this essay. It was the voices that had been subjected to hate crimes,
            ostracization, to being put in boxes, under labels, when they were never contained. Another
            rhetorical characteristic of this essay was the way that Lechuga seamlessly moved from subjective
            evidence to an analysis of systems of government, which I found to be flawless.
       5. Who is the author in conversation with? Who are the people that the author cites the
            most, builds upon, or takes issue with?** Lechuga says "This study is informed by a rich body
            of scholarships on vernacular discourse". In his text he writes about the most critical of those
            scholarships being one that is producing the greatest ripples in the water being one that actively
            makes critiques of those that dominate the discourse that constructs and marginalizes the identity
            of Latina/o/x communities. Throughout the essay Lechuga does not blatantly say, `You, the
            authoritarians need this education" and that "NPNF argues that migration is a human right."
            Lechuga takes issue with the presidents that entered and exited the office and done nothing to
            remediate the issue of ICE, of the prison state that we have created.
       6. What does the author contribute to this conversation? What is it that they bring in the
            way of a new idea, concept, terminology, or kind of analysis? Throughout the essay Lechuga
            builds on mestiza consciousness and the idea of NPNF. Lechuga powerfully enters the
            conversation with a quote from Anzaldua about what being a nomad is. It is as though she is
            describing a rhythmic dance, tiptoeing from one movement to another. When, it is describing an
            entire change of oneself to conform to another culture because you as an entity are not a stagnant
            puddle of muck, but ubiquitous in life and culture. By raising the idea of rhetorical criticism as a
                                                                                    SHORT PAPER 2: ANNOTATION ASSIGNMENT | 445

    voice for the voiceless to light, he also emphasizes that rhetoric must goes beyond the Burkean
    definition of rhetoric as symbolic action, or as a universal identification among all individuals,
    which does not take into account the unique modes of communication and lived experience that
    characterizes migrant communities.
7. What are other key terms not already that are especially important to understanding this
    essay? Why were they important to the overall meaning of the essay? (1) Mestizaje or
    mestiza consciousness describes "an orientation to multiple spaces and multiple possibilities that
    span time, language, and ideology." As opposed to a logic-centric approach to rhetoric, in which
    words and arguments convey meaning that is assumed to be universally available to an audience,
    this concept explains "how power is layered onto bodies through affection, through institutions,
    and of course through language." It is a theory of speech but also of feeling, emotion, and lived
    experience that aims for "coalitional activism that encourages bodies to occupy spaces of
    contradiction as a resistance to white supremacy." (2) Vernacular, which may be understood as the
    linguistic and rhetorical expressions of a particular community. Everything about the Latina/o/x
    culture is their identity, yet they so easily slip in and own to appease the cultures around them.
8. How might the essay help us to understand circumstances beyond those described in the
    essay? If we look at the world and stop seeing it as lines, ownership, borders, categories of people,
    labels, compartmentalization of human beings we can maybe see each other. See each other.. By
    using rhetorical criticism as a means of depowering the authoritative state and empowering the
    minorities we are one step closer to social equality. This essay really sought to inform about what it
    means to be nomadic. The fluidness of the body, the mind, the energy that allows someone to
    seamlessly transpose themselves through worlds of cultures and people. It showed how our rigidity
    as US citizens limits us from embracing, acknowledging, and learning about others in a meaningful
    way. We have such a disconnect from movement, identity, culture, bodies, emotions, even our own
    loved ones. We see differences, not what brings us together. Lechuga wrote about how immigrants
    are caught in constant states of fear, anxiety, not being secure in a homeland, and how can we not
    relate? This isn't even our land, yet we prevent others from moving here as the majority of us did as
    settlers.

SHORT PAPER 3: RHETORICAL ANALYSIS

This 2 page statement should clearly answer the research questions below regarding rhetorical communication
(see below). The following bullets provide the prompt for the essay. Students may choose to treat their answers
to each bulleted prompt as separate paragraphs in the final essay.

   Please note that this assignment is asking you to answer all of the questions below. You do not have to format
the answers as separate paragraphs, although I recommend that organizational strategy to feature your answers
to the questions.

  · Introduction: After your Attention-Getting Device (AGD), provide the thesis and purpose of your
      rhetorical analysis. What new observations does your analysis reveal? What is the benefit, profit, or take-
      away of having completed this analysis? Then, provide a preview statement that outlines how the rest of
      the essay will proceed.

  · What is rhetoric? Cite a key definition drawn from the course and/or academic sources, and explain
      what this definition means.

  · Explain a core rhetorical concept. Connect this definition to a concept (or concepts) drawn from the
      course. Why and how do they offer a helpful lens through which to understand contemporary rhetoric?

  · Show how the concept illuminates a case. Provide an example of current or contemporary rhetoric that
      illustrates this rhetorical concept `in action'. Tell us enough about the case to understand the relevance
      of the rhetorical concept, and then show how the concept illuminates our understanding of this
      example.

  · Conclusion: Gesture beyond the case at hand to explain why your rhetorical analysis might be useful
      more generally or in application to a wider set of topics. What else about public communication might
      an analysis like this one reveal?

It is important that you make use of clear organization and topic sentences in your writing. Please indicate
which question you are answering in the header of your document (in addition to identifying information
like student name, class, date), offer a prospective answer as a thesis statement, and briefly discuss researched
support for the thesis. For additional writing and organizational advice for this assignment, please consult the
following document: Additional Guidance for Critical Writing.

   How to Organize a Short-Form Rhetorical Analysis, Paragraph by Paragraph
   The optimal organization for this paper is a logically dependent structure, meaning that each paragraph
built toward a larger argument. This approach is modeled below. However you decide to organize the paper,
it must coordinate a thesis that advances how rhetoric and rhetorical concepts help to explain a given topic/
object/artifact/event/text/image with topic sentences that flow through the entire document.
   Paragraph 1: Thesis. Articulate a clear thesis statement, purpose statement and preview for your short
essay.

  · The thesis statement should connect an idea of rhetoric to a concrete instance of rhetoric as it has been
      discussed in this class.
          (e.g.) [this idea of rhetoric and/or a specific rhetorical concept] helps to explain the [impacts, effects,
            strategies, motives, or power hierarchies] at work [in this specific instance, case study, image, artifact,
            etc.]. However it is phrased, this statement should unfold over the course of the next several
            paragraphs.
                (e.g.) Kenneth Burke's dramatistic ratios, such as between scene and agent, can help us to
                  understand the rhetorical choices made by courtroom speakers in US v. Texas (2021) and the
                  motives of the plaintiff and defendant in the case.
                (e.g.) The concept of anamorphosis, drawn from theories of visual rhetoric, can help us to
                  explain the dynamic scenes and narrative structure of the film The Green Knight.
          How have we understood the idea of "rhetoric" in this class? As speech, persuasion, ideological signs,
            symbols, and representations, narratives, arguments, visual rhetorics, public address, settler
            representations and disavowals, instances of public secrecy, or digital rhetoric.

  · The purpose statement should explain what is gained or better understood by describing this artifact
      using rhetorical concepts. This is a statement about why this analysis is important, urgent, or deserving
      of our attention. It may speak to the ethical stakes of the analysis or the reasons why people would
      benefit from a rhetorical perspective.

  · The preview statement should give us a sense of how the rest of the essay will unfold. Given the
      progression below, it might read: first, I will offer a nuanced definition of rhetoric and explain the features
      of [a specific rhetorical concept]. Then I will describe how [the rhetorical concept] helps us to understand
      [your case study, speech, text, image, etc.]

Paragraph 2-3: What is rhetoric? Cite a key definition drawn from the course and/or academic sources,
and explain what this definition means. At the most general level, we have discussed rhetoric as persuasion,
representation, and hierarchies of power. These are themes that stretch across multiple chapters.

   In addition to the unit-specific definitions below, I have also uploaded a separate document that contains some
448 | SHORT PAPER 3: RHETORICAL ANALYSIS

more Definitions of Rhetoric. For reference, you might consider the following pairings, which have been recurrent
throughout the class. Feel free to return to the lecture outline document and/or agenda document, which is also
where these definitions are drawn from. We have also more specifically defined rhetoric in the following ways:

  · Classical (Greek) Rhetoric
          Plato: "Rhetoric moves the soul by means of speech"
          Aristotle: "Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic (or philosophy) / the available means of
            persuasion in any given situation."

  · Sign and Symbol. As-persuasion/public address: "something that happens in or as a speech, and it
      relies upon the speaker's conscious choices, their historical circumstances, and the timeliness of the
      moment at which speeches delivered."
          Burke: Rhetoric as identification is "the way that speech unifies and divides a collective public
            audience." Rhetoric as symbolic action "occurs around symbols and relies upon the idea of
            consubstantiality or the creation of a sameness or likeness, between different members of a group
            based upon a shared and symbolic point of reference, rather than just persuading with the right
            words."

  · Ideology and Myth: Rhetoric describes the way that any given sign can acquire an additional meaning
      or signification, contributing to a shared system of belief that supports an ideology.

  · Agency: Rhetoric describes any subject's relative "capacity to act." In the case of a speech, for instance,
      "agency" may reside with the audience (who acts on the speech), the speaker (who compels the action),
      and/or the text (the speech itself which has a specific and repeatable kind of force).

  · Persona: Rhetoric is public address or speech addressed with an audience in mind or that is implied by
      the act of address.

  · Speech Act: Rhetoric is a performative utterance that has specific consequences either at the moment of
      the utterance or at some distance from it.

  · Narrative: Rhetoric is the arrangement of forms in language, image, and speech to create recognizable
      genres. Forms provide a recognizable logical order, are repeatable (such as a sequence or a figure of
      speech), and are ambivalent to the ethical or political goals that they serve.

  · Argument: Rhetoric, when organized as an argument, is both a thing (such as a logical form) and a
      relationship (for example, as between an affirmative and a negative position, or between a defendant and
      a plaintiff).

  · Visual Rhetoric: Rhetoric consists of the persuasive and presentational symbolism of the circulating
      image that acts as a source of shared culture and identification for a given public. Visual rhetoric may
      also be an iconic image, an image event, monumental rhetoric, or body rhetoric.

  · The Rhetorical Situation: Rhetoric is a "fitting response" to an exigency that is addressed to an
      audience (or audiences) while navigating specific constraints. It is a "complex of persons, events, objects,
      and relations presenting an actual or potential exigence which can be completely or partially removed if
                                                                                                     SHORT PAPER 3: RHETORICAL ANALYSIS | 449

      discourse, introduced in the situation, can so constrain human decision or action as to bring about the
      significant modification of the exigence
  · The Settler Situation: Rhetoric consists of the colonizer's patterns of disavowal that project that threat
      of colonization onto a foreign other who allegedly threatens the colonizer with their colonization, and
      which provides the colonizer with a justification to perpetuate colonial governance.
  · Secrecy Rhetoric: Rhetoric consists of the ways that "we know that we do not know" or the cues,
      patterns, and behaviors that alert a person or public, after the fact, to the existence of some secret.
  · Digital Rhetoric: The language we use and the practices that have become invisible/normal concerning
      technology, in which the words and techniques we use to monitor and model human behavior have
      destructive public consequences.

   Paragraph 2-3: Connect this definition to a concept (or concepts) drawn from the course. Why
and how do they offer a helpful lens through which to understand contemporary rhetoric? These concepts
are considerably more plentiful across the chapters of the book. What is the specific concept related to the
larger idea of rhetoric you have selected for this final essay? What is particularly interesting, illuminating, or
important about what this concept explains at a general level? If there are `tenets' or components of this
concept what are those tenets and how are they defined? (e.g. the four criteria for assessing visual rhetoric in
Finnegan's "Visual Modes of Public Address."

   Paragraph 3-5: Provide an example of current or contemporary rhetoric that illustrates this
rhetorical concept `in action'. Provide a detailed context about the case to understand the relevance of the
rhetorical concept, and then show how the concept illuminates our understanding of this example. You may
want to devote one paragraph to the context of your selected topic/object/artifact/text/image and another to
the application of the rhetorical concept from the previous paragraphs to this topic. Here are some framing
questions for the "context" you might consider. You can answer one or all of these:

  · What was the emergency or problem or situation to which this artifact/object responds?
  · For whom was the object/artifact/text staged? Who was it meant for? Who consumed it? Did it get a lot

      of attention?
  · What were the limitations of communicating this message? What limitations did the creators of the

      message face? What kinds of choices were made in the creation of this message?

Here is a more condensed version of this assignment organized by prompts for each section.

                                                                                                     SHORT PAPER 3: RHETORICAL ANALYSIS | 451

with a case study. The idea is for you to show us that you have gained an understanding of at least one of the
rhetorical concepts we have discussed and are able to think about how it explains an instance of persuasion,
representation, or hierarchical power relations.

  · Rhetoric is a mode of strategic representation, which uses written and visual symbols in order to
      convey a message to an audience. Visual rhetoric, for example, can be understood as the use of
      representations to convey a message to a public audience using a strategic arrangement of element.

  · One concept that falls under this heading is the "image event." The image event describes the crafting
      of a public performance for purposes of media circulation, such as a protest, demonstration, or
      movement that makes for "good pictures" and therefore represents the importance of a social issue to a
      wider community or audience. An image event also provokes thinking about the authenticity of the
      performance/demonstration/movement in question precisely because they are designed to be `pictured'.

  · One example of this concept in action is the "extinction rebellion" demonstration on the Thames,
      where activists staged a house floating down a river to illustrate the effects of climate change. You would
      then show how it is designed for `good pictures' and provokes questions about authenticity.

Another example, focused on a speech:

  · Rhetoric is a strategy of persuasion, where a speaker crafts a message for an audience with some idea of
      how they would like this audience to think, feel, and act in response. One broad framework that is useful
      for understanding rhetoric as persuasion is "the rhetorical situation," which helps us to puzzle out the
      different elements that collaborate to give a speech its force and meaning.

  · A rhetorical situation is composed minimally of an "exigence," an "audience" and "constraints." The
      exigence is the "imperfection marked by urgency" which is the problem to which the speaker responds
      and seeks to resolve. The audience is those people to whom the speech is addressed who have the
      capacity to act in order to resolve or reduce the urgency of the exigence. Constraints describe the
      limitations upon the speaker and the speech which must be navigated in order for persuasion to have its
      intended effect.

  · A speech by Barack Obama such as the 2008 "Yes We Can" address can be explained as an
      intentionally crafted persuasive address by attending to the "problem" to which he responded (i.e., the
      exigence: a recession in the wake of the Bush presidency, the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, etc), the
      audiences to whom his speech was addressed (moderate Americans and the specific constituencies
      named in the speech itself), and constraints (such as the fact that "yes we can" was used in previous
      campaigns that were not successful, or that it was adapted from other movement leaders like Dolores
      Huerta [Si se puede]).

Selecting a Topic: Like the encomium assignment, you pick your topic. You may want to think about your

Class Sample 1

On January 29, 2021 in Brussels, Belgium hundreds of Members of European Parliament rose to their feet,
joined hands, and broke into song for what was perhaps the most consequential rendition of Auld Layne
Syne in European history. Moments before, the European Parliament had ratified the terms of the United
Kingdom's withdraw from the European Union, ending 47-years of British membership in the organization
(Payne, 2020). This paper examines the moment from a rhetorical lens, arguing that the rhetorical concepts of
the second persona and eavesdropping audience can be used to better understand the political motivations for
the European Parliaments singing of the Scottish folk song. To this end, the paper is divided into a definition
for rhetoric, explanation of how this definition relates to the concepts of the second persona and eavesdropping
audiences, and exploration of how the singing of Auld Layne Syne can be better understood by viewing it as
an example of these concepts in action.

   First, for the purposes of this paper the definition of rhetoric developed by Kenneth Burke shall be utilized.
According to Burke, rhetoric "is the manipulation of men's beliefs for political ends....the basic function of
rhetoric [is] the use of words by human agents to form attitudes or to induce actions in other human agents"
(Burke, 1969). Thus, rhetoric can be understood as the use of language by human actors to advance ideological
objectives by inculcating attitudes within others or effectuating the action of others. So long as the message
remains intelligible, rhetoric can occur through any medium, and can be certainly communicated and analyzed
through the medium of a song such as Auld Layne Syne.
                                                                                                        SHORT PAPER 3: RHETORICAL ANALYSIS | 453

     This definition connects directly to the concept of second persona and the eavesdropping audience. Simply
  put, to understand rhetoric as the utilization of language to mold attitudes and incite action is necessarily to
  presume that rhetoric cannot occur without an audience capable. While their multiple audiences to which
  rhetoric may be addressed, the first penitent to this case is the second persona, or the implied audience who
  a rhetor is targeting his address towards directly. The other is the eavesdropping audience. This audience is
  one that the rhetor wants to hear their message while explicitly targeting the message at another group. This
  is typically done to limit the either limit the agency of the eavesdropping audience, or to acknowledge and
  empower them. Pundits, elected officials, and other political actors regularly address the second persona and
  the eavesdropping actors in the rhetoric, as evidenced by examining the signing of Auld Layne Sayne.

     These concepts of audience concepts provide a lens to better understand the European Parliaments purpose
  for singing Auld Layne Sang after voting to approve the terms of the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the
  European Union. To be certain, the rendition of Auld Layne Syne is an act of rhetoric. Despite what reporting
  on the seemed to imply, the signing was not spontaneous, as evinced by MEP's circulating to one another lyric
  sheets, but instead can best be understood by being viewed as pre-planned act of political messaging targeted
  towards the British public, the second persona in this scenario, and Scotland, the eaves-dropping audience. For
  those Britons watching the proceeding, both who did and did not vote from Brexit, the somber singing of
  Auld Layne Sing was meant to cast the moment as one of celebration and instead frame moment as the tragic
  end of a period of cooperation and camaraderie. In doing so, the rhetorical action accomplished a political
  objective by subverting the attempt of Nigel Farage and his Eurosceptic UKIP delegation, who had moments
  before stormed out of the building in a flurry of boorishly gleeful flag waving, to cast the moment as one of
  celebration and instead framed the vote as the tragic end of a period of cooperation and camaraderie. Perhaps
  more interestingly, the selection of a quintessentially Scottish song written partially in 18th-century Scots can
  also be understood as disguised overture to the Scotland, the eaves-dropping audience, who's public and ruling
  pro-EU, anti-UK1 Scottish National Party continues to openly muse about attempting a second independence
  referendum in the aftermath of the Brexit vote (Sturgeon, 2021).

     In conclusion, Burke's definition of rhetoric and the rhetorical concepts of the second persona and
  eavesdropping audience allows a lens by which to better understand the singing of Auld Layne Syne. Applying
  this lens reveals the singing as a complex political calculation designed to simultaneously undermine UKIP
  and encourage the SNP, rather than as, the cursory observer may assume, a spontaneous, and perhaps slightly
  frivolous, symbolic bidding of farewell to the United Kingdom.

1. While this is admittedly an oversimplification of the SNP's relationship with the United Kingdom, a detailed discussion of
  the SNP's politics and positions towards secessionism is beyond the scope of this paper.

Class Sample 2

While many understand rhetoric as simply the art of persuading an individual or group of people, it can be
better understood as "the art of ruling the minds of men" (Plato, 2018). In this short paper, I will argue
that rhetoric may be understood as that rhetoric is the language of colonizers and how media coverage on
events such as those in Jerusalem may perpetuate coloniality and provide the colonizer with a justification to
perpetuate their colonial governance. By the end of this paper, my reader should understand what rhetoric is,
and how colonial communication animates western media coverage on the recent attacks in Jerusalem. To do
this, I'll first explain how I define rhetoric, following with a connection to colonial communication and Dr.
Lechuga's "incomunicable", and finally closing with an outline of how this plays out in my given example.

   To begin, I will define rhetoric through the lens of colonialism, in that rhetoric is a collection of renounced
patterns that project the threat of colonization onto the colonized other, while providing the colonizer
justification to perpetuate their colonial governance (Hallsby, 2021). This means that for the colonizer, rhetoric
is another weapon they use to perpetuate their colonial power in a way that is often hidden, objective and
subtle because of their continued rejection of responsibility. Rhetoric is used here to bring power to the
colonizer, while bringing fear and oppression to the colonized.

   The previous definition of rhetoric is connected to Dr. Michael Lechuga's concept of colonial
communication and "incomunicable". Colonial communication is defined as a "colonizing group [that]
distributes and maintains control over the political, social, and economic hierarchies" (Lechuga, 2021).
Furthermore, "incomunicable" is a concept that is used to refer to the product of colonial communication
(Lechuga, 2021). When rhetoric is used to maintain control over a group of people and structures of power,
rhetoric is being used to dictate what is acceptable or not acceptable, what is allowed or not allowed, in order to
keep the colonial power in place. These concepts are helpful in understanding the aforementioned definition
of rhetoric because they provide a tangible way of how colonial rhetoric has a clear purpose, which is to
maintain the systems of power of the colonial government, while maintaining the colonized position below.

   Over the weekend, Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank of Palestine has been the target of massive raids
and attacks by Israeli officers due to the protesting of the planned eviction of several Palestinian families from
their homes in Sheikh Jarrah. These past few days have left hundreds injured, multiple dead, and the entire
world heartbroken and ashamed of Israeli response to the peaceful protesters. While these events have been an
example of many things, including irresponsible US foreign aid, continued violations of human rights, and the
exacerbation of the Israeli apartheid, it has also been an example of colonial communication. Many western
news media outlets have been reporting day in and day out about the details of what is going on on the ground.
Through these media coverage, I will highlight how rhetoric as colonial communication is prevalent due to it
rendering the Palestinian people and their struggle "incomunicable".

   In an article published today in the New York Times, the subtitle of Kingsley and Kershner (2021) report
indicate the prevalence of colonial rhetoric. They say "clashes between the Israeli police and Palestinian
protesters at Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem" (Kingsley and Kershner, 2021). In this subtitle, the word "clashes"
                                                                                                     SHORT PAPER 3: RHETORICAL ANALYSIS | 455

is a clear indication of the objectivity of colonial communication in that the word suggests that the events are
strictly two sided, and that both sides are responsible for the attacks. However, the fact of the matter is that
Israeli forces attacked the Palestinians, and when using the word attacked, it is clear who is responsible for the
event. Another example of this is also from the New York Times where they titled their article "Hundreds
of Palestinians Hurt After Israeli Police Enter Aqsa Mosque" (The New York Times, 2021). Again, the word
"enter" is used objectively, but dismisses the violence and power that Israeli forces held during that incident.
Here, it is clear that rhetoric is being used to dismiss the true nature of the events happening in Jerusalemn
against the Palestinian people and their land, and it is being used to maintain the position of the Israeli
colonial government, who continues to attack, raid and destroy Palestinian land, but remains unnaffected and
disavowed.

`Snitches get stitches', a phrase that most people know means say what you know to someone and suffer
the consequences. Secrets play a large part in secrecy rhetoric, whether it be keeping them or exposing them.
Secrecy rhetoric is a type of rhetoric that many people encounter on a daily basis whether it be in their
interaction or the media they consume. In this paper, I will define secrecy rhetoric, discuss the concept of
surveillance in regards to secrecy rhetoric, and close by relating surveillance and secrecy rhetoric to the 2016
film Snowden.

   To begin, secrecy rhetoric is defined as "rhetoric that consists of the ways that `we know that we don't know'
or the cues, patterns, and behaviors that alert a person or public, after the fact, to the existence of some secrets
(Hallsby, 2021). What this definition means is that rhetoric is the actions taken to reveal secrets to those who
456 | SHORT PAPER 3: RHETORICAL ANALYSIS

are un aware of the secret. One key concept of secrecy rhetoric is the concept of surveillance which is the act of
observing an interaction or behavior by a nonparticipant in the action (Hallsby, 2021).

   Surveillance is one of the key concepts to understand in secrecy rhetoric. It also is helpful in understanding
contemporary rhetoric in a few ways. As stated before, surveillance is the act of observing an interaction or
behavior by a nonparticipant in the action. This is definition makes it easier to understand the concept of
persona in contemporary rhetoric for example, an audience that has seen something the speaker has done that
revealed something about them but the audience remained silent it would be the fourth persona. Another way
that surveillance helps to understand contemporary rhetoric is that rhetoric involves knowing the audience and
persuading them which can be done with the help of secrets. This means that the speaker can keep secrets from
the audience or they an let them in on a secret. To illustrate the concept of surveillance in action, let's look at
the example of the 2016 film Snowden.

   The 2016 film Snowden is about Edward Snowden, a former employee of the NSA who revealed classified
information about the American government to the public. In the film Snowden surveils people through
their devices without their knowledge and is disturbed by the extent of the capabilities of the NSA to watch
almost everyone. In one scene in particular, Snowden is looking into his camera on his laptop and appears
scared of who could be watching him. So, he decides to cover the lens with some tape, to not be surveilled
(Stone, 2016, 0:55:26). The film depicts surveillance as the collection of secrets and private information by the
NSA, this leads to Snowden becoming a whistleblower and revealing the secrets to the public by leaking the
classified information to the Guardian (Greenwald, 2013). Throughout the whole film, Snowden is observing
interactions as a nonparticipant, in other words surveilling them and obtaining their secrets.

   To conclude, secrets in rhetoric play a large role in contemporary rhetoric by helping us to understand the
how secrets are formed and how secrets are revealed. If there is one thing to take away from this paper it should
be that surveillance is a key concept in helping us to understand rhetoric because it pertains to the relationship
between the audience and the speaker. `To know that we don't know' is the principle of secrets and whether
they be secrets of the individual or the government, they are both relevant to secrecy rhetoric.

APPENDIX: DEFINITIONS OF RHETORIC

Plato: Rhetoric is "the art of moving the soul (psyche) by means of speech."
   Aristotle: Rhetoric is "the faculty of discovering in any particular case all of the available means of

persuasion.
   Cicero: "Rhetoric is one great art comprised of five lesser arts: inventio, dispositio, elocutio, memoria, and

pronunciatio." Rhetoric is "speech designed to persuade."
   Quintillian: "Rhetoric is the art of the good man speaking well."
   Francis Bacon: Rhetoric is the application of reason to imagination "for the better moving of the will."
   George Campbell: [Rhetoric] is that art or talent by which discourse is adapted to its end. The four ends

of discourse are to enlighten the understanding, please the imagination, move the passion, and influence the
will.

   I.A. Richards: Rhetoric is the study of misunderstandings and their remedies.
   Kenneth Burke: "Rhetoric is rooted in an essential function of language itself, a function that is wholly
realistic and continually born anew: the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings
that by nature respond to symbols." ALSO: "Wherever there is persuasion, there is rhetoric, and wherever there
is rhetoric, there is meaning."
   Richard Weaver: Rhetoric is that "which creates an informed appetition for the good."
   Erika Lindemann: "Rhetoric is a form of reasoning about probabilities, based on Assumptions people
share as members of a commununity."
   Andrea Lunsford: "Rhetoric is the art, practice, and study of human communication."
   Francis Christensen: "Grammar maps out the possible; rhetoric narrows the possible down to the
desirable or effective." "The key question for rhetoric is how to know what is desirable."
   Sonja and Karen Foss: "Rhetoric is an action human beings perform when they use symbols for the
purpose of communicating with one another . . , [and it] is a perspective humans take that involves focusing
on symbolic processes."

 1. Boethius: Confessions (Howell's translation)

Rhetoric treats of and discourses upon hypotheses, that is, questions with a multitude of surroundings in time
and place, and if at any time it brings up a thesis, it uses it in connection with its hyposthesis. These are its
surroundings: Who? What? Where? By whose help? Why? In what manner? At what time?

 2. James J. Murphy: "One Thousand Neglected Authors"

A rhetorician is someone who provides his fellows with useful precepts or directions for organizing and
presenting his ideas or feeling to them. (20)

 3. Marc Fumaroli: "Rhetoric, Politics and Society"

Rhetoric appears as the connective tissue peculiar to civil society and to its proper finalities, happiness and
political peace hic et nunc. (253-4)

 4. Kenneth Burke: A Rhetoric of Motives

The most characteristic concern of rhetoric [is] the manipulation of men's beliefs for political ends....the basic
function of rhetoric [is] the use of words by human agents to form attitudes or to induce actions in other
human agents. (41)

 5. Covino and Joliffe: Rhetoric: Concepts, Definitions, Boundaries (1995)

Rhetoric is primarily a verbal, situationally contingent, epistemic art that is both philosophical and practical
and gives rise to potentially active texts.

 6. Paolo Valesio: Novantiqua (1980)

I specify now that rhetoric is the functional organization of discourse, within its social and cultural context, in
all its aspects, exception made for its realization as a strictly formal metalanguage-in formal logic, mathematics,
and in the sciences whose metalanguages share the same features. In other words: rhetoric is all of language, in
its realization as discourse.

 7. George Kennedy: "A Hoot in the Dark" (1992)

Rhetoric in the most general sense may perhaps be identified with the energy inherent in communication: the
emotional energy that impels the speaker to speak, the physical energy expanded in the utterance, the energy
level coded in the message, and the energy experienced by the recipient in decoding the message.

 8. Francis Bacon (1561-1626): Advancement of Learning

The duty and office of rhetoric is to apply reason to imagination for the better moving of the will.

9. Bender and Wellbery:

...that sea of communicative transactions...the impersonal drama of what occurs among us, unnoticed and
without deliberation or grandeur...the dense tangle of our triviality.

10. Lloyd Bitzer: "The Rhetorical Situation" (1968)

In short, rhetoric is a mode of altering reality, not by the direct application of energy to objects, but by the
creation of discourse which changes reality through the mediation of thought and action.

11. Edward T. Channing: Lectures Read to the Seniors at Harvard College (c. 1856)

[Rhetoric is] a body of rules derived from experience and observation, extending to all communication by
language and designed to make it efficient. It does not ask whether a man is to be a speaker or writer, -a poet,
philosopher, or debater; but simply,-is it his wish to be put in the right way of communicating his mind with
power to others, by words spoken or written. If so, rhetoric undertakes to show him rules or principles which
will help to make the expression of his thoughts effective.

12. Douglas Ehninger (1972):

[Rhetoric is] that discipline which studies all of the ways in which men may influence each other's thinking
and behavior through the strategic use of symbols.

13. Gerard A. Hauser: Introduction to Rhetorical Theory (1986)

Rhetoric is an instrumental use of language.... One person engages another person in an exchange of symbols
to accomplish some goal. It is not communication for communication's sake. Rhetoric is communication that
attempts to coordinate social action. For this reason, rhetorical communication is explicitly pragmatic. Its goal
is to influence human choices on specific matters that require immediate attention.

14. C. H. Knoblauch: "Modern Rhetorical Theory and Its Future Directions" (1985)

...rhetoric is the process of using language to organize experience and communicate it to others. It is also
the study of how people use language to organize and communicate experience. The word denotes...both
distinctive human activity and the "science" concerned with understanding that activity.

15. John Locke: Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)
460 | APPENDIX: DEFINITIONS OF RHETORIC

[Rhetoric,] that powerful instrument of error and deceit.

16. McCloskey:

...merely speech with designs on the reader.

17. Bazerman, Charles: Shaping Written Knowledge: The Genre and Activity of the Experimental Article in
      Science. Madison U of Wisconsin P, 1988. 6.

The study of how people use language and other symbols to realize human goals and carry out human activities
. . . ultimately a practical study offering people great control over their symbolic activity.

18. Hyde, Michael and Craig Smith: "Hermeneutics and Rhetoric: A Seen but Unobserved
      Relationship." Quarterly Journal of Speech 65 4 (1979): 347

The primordial function of rhetoric is to "make-known" meaning both to oneself and to others. Meaning is
derived by a human being in and through the interpretive understanding of reality. Rhetoric is the process of
making known that meaning. Is not rhetoric defined as pragmatic communication, more concerned with the
contemporary audiences and specific questions than with universal audiences and general questions (360)?
