Preface: About this
Book

Welcome to an evolving world, and an evolving "book". This
is a textbook on social media, new media, and participatory
culture. What makes this book special is that the book itself
is participatory, drawing on the insights and artistry of those
immersed in social media cultures. We believe in channeling
students' "funds of knowledge" as we teach about social media
technologies, because what students know about social media
is essential in connecting with students in order to teach them,
and in helping all of us learn about this ever-evolving digital
world.

                                                             Preface: About this Book | xxi

                                  Humans R Social Media

                                  (HRSM) is an Open

                                  Educational Resource. That

                                  means it is designed not only

                                  for free access, but so anyone

                                  can do with it what are called

                                  the 5 R's: Reuse, Remix,

                                  in a course is that OER are

                                  usually free of cost. For

                                  course without creating an

entirely new book. There are also even more collaborative

possibilities with OER that we are exploring with this book.

We would love to know what you think of Humans R Social
Media. Do you have an idea for a chapter? Do you see an error
that needs to be fixed? Is there content that is outdated or
offensive you'd like to alert us to? Are you interested in
becoming more involved in editions of this book in the future?
Fill out our survey to help us see HRSM from your perspective.

New in this edition

This edition of HRSM is designed to be exciting for students,
accessible for all learners, and socially aware. We remain rooted
xxii | Preface: About this Book
in the Americas with a particular focus on English-speaking
cultures in the United States, though we hope to invite broader
perspectives as we move this book toward open governance.
For now, we hope you enjoy and learn from this book including
preexisting content and revisions including those listed below.

Chapter Overviews and Key Points

We have added text boxes at the top of some chapters with
overviews including chapter section headings, and lists of key
points in the book.

Glossary term updates

Glossary terms are still listed at the end of each chapter--now
in alphabetical order, rather than order of appearance--and
they are also listed all together at the end in Core Concepts (a
Glossary).

Student insights updates

We have updated how we integrate student content to be
more accessible and interactive for readers. Our Student
Insights text boxes have been updated to be expandable and
include transcripts of any spoken content. You will also find
more audio and video stories and more graphics than in any
previous version of HRSM.

Galleries of iVoices student work

In this edition, we are presenting culminating work from our
producing project, iVoices Media Lab. With iVoices, original
HRSM author Diana Daly worked with teams of mostly
undergraduate students in a media lab, producing imagery,
audio, and video stories about their experiences with social
media technologies. In this edition of HRSM, we present some
of that work. This includes new audio, visual, and graphic
student content integrated with the HRSM book text, and our
Galleries at the end of the book.

How we've made Humans R Social Media
and the current edition

Information is always in motion, so this book is changing too.

I began writing this book on my own in 2017, and have updated
it since as often as I could. (Future updates to this book will
look different--read more about that here.) The social media
xxiv | Preface: About this Book
landscape changes so quickly, it's wise to question whether
any book on the subject can remain relevant. One answer to
this question is that any book or knowledge source remains
relevant longer when it's dynamic, or embracing of continuous
change.

This edition of Humans R Social Media is a culmination of work
by the iVoices Student Media Lab (visit iVoices here), funded
by the Center for University Education and Scholarship, the
College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, and the iSchool at
the University of Arizona. The goal of iVoices is to integrate
student voices including narratives and media into instruction
about technologies, and - beginning in Fall 2022 - to broaden
our understandings of youth and new media experiences
through research and scholarship.

Students hold extraordinary knowledge and experiences in our
social media-saturated world, as I learned when I began
inviting student perspectives in the Social Media and Ourselves
podcast (visit the podcast here). Then our iVoices student
Media Lab workers helped design assignments and train
students in the large General Education course I teach, to
produce media based on their experiences with technologies.
Our team of iVoices interns training in Library and Information
Science then carefully described, tagged, selected, and
integrated student stories and media into the textbook. This
edition you are reading now is the product of this extraordinary
collaborative effort.

I am thrilled to broaden this book to include more student
stories and media, and just as thrilled that you are here to read
and share it. Throughout the book Humans R Social Media,
you can find personal stories in video, audio, and writing. by
students in the course the book was first designed for. In most
chapters of the book, these student stories are presented as
Case Studies followed by thought-provoking questions, to

                                                            Preface: About this Book | xxv
which readers are invited to respond. Case studies are
frameworks for learning from life in the social sciences, and
these stories offer opportunities for observation and analysis.

A Note on Impermanence

Information can be impermanent, like sand on a beach.

Many books pretend permanence. This one is unusual in
acknowledging that books today - indeed any written
information today - will not hold steady value for long. The
value of this webbook is directly proportional to the human
attention it can manage to sustain.
All informational content today, and particularly online content,
is comprised of structures built on shifting foundations. Books,
and especially online books, are like the New Jersey beaches I
grew up on. On those beaches it is easy to forget that the sands
xxvi | Preface: About this Book
beneath treasured the boardwalks and evening bingo games
are drifting into the sea, to settle on ocean floors and other
shores.

In the case of this book, the sands on which it is built are
always shifting and changing; some of the channels that will
suck them away fastest are already in view. First, we will lose
the hyperlinks, as one, then a few, then many links lead to
disappeared pages; indeed I wouldn't be surprised if a link or
two is already broken today on the first day of publication.
Second, the platform on which this book is published could
be compromised. (We hope not. As an Open Educational
Resource drawn from open source development, Pressbooks
has an advantage over other proprietary platforms. But things
happen.) Third and last, this book's truths will be cast into
doubt as new information emerges around situations about
which I've written.

I will do my best to keep this book relevant through all of these
shifts. And I hope readers will find my writing voice human
enough to contact me and alert me when something has
slipped out of place.

How to read this book

Today Humans R Social Media is technically a "webbook",
currently hosted on Pressbooks. It is designed so that the
menu - a stack of lines icon - at your upper left will drop down
to show you the book's major Parts, which can then be
expanded with a + sign to show you the chapters within each
part. The arrows at the bottom also help you navigate to the
next chapter.

Below is more information on Pressbooks if you need it.

                                                           Preface: About this Book | xxvii
https://guide.pressbooks.com/chapter/what-is-a-webbook/

You can learn the most about social media through this text if
you perform, as you read, some critical self-reflection - that is,
intense inward examination - of your own use of online social
networking technologies. What do you do online, and why?
Really? What makes that a good idea? Is it possible it's not a
good idea? Why does that process look as it does? Can you
envision it working differently? I invite you to critically engage
with the content covered in this book. To examine social media
critically, you will need to challenge your own beliefs and
practices, as well as social norms, institutions, corporations, and
governments.

More about the Student Insights case
studies

In our iVoices Media Lab days, we trained students to produce
media stories and content, and then offered them the
opportunity to openly license their work for future use. We
depended on interns to organize all of that student content.
Below, one of them introduces a story that made her smile.

       Integrating hundreds of stories into a textbook can be a
       tedious process, but sometimes, student stories like this
       one grab your attention.

       As part of the intern team in 2021, I was part of multiple
       phases of integration including tagging student media.
       I had been working for hours on tagging when I
       stumbled across this audio clip. Even though I love this
       story because it highlights how stepping away from
       social media can be as impactful as being on social
       media, it really made me smile for another reason. Most

xxviii | Preface: About this Book
       of the audio disruption we get is a result of static noise
       or technical difficulties. Imagine my laugh of surprise
       when I recognized the familiar sound of a cat purring! It
       made me so happy, I just had to share it with the other
       members of our team. It was such a special, endearing
       thing to find, we even made "cat purring" a tag in our
       tagging system. ~ Randi Baltzer, iVoices Intern, Spring
       2021

     Respond to this case study: This creator describes
     going on a social media cleanse. What is the purpose of
     this type of exercise, and how does calling it a "cleanse"
     shape the expectations for this type of lifestyle change?
     Have you stopped using social media in this way, and if
     so, what did you learn?

About each chapter's Core Concepts

This book contains a glossary of terms
interspersed throughout the book and
also listed at the bottom of specific
chapters.

Please think beyond the specific definitions given to
the meanings of these concepts, and try to understand
what they mean in your own words.

   About each chapter's Core Questions

   There are questions in each chapter
   that will help you process what you are
   learning and express yourselves.

    A. Qualitative questions are asked first at the
    bottom of each section.

     Some of our qualitative questions prompt you to
     consider situations and stories from your own
     experiences with technologies. Users make sense of
     technologies personally, ideologically, and culturally.
     This does not mean youth or any other users are
     "digital natives," as there is no such thing as a digital
     native! But the sense you make of technologies in your
     own familial and cultural ways is a valuable form of
     knowledge that belongs to you. Honor it by thinking
     seriously about the questions asking you to reflect on
     your tech lives.
     Other qualitative questions at the bottom of these
     chapters ask you to think imaginatively. In these
     scenarios, you have the power to manipulate the past,
     the future, or both. Think deeply about social media

xxxiv | Preface: About this Book
decisions, their impacts, and your potential power in
these.

B. Multiple-choice and other interactive
questions are also asked at the bottom of each
chapter. Use these to test how well you have
comprehended what you've read.

           An interactive H5P element has been
           excluded from this version of the text. You

Introduction

       Key points
            · Social media reflects life in systematically
                distorted ways.
            · We are influenced by social media, and social
                media are influenced by us in turn.
            · Phenomena happening online call back
                cultural patterns that are old and offline.
            · Claims about the internet can be misleading,
                while personal reflection on what we see and
                do can lead to new knowledge.
            · Information can come from data, and may
                even lead to knowledge.
            · Computers can remember, and analyze
                through patterns, but knowledge is a human
                construct influenced by society and culture.

It's June 2020. The streets

host surging protests against

systematic racism in the US,

and polls show a majority of

Americans in favor of the

Black      Lives  Matter

movement at the protests'

foundation. However, social

media metrics show at least

seven of the ten top trending

posts on major social media

platforms         including     A misguided but widely spread
                                Facebook poll drumming up
Facebook and Twitter are        conspiracy theories about George
                                Floyd, who was killed by
highly critical of Black Lives  Minneapolis police in May 2020. A

Matter.                         of Floyd as a conspiracy.

The mismatch seems

unusual, except we don't

need to look far back to see other serious misrepresentations of

the social world on social networking platforms. Another

example began in May 2020. Polls showed a majority of

Americans trusting medical experts on coronavirus, agreeing

with coronavirus-related restrictions, and in fear of going to

work with the virus still spreading. Nonetheless, posts about

government overreach and misinformation skeptical of the

coronavirus threat were top trends on social media platforms

including Twitter, Facebook, and even TikTok. Drummed up

and networked through connecting with these posts, in the

midst of lockdown people staged "Reopen protests" that are

widely covered by the media (including this author).

These mismatches signal important and often forgotten
factors that distort social media's image of public life in
America. Social media are not simply mirrors of society. Social
media platforms, content, and algorithms influence societies,

them, in continuous

cooperation  and

struggle.

media insights can be more

like funhouse mirrors than

clear reflections.

While social media buzz does not simply mirror society,
insights found on social media are not fully disconnected from
real social life either. Understanding the nature and design
behind the trends and even individual posts across social
networking sites (SNS's) can have great value in understanding
networked communication, including the impacts of social
networking on social life, and human social influences on SNS's.
One goal of this book is to guide the reader and participant
through these complex layers of understanding.

Section 2: A relationship of mutual
influence

How are we influenced by social media? How is social media
influenced by us? And why have this book title represent
humans as social media? The swirl of life immersed in social
media begins and ends with ourselves as active human players
in it. We produce social media content, we consume it, and we
create and influence social media algorithms. Human practices
and tendencies feed the systems that produce feeds for us in
turn. In the end, our own careful human interpretation of these
feeds will produce knowledge about the mutual influence
humans and social media have on one another. The explosion
of social networking and Web 2.0 sites since the early 2000's
gives us an opportunity to examine how we do everything -
relationships, work, social life, politics, government, and even
life itself - through social media. This can tempt us to the
overwhelming conclusion that the study of social media means
the study of everything, everywhere. Luckily, we can always
return to the basics, beginning with what social media are by
definition.

What is / are social media, really? Consider the terminology.
The term media is the plural form of medium, which is
anything through which impressions or force are transmitted
to affect things on the other side. Social describes the kind
of media we are talking about because they relate to people
interacting. The term social media usually refers to digital
technologies that help people interact. So it's technically
correct to write "Social media are [awesome, stupid, elemental,
detrimental, whatever]." But it's also ok if you write "Social
media is [changing the world, turning my friends into zombies,
etc]" because the singular form is in common usage. I will use
the term "social media" as both plural and singular in this book.

7 | Introduction
This is the thing about social media: it is grounded in how
people talk and behave, not in rules set by any authorities.
Almost any standards at work in social media can be changed
by users if enough of us start pushing against those standards.
We create social media. Tech developers respond to us as they
create software apps, also known as software platforms. Then
we tweak their apps, using them in ways that developers never
planned because these unforeseen uses fit our lifestyles. Or we
choose other apps that fit us better. And then those developers
respond to us again.
And yes, social media does influence us too. But it can be
surprising how much of what we do online was in practice
in our society before social media became "a thing," and how
societal and cultural phenomena independent of technologies
weave their ways into our online behaviors. Unpacking these
influences requires explorations of history and theories in
communication, sociology, anthropology, economics, and
political science.

                                                                                 Introduction | 8
Section 3: Is this digital? Is this even
new?

Social media trends can seem as surprising and new as life on a
future planet. But they often turn out to be part of familiar cultural
patterns.

Human behavior today can appear utterly transformed by
digital technologies. When we look more closely, there are
many moments today that echo behaviors of the past before
digital technology played a key role. And there are many
societal changes that have a variety of causes, some playing
much larger roles than technology. Still, people love to claim
that technology has transformed society, perhaps because
they benefit from the claim, or because it makes changing the
world look easy with the proper tools. It isn't.
The impacts of social media in our world are complicated.
Misunderstandings around these technological platforms and
practices in our world are common outcomes of flawed
thinking or fallacies about this new force in our lives. In this
section, we will break down some of these fallacies behind

9 | Introduction
simplistic and exaggerated claims about social media in our
world.

Utopian and dystopian thinking are among the most fallacies
in thinking around social media. We are all familiar with
utopian visions of social media - as though entering the golden
gates of social media means leaving behind all the troubled
communication practices that came before. A utopia is an
idealized or perfect imaginary view of society. The utopian view
sometimes imagines social media as a miracle disconnected
from all prior human communication; other times, social
media represents a more evolved social media world, where
we have moved beyond all bias. The media theorist Clay Shirky
conjures utopias as he describes social media's effects on how
we organize, as though they might connect everyone in the
world. He is a great speaker; when I listen to him I feel
comforted by the humming machines watching over us,
extending our powers with God-like equanimity.

Conversely, it is also common to find social media use viewed
as the downfall of society - a dystopia, or imagined society
where everything is terrible. The increasing reliance of our

                                                                                Introduction | 10
society on social media for everyday communications looks
nightmarish to some. Teens never look up from their phones.
Computers make life-or-death decisions or at least remove
humans from making them. Our brains are rewiring to cut out
human emotions like compassion as we become robotically
trained to pursue likes and connect with people we never see.
Such dystopian thinking can make people jump to conclusions
and even deploy data and scientific research as hasty "proof"
of their extreme conclusions, leading to moral panics or fears
spread among many people about a threat to society at large.

Technological determinism is among the broadest fallacies
around social media use. Technological determinism is the
belief that technologies are fully responsible for grand shifts
in our world, instead of acknowledging the more complicated
interplay of forces behind the phenomenon in question. While
social media technologies have enormous effects on our lives,
human cultural and societal factors are usually also at play.
The following are two claims about social media that exemplify
technological determinism and explanation of their more
complicated realities.

Claim: Twitter "made" the Arab Spring.

A good example of hype around social media is in popular
misunderstandings about the Arab Spring, an explosion of
protests against governments in the Middle East in 2011.
Contrary to many claims in the media, Twitter was not
responsible for the Arab Spring. Twitter was an important tool
there, but relationships sustained in face-to-face interaction,
and old-fashioned protest in public spaces like Tahrir Square,
were the foundations of the Arab Spring, as researcher Paulo
Gerbaudo found and presented in his 2012 book Tweets and
the Streets. Zeynep Tufecki's research in the Middle East and

11 | Introduction
in activist movements with online components has also found
that while speed and ease were benefits of organizing
movements online, toppling regimes as protestors in the Arab
Spring accomplished required substantial offline interaction
including countless cups of tea. Video footage from the
Egyptian protests in media including the song lyrics and music
video #Jan2 reveal intensely organized physical encounters.

Claim: Youth are addicted to social media, and
this is a new phenomenon

Today's North American teenagers choose to spend much
more of their time with friends online, according to Pew
Research Center, while past generations socialized more in
person. However, there are many factors responsible for this
other than today's ubiquity of digital technologies. One factor
is that youth are not allowed to be out as much as they once
were. Today's youth deal with parents who hover more closely
and give them less freedom in public spaces than their parents
were given themselves, and curfews and other restrictions
remind teens that they are unwelcome in public spaces. For
her 2014 book It's Complicated, danah boyd conducted
qualitative research, including interviews with teens and
observations of their homes and neighborhoods. In her
research, she found that teens were using social media to cope
with physical restrictions on their mobility, pursuing social
relationships online from their homes. Yet despite the lack of
evidence around addiction, social media is associated with
health concerns for all users and especially youth, due to
content that exists only and the dynamics of its circulation and
our communications. As U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy
advised in 2023, "We don't have enough evidence to say it's
safe, and in fact, there is growing evidence that social media
use is associated with harm to young people's mental health."

To learn the truth: Rely on the science you
understand.

Meme by Ava Doubek, 2021  Sweeping claims about social
                          media often go to far, and leave
                          out important nuances. So how
                          do we navigate a world in which
                          social media is everywhere, and
                          science about it gives
                          complicated answers? To
                          understand the human condition
                          in a digital era, we must critically
                          consider claims of human
                          transformation by and revolution
                          through digital technologies. In
                          other words, it is important to
                          study what social media are
                          actually doing in our world, as
                          opposed to human assumptions,
                          hopes, and fears about them.

                                           Scientific research is a crucial tool
for understanding any phenomenon in our world, yet the
scientific methodology behind many claims around social
media is misleading or poorly understood by those spreading
it. Here is an example: claims that social media is "rewiring"
people's brains are often based on interpreted neuroscience
from entities like the UCLA Brain Mapping Center to support
these arguments. Yet neuroscientific findings require some
understanding of neuroscience and a critical approach;
without these, researchers have found that neuroscientific
findings can be used to add support to any claim, regardless of
its truth. Many turn to neuroscience when they want to add
weight to their beliefs about social media, but too often that
weight comes at the cost of validity and accuracy. On the other

15 | Introduction
hand, since the COVID-19 pandemic, in a 2023 study by the
National Institutes of Health that simply asked respondents
about loneliness and social media in an online survey, its use
found to be associated with loneliness--sadly, for those
attempting to use it to maintain relationships.

It is important to learn the ways these media really impact
how we communicate and behave, but we can achieve
considerable new understanding by using observations and
conversations or interviews as human research instruments -
this is the practice of qualitative inquiry or qualitative research.
We can ask ourselves and those in our lives how social media
shapes our world, and pursue the answers through looking,
listening, and carefully interpreting. What can we learn about
this new world of communication by simply sharing our stories
and impressions of our behavior on social media in our lives?
When we collect these accounts and analyze them for themes
- that is, when we examine social media and ourselves using
qualitative inquiry - we may not feel the need for neuroscience
to confirm our new knowledge.

Section 4: Infinite data, interpreted
information, and precious knowledge

Even if claims around today's technological "revolution" may be
overblown, our minds and information practices are certainly
changing as we use social networking sites. Among the
starkest of these changes is in how we deal with ways of
knowing about our world, through concepts in the discipline
of Information. To understand societal changes in which social
media plays a role, it is best to first understand the concepts
of data, information, and knowledge. Think of data as raw
material in the world of ideas and information concepts: a list

                                                                                Introduction | 16
of millions of likes on Instagram. A glimpse of a scene you
see walking down the street but do not yet fully understand.
Information is the bridge to making meaning from that data:
a research article interpreting findings from a study, or a
newspaper article making sense of observed phenomena such.
Knowledge is what we should ideally do with information. The
information is synthesized by considering it among all of our
understandings and experiences in the world to truly know it as
knowledge. The scene you saw on the street may be explained
by the newspaper article you read. However, you may also
realize from your own experience including conversations with
friends around the topic that the newspaper article author
presented a biased view of what you saw, or that you
understand things about the scene now than the newspaper
author did not.

The web allows us to take in limitless new data from many
sources, and to seek out information to make sense of that
data - although this will not always be good information. With
so many streams of information coming in, we have trouble
carefully forming knowledge, that deep sense of all we learn.
Knowledge is both the most important and the most ignored
stage of knowing in the digital age. In this interview for the
podcast Hidden Brain, computer scientist Cal Newport
describes deep work , or the act of sustained thinking and
creation, as one of the few forms of human labor that
computers cannot easily replace. On the other hand--as
Hidden Brain host Shankar Vendantam discovers when
Newport misses his first interview appointment for the
podcast--not communicating with others can be a privilege,
and may put those others at a disadvantage. This clues us in
that knowing can be seen as an individual or a social state, and
reminds us that epistemologies--ways of knowing, or how we
know what we know--vary widely across cultures. Meanings

Digital systems such as computers present us with a lot of new
data points. Computers can sometimes even transform these
data points into knowledge, such as by combining keywords
from social media posts into news stories automatically
emailed to you. However, to process what publics express on
that social media platform in the most valuable ways, posts
must be studied critically - are they bots? Are they deceptive?
- and carefully - what is the history behind this trend? What
are the unseen forces shaping it? Journalists and analysts and
many other interpreting forces online can help us make sense
of this data as information, but can we trust them? Is the
information true, and are there other ways of interpreting these
findings that we should also seek to understand? Most
importantly, what do we really know about this situation that
can serve us moving forward? How can it be applied to more
broadly explain phenomena in the world or predict interactions
in our world?

Questions around different levels of knowledge and their value
grow more acute with the rapid development of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) technologies including generative AI
programs like ChatGPT that generate new content in countless
shapes and formats. (See our chapter Me, Myself, and AI for a
deeper dive into how AI works.) However, even when driven by
powerful neural networks as AI can be, computer algorithms
and models rely on preexisting data and patterns to
understand the world. Computers do not think, or have
unpredictable or individual insights. Regardless of the
immense power invested in computing algorithms and
models today, computers cannot create knowledge in the way
I conceptualize it, and I do not believe they will ever be capable
of doing so. Only humans can, and only if we bypass the
proliferating distractions in our lives and give ourselves time to
think, study, question, and theorize.

19 | Introduction
In short, we are in an Information Age in which human
knowledge is growing rarer, even as data and information
proliferate. Your own knowledge must come through you. This
is why in this book you will be asked to reflect on your own
experiences, stories, and visions around social technologies.
This will not only help you to understand how social media is
impacting you; it will help shed light on a world that is often
broadcast, yet little understood.

A. Questions for qualitative thought:

    1. Write about a phenomenon you experience that
        you feel is distorted by its representation in media
        including social media. How do you know what
        you know about this phenomenon? If you can
        find information sources to support your
        understanding of it, cite or otherwise refer to
        them, and explain. If not, envision what
        information source[s] you could create based on

                                                                          Introduction | 24
             your knowledge of the phenomenon.
        2. Create a concept map of data, information, and

             knowledge you would consider to respond to the
             question above.
        3. Consider a belief you encounter commonly that is
             rooted in one of the fallacies described in this
             chapter. Describe the belief and link to or cite an
             example of flawed thinking, and identify the type
             of flawed thinking it is. Then, refute it.

   Consider It: What are the `reopen'
   protesters really saying? (Diana Daly,
   2020)

     In April 2020, shortly after the threat of coronavirus
     transmission led to the shutdown of many US
     businesses, protests ensued. I (author Diana Daly) was
     invited to use qualitative online research to help
     people understand the demands of "Reopen"
     protestors. Read this article and then consider these
     questions.

         1. How was the online qualitative inquiry
             conducted? Describe the process in your own
             words based on what was written.

        2. Write a summary of your knowledge today about
             the "Reopen" protests. Include what you learned
             from the article as well as other data and
             information sources and your knowledge and
             experiences. Consider especially truths you know
             about the world around these protests at this
             time that are not included in this article.

        3. This article is information for you, but I wrote it
             based on my knowledge. Draw a concept map of
             the data and information that go into your

The "anti-lockdown" and #Reopen protests in the U.S.
have powerful and secretive backers, but there are real
Americans on the streets expressing their opinions.
As an ethnographer - someone who studies cultural
participation - I'm interested in who those Americans
are, and why they're upset.
I spent the last week on what you might call an online
road trip, studying 30 posts of protest footage from
events in 15 cities. I found some shared themes, which
don't fit well with popular narratives about these
protests.
Protesters object to handouts but want to work.

                                                                          Introduction | 28
   1. Poverty is taboo, but work is
   `essential'

     Despite the economic toll the lockdowns are taking on
     America's poor, no protesters put their own poverty on
     display, such as posting signs asking for help.
     Instead, they held signs with more general language,
     like "Poverty Kills," or expressed concerns like the
     restaurateur in Phoenix, Arizona, who told a passing
     videographer he was worried about his 121 "suffering,
     devastated" employees.
     Their messages made clear that they didn't want to ask
     for a handout or charity - but they were asking to be
     allowed to work. Protesters across many states asserted
     their work - or even all work - was "essential."
     In one video from an "Operation Gridlock" protest in
     Lansing, Michigan, where activists planned to block
     traffic, a protester filmed out the window of his car
     when he drove past a sign saying "Give me work not
     money." The protester himself called out in approval,
     "Give me work not money, I hear that!"
     A young man at an Olympia, Washington event
     described work as a source not only of money but
     identity: "I wanna go back to work! That pride that you
     feel every day when you go home from work? That's
     like nothing that can ... be taken."
     Protest signs in Denver, Colorado included the plaintive

Need Groomers."

2. The threat of the virus is serious

Despite alarming news reports that protesters were
ignoring social distancing, many of the protesters
observed safety guidelines. Photos showed at least
some people wearing masks. A TikTok video recruiting
participants for Michigan's Operation Gridlock
encouraged protesters to be safe; drone footage shows
that most participants at the state capitol stayed in
their cars, away from other people.
Protesters' signs didn't really downplay the threat of
the virus but rather compared it with potential harm

                                                                          Introduction | 30
     from the lockdown. For instance, a sign in Denver was
     headed "Trading Lives" and featured a scale with virus
     deaths on one side, with unemployment, suicide, and
     homelessness on the other.

     Protesters in cars are, in general, observing social
     distancing guidelines.

   3. Anti-science displays are on the
   f ringe

     There were protesters at several rallies who wore anti-
     vaccination T-shirts and held signs suggesting they
     don't trust public health experts and scientists.
     But only one protest was dominated by that theme. At
     that one, on April 18 in Austin, Texas, hundreds of
     attendees chanted "Fire Fauci!" referring to Dr. Anthony
     Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
     Infectious Diseases, who has been a frequent public
     face of the federal government's efforts to fight the
     virus. That was also the rally where right-wing radio
     host Alex Jones, who runs a conspiracy-theory website,

31 | Introduction
drove around in a truck egging on attendees' chants
through a megaphone.
At the other events, it appeared protesters had been
expecting higher numbers of infections than actually
happened. Rather than seeing that as evidence of the
success of social distancing, they seemed to interpret
this as saying the science was no longer valid. "The
models were wrong" was on more than one sign,
suggesting protesters had paid attention to the
scientific models at first but had come to believe the
disease's seriousness had been exaggerated.

Idahoans rally to fight the outbreak's effects in ways
they have dealt with more familiar problems.

4. People want to fight the virus in
familiar ways

Even when protesters acknowledged the threat of the
virus, few were calling for medical experts to provide

                                                                          Introduction | 32
     the solution. I saw none of the demonstrators calling
     for more widespread testing, for instance.
     When they did express concern, protest signs coupled
     it with a desire to fight the contagion. In Boise, Idaho,
     one sign read "Freedom over Fear." In Denver, one said,
     "Don't let your mask be your muzzle."
     However, the protesters wanted to fight the virus in
     ways that were more familiar to them and, perhaps,
     more empowering: In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a giant
     green truck had "Jesus is my vaccine" scrawled on its
     side.
     Some protesters demanded governments allow people
     to make their own decisions and even displayed the
     pro-choice slogan "My Body My Choice." Others
     showed up with guns. One man in Frankfort, Kentucky,
     blew a shofar, a Jewish religious instrument made from
     a ram's horn blown at the start of a battle.

     Armed protesters were among the crowd in Michigan
     on April 30.

5. `Tyranny' depends on who governs,
not how

In many of the events across different states, protesters
objected to what they called "tyranny," and held up the
Revolution-era "Don't Tread On Me" Gadsden flag to
symbolize their resistance to government rules. They
were not objecting to President Donald Trump's April
13 declaration that, as president, his "authority is total"
over the nation.
Instead, they were objecting to governors' lockdown
rules, which they highlighted as overreaching their
power. Many protesters likened the government's
behavior to Nazis, with protesters adding "Heil" before
Democratic governors' names.
No male governor was targeted as viciously and overtly
as female Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. A widely
circulated poster depicted her dressed as Adolf Hitler,
giving a Nazi salute beside a swastika. Other
demonstrators talked about Whitmer as though she
were mothering them instead of governing them, like
one who insisted, "We're not her children!"

     Michigan protesters speak out about their concerns.

   6. Race is a factor

     One clearly visible theme in the #Reopen protests is
     how white the attendees are - but not just in terms of
     their own race. Their compassion also seemed limited
     to fellow white people. None that I saw were calling
     attention to the fact that the coronavirus doesn't hit all
     populations equally: Blacks and other racial minorities
     had less access to high-quality health care before the
     outbreak, and as a result are less healthy and less able
     to fight off the virus when it strikes.
     There was overt racism toward the Chinese, too,
     echoing words of the president and other political
     leaders, as on the Jefferson City, Missouri, sign that read
     "Tyranny is spreading faster than the China virus."

                          One or more interactive elements has

        humansrsocialmedia/?p=28#oembed-6

There's potential for a wider movement.

7. Divided and distanced, is it a
movement?

Most protesters did not refer to these protests as a
movement. I found just one video offering a vision that
they could form one. In that livestream from Operation
Gridlock, at one point the videographer shouted,
"`merica!"
Then, his unseen companion replied in a meditative
tone about the potential he saw on that road:
"Together we're strong, divided we're weak. That's the
establishment's biggest fear, for the people to get
together and not be divided. ... That's what they fear the
most. Because we have the power." It was not clear if
those people with the power included the much
greater number of people across America who were
sheltered in place.

Identity, once an elusive concept, is now
expressed overtly online.

DIANA DALY

       Key points
            · Identity online depends on what platforms
                allow you to express and what social norms
                influence you.
            · Self-presentation often involves our
                performances of other people's performances,
                or "performativity".
            · Authenticity is an ideal in self-presentation,
                but what appears to be authentic can be
                complicated, especially for people who are not
                part of dominant social, racial, and ethnic
                groups.
            · We present ourselves differently in each
                context we are in. Social media collapses these
                contexts, which can cause problems.
            · Social media intensifies our interactions by
                making them more persistent, visible,
                spreadable, and searchable.

                2023 from The Conversation)

This book is about people, including you - all of you, through
whom culture passes and takes new shape. You are a huge
part of social media - but factors come together to make you,
you? Identity is an iteration of the self that links individuals

                                                                                       Identity | 40
with how they are perceived by others. Identity combines how
you see yourself and how others see you, in an endless riff that
becomes your positioning in the world.

Section 1: Creating a profile

Male and female identities are
often the only options given to
users building an online profile.
This reinforces gender divisions
and performances enacted on
those sites, making people present
themselves as more strictly male
or female than they otherwise
might.

Let's imagine that you were told that you must create a profile
to continue reading this book or get a grade associated with
it. Who would you be? I imagine many of you would reply,
"Well, I'm not sure yet. Who is the profile for?" An audience or
a public with whom you interact shapes your identity at any
given time.
If the profile you are creating is simply for other students and
instructors in the class you are taking, perhaps you'd craft the
profile to reflect student teams or organizations you are part of;
or perhaps you would keep it vague if the student community

41 | Identity
on your campus feels large or impersonal. Compare that to
the profile you might craft for a professional site, like LinkedIn,
and you might see distinct differences. When students in my
courses share LinkedIn profiles they often look very different
from the same students' profiles in our Course Management
System (CMS). On our CMS students upload small, fuzzy photos
if they upload photos at all, whereas on LinkedIn those same
students look directly at the camera, proudly wear suits, and
boast of their accomplishments. In class, they want to blend in;
but when applying for jobs, they want to stand out.
And now compare your student and professional profile to the
profile you might use in online dating. Is it different? I imagine
so! Perhaps the focus moves to looking attractive and inviting
to attract those you are interested in.

Can the way someone uses online platforms tell us real
43 | Identity
information about their offline life? What are some examples
from your life that could be seen by others as not being the
"real" you?

You may find your self-presentation of your identity is limited
or enhanced by what options or features the platform you use
offers. These are affordances: cues in an environment that
communicate how to interact with features or things in that
environment and that can also communicate to others. A
button affords being pushed; Snapchat's snap streaks affords
keeping a visible running count of two people's interactions
with one another. Affordances can also be expanded, as they
often are by users on social media platforms. For example,
many platforms that do not afford the claiming of gender
identities other than male or female find users exploiting
creative ways to express gender fluidity.

Another example of identity limitations online--and in offline
systems relying on categorization--relates to race and
ethnicity, which are related but distinct concepts. Race is the
visible perception of whiteness, blackness, Latinidad, or other
categorization related to people's characteristics such as skin
color, while ethnicity refers to shared cultural expression or
history, potentially including elements like religion or
language. The racial and ethnic identities of many online
media users and particularly those in the US can be complex
combinations of races and cultures that are inadequately
reflected in categorization systems.

The decisions and challenges users face in creating online
identities get even more complex when it's time to post
content. Of course, users of social media are not always seeking
to express their most "realistic" selves. Some platforms are
desirable to users because they afford fantasy filters or the

                                                                                       Identity | 44
trappings of other identities. Video game avatars offer
compelling examples of profiles that embody other lives and
beings. But does that mean you don't spend much time
designing that avatar, since it's "not you?" Of course not; it has
become standard in the gaming industry to charge significant
sums for downloadable content to customize your avatar or
"skin" - because your avatar is you, for one or more gaming
publics. And that avatar and profile will influence how people
treat you in-game; they constitute your in-game identity.

Identities online are associate with financial capital and social
power, demonstrated most clearly by influencers --online
celebrities and microcelebrities whose popularity is leveraged
to sway the opinions, preferences, and purchasing decisions of
their audience. Meanwhile, online audiences seem to crave the
sense of "real"-ness, or authenticity, from online influencers
and personal contacts alike, associating that quality with trust
and closeness. As of 2023, the rising app BeReal was designed
around one daily invitation to users to capture what they are
doing during two-minute window, in a clear attempt to capture
authentic moments. This design may not be built around
simply wanting users to enjoy one another; authentic
moments are big business to those who buy and sell user data.
The pressure to be authentic can be particularly complicated
for people of color, who can be challenged with meeting
expectations online of what Mikaela Pitcan and coauthors refer
to as a "vanilla self:" exhibiting the trappings of conservative
whiteness, while simultaneously appearing to be authentically
part of their racial group. This identity conundrum is not
new--Signithia Fordham and John Ogbu found pressure to
"act white" existed for black students in the 1980s, well before
social networking sites existed--but social media's capacity to
gather varieties of audiences means different expectations of
how to behave "right" can all come together at once.

Section 2: Who are you? Offline?
Online? Across modalities?

Like the concept of information, identity is a notion that used
to be amorphous and philosophical. You couldn't easily set
"identity" apart from the human to whom the identity
belonged. Today, though, humans try to project every unseen
aspect of our lives onto the binary-minded digital world. And
that means the formerly shapeless concept of identity has to
take shape and if we want it to represent us online, we have to
know what we want and put it out there.
As a human, you don't just have one identity, or even one online
identity and also one offline identity. Our legal world and
policies from platforms like Facebook may limit people to
having one identity, but in life, both online and offline, we play
many roles and thus have many identities.

Section 3: Self-presentation,
Performativity, and Intersectionality

Two theorists have given us important tools to understand
these identity roles, although both theorists began writing
about these roles before the internet drew so many of us to
craft identities online.

Backtrack to the 1950s. Social roles in North America were rigid.
Then, sociologist Erving Goffman put forward a new way of
looking at identity in his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in
Everyday Life. Goffman wrote that we are all actors on a "social
stage," who play particular roles to create our identities and
that these roles change as we interact with different people
and situations. He also wrote that we can only really
understand ourselves when we look at all of the roles we play.

The cultural critic and feminist theorist Judith Butler
deconstructed the behaviors of identity roles expressing to
gender in her 1990 book Gender Trouble. Butler's theories
introduced the notion that gender itself is our playing of roles
like "boy," "girl," "man," and "woman," rather than these being
"natural" or connected to our biologies. Butler's concept of
performativity says that roles like gender are only constructed

                                                                                       Identity | 48
through our performances of them; they would not exist
without our acting them into existence.
Also beginning in the later 1980s and early 90s, civil rights
theorist, activist, and law professor Kimberle Crenshaw wrote
about how the power dynamics related to gender, race, and
other identity categorizations must be understood for how
they intersect with one another. Crenshaw's theory of
intersectionality has been crucial both as a tool in holistic
identity presentation and in recognizing that racism, sexism,
and other types of oppression do not take terms impacting
people, but instead work in compound ways.
If these theories have truth in them - and I believe they do -
what does this mean for our identities online? Well, our online
identities offer some additional evidence that gender and
other social roles are constructed. Many early internet adopters
were thrilled at the possibilities of expressing themselves
without being defined by their bodies. But what we have
learned from the maturing of the internet - aided by Goffman's
and Butler's theories - is that humans' "selves" have never
existed only in or on our bodies. We perform ourselves into
existence. And so when we perform ourselves into being online,
we carry much of that same old offline, embodied baggage
with us.

     Respond to this case study: The author describes how
     others' "perfect" self-presentation on Instagram made
     him withdraw from life's activities until he deleted
     Instagram and then learned more about his own
     identity. Have you experienced these feelings when you
     view other people's posts? Have you thought about
     how it might be harmful when you create posts that
     appear "perfect"? What are our responsibilities to
     others when we post on social media about ourselves?

Section 4: Context collapse

What if the profile I asked you to create above would be seen
on multiple social media sites? What if you learned the profile
would be associated with both your dating and your LinkedIn
profiles? And also visible to your network where you connect
with family? If this idea makes you feel uncomfortable, you are
experiencing the threat of context collapse. Context collapse
is when the different contexts or worlds you associate with
overlap or become mixed together. Friends snicker at an
embarrassing comment your mother makes in reply to your
photo online. A job recruiter sees an Instagram photo of you
partying and decides not to recruit you.

Political views expressed online can lead to particularly fraught
situations. White supremacists preparing to demonstrate in
Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017 discovered this when
AirBnB canceled demonstrators' Charlottesville reservations
after being alerted to the demonstrators' intentions. After the

51 | Identity
demonstrations, a campaign on Twitter to identify and publicly
shame protestors led to problems for some protestors, who
were prepared to promote white supremacy when surrounded
by sympathizers but not prepared to defend these views before
broader network contacts.
Context collapse is a constant danger as our online identities
proliferate. In her research, new media scholar danah boyd
found that teens develop strategies for dealing with context
collapse, including using coded language to communicate. It
is also common practice for people to try to keep their social
media accounts separate and hide some details or even entire
accounts from specific people and publics (as we'll discuss in
more detail in Chapter 3).
What keeps us using platforms even when our interactions feel
uncomfortable or compromising? Well, network effects, which
means that the more the platform is used - the more often
we go there to interact with family, friends, customers, or all of
these - the more valuable it becomes.

                                                                                       Identity | 52
When my `professor' and `mother' roles
overlap

                                I (Diana Daly, an author

                                of this chapter) deal

                                with context collapse

                                too. As a professor of

                                social media, I

                                encourage my students

                                to embrace their online

                                experiences as part of

                                their real worlds; in this

Identities collapse, including  professor role, I
those of author Diana Daly      recognize the value in

                                online interactions. And

then I head home from class to find my teenaged

son or daughter has been on social media for hours.

I freak out. Enough screen time! I shout. I don't care

what you're doing on there!

It feels hypocritical that I behave so differently in
these two roles. So why do I do it? I ask myself this a
lot, but I only have tentative answers; they have to
do with what I perceive as distinct responsibilities in
each role I play. When I teach, I don't want my
students to shut me out; I know from experience
that they are only willing to examine their online
interactions in my class when they feel comfortable
I'm not judging them. But my job as a mother is not
to help my son understand his online life. My job is

53 | Identity
       to keep him safe and healthy, and when he spends
       too much time in virtual worlds, his safety and
       health slip out of my control.

Section 5: Affordances of online
communication

You could say I am getting off easy with my own professor-
mother context collapse. My mother role is mostly an offline
role, so context collapse between my mother and professor
roles online is not frequent, and it doesn't last forever online.
Whatever roles you feel the need to keep distinct in your life, it
is likely their online expressions that you worry about the most.
There are four key affordances of online communication that
danah boyd emphasizes are far more pronounced than they
would be offline (It's Complicated, pg. 11). They are:

  · persistence: online content and expressions can last for a
      very long time

  · visibility: many audiences and publics may be able to see
      what you post over time

  · spreadability: it's nearly effortless to share content posted
      online

  · searchability: content posted online can be searched for

The four affordances identified by boyd raise the stakes of
online context collapse and communication in general. When
we consider who controls our data, and what we agree to when
we agree to use their services, it can be especially chilling to

                                                                                       Identity | 54
realize how easily what we express online might become visible
to unintended audiences. They may spread this information
to other publics, who will be able to search and find it easily.
Finally, this threat will persist for a very long time.

Core Questions

A. Questions for qualitative thought:

    1. In what ways have a social media platform's
        affordances on how you can present your identity
        felt restrictive to you? If you were in charge, how
        would you rewrite them?

   2. Write about an example of context collapse you
        have seen or experienced online. Who were the
        intended publics or audiences? How did the
        situation end up?

   3. Consider one or more aspects of yourself that do
        not feel like they have places to be expressed
        online. What is happening with these aspects of
        yourself that cannot be expressed online? How
        does it feel? Envision and describe or map out a
        platform where this type of expression can be
        shared.

Consider It: Social media still a closet
for too many LGBTQIA+ employees
(Amaral Lauriano, 2023 from The
Conversation)

shutterstock.
Lucas Amaral Lauriano, IÉSEG School of Management
Social media has revolutionised how we relate to our
colleagues and higher-ups, offering us opportunities to
showcase different aspects of our lives. Currently, three
out of four employees are connected with their
coworkers via social media platforms like Instagram

                                                                                 Identity | 64
     and Facebook. Be it in person or online, we all strive to
     present the best versions of ourselves, and social media
     allows us to filter these representations in ways that are
     specific to each platform. Twitter, for example,
     emphasises short, text messages, while Instagram
     focuses on images and videos. We also consider the
     diverse audiences and how they will interact with our
     content when determining our online behaviour.
     But what happens when lesbian, gay, bisexual,
     transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, or asexual
     (LGBTQIA+) employees, often marginalised in their
     workplaces, also need to decide whether or not to
     show their true selves online? As a management
     researcher interested in social issues, I recently delved
     into the experiences of gay male employees at the
     Brazilian subsidiary of a multinational automaker. My
     analyses of 480 hours of observation and 20 interviews
     with gay male employees uncover how they navigate
     online self-representation in the face of adversity.

   When professionalism equals
   heteronormativity

     I found that LGBTQIA+ employees adjust their social
     media use to align with the platforms' functions and
     their professional lives. This was particularly the case
     with Instagram and Facebook. Many individuals I
     interviewed reported feeling that the traditional notion
     of professionalism, which favours heteronormativity,
     affects their online self-representation. As a result,
     some employees feel compelled to employ exhausting

65 | Identity
tactics to hide or regulate their sexuality. The latter can
broadly be divided in three main strategies:
Fabrication, or the use of social media to create
counterfeit straight relationships. Gabriel (29, sales
executive) pretended for years that he had a girlfriend
named Paula. She was a friend who accompanied
Gabriel and his same-sex partner to social events and
frequently appeared in pictures with them. Gabriel
intentionally fabricated this narrative to fit his view of
professionalism on Facebook and Instagram, as he
explains:

       "When someone [from work] sent me a
       friendship request, I was like `Fuck, what am I
       going to do?. I thought that if I disclosed my
       sexuality I would be judged, professional doors
       would close, and colleagues would be talking
       about me all the time... So, I never posted
       anything about my real boyfriend."

In his evaluation, colleagues and superiors would have
access to information about his sexuality, impacting
how he is seen as a professional. He decided to hide
homosexuality as much as possible, leading to a spiral
of fabrication online.
Content control, or the careful curation of pictures,
comments, likes, and posts in a bid to tone down, or
even erase, traces and evidence of their sexuality.
Roberto (31, engineering coordinator) explains:

       "I usually do not post anything that could

                                                                                 Identity | 66
            indicate that I am gay; I post mainly scenic
            pictures from my trips."

     Carlos (29, human resources analyst), on the other
     hand, steers clear from posting in general. Others
     prefer to change their profile names to avoid being
     found, such as Mario (28, marketing analyst), who uses
     only his initials:

            "For years I kept my profile only with the letters
            ML, for Mario Lontra, my surname. I guess it was
            also a defence mechanism not to be found by
            colleagues at work."

     Audience control Through privacy configurations,
     individuals can target their posts at specific audiences,
     or limit the visibility of posts and comments on
     Instagram or Facebook. One of my interviewees, Diego,
     explains his reasons behind adopting the method:

            "My colleagues screenshot pictures of other
            possible gay colleagues and send them to our
            chat group saying, `Look at what this faggot is
            doing.' I've seen this happening, and I'd rather
            hide my profile to avoid them talking about me."

   When professionalism and
   homosexuality co-exist

     While some individuals strive to conceal or manage
     their homosexuality on social media, some of my

67 | Identity
participants feel that being openly gay and
professional is feasible. Through my research, I
identified two strategies adopted by those who choose
to publicly embrace their sexuality:

Community support building Rather than perceiving
social media as a threat, these users make the most of
it to network with other members of the LGBTQIA+
community, and downplay the idea of professionalism
as heteronormativity online. This can be achieved by
engaging with colleagues via comments, posts, and
likes. Expressing opinions and engaging in gay
discourse is less crucial for those who prioritise SNSs as
a means of community support. Ravi (32, marketing
executive) recognised the potential impact of being
open about his sexuality on his LGBTQIA+ peers:

       "I'm adopting a more activist posture. I met
       Mario at a meeting and he hugged me and said:
       `You don't know how happy I am to see one of
       ours being promoted!'"

Mario and Ravi are from different departments but
follow each other on Facebook and Instagram. Mario
could see that Ravi expresses his homosexuality online
and decided to talk to Ravi when he heard he had been
promoted. Social media, in this case, had a community
support building role for them.

Activism These individuals take advantage of social
media to amplify their voices and destigmatise being
gay, thereby also destigmatising their identities at
work. Mario shares content on social issues affecting
minorities and opposes Bolsonaro. He follows left-
leaning LGBTQIA+ political profiles and drag queens,

                                                                                 Identity | 68
     often posting pictures with his boyfriend. Gabriel is
     becoming more open about his sexuality, expressing
     himself at work and on Facebook and Instagram. He
     comments:

            "It was one of the best things I did. I changed
            my relationship status to "engaged to Luigi" on
            Facebook. If anyone had a doubt, it is very clear
            there. A lot of managers congratulated me on
            the engagement... when you are in a situation
            like that, you have to act so that others who
            suffer can see that they have support, and also
            that those who have prejudice see that it can
            end up badly for them."

     Open political activism has the notable advantage of
     helping dissociate professionalism from
     heteronormativity.

   Testing the waters across different
   social media channels

     Overall, my study found that employees' behaviours are
     not static over time. Instead, employees adapt their
     online behaviour based on workplace experiences and
     external feedback, constantly "testing the waters" to
     strike the right balance. As social media audiences
     evolve, LGBTQIA+ employees may shift their self-
     representations to align with the new norms of popular
     platforms. For instance, Twitter might be perceived as a
     more "niche" social media channel today. If that
     changes, and colleagues and superiors start using the

69 | Identity
     platform, LGBTQIA+ employees might also behave
     differently.
     Sadly, old-rooted ideas such as heteronormativity
     equalling professionalism are still pervasive. In an ideal
     world, sexual identity would not compromise
     professionalism, and there is still much work to be
     done before that is the case. Some positive examples to
     take inspiration from are IBM, Google and Deloitte, who
     have introduced structures for LGBQT employees to
     "be outspoken", "authentic" and "confident" about their
     sexuality.

Social media have evolved through
human cultural practices along with
technological affordances.

       Key points

            · Social media evolution bridges cultural
                practices and technological changes.

            · Blending old and new technologies is evident,
                such as the iconic shutter sound of digital
                cameras.

            · Diverse methods, beyond traditional media,
                have been historically used for broad
                communication.

            · User-generated content challenges the
                traditional one-way flow of information.

            · Major platforms like Google and Facebook
                profoundly influence industries, local
                economies, and cultures.

            · Web 3.0, driven by Tim Berners-Lee's mission,
                aims to give users control over their data,
                challenging the current paradigm of data
                ownership on social networks.

It is important to understand the relationships between older
media and social media. By older media, I mean the industry-
produced form of mass communication available in the US
before digital social media became a thing, such as television,
radio, newspapers, books, magazines, etc.
Older media can be referred to by other names, such as
traditional media. And then there are subcategories of older
media: broadcast media are one subcategory of older media,
including television and radio, that communicates from one
source to many viewers at once. Print media are a paper-based
subcategory of older media such as newspapers, books, and
magazines, that many users access.

Section 1: Media convergence

New digital media devices inherit many qualities and functions
of older media and forms of communication.

                                                                        Old to New Media | 74
                                  Here's an example: When
                                  your phone camera snaps a
                                  digital photo, it probably
                                  makes this sound or
                                  something like it. That sound
                                  is the sound of a shutter
                                  opening and closing. It is a
                                  sound that analog (non-
                                  digital) cameras have to
                                  make in order to function.

                                  Digital cameras don't have

                                  shutters; they function

                                  through chips that sense

                                  light coming into the lens. So

                                  Media scholar Henry Jenkins

calls this type of blending of old and new media "technological

convergence." (Convergence just means coming together

while moving through time.) Technological convergence is one

of several types of media convergence that Jenkins writes are

crucial to understanding our media world today.

Our technologies are full of convergences with older, traditional
media helping us make sense of new media. Some signs of
technological convergence go away over time as we become
more comfortable with technologies. For example, mobile
phones were once shaped more like analog phones, which
helped people feel more comfortable calling and talking on

affordances, they began to appear more like remote control
devices.

Section 2: The history of
communicating with many at once

Traditional media can be limiting when viewed as the only
influence on new social media. Think of a famous athlete's
Facebook post seen and raucously responded to by thousands
of people. Would that have been possible through traditional
media like a paper newspaper or radio broadcast? No. But now
imagine it in this ancient amphitheater in Syria (below). That
athlete could have shouted an insult at an opponent, and
gotten roars of approval and disapproval from the crowd.

Spectators may even have gotten into fights with one another.
Those types of interactions have a long social history.

Humans can communicate to broad and distant audiences
using many other means outside of print or broadcast media.
These include:

  · Vocalization and voice amplification
  · Staging for visibility
  · Oversize objects
  · Movement and dance repertoires
  · Songs and repetition

Some of these means of communication are very old. But the
smartest developers and users of new media let every possible
means of communication and visibility inspire their designs
and practices.

It is important to recognize that when we use media, we
communicate and spread our ways of interacting with these
media, not just the content delivered by the media. Theorist

                                                                        Old to New Media | 78
Marshall McLuhan referred to this with the phrase, "The
medium is the message."
When developers consider new features, they have to consider
what is present in the cultures that will interact with those
media. If a feature relies upon brand new methods of
interaction, it increases the likelihood that those media will
confuse users. See one interesting way people are looking at
new gestures developed in the digital age here.

Section 3: A millennial shift: Web 2.0
as user contributions

It is with traditional media in mind that New York University
Journalism professor Jay Rosen wrote The People Formerly
Known as the Audience in 2006. He claimed that these people
were taking over the media by using social media, and that
his statement was their "collective manifesto." He claimed the
people were speaking out to resist "being at the receiving end
of a media system that ran one way, in a broadcasting pattern,
with high entry fees and a few firms competing to speak."
Today's media exist in a different era from the turn of the

                                                                       Old to New Media | 80
millennium. Rosen reminds us that broadcasters used to refer
to viewers as "eyeballs." Think about what that metaphor
means. An eyeball has only two powers: To look, and to look
away. There are plenty of media content creators who still only
care about whether or not people are looking. But far more
now allow users to "take part, debate, create, communicate,
[and] share." It increases their viewership, for one thing. And
whereas the traditional media model involved advertising to
the individual, the new model involves persuading the
individual to advertise your product to their contacts.

The term Web 2.0 refers to sites that afford user contributions,
such as likes and votes. O'Reilly Media coined the term Web
2.0 in 2004; you can read about that here. They were referring
to social media sites popping up all over the web at that time.
These new sites were different than the static sites of the 1990s
and 2000s, the "Web 1.0" era. Web 1.0 sites would provide
information or maybe some entertainment, but would not
allow user contributions. You might say they were designed for
eyeballs only - although creative users found ways to connect
on Web 1.0, as we will learn when we learn about the Zapatistas
in Chapter 5.

Web 2.0 sites that emerged in the early 2000s offered new
capabilities, or affordances, to users. With Web 2.0 affordances,
users can weigh in with likes and votes. They can comment
or write their own posts. They can upload content, like images
and videos. They can connect with others, and offer their own
profiles and content to connect to.

Tools of change: Online cultures

The result of Web 2.0 is sites that are shaped by user cultures.
Culture is a concept encompassing all the norms, values, and
related behaviors that people who have interacted in a social
group over time agree on and perpetuate. Think about the
Web 2.0-enabled social media spaces you frequently visit.
Perhaps when you spend time on Tumblr, you see that people
talk about their emotions, and you talk about your own.
Meanwhile, in League of Legends chat, you don't talk about
your emotions because you know you will get attacked if you
do. On Facebook and LinkedIn, you might wear a high-
buttoned shirt, as you have seen is the norm; but you might
appear in a robe on Snapchat or a bikini on Instagram. Culture
encompasses how users talk to each other, present themselves
for one another, and take cues from and influence each other
as they collectively decide what's in and what's out.

Software platform developers do influence culture in their user
designs. For example, Facebook has its own shirt buttoned up
rather high, with its plain white background and limitations on
user customization of profiles. Online cultures do take some
cues from developers, and users are restricted or guided by
their affordances. But users have a lot of agency as they
develop and share cultures within these sites.

memes and internet culture that they do?\"\n\
nHe shrugged \"You have a good point. I think
you're probably correct, but we will know with
time.\"\n\nThis is a conversation I think
about a lot when I reflect upon my childhood
and my years so far as a young adult. Unlike
my parents, I grew up with technology around
me. I was a baby who watched The Wiggles on
television, and played Tetris on my dad's old
blackberry. It evolved into playing Webkinz
and Club Penguin, and the kids at school were
suddenly talking about making Twitter accounts
at grade 5. Twitter was something I wasn't
allowed to have back then. I had an iPod and I
played games on it where I gave people cool
hairstyles or took care of pet dragons. These
are all memories I look upon very fondly.\n\
nThen my relationship with technology changed
around middle school. I downloaded the social
media platform Instagram alongside all my
peers and I was playing around with it,
posting pictures of my pets. Soon enough,
microcelebrities that I would watch on youtube

                                                                  Old to New Media | 84
     started joining the platform, and soon I was
     scrolling though posts of these people who I
     idolized and realized: my body doesn't look
     like that.\n\nSoon, while trying to grow my
     photography account, I was getting sucked into
     this vortex of people's selfies where they
     didn't have any acne, unlike me; or their
     bikini pictures where their stomach was
     completely flat, unlike mine.\n\nI didn't
     realize the effect this was having on me until
     high-school where I will admit that I grew
     resentful of the way my body looks. It took a
     couple of photography classes for me to
     realize: most of this, if not all, was due to
     the magical powers of Adobe Photoshop. I
     unfollowed all of these Instagram models and
     instead pushed myself to follow more
     photography accounts that didn't make me hate
     my body.\n\nIt took a while for my
     relationship with social media to heal after
     that. However, my relationship with technology
     itself was flourishing. I was learning and
     creating art through Adobe Photoshop and a
     DSLR camera. I was using the photography
     studio at my school daily, and pushing out
     photos that I was extremely proud of.\n\
     nAround the time I went into college was when
     my social media healed enough to start being
     more active there. Instead of Instagram, which
     I post on rarely, I chose a more casual
     platform to me: Twitch. I started, and still

85 | Old to New Media
continue to, stream every Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday night.\n\nI met a few online
friends through that platform that I love to
play, stream, and converse with. Some live a
state over, and some live all away across the
world in Japan.\n\nI look forward to every
Tuesday through Thursday, excited to play
Stardew Valley, Uno, Valorant, Call of Duty:
Cold War, or any other game that I want to
play then; either on my own or with my
newfound friends. This schedule has given me
something to look forward to and a social life
that is fulfilling during the Covid
Pandemic.\n\nIn the very end, I would say my
relationship with tech is rapidly expanding,
with learning new things about stream
equipment and how to apply them to make my
stream more fun for both me and my viewers. I
also realize that I am not obligated to join
every social media platform and that is
perfectly okay. This newfound casualty of
Twitch as my main social media platform,
alongside all the friends I found through
there warm my heart and make me feel less
alone. I finally feel like I belong in the

Section 4: Dominating today: The
platform economy

       ...we are in the middle of a contest to define the
       contours of what we call the "platform society": a global
       conglomerate of all kinds of platforms, which

87 | Old to New Media
       interdependencies are structured by a common set of
       mechanisms."

- José Van Dijck and Thomas Poell, Social Media and the
Transformation of Public Space. Social Media + Society, July-
December 2015: 1.

Human-to-human connection is what social media is
supposed to be about. This belief, this hope, was an impetus
for this book when I began writing it in 2016. Historically, the
human-to-human connection was also what the internet itself
reached for, at least in the dreams of its creators. This Web 1.0 or
the "read-only" web as it would later be called was quite limited
in its reach compared to today. And yet...that potentially infinite
web of networks was still a wonder, and a site of international
connections and information wars (as you'll see in Chapter 5
with the Zapatistas).

Then what happened? Well on the surface, the web simply
became more social. By the early 2000s with Web 2.0 and the
"read/write web," great excitement and euphoria surrounded
the participatory cultures that blossomed on Web 2.0 sites. The
wonder of the web refracted across our lives, as we marveled
at how easily we could connect with one another. This world
of connections broadened our human imaginations and
expectations in irreversible ways. And many were overjoyed
when, by 2009, all this human connection grew teeth - which is
to say viability in the form of real currency exchange - with the
"sharing economy" that enabled regular folk to share services
and goods with one another. Platforms that began as tiny
businesses with few assets gained tremendous value as the
places to go to socialize online, with family, customers, friends,
and influencers. The more real or potential network
connections we had who used a platform, the more certain we
became that we had to use it too. In the platform economy,
the more, the merrier. These network effects continue to drive

                                                                       Old to New Media | 88
audiences to platforms at dizzying rates, rapidly eclipsing
product pipelines and business models that dominated in
times past.

Behind the visible connections, all this sociality also marked the
beginning of voracious - yet invisible - intermediaries. We were
giddily giving up our data in exchange for the peer-to-peer
exchange of services, a backroom exchange with implications
few would recognize for nearly another decade.

And today? Welcome to the "platform society," in which we
are connected to one another, but only through platforms that
derive immense power from and over our human connections.

What are platforms?

I define a platform as follows:

       Platform: An ecosystem that connects people and
       companies while retaining control over the terms of

89 | Old to New Media
       these connections and ownership of connection
       byproducts such as data.

Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon: These are the major
platforms that José Van Dijck argues have defined how society
and both public and private life function today. These platforms
reach deeply into human lives worldwide, with their publicly
understood purposes forming only a fraction of their activities
and profits. And rippling from these big four platforms are
smaller ones, which emulate their models in various ways.
These platforms and their stakeholders transform not just what
we buy and enjoy but what we need to live and thrive: how
we educate, how we govern and are governed, and how we
structure our societies.

       The impact of globally operating platforms on local and
       state economies and cultures is immense, as they force
       all societal actors--including the mass media, civil
       society organizations, and state institutions--to
       reconsider and recalibrate their position in public space.
       (Van Dijk and Poell, 1.)

Platforms have a profound effect on how societal life is
organized. Airbnb has changed not just the hospitality sector,
but also neighborhood dynamics and social life. Uber has not
only affected the taxi industry; it has affected the construction
of roads and public transportation services. We do not yet vote
through platforms, yet they have had irreversible effects on our
elections. Today almost every sector of public life has become
platformized: Higher Education. News and Journalism. Fitness
and Health. Hospitality. Transportation. And in these platforms,
transactions that are visible to consumers are undergirded by
other transactions in which consumers become unwitting
producers, their data a form of currency that subsidizes the
transactions they chose to engage in in the first place.

                                                                       Old to New Media | 90
Section 5: Future directions in the
online world

With so much human activity and cultural expression enabled
in Web 2.0, what is Web 3.0? Look this up on the web and
you will find no shortage of responses. There is no consensus -
no agreement among experts or among users. We don't even
know if we are already using Web 3.0, because it is hard to
know where Web 2.0 ends.

Surely one valuable perspective on the present and the future
of the internet would come from Tim Berners-Lee, who
invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989. (It was released
to the public in the 1990s; read more of that history here.)

Today Tim Berners-Lee has a new mission - to make sure we
really are connected by the internet. He describes what drove
him to pursue this mission this way:

       "Now people feel very disempowered, because the end
       result is that they're telling their computer who their
       friends are, and who's in the photographs, and planning
       things and designing things -- and those plans and
       designs and friendships are sucked up and held by
       these social networks. And they're not really social
       networks, they're silos."

The data you create as you move across online spaces is often
controlled and owned by those spaces. Berners-Lee is now
working to develop new methods of linking data across virtual
space without relying upon governments, corporations, or the
many others with an interest in controlling that data. You can
read more about this new mission in this TechCrunch article.

"Right now we have the worst of both worlds, in which people
not only cannot control their data, but also can't really use

91 | Old to New Media
it," Berners-Lee said in the project's announcement last year.
"Our goal is to develop a web architecture that gives users
ownership over their data."

Core Questions

A. Questions for qualitative thought:

    1. What are examples of qualities that digital media
        have inherited from traditional media other than
        those discussed here? Try to think of some that
        don't make the new media work better.

   2. Can you give an example of a site that allows you
        to create and share? And then of one that still
        treats you like little more than "eyeballs"? Explain.

   3. Do you think you are part of "the people formerly
        known as the audience?" Is it still possible to feel
        that you are only an audience (not a participant)
        in the age of social media? Or are there different
        terms we should use now?

   4. Try to conceptualize a platform that you use.
        Make it a place, familiar or imaginary. How is it
        organized? Who is there? How are they
        behaving?

                                                                  Old to New Media | 98

   Consider It: How will AI affect
   workers? Tech waves of the past
   show how unpredictable the path
   can be

     Personal computers started an information technology
     revolution. Will AI bring similarly dramatic changes?

     The explosion of interest in artificial intelligence has
     drawn attention not only to the astonishing capacity of
     algorithms to mimic humans but to the reality that
     these algorithms could displace many humans in their

101 | Old to New Media
jobs. The economic and societal consequences could
be nothing short of dramatic.
The route to this economic transformation is through
the workplace. A widely circulated Goldman Sachs
study anticipates that about two-thirds of current
occupations over the next decade could be affected
and a quarter to a half of the work people do now could
be taken over by an algorithm. Up to 300 million jobs
worldwide could be affected. The consulting firm
McKinsey released its own study predicting an AI-
powered boost of US$4.4 trillion to the global economy
every year.
The implications of such gigantic numbers are
sobering, but how reliable are these predictions?
I lead a research program called Digital Planet that
studies the impact of digital technologies on lives and
livelihoods around the world and how this impact
changes over time. A look at how previous waves of
such digital technologies as personal computers and
the internet affected workers offers some insight into
AI's potential impact in the years to come. But if the
history of the future of work is any guide, we should be
prepared for some surprises.

The IT revolution and the productivity
paradox

A key metric for tracking the consequences of
technology on the economy is growth in worker
productivity - defined as how much output of work an

                                                                Old to New Media | 102
     employee can generate per hour. This seemingly dry
     statistic matters to every working individual, because it
     ties directly to how much a worker can expect to earn
     for every hour of work. Said another way, higher
     productivity is expected to lead to higher wages.

     Generative AI products are capable of producing
     written, graphic and audio content or software
     programs with minimal human involvement.
     Professions such as advertising, entertainment and
     creative and analytical work could be among the first
     to feel the effects. Individuals in those fields may worry
     that companies will use generative AI to do jobs they
     once did, but economists see great potential to boost
     productivity of the workforce as a whole.

     The Goldman Sachs study predicts productivity will
     grow by 1.5% per year because of the adoption of
     generative AI alone, which would be nearly double the
     rate from 2010 and 2018. McKinsey is even more
     aggressive, saying this technology and other forms of
     automation will usher in the "next productivity
     frontier," pushing it as high as 3.3% a year by 2040.

     That sort of productivity boost, which would approach
     rates of previous years, would be welcomed by both
     economists and, in theory, workers as well.

     If we were to trace the 20th-century history of
     productivity growth in the U.S., it galloped along at
     about 3% annually from 1920 to 1970, lifting real wages
     and living standards. Interestingly, productivity growth
     slowed in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the
     introduction of computers and early digital
     technologies. This "productivity paradox" was famously

103 | Old to New Media
captured in a comment from MIT economist Bob
Solow: You can see the computer age everywhere but
in the productivity statistics.

https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/i96wK/10/

Digital technology skeptics blamed "unproductive"
time spent on social media or shopping and argued
that earlier transformations, such as the introductions
of electricity or the internal combustion engine, had a
bigger role in fundamentally altering the nature of
work. Techno-optimists disagreed; they argued that
new digital technologies needed time to translate into
productivity growth, because other complementary
changes would need to evolve in parallel. Yet others
worried that productivity measures were not adequate
in capturing the value of computers.

For a while, it seemed that the optimists would be
vindicated. In the second half of the 1990s, around the
time the World Wide Web emerged, productivity
growth in the U.S. doubled, from 1.5% per year in the
first half of that decade to 3% in the second. Again,
there were disagreements about what was really going
on, further muddying the waters as to whether the
paradox had been resolved. Some argued that, indeed,
the investments in digital technologies were finally
paying off, while an alternative view was that
managerial and technological innovations in a few key
industries were the main drivers.

Regardless of the explanation, just as mysteriously as it
began, that late 1990s surge was short-lived. So despite
massive corporate investment in computers and the
internet - changes that transformed the workplace -

                                                                Old to New Media | 104
     how much the economy and workers' wages benefited
     from technology remained uncertain.

   Early 2000s: New slump, new hype,
   new hopes

     While the start of the 21st century coincided with the
     bursting of the so-called dot-com bubble, the year
     2007 was marked by the arrival of another technology
     revolution: the Apple iPhone, which consumers bought
     by the millions and which companies deployed in
     countless ways. Yet labor productivity growth started
     stalling again in the mid-2000s, ticking up briefly in
     2009 during the Great Recession, only to return to a
     slump from 2010 to 2019.

     Smartphones have led to millions of apps and
     consumer services but have also kept many workers
     more closely tethered to their workplaces.

Throughout this new slump, techno-optimists were
anticipating new winds of change. AI and automation
were becoming all the rage and were expected to
transform work and worker productivity. Beyond
traditional industrial automation, drones and advanced
robots, capital and talent were pouring into many
would-be game-changing technologies, including
autonomous vehicles, automated checkouts in grocery
stores and even pizza-making robots. AI and
automation were projected to push productivity
growth above 2% annually in a decade, up from the
2010-2014 lows of 0.4%.
But before we could get there and gauge how these
new technologies would ripple through the workplace,
a new surprise hit: the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pandemic productivity push -
then bust

Devastating as the pandemic was, worker productivity
surged after it began in 2020; output per hour worked
globally hit 4.9%, the highest recorded since data has
been available.
Much of this steep rise was facilitated by technology:
larger knowledge-intensive companies - inherently the
more productive ones - switched to remote work,
maintaining continuity through digital technologies
such as videoconferencing and communications

                                                                Old to New Media | 106
     technologies such as Slack, and saving on commuting
     time and focusing on well-being.
     While it was clear digital technologies helped boost
     productivity of knowledge workers, there was an
     accelerated shift to greater automation in many other
     sectors, as workers had to remain home for their own
     safety and comply with lockdowns. Companies in
     industries ranging from meat processing to operations
     in restaurants, retail and hospitality invested in
     automation, such as robots and automated order-
     processing and customer service, which helped boost
     their productivity.
     But then there was yet another turn in the journey
     along the technology landscape.
     The 2020-2021 surge in investments in the tech sector
     collapsed, as did the hype about autonomous vehicles
     and pizza-making robots. Other frothy promises, such
     as the metaverse's revolutionizing remote work or
     training, also seemed to fade into the background.
     In parallel, with little warning, "generative AI" burst onto
     the scene, with an even more direct potential to
     enhance productivity while affecting jobs - at massive
     scale. The hype cycle around new technology restarted.

   Looking ahead: Social factors on
   technology's arc

     Given the number of plot twists thus far, what might
     we expect from here on out? Here are four issues for
     consideration.

107 | Old to New Media
First, the future of work is about more than just raw
numbers of workers, the technical tools they use or the
work they do; one should consider how AI affects
factors such as workplace diversity and social
inequities, which in turn have a profound impact on
economic opportunity and workplace culture.

For example, while the broad shift toward remote work
could help promote diversity with more flexible hiring, I
see the increasing use of AI as likely to have the
opposite effect. Black and Hispanic workers are
overrepresented in the 30 occupations with the highest
exposure to automation and underrepresented in the
30 occupations with the lowest exposure. While AI
might help workers get more done in less time, and
this increased productivity could increase wages of
those employed, it could lead to a severe loss of wages
for those whose jobs are displaced. A 2021 paper found
that wage inequality tended to increase the most in
countries in which companies already relied a lot on
robots and that were quick to adopt the latest robotic
technologies.

Second, as the post-COVID-19 workplace seeks a
balance between in-person and remote working, the
effects on productivity - and opinions on the subject -
will remain uncertain and fluid. A 2022 study showed
improved efficiencies for remote work as companies
and employees grew more comfortable with work-
from-home arrangements, but according to a separate
2023 study, managers and employees disagree about
the impact: The former believe that remote working
reduces productivity, while employees believe the
opposite.

                                                                Old to New Media | 108
     Third, society's reaction to the spread of generative AI
     could greatly affect its course and ultimate impact.
     Analyses suggest that generative AI can boost worker
     productivity on specific jobs - for example, one 2023
     study found the staggered introduction of a generative
     AI-based conversational assistant increased
     productivity of customer service personnel by 14%. Yet
     there are already growing calls to consider generative
     AI's most severe risks and to take them seriously. On
     top of that, recognition of the astronomical computing
     and environmental costs of generative AI could limit its
     development and use.

     Finally, given how wrong economists and other experts
     have been in the past, it is safe to say that many of
     today's predictions about AI technology's impact on
     work and worker productivity will prove to be wrong as
     well. Numbers such as 300 million jobs affected or $4.4
     trillion annual boosts to the global economy are eye-
     catching, yet I think people tend to give them greater
     credibility than warranted.

     Also, "jobs affected" does not mean jobs lost; it could
     mean jobs augmented or even a transition to new jobs.
     It is best to use the analyses, such as Goldman's or
     McKinsey's, to spark our imaginations about the
     plausible scenarios about the future of work and of
     workers. It's better, in my view, to then proactively
     brainstorm the many factors that could affect which
     one actually comes to pass, look for early warning signs
     and prepare accordingly.

     The history of the future of work has been full of
     surprises; don't be shocked if tomorrow's technologies
     are equally confounding.

113 | Regulation
On February 8, 1996, from the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland, an American rock lyricist and state legislator's son
named John Perry Barlow issued a "Declaration of the
Independence of Cyberspace."
Back home in the United States, Congress had recently passed
the Communications Decency Act, in which the largely elderly
and analog legislature asserted its power over the still nascent
Internet. Barlow protested that they should keep out. He
believed the Internet was a wholly new kind of place, one that
Congress had no right to govern. Evoking language from the
country's original Declaration of Independence, he wrote:
Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did
not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world.
Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that
you can build it, as though it were a public construction project.
You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our
collective actions.

        humansrsocialmedia/?p=2170#oembed-1

Despite Barlow's complaint, government regulation has

                                                                                  Regulation | 114
shaped the Internet in profound ways. The Internet itself was
the product of a military research program, and government
decisions made it publicly available in the first place. Since
then, public policy (or the lack thereof) has affected users' daily
experience of social media, as well as the fortunes of
companies that reap profits from it.

Even in 1996, Barlow need not have been so worried. The
following year the US Supreme Court struck down much of
the Communications Decency Act for violating the First
Amendment of the Constitution. One part of the law that
remained standing has since become famous. It is known
simply as Section 230. This provision protects online platforms
from being sued for most of the content that users post,
freeing the platform's owner to moderate as they see fit.
Without this law, social media as we know it might not have
been possible. Internet companies would have to behave more
like offline newspapers and television stations, carefully vetting
everything they publish. Section 230 meant that, at least in
certain ways, the Internet could play by its own rules, just as
Barlow had hoped.

Through the very law that he objected to, the Internet got
a kind of declaration of independence. But that happened
because of, not despite, government policy.

This chapter will explore how social media has been and
continues to be shaped by the often invisible effects of legal
regulation--in increasingly diverse ways around the world.

Section 1: What media regulation
does

Whenever media has had influence over cultural and political

115 | Regulation
life, governments have sought to regulate how media
circulates. Pre-digital governments established rules about the
production of manuscripts and required licenses for printing
presses. The US news industry benefited early on from a postal
subsidy, which reduced costs for delivery, along with the
relatively expansive free speech allowed under the First
Amendment. As telegraph lines enabled instantaneous
communication across long distances, governments
attempted to challenge the growing power of companies that
controlled the lines.

The rise of radio and television came with new sets of rules
about technological standards, political speech, and
acceptable content. For instance, between 1949 and 1987 in
the United States, the "fairness doctrine" required broadcasters
to include diverse viewpoints on controversial social issues.
Federal law prohibited content deemed obscene from public
airwaves but was more permissive with private cable networks.

Some countries have regulated by creating high-quality,
government-funded public media that retained
independence from politicians in power. The best-known
example is the British Broadcasting Corporation, or BBC, which
was founded in 1922. This kind of public media can put pressure
on private companies to meet higher standards of quality.

Meanwhile, governments have used antitrust law to prevent
companies from becoming too powerful, and media
companies have often been targets of antitrust action. For
instance, US regulators used antitrust enforcement to break up
the Bell telephone system in 1982, followed by actions against
Microsoft in the 1990s and Google in the 2020s. Some scholars
have argued more recently that antitrust law should have been
used more for social media, such as by preventing Meta from
acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp.

Media regulation enables and constrains the media available

                                                                                  Regulation | 116
to us in various ways. It limits what content is allowed, keeps
corporate power in check, imposes technological standards,
and establishes government-funded media outright. For many
media consumers and producers, the role of regulation may
not be obvious in their everyday lives if they never learn to see
it, but it is touching their media lives nonetheless.

Section 2: How regulation shaped
early social media

As online social media became increasingly mainstream in the
2000s, many of the major platforms were based in the United
States, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The US
government regulated the new social media with a light touch
compared to broadcast media. Leading politicians and Silicon
Valley entrepreneurs believed that important decisions should
be left to the free market rather than to government. Ideas
like the "independence of cyberspace" were influential. But
regulation continued having far-reaching effects.

117 | Regulation
Section 230 became, in the words of legal scholar Jeff Kosseff,
"the twenty-six words that created the internet." Because of
this law, content moderation was largely in the hands of
platform companies, except in the most violent or abusive
cases. Another legal scholar, Kate Klonick, argues that
platforms became "the new governors," usurping
government's traditional regulatory role. Section 230 has been
widely criticized, both for giving platforms too much power to
censor user posts and for not requiring them to censor more.
But many experts also fear that without Section 230 the whole
social media industry would be in peril.

One significant limit on Section 230's protection of platform
companies was the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or
DMCA. If you have ever experienced an automated removal
after posting someone else's copyrighted material, like a song
or video clip, this is why. The DMCA raised the prospect of
major fines for copyright infringement on the Internet. It also
encouraged platforms to develop ways to pay copyright
holders for the use of content that they own. The DMCA was
a severe blow to the once-widespread belief that digital
technology made copyright obsolete, that "information wants
to be free," as the early Internet advocate Stewart Brand once
claimed.

Another important kind of regulation that has shaped social
media might not seem relevant to media at all: the regulation
of finance. Most major social media platforms grew thanks to
a kind of financing called venture capital. This practice involves
large, risky investments in companies that are expected to
grow very quickly and take over entire markets. Changes to
financial regulation in the 1970s and 1980s brought vast sums
of money into venture capital, setting the stage for the growth-
centered, all-or-nothing culture that dominates social media
platforms today.

                                                                                  Regulation | 118
Finally, the regulation of work has also affected social media.
In the early days of online communities it became a practice
to compensate users with discounts for serving as moderators
of chat rooms and forums. But labor regulators became
concerned that this amounted to a violation of labor law, since
the compensation typically did not reach the minimum wage
and failed to include other benefits that employees are entitled
to. Subsequently it became a norm that moderators of online
communities are expected to serve as volunteers. More
recently, the influencer economy has provided new ways for
users to monetize their communities, such as through third-
party sponsorships or revenue-sharing with the platforms.

As the social media economy has matured, leading companies
have shifted from preferring to ignore government to spending
many millions of dollars every year on influencing government.
Much of this spending seeks to block changes that the industry
sees as threatening.

Although US law has already shaped social media profoundly,
the Internet has generated less ambitious regulation than
radio and television did. At the same time, countries that have
become dependent on US-based platforms are increasingly
seeking ways to regulate their citizens' online lives more, as
they see fit.

Section 3: A deepening "splinternet"
around the world

While media regulation usually takes place in the context of
particular national governments, it is also an international
concern. During the mass media era, for instance, people in
many countries viewed the influx of Hollywood productions as
a threat to local culture; some actively restricted the circulation

119 | Regulation
of Hollywood films to encourage homegrown entertainment
industries. A 1980 United Nations report, Many Voices, One
World, provided an international framework for policies to
protect what came to be called communication rights--the
rights of all people to express their cultures and beliefs, and
to access the media necessary to be heard. This framework
involved seeking a balance between the free flow of
information and the ability for local communities to have
collective control over their media ecosystems.

Similar concerns have returned in the age of the Internet. With
most social-media platforms headquartered in just a few
countries, critics have began describing the online economy
as digital colonialism: a situation where a wealthy few can
dominate others politically, economically, and culturally. Just
as earlier forms of colonialism extracted valuable raw materials
from poorer countries, the argument goes, digital platforms
make money from the social interactions of people whose
societies do not control or benefit from those platforms. When
the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed the extent of US
spying on the major platforms in 2013, both allied and
adversary countries sought ways to protect their secrets and
their citizens.

The Internet is increasingly becoming what some have called
a splinternet. A growing number of governments are asserting
their sovereignty over digital space, resulting in an Internet that
is more fragmented in how users experience it. The splinternet
is producing social networks that are more diverse and more
accountable to local societies, but it also raises the danger of
greater censorship. This section will review some of the ways
that the splinternet is splintering more deeply through
regulation.

One type of regulation seeks consumer protection. This
approach has been the focus of lawmakers in the European
Union. The EU's 2016 General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), for instance, imposed a variety of rules on tech
platforms for the management of their users' data. The GDPR
requires foreign companies to keep data about EU citizens in
the EU, and it expects platforms to obtain permission from
users for all data collected. While the GDPR was mainly
designed to affect EU citizens, it has shaped platforms'
behavior globally. (Whenever you get a pop-up on a website
asking you to let it track you with cookies, that might be
because of the GDPR.) In 2022, the EU passed another
sweeping regulation, the Digital Services Act, which seeks to
reduce the spread of disinformation online. In these ways,
European governments have become more active regulators
of US-based social media giants than the US government has
generally been.

Another strategy for regulation involves forms of taxation,
which attempt to capture some of the value that foreign
platforms generate from local economies. In Australia and
Canada, governments have passed requirements that social
media companies compensate news organizations when users
post their content. Meanwhile, countries such as Uganda and
Lebanon have tried (and ultimately failed) to impose laws on
their own citizens for using social media platforms. While the

121 | Regulation
Australian and Canadian laws were attempts to fund domestic
news production, the user taxes were widely seen as a form of
censorship by discouraging communication that could lead to
unrest.

Censorship has taken various forms across the emerging
splinternet. Countries such as India and Iran have used Internet
blackouts--simply shutting down the Internet for certain
periods of time--to inhibit protest movements. India's
government has also used the employees of foreign social
media companies as leverage; if companies do not reply with
the government's requests for the removal of content or
accounts, the government has threatened local employees
with arrest. In addition to blocking online speech, many
countries have developed armies of humans and bots to flood
networks with pro-government or distracting content,
drowning out the dissent.

Perhaps the strongest force driving the splinternet is China's
Great Firewall. This combination of technical and legal barriers
has produced a Chinese Internet partially cut off from what
most of the world can see. Major US platforms such as
Facebook, Instagram, and X, as well as Google and Wikipedia,
are not available on the Chinese Internet. But the great firewall
is not merely a tool of censorship, as Western critics tend to
describe it. By preventing foreign access to its growing
consumer market, China has developed the only major
platform economy that poses a significant challenge to US-
based companies. Chinese platforms such as WeChat have
developed features that US platforms have sought--often in
vain--to copy. Regulators in China have also developed rules for
ensuring certain privacy protections, limiting corporate power,
and overseeing the algorithms that choose what users
encounter. China has also exported its Great Firewall
techniques to other countries seeking more control over their
Internet, such as Iran and Russia.

                                                                                 Regulation | 122
When TikTok became the first Chinese-owned social media
platform to gain mass adoption in the US market, the US got
a taste of its own medicine--a taste of what others had long
been calling digital colonialism. Elected officials began to
worry about how the popular app could become an asset for
the Chinese government in a conflict, whether through its data
on US users or its ability to manipulate flows of information.
States and the federal government began restricting use of the
app among government employees and, in some cases, entire
populations. Although the US has often championed an open,
unfettered Internet, it is revealing that its leaders have reacted
in ways similar to those of other countries when faced with
similar threats.

Section 4: Major tradeoffs of media
regulation

Regulating social media always involves tradeoffs. A tradeoff
occurs when no course of action is perfect and decision-
makers must find a balance among competing values. This
chapter ends with a few of the major tradeoffs that seem to
arise with every attempt to regulate social media.

Free speech vs. safety. Free speech sounds good in theory, but
it can less so in practice. One person's free speech can result
in harm to other people, making them feel less comfortable
speaking the truth as they see it. At the same time, efforts
to help users feel safe through rule-making can dampen the
liveliness of an online community. Online networks are
powerful precisely because they are less constrained than
earlier forms of media. But truly free speech is only possible
within the context of some constraints. To experience some of

123 | Regulation
these tradeoffs for yourself, try playing the free game Trust &
Safety Tycoon.

Free enterprise vs. democratic oversight. The Internet as we
know it arose through both government investment and
private entrepreneurship. Startup companies have built the
most successful social media platforms, exhibiting a kind of
creativity and risk-taking that governments often lack. This is
partly why Section 230 put a lot of trust in platform companies
to moderate content based on the pressures they get from the
market. Yet when startups become successful, their appetite
for risk can have enormous consequences for society, mental
health, the economy, and politics. Managing potential risks is
why the GDPR sought to strengthen government control over
platforms, especially foreign ones. Regulators seek to find the
right balance--to foster a vibrant market of ideas and products
while ensuring that the market plays by rules determined
through democratic processes.

Local control vs. global standards. Part of the Internet's early
promise was to bring people together across borders. In
countries that have historically restricted free speech, social
media platforms based abroad can give people a way to say
what they otherwise could not. But as the advocates of
communication rights might remind us, global flows of
information can threaten local cultures. Governments have
increasingly sought to assert local values and priorities over
those of the major global platforms. But human rights
advocates also worry that the quest for local control will result
in losing the opportunity for a more free, interconnected world.

No genuine tradeoff is easy; it wouldn't be a tradeoff if it were.
The major challenges of regulation involve trying to find
balance in dilemmas where the answer is not obvious. Societies
will have different ideas about what that balance should look

                                                                                 Regulation | 124
like--and those differences are splintering the Internet into
many pieces.
Regulation has already, and always, shaped the social media
we already experience. The effects of regulation can be hard to
see. But learning to see regulation helps us recognize that the
media ecosystems around us are the result of choices--choices
with both intended and unintended consequences. To see the
regulatory choices made in the past can help us see more
clearly how our choices today might affect the future.

   Read It: Protect Elders! Ban
   Television!!

     (Some thoughts on the efforts to regulate children's
     use of social media)

131 | Regulation
Have you noticed how many people ages 65+ watch
television every day? According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, almost 90% of those in this age bracket
watch TV Every.Single.Day!!!! ::gasp:: And that data was
collected before the pandemic! By <hand-waving logics
of a moral panic>, it must be so much worse now!
And they don't just watch a little bit. According
to Nielsen, before the pandemic, these elders were
watching over 7 hours a day of television! Our elders are
glued to their boob tubes.
Television is a serious problem! Their brains are wasting
away. Their health is suffering. Their ability to maintain
friends is declining. They're unable to recognize
disinformation. Elders' brains are not fully baked
anymore; they can't handle television. This foolish
medium is making fools out of our elders, making
them unable to participate responsibly in a democratic
society. We must put a stop to this. We must stop TV!

                                                                           Regulation | 132
     And if we can't stop TV, we must prevent them from
     watching it!
     It is time that we protect our elders by unplugging
     them. Clearly they won't do it themselves. And clearly
     we can't figure out how to regulate television. So we
     must regulate our elders' use of television. For their
     own good!

            Going forward: Only those under 65 should be
            allowed to watch television.

     Now, I know that our elders won't see how important it
     is that we do this to them for their own good so we
     need to develop newfangled surveillance technology to
     ensure that no one over 65 can turn on their television
     set. Sure, that technology might be a little creepy, but
     how bad can it be? It's not like age verification face
     scanning technologies could be racist, right!?! And
     sure, some of those sneaky elders might think that they
     can trick the system by getting plastic surgery or
     wearing makeup, but we can put a stop to that too,
     right? We just need to collect more data from them. I
     mean, what could go wrong if we collected their name,
     date of birth, and social security number? That way
     we'll know that they're really who they say they are.
     Those sneaky elders.
     Le sigh.

What is New is Old

For over a decade, I studied how teenagers use social
media. I had a front row seat to multiple moral panics. I
even wrote an entire book dedicated to unpacking said
moral panics: It's Complicated: The Social Life of
Networked Teens. I was also a co-lead on a task force on
internet safety where we were asked to identify the
dangers that youth were facing and identify
interventions that would help. With the help of an
amazing advisory board, Andrew Schrock and I scoured
the research space trying to map out the different risks
teens faced vis-a-vis solicitation, harassment, and
problematic content. Little did I understand at the time
that my real job was to "prove" that age verification
technologies were the "solution" to all online safety
problems. I learned that lesson the hard way when our
research led us to a different set of recommended
interventions. This lesson was pounded into me when a

                                                                           Regulation | 134
     state Attorney General yelled at me to "go find different
     data" and when a Frontline reporter told me that she
     was encouraged to investigate my efforts to show that I
     was falsifying data to defend tech companies. (She
     concluded I was not falsifying data and the story never
     happened.)

     But here we are again. A new moral panic is unfolding
     around teenagers' use of social media. And once again,
     the "solution" seems to be to restrict access and use
     age verification technologies to enforce this approach.
     A few weeks ago, Utah took the first stab with a law
     that prohibits minors from accessing social media
     "without parental permission." At first blush, this looks
     like an extension of the federal Children's Online
     Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) that requires for-profit
     websites that collect data about children under 13 to
     get permission from parents.

     COPPA seemed like a good idea at the time it was
     passed back in the 1990s. In practice, COPPA is the
     reason why all sites require you to be 13+ to join. Of
     course, every social media company knows children
     under the age of 13 are lying about their age to get
     access to their sites. A decade ago, Eszter Hargittai,
     Jason Schultz, John Palfrey, and I decided to figure out
     what parents thought about this. We quickly
     discovered that parents teach their kids to lie to get
     access to social media. So much for that being
     effective. (Full disclosure: I created dozens of accounts
     for my kids for different sites during the pandemic.
     Over and over, I've been stymied by the processes of
     parental approval and just given up and given them a
     false birthdate.)

135 | Regulation
Utah's law goes beyond COPPA because it's not just
worried about data privacy and advertisement. It's
centered on a purported mental health crisis that kids
are facing, supposedly because of social media.

All of this seems to connect back to a dubious
interpretation of a Centers for Disease Control report
on "Youth Risk Behavior." The report is super
interesting. It turns out that teenagers are having less
sex (although those who are might be engaged in
more risky sex). It also turns out that bullying at school
declined during the pandemic (duh) but that bullying
online didn't go up or down even then.

But the thing that caught the eye of regulators was
that mental health seems to have skyrocketed in
recent years. I looked at this data and shook my head.
My head swirled thinking about the pandemic, the rise
in financial instability and food scarcity in some
communities, the rising costs of college, the rise in
visible hate speech, anti-trans and anti-abortion
legislation, the fear kids have of a mass shooter at
school, and a slew of other trends that I hear young
people angst about. But apparently regulators
preferred a different interpretation. They looked at this
and went: "blame social media!!!"

Jessica Grose took many of these interpretations to
task in her op-ed "Stop Treating Adolescent Girls as
Emotionally Abnormal." I want to call particular
attention to her colleague's remark: "The most
predictable thing in the world is for people to respond
to this article with their own reasons for why this is
taking place based entirely on their own specific hills
on which they have decided to die."

                                                                           Regulation | 136
     Still, most news coverage of these stories were full of
     sheer panic. WashPo responded to this study with a
     story titled "The crisis of student mental health is much
     vaster than we realize." Their editorial board followed
     up with a note that "America's teens are in crisis. States
     are racing to respond." My immediate thought was: are
     they? They're looking to ban social media as though
     that's the cause of this crisis. As though if social media
     goes away, the problem will go away. A Financial Times
     reporter took it to the next level, conflating correlation
     and causation with the headline that "Smartphones
     and social media are destroying children's mental
     health" (note: the story itself is full of hedge language
     like "may"). And then a writer at The New Yorker
     penned a piece entitled "The case for banning children
     from social media" that hinges on his own experiences
     as a parent.

     I cringed. One basic rule of research is never to take
     one's personal experiences as extrapolate based on
     them. And one thing I learned as a researcher of young
     people is that parents will always look for something to
     blame in a way that minimizes their own agency. And I
     get it. Parenting is haaaard. And emotionally
     exhausting. And guilt-inducing. It's soooo much safer
     to justify the situation that's frustrating you by blaming
     structural conditions that you can't do anything about.
     But it's not honest. And it doesn't hold up empirically.

     The CDC survey offers sound empirical evidence that
     young people are currently reporting higher levels of
     duress. There's also a lot of other empirical signal that
     mental health struggles are on the rise. Those who
     follow these trends over decades aren't be surprised.

Adults are also more anxious and more depressed right
now. It turns out that tends to impact kids. Financial
instability, political polarization, food scarcity,
geopolitical conflict, and many other factors tend to
correlate with anxiety and depression, even if causality
is messier. Lots of trend lines are all over the place right
now on lots of different measures.

Two "new" factors are harder to evaluate. One is the
pandemic. Researchers generally expect this to have
negative repercussions within community but it'll take
a lot of work to tease out what is the pandemic directly
and what are ripple effects (e.g., financial instability).
The other new one that has become the modern day
boogie many is whatever the new technology is. Social
media (and, more recently, mobile phones) have been
favorites for the last decade.

My research consistently found that teens turn to these
technologies to connect with others, especially when
they were struggling. Surprise surprise, when kids were
stuck at home during the pandemic, they wanted to
talk with their friends via phone, social media, and in
video games. When young people feel isolated, they
look for others like them in various online fora. And so,
yes, there will be a correlation between certain kinds of
online behaviors and mental health states.

Where things get dicier concerns causality. Chicken
and egg. Does social media cause mental health
problems? Or is it where mental health problems
become visible? I can guarantee you that there are
examples of both. But here's the thing.... Going to
school and church are often a "cause" of mental health
duress. Parents and siblings are often a source of

                                                                           Regulation | 138
     mental health duress. No one in their right mind would
     argue that we need to prevent all youth from attending
     school or church or living with their parents or siblings.
     We take a more tempered approach because there are
     also very real situations in which we need to
     remove some children from some environments
     (namely abusive ones).

     So why do we want to remove ALL children from social
     media?

     This is a story of control, not a story of protecting the
     well-being of children.

     A century ago, we forced teenagers into compulsory
     high school to prevent them from being able to
     fraternize with older adults because we were afraid
     that 16yos would compete with adults for jobs as the
     Great Depression was unfolding. Fifty years ago, moral
     panics around comic books normalized a world in
     which we restricted children's access to content. Can
     we admit that much of this content was political in
     nature and those who restricted it opposed those
     politics? Now we're back to book banning and "don't
     say gay" frames. This is not about children's mental
     health. This is about preventing children from being
     active members of our contemporary political polis.
     This is about using rhetoric around children's
     "innocence" to ensure that they don't encounter views
     that politicians don't want them to have. This isn't new.
     This is as old of a strategy as it gets.

     I care deeply about children's mental health. And
     there's a lot that can and should be done. Let's start
     with giving every child access to mental healthcare.

139 | Regulation
Let's make talking to a counselor free. Let's ensure that
children can talk to a trained therapist without being
surveilled by their parents (or even needing parental
permission).
I am deeeeeeply worried about social and structural
conditions that increase mental health crises. Let's
eradicate food scarcity. Let's make it possible for
parents to stay home with newborns and sick children
without being docked pay or losing their jobs. Let's
build a social safety net.
I also fully know how frustrating it is to see your own
child struggling and escaping into a zombie state in
front of a screen. But parents, please take a deep
breath and look at the situation more holistically. Why
is this giving them pleasure? What are they escaping?
What social itch are they scratching? And are you able
to create other paths for pleasure, escape, and
socialization?

Revisiting Our Collective Habits

I began this post satirically by focusing on elders and
television. But let's also be real. Many elders do have a
seriously unhealthy relationship with television at this
point. We know that the answer is not to ban elders
from accessing TV (even if some of us might really
really want that). But what we can see in this unhealthy
dynamic is an important lesson about habits, a lesson
that applies to all of us.
Many elders got into the habit of watching TV years

                                                                           Regulation | 140
     ago. It may have started out with the nightly news or
     prime time TV, an opportunity to escape after an
     exhausting day of work. And it expanded from there.
     For many, the pandemic made it much worse. And as
     they watched more TV, it got harder to do other things.
     Other things were exhausting physically. Or mentally.

     This is not the only bad habit we've seen adults develop
     over time. We have a better framework for talking
     about what happens when a glass of wine after work
     turns into a bottle of wine a day habit.

     What we do know is that breaking habits is HARD. And
     it's hard for everyone. This is why, as parents, we don't
     want to see our kids develop bad habits. And, especially
     after the acute phase of the pandemic, many of us
     recognize that we -- and our kids -- have gotten into
     bad habits around technology. We used technology as
     a babysitter while we were trying to work from phone.
     And we haven't broken that habit at all. But block our
     kids from accessing social media through regulation
     will not produce a healthy response to technology
     overnight. If we want to change our habits in
     relationship to technology because we don't like them,
     we need to be thoughtful about them.

     When I was spending lots of time with teenagers, one
     of the things that they always told me was that parents
     were the real addicts. They couldn't let go of their
     phone (or Twitter or ... ). I looked around and realized
     how true this is. Go to a kids' sports game or
     playground and you'll see a bunch of parents staring
     into their devices. So, parents, here's a thing you can do.
     Every time you pick up your device in front of your kids,
     verbalize what you're doing. "I'm looking up directions"

141 | Regulation
will be easy to say out loud. "You're annoying me so I'm
going to look at TikTok" will be far more uncomfortable.
Set a new habit. Be visible about why you are using
technology and ask your kids to do the same. Talk with
them about your bad habits and ask them to
hold you accountable. Then you can build trust and ask
the same of them.
These bills aren't tools to empower parents or address a
very real mental health crisis. They're a mechanism to
control youth, enrich age verification vendors, and turn
our kids into political pawns.
These laws sound good because we are worried about
our kids and because there is deep and reasonable
animosity towards Big Tech. (The geopolitical fight over
TikTok is adding to the chaos.) Let's pass data privacy
laws that protect all of us (including our elders who are
an identity theft nightmare!). Let's build mental health
infrastructure. Let's increase our social safety net. But
please please, let us not ban children from social media
"for their own safety." Cuz that's just not what this is
about.

Privacy and Publics

Online norms around privacy are
dynamic, and the stakes are high.

DIANA DALY

       Key points

            · Online norms regarding privacy are dynamic
                and carry significant consequences,
                particularly in the realm of social media

            · The concept of "publics" is explored,
                emphasizing that online audiences aren't a
                singular entity but diverse groups paying
                sustained attention to specific content.

            · Networked publics, formed through social
                media connections, highlight the role of
                individuals as bridges connecting different
                publics.

            · Privacy in online publics is complex; the
                oversimplified dichotomy of private vs. public
                fails to capture the intricacies of social
                relationships in digital spaces.

                challenges of defining and protecting privacy

Section 1: Not "the public" - They're
publics, and they're networked

Let's go back to that amphitheater in Chapter 2. We envisioned
an athlete on the ground, spewing insults about her opponent.
(Yes, there were women athletes and gladiators in Ancient
Rome.) I imagine the athlete shouting, "I say before the public
that my opponent has the stench of a lowlife latrine!" And
we have a mass of spectators roaring in approval, disapproval,
excitement, and laughter.

                                                                    Privacy and Publics | 146

That mass of spectators is a public. The definition of a public is
complicated (see danah boyd, It's Complicated pp 8-9). But for
simplicity's sake, I define a public as "people paying sustained
attention to the same thing at the same time."
When the gladiator calls the mass of spectators "the public" it
147 | Privacy and Publics
deepens the effect of her insult to suggest that "everyone in
the world" is watching. Although it is imaginary, "the public" is
a powerful idea or "construct" that people refer to when they
want to add emphasis to the effects of one-to-many speech.
But really, there is no "the public." There is never a moment
when everyone in the world is paying sustained attention to
the same thing at the same time. There only are various
publics, overlapping each other, with one person potentially
sharing in or with many different publics.

If you use social media, you interact with many publics that
are connected to one another through you and likely through
many others. Publics that intersect and connect online are
"networked publics" (pg. 8.) In the terminology of social
network analysis, whenever an individual connects two
networked publics (or any two entities, such as two other
people), that connector is called a bridge. Think about the
publics you form a bridge between. How are you uniquely
placed to spread information across multiple publics by
forming bridges between and among them?

Bridging information between publics can be exciting, and
controversial. Networked publics really work each other up,
forming opinions, practices, and norms together. And they
occasionally get in fights in the stands, clubbing each other
with ancient Roman hot dogs and Syrian tabouleh.

Section 2: Privacy Norms in Online
Publics

It is important to understand networked publics because they
help us understand that the dichotomy of private vs public is
an oversimplification of social relationships. When you post on
social media, even if you post "publicly," you probably envision
certain people or publics as your audience.
Controlling the privacy of social media posts is much more
complex than controlling the privacy of offline communication.

  · On social media, as boyd notes, what you post is public by
      default, private by design (It's Complicated, p. 61).

  · Face-to-face, you can generally see who is paying
      attention and choose whether to speak to them, making
      your communications private by default, public by
      design. Note this is flipped from how it is on social media.

While popular media claim younger generations do not care
about privacy, there is a great deal of evidence that youth care
a lot about privacy and are developing norms to strategically
protect it. Norms take time. There are norms that societies
have developed over many centuries of face-to-face
communication. These offline norms have long helped
members of these societies get along with each other, and
negotiate and protect their privacy. Let's study one of these
offline norms: civil inattention.

                                                                    Privacy and Publics | 150

Section 3: Civil inattention

It's time to imagine an awkward face-to-face scenario,
together. You're in an eatery, which is bustling with people.
You're engaged in a conversation with two friends - and
suddenly a passing stranger stops to lean over you and tries to
151 | Privacy and Publics
join in your conversation. Another person from the next table
over is also blatantly staring at you and your friends talking. You
weren't even talking to these people, and now they're in your
business!

That scenario is unlikely to happen in real life, because of a
social norm sociologist Erving Goffman named civil
inattention. In crowded spaces, civil inattention is a common
understanding - by you and by others in that society - that
you don't get in other people's business. You may acknowledge
that you are sharing the space with them through small
interactions, such as holding the door for the person behind
you, making eye contact, and nodding or smiling. But you don't
stare, or listen in, or join in without an invitation.

So is civil inattention also an online norm? Well, that may
depend on who we are and which publics we interact with
online.

The online world is young, and norms in our networked publics
are still being decided. Online norms are also dynamic, which
means they are based on a changing set of deciders, including
software developers and evolving publics of users. It could be

                                                                     Privacy and Publics | 152
that the most effective forms of privacy protection online will
be based on social and cultural norms as we develop these.
But once we figure out what works in the online world in terms
of privacy, we will have to articulate it - and then fight for it,
because our data is immensely profitable for developers of the
platforms we use.

Cancel Culture

Follow Your Dreams Cancelled in Chinatown, Boston by Chris Devers;

A popular topic at the time of this writing is cancel culture
153 | Privacy and Publics
or callout culture, a collective attack built upon the practice
of using social media to call people out for perceived wrongs.
Cancel culture is arguably linked to positive social change, as
Spencer Kornhaber asserts in the article linked below from the
Atlantic. Yet cancel culture is also linked to devastating losses of
employment and identity, and is sometimes directed at people
who had little else of value in their lives. Consider the mural
by the artist Banksy. A painter stands beside the whimsical
phrase "FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS" upon which the red label
"CANCELLED" is affixed, serving as a vivid visual representation
of Cancel Culture and the real economic and identity-level
threats it poses. There is power in shaming, silencing, and
censoring.

Partisan North American groups hold divided views on cancel
culture, according to 2021 research by Pew. Fortunately, we do
not all need to think in polarities or extremes. Cancel culture is
not uniformly good or bad. It is an opportunity for all citizens
to consider: How should such culture or a better version of it
look, and where should it end, if it has value in your society
or culture? If you find it is not valuable, then when might it
be valuable to use networked publics' attention to stop people
from doing harm online? I offer two well-reasoned perspectives
to consider if you aren't sure: Jon Ronson's BBC podcast So
You've Been Publicly Shamed, which views those called out
with empathy; and this CTZNwell Substack on callout culture
as accountability.

When publics fixate, attack, troll, and bully

The term cyberbullying received a great deal of attention as
the internet reached widespread adoption, and it is entangled
moral panics that caused and used it. As parents and educators
in the early 2000s struggled to recognize the longstanding

                                                                    Privacy and Publics | 154
issue of bullying in online discourse, they sometimes conflated
bullying with all online interaction. Meanwhile, many of the
cases the media labeled cyberbullying are not actually
bullying, which is a real phenomenon with specific criteria:
aggressive behavior, imbalance of power, repeated over time.
(These criteria were laid out by Swedish psychologist Dan
Owleus; an excellent analysis of cyberbullying in the context of
these is in boyd's fifth chapter of It's Complicated.)

Still, some online interactions are toxic with cruelty, whether or
not we can scientifically see them as bullying. Another term
in popular use to describe online attacks is trolling, perhaps
derived from the frequent placement of trolls' comments
below the content, like fairytale trolls lurking below bridges.

  · Individuals troll. Some seem to lash out individually from
      personal loneliness or trauma, as with a Twitter troll to
      whom celebrity Sarah Silverman recently responded with
      surprising compassion.

  · Mobs also troll. A distinctly frightening modern scourge is
      when critical networked publics and trolls attack in a
      coordinated effort, or mob. More visible examples of online
      troll mobs include hateful vitriol directed at a 13-year-old
      musician's Youtube explorations, at a black actress in a
      sequel to a white male film, and at a columnist who is
      proud to call herself fat - but trolls attack less visible
      people incessantly as well.

  · Not all are affected equally by trolling. While attacks do
      plague some men online - and specifically men of color -
      online hatred is directed more often and more viciously at
      women. Women of color are particularly vulnerable. Many
      online spaces with widespread usership such as Reddit
      have cultures of sexism and bigotry - and while there is
      evidence of efforts to combat toxic online cultures, many
      of these sites have a long way to go.

155 | Privacy and Publics
Toxicity is technologically exacerbated or worsened, but not
technologically determined. John Suler wrote in the early days
of the internet about the online disinhibition effect, exploring
the psychology behind behaviors that people engage in online
but not in person; he noted while some disinhibition is benign,
much of it is toxic. More recent research connects online
trolling to narcissism. As we perform before online publics, we
enter an arena of unleashed and invisible audiences. However,
development of theory related to the online disinhibition effect
occurred in the 20th century, before most social media, and
before participatory culture developed some of the systematic
toxicity we see online today.
In the first decades of the 21st century, it has become clear
that inequities including racism and gender bias are amplified
in online publics, making online spaces much more fraught
for attacks upon those identifying as women and those with
non-dominant genders and racial identities. This dynamic has
deep roots in social history, and is exacerbated by media
manipulation, with groups coordinating attacks to maintain
dominant cultural norms.

Section 5: Why privacy is such a
tangled issue online

Privacy is a notion relating to self-determination that is too
complicated to be reduced to one simple idea. Invasion of
privacy and its potential consequences can be defined in many
ways; this is one of the reasons software companies' Terms of
Service or TOS are never adequate protections for users of their
services. How do we demand protection of privacy when it is so
multilayered and impossible to define?
Consider these two passages by Daniel Solove in his article,
"Why Privacy Matters Even if you have Nothing to Hide."

       Privacy... is too complex a concept to be reduced to a
       singular essence. It is a plurality of different things that
       do not share any one element but nevertheless bear a

                                                                    Privacy and Publics | 158
       resemblance to one another. For example, privacy can
       be invaded by the disclosure of your deepest secrets. It
       might also be invaded if you're watched by a peeping
       Tom, even if no secrets are ever revealed.
       Privacy, in other words, involves so many things that it
       is impossible to reduce them all to one simple idea. And
       we need not do so.
I agree with Solove that privacy is too complicated to be
reduced to one simple idea. But often we are still called on to
present a simplified definition of our privacy - for example, we
have to justify why it is wrong to give companies such rampant
uses of our data.

We are learning the hard way that we must fight for our privacy
online. As an early leader in the social media platform market,
Facebook set very poor standards for the protection of user
privacy because access to personally identifiable user data was
immensely profitable for the company. Before Facebook, it was
standard for users of online sites to use avatars and craft
usernames that didn't connect to details of their offline lives.
Still, countless online sites permit or encourage users to create
online identities apart from their face-to-face identities. Many
of today's younger internet users choose platforms with higher
standards for privacy, limiting the publics that their posts reach
and the periods of time that posts last. Youth frequently have
"finsta" accounts - "fake" Instagrams that they share with nosy
family and acquaintances, while only good friends and in-the-
know publics have access to their "real" Instagrams. Practices
like these force developers to offer users more control over user
privacy and the reach of their posts, at the risk of losing users to
competitors.
Users shape platforms and platforms shape user behavior. And
social and cultural norms shape both user behavior and
software platforms.

Core Questions

A. Questions for qualitative thought:

    1. Consider at least one recent post you wrote on
        the last three social media platforms you used.
        What publics were you intending to reach with
        those posts? What language use, visual displays,
        and other strategies did you use to gain the
        attention of those publics? If you were facing
        those publics face to face, how might your self-
        presentation have differed?

   2. Consider something you have seen online that
        did not seem to be intended for you in particular
        to see it. What factors were responsible for its
        visibility to you? Then consider something you
        have posted on social media that was seen or
        commented on by someone you did not have in
        mind as its audience. How did that situation
        resolve, and what lessons did you learn from it?

   3. Imagine you are one of the people in charge of a
        new online world. Your job is to define the
        communication norms and policies for everyone
        invited into that world. Which are the key norms
        you implement? And how do you present them to

             people so that they will follow them?

Many people think of privacy as a modern invention, an
anomaly made possible by the rise of urbanization. If

                                                               Privacy and Publics | 170
     that were the case, then acquiescing to the current
     erosion of privacy might not be particularly alarming.
     As calls for Congress to protect privacy increase, it's
     important to understand its nature. In a policy brief in
     Science, we and our colleague Jeff Hancock suggest
     that understanding the nature of privacy calls for a
     better understanding of its origins.
     Research evidence refutes the notion that privacy is a
     recent invention. While privacy rights or values may be
     modern notions, examples of privacy norms and
     privacy-seeking behaviors abound across cultures
     throughout human history and across geography.
     As privacy researchers who study information systems
     and behavioral research and public policy, we believe
     that accounting for the potential evolutionary roots of
     privacy concerns can help explain why people struggle
     with privacy today. It may also help inform the
     development of technologies and policies that can
     better align the digital world with the human sense of
     privacy.

   The misty origins of privacy

     Humans have sought and attempted to manage
     privacy since the dawn of civilization. People from
     ancient Greece to ancient China were concerned with
     the boundaries of public and private life. The male head
     of the household, or pater familias, in ancient Roman
     families would have his slaves move their cots to some

171 | Privacy and Publics
remote corner of the house when he wanted to spend
the evening alone.
Attention to privacy is also found in preindustrial
societies. For example, the Mehinacu tribe in South
America lived in communal accommodations but built
private houses miles away for members to achieve
some seclusion.

According to Genesis in the Bible, Adam and Eve
`realized they were naked' and covered themselves.
Cleveland Museum of Art via Wikimedia
Evidence of a drive toward privacy can even be found in
the holy texts of ancient monotheistic religions: the
Quran's instructions against spying on one another, the
Talmud's advice not to place windows overlooking
neighbors' windows, and the biblical story of Adam and

                                                              Privacy and Publics | 172
     Eve covering their nakedness after eating the
     forbidden fruit.
     The drive for privacy appears to be simultaneously
     culturally specific and culturally universal. Norms and
     behaviors change across peoples and times, but all
     cultures seem to manifest a drive for it. Scholars in the
     past century who studied the history of privacy provide
     an explanation for this: Privacy concerns may have
     evolutionary roots.
     By this account, the need for privacy evolved from
     physical needs for protection, security and self-interest.
     The ability to sense the presence of others and choose
     exposure or seclusion provides an evolutionary
     advantage: a "sense" of privacy.
     Humans' sense of privacy helps them regulate the
     boundaries of public and private with efficient,
     instinctual mastery. You notice when a stranger is
     walking too close behind you. You typically abandon
     the topic of conversation when a distant acquaintance
     approaches while you are engaged in an intimate

Privacy blind spots

People do not have an intuitive understanding of
website and software privacy policies and settings.

An evolutionary theory of privacy helps explain the
hurdles people face in protecting personal information
online, even when they claim to care about privacy.
Human senses and the new digital reality are
mismatched. Online, our senses fail us. You do not see
Facebook tracking your activity in order to profile and

                                                              Privacy and Publics | 174
     influence you. You do not hear law enforcement taking
     your picture to identify you.
     Humans might have evolved to use their senses to alert
     them to privacy risks, but those same senses put
     humans at a disadvantage when they try to identify
     privacy risks in the online world. Online sensory cues
     are lacking, and worse, dark patterns - malicious
     website design elements - trick those senses into
     perceiving a risky situation as safe.
     This may explain why privacy notice and consent
     mechanisms - so popular with tech companies and for
     a long time among policymakers - fail to address the
     problem of privacy. They place the burden for
     understanding privacy risks on consumers, with notices
     and settings that are often ineffectual or gamed by
     platforms and tech companies.
     These mechanisms fail because people react to privacy
     invasions viscerally, using their senses more than their
     cognition.

   Protecting privacy in the digital age

     An evolutionary account of privacy shows that if society
     is determined to protect people's ability to manage the
     boundaries of public and private in the modern age,
     privacy protection needs to be embedded in the very
     fabric of digital systems. When the evolving technology
     of cars made them so fast that drivers' reaction times
     became unreliable tools for avoiding accidents and
     collisions, policymakers stepped in to drive

175 | Privacy and Publics
technological responses such as seat belts and, later,
airbags.

Ensuring online privacy also requires a coordinated
combination of technology and policy interventions.
Baseline safeguards of data protection, such as those in
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development's Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy
and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, can be
achieved with the right technologies.

Examples include data analysis techniques that
preserve anonymity, such as the ones enabled by
differential privacy, privacy enhancing technologies
such as user-friendly encrypted email services and
anonymous browsing, and personalized intelligent
privacy assistants, which learn users' privacy
preferences.

These technologies have the potential to preserve
privacy without hurting modern society's reliance on
collecting and analyzing data. And since the incentives
of industry players to exploit the data economy are
unlikely to disappear, we believe that regulatory
interventions that support the development and
deployment of these technologies will be necessary.

Nearly any software platform you use performs its work based
on algorithms, which enable it to make rapid decisions and
respond predictably to stimuli. An algorithm is a step-by-step
set of instructions for getting something done, whether that
something is making a decision, solving a problem, or getting

                                                                                Algorithms | 180
from point A to point B (or point Z). In this chapter, we will
look into how computing algorithms work, who tends to create
them, and how that affects their outcomes. We will also
consider whether certain algorithms should be used at all.

Section 1:
Humans make
computers what
they are

Most platforms have many

algorithms at work at once,

which can make the work       Algorithms: They can all be
they do seem so complex it's  reduced to simple steps, which
almost magical. But all       computers need in order to follow
functions of digital devices  them.

can be reduced to simple steps if needed. The steps have to be

simple because computers interpret instructions very literally.

Computers don't know anything unless someone has already
given them instructions that are explicit, with every step fully
explained. Humans, on the other hand, can figure things out if
they skip steps, and can make sense of tacit instructions. But
give a computer instructions that skip steps or include tacit
steps, and the computer will either stop working or get the
process wrong without human intervention.

181 | Algorithms
Here's an example of the
human cooperation that
goes into the giving and
following of instructions,
demonstrated with a robot.

As an instructor, I can say to

human students on the first

day of class, "Let's go around

the room. Tell us who you are

and where you're from." Easy

for humans, right? But          A robot: Having a computer for a
imagine I try that in a mixed   brain makes a robot a very
human/robot classroom, and      simple-minded student. (Image:
all goes swimmingly with the    Robot graphic by DrSJS,
first two [human] students.     https://pixabay.com/
But then the third student, a   p-320262/?no_redirect, Public
                                Domain.)

robot with a computer for a brain, says, "I don't understand." It

seems my instructions were not clear enough. Now imagine

another [human] student named Lila telling the robot helpfully,

"Well first just tell us your name." The robot still does not

understand. Finally, Lila says, "What is your name?"

That works; the robot has been programmed with an algorithm
instructing it to respond to "What is your name?" with the
words, "My name is Feefee," which the robot now says. Then
Lila continues helping the robot by saying, "Now tell us where
you're from, Feefee." Again the robot doesn't get it. At this
point, though, Lila has figured out what works in getting
answers from this robot, so Lila says, "Where are you from?"
This works; the robot has been programmed to respond to
"Where are you from?" with the sentence, "I am from Neptune."

In the above example, human intelligence was responsible for
the robot's successes and failures. The robot arrived with a few
communication algorithms, programmed by its human

                                Algorithms | 182
developers. Feefee had not been taught enough to converse
very naturally, however. Then Lila, a human, figured out how to
get the right responses out of Feefee by modifying her human
behavior to better match the behavior Feefee had learned to
respond to. Later, the students might all run home and say, "A
robot participated in class today! It was amazing!" They might
not even acknowledge the human participation that day,
which the robot fully depended on.

Section 2: Two reasons computers
seem so smart today

What computers can do these days is amazing, for two main
reasons. The first is cooperation from human software
developers. The second is cooperation on the part of users.

Source code of a simple computer program: This code written in the C
programming language will display the "Hello, world!" message.

183 | Algorithms
First, computers seem so intelligent today because human
software developers help one another teach computers. Apps
that seem groundbreaking may simply include a lot of
instructions. This is possible because developers have coded
many, many algorithms, which they share and reuse on sites
such as GitHub. The more a developer is able to copy the basic
steps others have already written for computers to follow, the
more that developer can then focus on building new code
that teaches computers new tricks. The most influential people
known as "creators" or "inventors" in the tech world may be
better described as "tweakers" who improved and added to
other people's code for their "creations" and "inventions."
The second reason computers seem so smart today is because
users are teaching them. Algorithms are increasingly designed
to "learn" from human input. New algorithms automatically
plug input into new programs, then automatically run those
programs. This sequence of automated learning and
application is called artificial intelligence (AI). AI essentially
means teaching computers to teach themselves directly from
their human users.
If only humans were always good teachers.

In 2016, Microsoft introduced Tay, an AI online robot they
                                                                                 Algorithms | 186
branded as a young female. Their intention was for Tay to learn
to communicate from internet users who conversed with her
on Twitter - and learn what she did. Within a few hours, Tay's
social media posts were so infected with violence, racism,
sexism, and other bigotry that Microsoft had to take her down
and apologize.
Microsoft had previously launched Xiaolce, an AI whose
behavior remained far less offensive than Tay, on Chinese sites
including the microblog Weibo. However, the Chinese sites
Xiaolce learned from were heavily censored. The English-
language Twitter was far less censored, and rife with trolls
networked and ready to coordinate attacks. Developers and
users who were paying attention already knew Twitter was full
of hate.
Tay was an embarrassment for Microsoft in the eyes of many
commentators. How could they not have predicted and
protected her from bad human teachers? Why didn't Tay's
human programmers teach her what not to say? It certainly
involved a lack of research, since bots like @oliviataters have
been more successful and even benefited from a shared list of
banned words that could easily be added to their algorithms.
In addition to these oversights, Tay's failure may also have been
caused by a lack of diversity in Microsoft's programmers and
team leaders.

187 | Algorithms
Section 3: Programming and bias

Programming languages: Basic, C++. and Java are just a few of these.
All translate human instructions into algorithms, which are
instructions computers can understand.

Humans are at the heart of any computer program. Algorithms
for computers to follow are all written in programming
languages, which translate instructions from human language
into the computing language of binary numerals, 0's and 1's.
Algorithms and programs are selective and reflect personal
decision-making. There are usually different ways they could
have been written.
Computer programming languages like Python, C++, and Java
are written in source code. Writing programs, sometimes just
called "coding," is an intermediary step between human
language and the binary language that computers
understand. Learning programming languages takes time and
dedication. To learn to be a computer programmer, you either
have to feel driven to teach yourself on your own equipment, or

                                                                                 Algorithms | 188
you have to be taught to program - and this is still not common
in US schools.

A Google search for "tech geek":
The many images of young white male "tech geeks" help
explain why youth who are not white or male may feel out of
place teaching themselves to code.

Because computer programmers are self-selected this way,
and because many people think of the typical tech geeks as
white and male (as suggested by the Google Image search
to the right), people who end up learning computer
programming in the US are more likely to be white than any
other race, and are more likely to identify as male than any
other gender.

Section 4: How can computers carry
bias?

Many people think computers and algorithms are neutral -
racism and sexism are not programmers' problems. In the case
of Tay's programmers, this false belief enabled more hate
speech online and led to the embarrassment of their employer.
Human-crafted computer programs mediate nearly
everything humans do today, and human responses are
involved in many of those tasks. Considering the near-infinite
extent to which algorithms and their activities are replicated,

191 | Algorithms
the presence of human biases is a devastating threat to
computer-dependent societies in general and to those
targeted or harmed by those biases in particular.

Google Glass was considered by some to be an example of a poor
decision by a homogenous workforce.

Problems like these are rampant in the tech industry because
there is a damaging belief in the US (and some other) societies
that the development of computer technologies is antisocial,
and that some kinds of people are better at it than others. As
a result of this bias in tech industries and computing, there
are not enough kinds of people working on tech development
teams: not enough women, not enough people who are not
white, not enough people who remember to think of children,
not enough people who think socially.
Remember Google Glass? You may not; that product failed
because few people wanted interaction with a computer to
come between themselves and eye contact with humans and
the world. People who fit the definition of "tech nerd" fell

                                                                                 Algorithms | 192
within this small demographic, but the sentiment was not
shared by the broader community of technology users. Critics
labeled the unfortunate people who did purchase the product
as "glassholes."

      Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

       Created in 2015, the film Code: Debugging the
       Gender Gap encapsulates many of the biases in the
       history of the computing industry as well as their
       implications. Women have always been part of the
       US computing industry, and today that industry
       would collapse without engineers from diverse
       cultures. Yet there is widespread evidence that
       women and racial minorities have always been
       made to feel that they did not belong in the
       industry. And the numbers of engineers and others
       in tech development show a serious problem in
       Silicon Valley with racial and ethnic diversity,
       resulting in terrible tech decisions that spread racial
       and ethnic bias under the guise of tech neutrality.
       Google has made some headway in achieving a
       more diverse workforce, but not without backlash
       founded on bad science.
       Below is the trailer for the film. The film is available

Section 5: Exacerbating Bias in
Algorithms: The Three I's

In its early years, the internet was viewed as a utopia, an ideal
world that would permit a completely free flow of all available
information to everyone, equally. John Perry Barlow's 1996
Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace represents this
utopian vision, in which the internet liberates users from all
biases and even from their own bodies (at which human biases
are so often directed). Barlow's utopian vision does not match
the internet of today. Our social norms and inequalities
accompany us across all the media and sites we use, and
worsened in a climate where information value is determined
by marketability and profit, as Sociologist Zeynep Tufecki
explains in this Ted Talk.

                                                                                 Algorithms | 194
Because algorithms are built on human cooperation with
computing programs, human selectivity and human flaws are
embedded within algorithms. Humans as users carry our own
biases, and today there is particular concern that algorithms
pick up and spread these biases to many, many others. They
even make us more biased by hiding results that the algorithm
calculates we may not like. When we get our news and
information from social media, invisible algorithms consider
our own biases and those of friends in our social networks to
determine which new posts and stories to show us in search
results and news feeds. The result for each user can be called
their echo chamber or as author Eli Pariser describes it, a filter
bubble in which we only see news and information we like and
agree with, leading to political polarization.

Although algorithms can generate very sophisticated
recommendations, algorithms do not make sophisticated
decisions. When humans make poor decisions, they can rely on
themselves or on other humans to recognize and reverse the
error; at the very least, a human decision-maker can be held
responsible. Human decision-making often takes time and
critical reflection to implement, such as the writing of an
approved ordinance into law. When algorithms are used in
place of human decision-making, I describe what ensues as
The three I's: Algorithms' decisions become invisible,
irreversible, and infinite. Most social media platforms and many
organizations using algorithms will not share how their
algorithms work; for this lack of transparency, they are known
as black box algorithms.

affordances of social media, our society has turned to
using the platform for more selfish reasons- such as
the fame granted when going viral.\n\nThere are some
noticeable pros and cons that are intertwined with
media spreadability. This term highlights how media is
continually spread and then passed on to others,
continuing the chain.\n\nAt this point, almost everyone
has had exposure through the media. In terms of
spreadability, exposure happens much more quickly.
One second a video is posted and the next, it could
have thousands of views. This was the case with now
famous influencer, Emma Chamberlain.\n\nCurrently,

total of nearly ten million subscribers and counting. At
only 19, she has established a huge platform for herself
and when she started as a young high school girl nearly
three years ago, I can guarantee she had no idea what
was in store for her in terms of success. As of now, she
has won three awards for her Youtube career: a
People's Choice Award, a Shorty Award, and lastly, a
Teen Choice Award. Her breakout Youtube fame
allowed her to then write her own book, create a
podcast, and even make and sell merchandise. All of

                                                                           Algorithms | 196
     this success due to a few viral videos that skyrocketed a
     young girl's career. How did her videos spread so
     quickly? Was her content really that appealing to her
     audience? Did she face any backlash? What type of
     content tends to go viral? Chelsea Galvin is here to give
     her insight on these types of questions we all have.\n\
     nEmma Chamberlain was just an ordinary girl from
     Belmont, California. Who else is a teenage girl from
     Belmont, California? My roommate Chelsea Galvin. She
     was a primary witness in Emma Chamberlain's claim to
     fame. Both girls are from the same hometown,
     attended the same high school, and had the same
     classes.\n\nChelsea is no stranger to the realm of social
     media. She uses popular apps such as instagram,
     tiktok, and snapchat (her favorite as of now). She is
     familiar with the various different Algorthims that
     appear on her explorer and \"for you\" pages. She
     typically watches videos about house decor, food, and
     videos of friends just having fun.\n\nShe believes that
     Emma Chamberlain's content was relevant for teen
     girls today. Her content is \"different from mainstream
     media and what we usually see on youtube\" and is
     associated with certain algorithms that relate to young
     teens today. Ultimately, Emma Chamberlain became so
     well known for her unstaged and realistic content that
     she is now easily recognizable by so many people.\n\
     nAlthough having a presence in the media may seem
     extremely desirable, there are always obstacles and
     hardships that must be overcome. Cancel culture.
     Currently, this is a big part of having a media presence.
     Individuals must always be aware about what they post
     in order to avoid upsetting others, whether it is

197 | Algorithms
intentional or not.\n\nAs Chelsea describes it, \"a lot of
attention brings a lot of people just wanting to hate or
ruin things for people\" and I totally agree. We are all
human and we all make mistakes but when those
mistakes resurface online due to spreadability and a
face in the media, those select individuals have a
harder time than those who are not in the spotlight.\n\
nUltimately anyone's content can spread and go viral, it
is just a matter of time and good, relatable videos- like
Emma Chamberlain posts. Both Chelsea and I believe
that it is important to be educated on this topic,
especially in times like this where social media plays a
large role in our daily lives. We have both seen the
more obstructive side of social media when content
goes viral and we agree that it's vital to be prepared for
the outcome.\n\nIt was a joy to chat with Chelsea and
learn more about our perspectives on the media and
what content is specific to our two feeds. I learned so
much from her and her story and it really helped me
conceptualize the term spreadability and how it occurs
in reality."}" data-sheets-

Section 6: Fighting Unjust Algorithms

Algorithms are laden with errors. Some of these errors can be
traced to the biases of those that developed them, as when
a facial recognition system meant for global implementation
is only trained using data sets from a limited population (say,
predominantly white or male). Algorithms can become
problematic when they are hacked by groups of users, as
Microsoft's Tay was. Algorithms are also grounded in the values

                                                                                Algorithms | 200
of those who shape them, and these values may reward some
involved while disenfranchising others.
Despite their flaws, algorithms are increasingly used in heavily
consequential ways. They predict how likely a person is to
commit a crime or default on a bank loan based on a given
data set. They can target users with messages on social media
that are customized to fit their interests, their voting
preferences, or their fears. They can identify who is in photos
online or in recordings of offline spaces.
Confronting the landscape of increasing algorithmic control is
activism to limit the control of algorithms over human lives.
Below, read about the work of the Algorithmic Justice League
and other activists promoting bans on facial recognition. And
consider: What roles might algorithms play in your life that may
deserve more attention, scrutiny, and even activism?

   Core Questions

   A. Questions for qualitative thought:

         1. Write and/or draw an algorithm (or your best try
             at one) to perform an activity you wish you could
             automate. Doing the dishes? Taking an English
             test? It's up to you.

        2. Often there are spaces online that make one feel
             like an outsider, or like an insider. Study an online
             space that makes you feel like one of these - how
             it that outsider or insider status being
             communicated to you, or to others?

        3. Consider the history of how you learned whatever
             you know about computing. This could mean
             how you came to understand key terms,
             searching online simple programs, coding, etc.
             Then, reinvent that history if you'd learned all you
             wish you knew about computing at the times and
             in the ways you feel you should have learned
             them.

          The United States already has laws against redlining,
          but companies can still use other data to advertise
          goods and services to you--which can have big
          implications for the prices you see.

          EPISODE NOTES

          One of the supposed promises of AI was that it would
          be able to take the bias out of human decisions, and
          maybe even lead to more equity in society. But the
          reality is that the errors of the past are embedded in the
          data of today, keeping prejudice and discrimination in.
          Pair that with surveillance capitalism, and what you get
          are algorithms that impact the way consumers are
          treated, from how much they pay for things, to what
          kinds of ads they are shown, to if a bank will even lend
          them money. But it doesn't have to be that way,
          because the same techniques that prey on people can
          lift them up. Vinhcent Le from the Greenlining Institute
          joins Cindy and Danny to talk about how AI can be used
          to make things easier for people who need a break. In
          this episode you'll learn about:

             Redlining--the pernicious system that denies
                historically marginalized people access to loans and
                financial services--and how modern civil rights
                laws have attempted to ban this practice.

             How the vast amount of our data collected through
                modern technology, especially browsing the Web,
                is often used to target consumers for products, and
                in effect recreates the illegal practice of redlining.

             The weaknesses of the consent-based models for
                safeguarding consumer privacy, which often mean
                that people are unknowingly waving away their
                privacy whenever they agree to a website's terms of
                service.

             How the United States currently has an insufficient

211 | Algorithms
      patchwork of state laws that guard different types
      of data, and how a federal privacy law is needed to
      set a floor for basic privacy protections.
   How we might reimagine machine learning as a
      tool that actively helps us root out and combat bias
      in consumer-facing financial services and pricing,
      rather than exacerbating those problems.
   The importance of transparency in the algorithms
      that make decisions about our lives.
   How we might create technology to help
      consumers better understand the government
      services available to them.

   how people learn from each other,
   research shows

213 | Algorithms
Social media pushes evolutionary buttons.
AP Photo/Manish Swarup
William Brady, Northwestern University

People's daily interactions with online algorithms affect
how they learn from others, with negative
consequences including social misperceptions, conflict
and the spread of misinformation, my colleagues and I
have found.

People are increasingly interacting with others in social
media environments where algorithms control the flow
of social information they see. Algorithms determine in
part which messages, which people and which ideas
social media users see.

On social media platforms, algorithms are mainly
designed to amplify information that sustains
engagement, meaning they keep people clicking on
content and coming back to the platforms. I'm a social
psychologist, and my colleagues and I have found
evidence suggesting that a side effect of this design is
that algorithms amplify information people are
strongly biased to learn from. We call this information
"PRIME," for prestigious, in-group, moral and emotional
information.

In our evolutionary past, biases to learn from PRIME
information were very advantageous: Learning from
prestigious individuals is efficient because these
people are successful and their behavior can be copied.
Paying attention to people who violate moral norms is
important because sanctioning them helps the
community maintain cooperation.

But what happens when PRIME information becomes

                                                                           Algorithms | 214
     amplified by algorithms and some people exploit
     algorithm amplification to promote themselves?
     Prestige becomes a poor signal of success because
     people can fake prestige on social media. Newsfeeds
     become oversaturated with negative and moral
     information so that there is conflict rather than
     cooperation.
     The interaction of human psychology and algorithm
     amplification leads to dysfunction because social
     learning supports cooperation and problem-solving,
     but social media algorithms are designed to increase
     engagement. We call this mismatch functional
     misalignment.

   Why it matters

     One of the key outcomes of functional misalignment in
     algorithm-mediated social learning is that people start
     to form incorrect perceptions of their social world. For
     example, recent research suggests that when
     algorithms selectively amplify more extreme political
     views, people begin to think that their political in-
     group and out-group are more sharply divided than
     they really are. Such "false polarization" might be an
     important source of greater political conflict.
     https://youtube.com/
     watch?v=WLf r7sU5W2E%3Fwmode%3Dtransparent%2
     6start%3D0
     Social media algorithms amplify extreme political
     views.

215 | Algorithms
Functional misalignment can also lead to greater
spread of misinformation. A recent study suggests that
people who are spreading political misinformation
leverage moral and emotional information - for
example, posts that provoke moral outrage - in order to
get people to share it more. When algorithms amplify
moral and emotional information, misinformation gets
included in the amplification.

What other research is being done

In general, research on this topic is in its infancy, but
there are new studies emerging that examine key
components of algorithm-mediated social learning.
Some studies have demonstrated that social media
algorithms clearly amplify PRIME information.
Whether this amplification leads to offline polarization
is hotly contested at the moment. A recent experiment
found evidence that Meta's newsfeed increases
polarization, but another experiment that involved a
collaboration with Meta found no evidence of
polarization increasing due to exposure to their
algorithmic Facebook newsfeed.
More research is needed to fully understand the
outcomes that emerge when humans and algorithms
interact in feedback loops of social learning. Social
media companies have most of the needed data, and I
believe that they should give academic researchers
access to it while also balancing ethical concerns such
as privacy.

                                                                           Algorithms | 216
   What's next

     A key question is what can be done to make algorithms
     foster accurate human social learning rather than
     exploit social learning biases. My research team is
     working on new algorithm designs that increase
     engagement while also penalizing PRIME information.
     We argue that this might maintain user activity that
     social media platforms seek, but also make people's
     social perceptions more accurate.

       Key Points

            · The chapter lays a crucial foundation by
                delineating the distinctions between equity
                and equality, setting the stage for a nuanced
                exploration of women's rights activism.

            · Online movements transcend borders, uniting
                local and global initiatives against systematic
                violence, fostering a sense of shared purpose.

            · Social media serves as a catalyst, amplifying
                private struggles into public conversations,
                providing visibility and support for
                marginalized voices.

            · Complexities arise from the close coexistence
                of individuals identifying as "men" and
                "women," impacting activism dynamics and
                communication patterns.

            · Striking a balance between online privacy and
                visibility is explored, especially within the
                LGBTQIA+ community, shedding light on the
                challenges faced.

            · Hashtags, exemplified by movements like
                #SaveDinaAli and #NiUnaMenos, play a pivotal
                role, fostering connectivity, spreading
                awareness, and sometimes succumbing to
                misinformation.

            · The #MeToo movement, although not initially
                labeled creative online activism, prompts
                critical reflection on inclusivity and complexity
                amid its widespread impact.

Stated simply, this chapter is about equity for women. Unlike
equality, which means treating everyone the same, equity
considers the different circumstances that may lead to
different support needs, and adjusts support based on need.
The concept of equity can be used when considering rights
and resource allocation for many types of groups. It is used
here, when referring to challenges women face that play out
online, because those challenges can be invisible obstacles.
What is salient - what stands out - about women's movements

221 | Equity and Gender
are the ways the internet is used to enable public conversation
around topics previously kept private. Social media in particular
affords exposure, drawing matters society guards as private
into the public sphere.
People who identify as "men" and people who identify as
"women" have lived in the same neighborhoods and
households across cultures and time periods. This quality
makes gender relationships and activism distinct among
activist movements. Issues that arise between groups of
different ethnicities, races, and classes are often clearly
expressed out in the open; but gender issues are not expressed
as openly. Because men and women co-exist so closely in every
community, issues between people of different gender
identities tend to leak out in whispers and remain more
hidden.

Women as a gender identity: A disclaimer

In order to look closely at two important online movements
for women, I have had to exclude many other movements,
moments, and identities from this chapter. The premise of the
chapter admittedly works against complex understandings of
gender, by presenting "women" as a fixed identity group. The
goal is to give you a selection of histories, tools, and examples
to help you understand online activist movements.

As the Wikipedia page on gender reflects, a deep
understanding of gender and sexuality must also consider
where the boundaries between genders come from and what
is left unspoken when we rely on binary gender categories.
Movements for the rights of transgender women have evolved
within, alongside, and sometimes in response to movements
by cisgender women, but these histories are often collapsed
into a single narrative.

Saudi women: Online and driving change

Saudi Arabian laws and culture enforce a system of male
guardianship over women, whereby every woman must get
the approval of a male guardian for decisions about her body
and life including passport applications, travel, and marriage.
Online activism helps women who are resisting the system of
male guardianship to connect with fellow activists, read the
climate for what they are asking, and connect with specific
publics who may support their causes.

#savedinaali

Like campaigns for other identity groups, many social media

                                                                     Equity and Gender | 224
campaigns for women are branded as leaderless or have
masked leadership. A particular feature of social media
campaigns for women is the naming of the campaign after
a woman who has been persecuted, even though she is not
organizing the campaign. Sadly, due to the violence women
face that leads to these campaigns, the woman the campaign
is named after is often one whose persecution has already
ensued.

One example is the campaign to #SaveDinaAli. Dina Ali fled
Saudi Arabia but was detained in the Philippines and returned
to her family, whom she said would kill her. It is unknown if
Dina Ali is severely injured or even alive. However, organizers
started the #SaveDinaAli campaign to help her and women in
similar situations and draw attention to Saudi women's human
rights abuses. Raising awareness around the situations of
particular imprisoned women may lighten the punishment
inflicted on them - though it does not guarantee safety or
survival.

Recognizing the small beginnings of large
media campaigns

Activist movements that become large usually began as small,
local efforts for change. This is especially true around women's
rights; whispers about a case or pattern of abuse first spread
locally, then grow into regional or global social movements
once it's clear that the abuse is systematic. Take for example
the extensive Human Rights Watch campaign to end Male
Guardianship in Saudi Arabia. It was many small campaigns
like the one to save Dina Ali that led Human Rights Watch to
produce a 2016 report entitled Boxed In: Women and Saudi
Arabia's Male Guardianship System. The campaign uses the

225 | Equity and Gender
hashtag #TogetherToEndMaleGuardianship along with video
and other content.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) is a large, global organization,
but small movements gave them key examples and networks
on which to build a larger campaign. HRW's decision to focus
on Twitter as a platform required the organization to monitor
smaller movements for evidence that Saudis would use and
respond to Twitter hashtags for activism. Those small
movements provided the core of the larger networks HRW
would use in their campaign.

One prior online network example for campaigns for Saudi
women is the campaign to allow them to drive. Women have
been putting themselves on the front lines and driving - and
celebrating this civil disobedience online. In 2011-2013 the
hashtag #W2drive (women to drive) was used by Saudi activists
to gather public interest in women's right to drive, as did the
account @SaudiWomenSpring on Facebook.

Section 2: Meming of hashtags and
more

The use of any hashtag can expand and complicate the spread
of a message across a global audience, particularly if the meme
flips to become sarcastic or changes direction.

Hashtags relating to Saudi women's rights led to numerous
memes, but most just added force to the movement.
#TogetherToEndMaleGuardianship was of course translated -
you might also say, imitated or memed - into Arabic, and it
is that tag which Arabic-speaking social media users began
spreading prolifically. #StopEnslavingSaudiWomen is another
tag channeling similar publics. Like #HandsUpDontShoot in

                                                                     Equity and Gender | 226
the Black Lives Matter movement, it is a phrase speaking
directly to an oppressing force, telling them to change their
behavior.
However, there is some evidence of the spread of
misinformation through hashtags related to Saudi women. For
example, a story about Saudi male scientists declaring women
"not human" started out on a satirical website, but it spread to
other publics - including some who believed it was true, and
others who found it useful in spreading fear of Islam. As this
example shows, hashtags are easy targets for appropriation -
use for a different cultural purpose than originally intended.

     From the Social Media & Ourselves Podcast and iVoices:
     Hearing from gamers on #backtothekitchen and comebacks
     in online game spaces

     We produced the Social Media & Ourselves podcast
     with the iVoices project, with the goal of learning from
     students about online life. In late 2021, one particular
     student story led me and a team of students down a
     new path of research. The story was Girl Meets Chud,
     aired on December 1st, 2021.

In the episode, a student named Kiersten describes
how she was driven into an unhealthy online
relationship by pandemic loneliness and a toxic
gaming environment where girls were regularly told to
"Go back to the kitchen." I thought, wow, people are
still saying that to girls and women? And it led me to
wonder: How did young players describe and respond
to this phrase in networked publics?

     analyze videos hashtagged #gobacktothekitchen and
     #backtothekitchen on TikTok. Work produced from this
     project was presented for the Association for
     Information Science and Technology annual
     conference. Here's the abstract:

             This research arose from the iVoices project
             collection of student technology experiences
             guiding research. In response to students
             being told to "go back to the kitchen" while
             gaming and reading as "female", our team
             analyzed TikTok for videos hashtagged
             #gobacktothekitchen and
             #backtothekitchen across a one-year period.
             We also performed deeper analysis on
             comeback appeals eliciting or offering
             suggestions of responses to "Go back to the
             kitchen" and related misogyny and their
             responses. We found videos were typically
             created by "girl gamers" toward whom "back
             to the kitchen" misogyny had been directed,
             and who tagged them to assign networked
             meanings to their experiences, encapsulate
             their struggles for broad publics, and find
             validation with users sharing similar
             experiences. A salient theme in comeback
             appeal posts was performing positions of
             power to gain leverage over aggressors,

229 | Equity and Gender
             while comments frequently offered support
             from other "girl gamers" and reinforcement
             of misogynistic stereotypes by male-
             identified aggressors.

Section 3: How social media can help
women's causes in particular

To understand women's online movements, including those for
Saudi women and women in the Americas (in the next section),
it is important to consider relationship communication. First,
let's consider who Saudi women can and cannot speak to and
when or where those conversations take place. In traditional
Saudi society, women have limited face-to-face contact; they
rarely gather or communicate with people beyond their
immediate family, and external communications may be under
constant surveillance. This limits the communication of
women activists with those who are geographically close to
them and to moments of low surveillance.
However, communities devoted to women's activism can
interact online on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and
other social media platforms. So the most important
affordance of social media for women's movements is this:

                                                                    Equity and Gender | 230
movement organizers can orchestrate gatherings and
strategies through the use of social media. An example of this is
the campaign #women2drive, which Saudi women have been
pushing for several years to challenge male guardianship
incrementally by focusing on the right to drive.

                                   Another affordance of social

                                   media       for  women's

                                   movements is this: social

                                   media can extend and

                                   deepen      communication

                                   among            activists,

                                   transforming short or casual

women2drive is a campaign in       encounters       into
Saudi Arabia that counteracts the
prohibition of women in public     opportunities for a more
spaces through online, networked
publics.                           profound exchange of ideas.

                                   Social media can allow

                                   people who will be gathering

in person to get a sense before the event of what others are

thinking. It also allows people to continue sharing their

"staircase thoughts" after they leave the meeting (think of the

old TV series Columbo, where the detective seems to be leaving

the suspect alone but then turns around just before going

downstairs and says: "Oh, there's just one more thing...").

Staircase thoughts are sometimes considered simply wit that

we thought of too late. But l'esprit de l'escalier or "wit of the

staircase" as French philosopher Denis Diderot called it, can

deepen communication, especially in activist movements that

involve covert communications.

activism include people who are not necessarily organizers of

causes.

Some of the publics gathered by social media include large
organizations with resources to support movements, leading
to a fourth affordance in creating a global movement: Social
media connects activists with their publics. Saudi women can
feel the support of women activists across the globe with the
hashtag #suffrage, and I imagine that is important at
moments when the national culture seems to be changing
too slowly. Connecting with supportive publics can also lead to
organizational and financial support.

The publics gathered through hashtags around Saudi women's
rights and specifically the push to end male guardianship in
that country demonstrate how publics can build on and
connect to one another, through hashtags among other tools.
Saudi women have pushed to end male guardianship in the
past, and the gathering of publics by these early movements
led to the taking up of the cause by larger organizations.

                                  Una Menos began in the

                                  summer of 2014 in Argentina,

                                  culminating in an August

2016 demonstration in Lima that was characterized as the

largest demonstration ever seen in Peru. It was reactivated in

South American cities including Buenos Aires and Rio Di

Janeiro in October 2016, in response to the drugging, rape, and

murder of a 16-year-old Argentinian girl.

Hemispheric hashtags coordinating these movements include
#NiUnaMenos (not one less or not one fewer) and
#vivaslasqueremos (we want them alive) - proactively worded
demands that not a single woman or girl be killed by
systematic violence. This proactive framing makes every death
cause for further protest.

One striking strategy in this movement is its theatricality. From
dressing as death in Mexico to applying makeup to simulate
bruised and bloodied faces and crotches in this demonstration
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, these movements rely upon visual
impact. In the United States, it is common to embody the

233 | Equity and Gender
unjustly dead - in #BlackLivesMatter, the #icantbreathe
hashtag for Eric Garner and hoodie-posing to say "we are
Trayvon Martin" are two of many examples of resurrection
through performance. But this practice of embodying a
bruised, bloodied woman is distinct from most feminist
protests seen in the US.

approach - as in Michelle Obama's speech at the DNC following

the recording of Trump boasting of using his wealth and

stature to grab women "by the pussy." But the difference may

come down to class more than nationality.

The performative demonstrations in Latin America reflect the
grim reality of being unable to "go high" and hide abuse for
many of its survivors. Many abused women wear visible bruises
on their faces. The sounds of abuse are more evident on city
streets and in smaller apartment buildings than in large
houses and suburbs. Abuse of poor women is more visible than
abuse of wealthier women - even when poor women don't live
on the streets, lower-class status is generally accompanied by
a lack of personally owned or controlled space. As Margaret
Rodman has written, "The most powerless people have no
place at all." In these hemispheric demonstrations, the streets
become women's place, with demonstrators of all classes
increasingly marching them. By making the marks of women's

     from our course discussions, the readings, and your
     experiences, how might the affordances and culture of

     activism?

Section 5: The #MeToo Movement in
the U.S.

After this book was released, the #MeToo movement ensued,
in late 2017. As I write this update, the #MeToo movement is
sweeping the US and other nations, as charges and evidence of
long histories of sexual harassment and abuse circulate in the
media and online. The movement has pervaded the academic
and political spheres in the US and other nations as well.

Critiques of the #MeToo movement are also circulating. One
example is the response #whataboutus by working-class
women that draws attention to the limits of #MeToo in telling
their stories. Another critique elevates discomfort among
feminists with #MeToo's simplistic image of women as victims,
and of the collapsing of such a vast range of behaviors into the
concept of "harassment."

The creative online activism explored in these chapters is
remarkable for its inclusiveness and complexity in the face of
these critiques. Branding is hard. Oversimplification is a threat
faced by any spreading movement; in this phenomenon,
complex causes can be reduced to a simplistic phrase or
meaning as the movement spreads. Oversimplification of a

237 | Equity and Gender
message seems inevitable for it to gain national or global
traction, as critiques of the #MeToo movement charge. Yet the
Black Lives Matter movement has remained complex, so why
not #MeToo?
As of this writing, I do not include the US-based #MeToo among
the movements I label creative online activism - yet. Although
the Hollywood actresses whose accounts received the most
attention are very visible, the movement's strategies are not
highly visual, or performative; rather, the movement has
gained traction through the voices of people who already have
access to significant public attention and national platforms.
Imagine if they used their performance and visibility skills to
redirect their audiences' attention to working-class women
and women in nations with oppressive regimes. I hope #MeToo
advocates where the movement is most visible will turn
attention to the women who need help most, rather than
celebrating #MeToo as a simple success.

       Social and activist movements take time. Decades may
       pass before the effects of a movement are in full view.
In the next chapter - as we explore cultural branding - keep
activist movements in mind. But also remember that whereas
the goal of cultural branding is immediate influence, the goal
of social and activist movements is long-term cultural change.

Core Questions

A. Questions for qualitative thought:

    1. Start looking at hashtags online used alongside
        #MeToo and also look at stories posted in #MeToo
        over the last several years.In your groups, choose
        one or two posts to discuss. What do the stories
        using like hashtags have in common, and what
        are some ways that they differ?

                                                               Equity and Gender | 242
        2. What are some of the smaller impacts you have
             noticed in the years since #MeToo and
             companion hashtags and practices have come
             about? In your own experiences or those you
             know about.

        3. If you were aware of the women's movements
             discussed in this chapter before, what had you
             heard about them? Do these movements
             influence you to think differently about women's
             roles in the cultures from which these
             movements came? Explain.

     Considered to be the largest social justice movement
     since the civil rights era of the 1960s, Black Lives Matter

245 | Equity and Gender
is more than the scores of street protests organized by
the social justice group that attracted hundreds of
thousands of demonstrators across the world.
From its early days in 2014 after Officer Darren Wilson
killed Michael Brown, Jr. to the protests following the
murder of George Floyd in 2020, Black Lives Matter has
opened the door for social change by expanding the
way we think about the complicated issues that involve
race.
As sociologists who study how protests lay the
groundwork for social change, we understand their
necessity as a tactic to draw attention toward a
movement's broader agenda.
In our study published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, we found that the Black
Lives Matter was able to shift attention away from its
protests and toward its agenda of building an anti-
racist society.
Our report further revealed that Black Lives Matter has
changed how people learn about specific issues that
involve race, such as police violence, mass incarceration
and other systemic problems in Black communities
that would be intolerable in other communities.

Spikes in anti-racist searches

Social change, such as the anti-slavery movement in
the 19th century, is not represented only by new
legislation or Supreme Court decisions. It is also found

                                                              Equity and Gender | 246
     in the public's ideas and conversations: what you and I
     think and talk about.
     When people engage with a movement, such as
     joining a protest, they are more likely to learn about the
     movement's aspirations and plans to achieve their
     goals. In this way, protest opens the door for social
     change.

     In our digital age, researchers can measure what
     people are thinking about by analyzing activity on
     public internet platforms like Google, Wikipedia and
     Twitter. Social researchers can quantitatively measure
     social media activity and see how it changes over time
     and in response to particular events, such as Black
     Lives Matter protests.
     Our study examined how street demonstrations

247 | Equity and Gender
facilitated an important initial step in creating social
change: changing the way people think. Based on our
research, we found that people began thinking about
racism from a broader and deeper perspective.
We conducted a large-scale quantitative analysis of
news media, Google searches, Wikipedia page visits
and Twitter from 2014 to 2020 to build a picture of the
movement's impact on how Americans and the world
understand the conditions of Black life in the U.S. over
the past century.
Though Google doesn't share the actual number of
people who search on its platform, the total number is
estimated to be in the billions. For our data set of
searched words and phrases, that number is likely to be
as much as in the hundreds of millions.

                                                              Equity and Gender | 248
     digital search users think and talk about racial ideas,
     such as systemic racism, Michelle Alexander's book
     "The New Jim Crow" and white supremacy, up to 100
     times more than they did in the weeks before the
     protests.
     Over the years these spikes grew larger and included
     more diverse ideas.
     In 2014 and 2015, for instance, we saw people using
     Google to search terms about police shootings and
     past victims of police homicide.
     But in 2020 the search terms were much broader and
     included ideas like prison abolition and redlining - the
     discriminatory practice by banks, insurance companies
     and other financial institutions that resulted in
     segregated neighborhoods.
     Importantly, the ideas that come into the public
     consciousness during protest don't simply disappear.
     They stick around. We found that six months after the
     2020 George Floyd protests, social media searches of
     terms such as systemic racism and white supremacy
     were considerably higher than before the protests.

   Social change?

     After the murder of Floyd, journalists and researchers

249 | Equity and Gender
alike proclaimed that the United States was
experiencing a "racial reckoning."
To understand the full scope of the reckoning and the
possibility for change, it is important to know how
people make sense of these events.
Large-scale digital data from platforms like Google,
Wikipedia and Twitter shows us which ideas are
attracting attention and when this attention is
sustained.
In a sense, protests help create a "new normal," in
which anti-racism is an increasingly common way to
talk about inequalities in American society.
The pathway toward change is not always simple.
Activists such as those in Black Lives Matter want
people to rethink social problems, and many
contemporary problems are rooted in historical failures
to produce a just society.
The participants in the demonstrations of 2020 have an
advantage that previous generations of activists did
not: They witnessed the shortcomings of past civil
rights movements, as well as the limits of modern-day
efforts to teach diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
Certainly, increased attention does not always bring
positive results.

     Our study also investigates the rise in opposition that
     overlapped with BLM attention.
     On Twitter, hashtags such as "#AllLivesMatter" and
     "#WhiteLivesMatter" increased during BLM protests
     and periods of reactionary right-wing protest, such as
     the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
     We found that countermovement activity did not
     decrease attention to the BLM movement and was
     always dwarfed by BLM-related social media activity.
     During the peak of the George Floyd protests in May
     and June 2020, for instance, there were about 750,000
     #BlackLivesMatter tweets per day, compared with
     about 20,000 #AllLivesMatter or #BlueLivesMatter.
     The trend continued as time passed. In December
     2020, #BlackLivesMatter tweets were posted about

251 | Equity and Gender
     10,000 times per day, compared with fewer than 1,000
     for #AllLivesMatter or #BlueLivesMatter.
     The data suggests that the Black Lives Matter
     movement is having a lasting impact - as are the
     group's ideas.

                online activism to counter the negative impact
                of NAFTA on indigenous communities in
                Mexico.

            · The internet played a dual role for both
                activists and governments, with a focus on
                how the Zapatistas employed information
                warfare to gain global support.

            · Drawing parallels between Zapatistas and
                contemporary movements like Black Lives
                Matter underscores the role of online activism
                in tackling issues of race, income inequality,
                and political decisions.

            · Utilizing strategies such as speed, visuals,
                performances, inclusiveness, and "masked"
                leadership, both Zapatista and Black Lives
                Matter movements showcased effective online
                activism.

            · Addressing critiques, concerns include the
                swift mobilization of movements, potential
                shallowness, and the notion of "slacktivism."

            · Acknowledging the intricate interplay
                between key figures and networked groups
                highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of

                                                                                    Activism | 254

Before the internet was an effective product marketing tool,
it was a tool of activism - and social media has extended and
complicated the ways activists can use it (in other words, its
activist affordances). This chapter takes a few key movements
as examples - from 1994 when Mexico's Zapatista movement
forced the Mexican government into a ceasefire, to 2017 when
Black Lives Matter hashtags now quickly activate publics in the
US and beyond. I refer to these movements under the umbrella
of creative online activism. What ties these movements
together is their creativity in using the affordances of the
internet to promote activist agendas and avoid the pitfalls of
oversimplification and appropriation.
Note: This chapter focuses on movements that have coalesced
(formed) around racial and ethnic identity groups, as well as
income inequality and political decisions.

Zapatistas in Chiapas used early social media to advance their cause
and protect their lives.

                                                                                    Activism | 256
Section 1: The Zapatistas

In early 1994, only a tiny percentage of the world was online,
and the term "social media" did not exist. The internet was
very young and very Web 1.0, with static pages that did not
allow visitors to contribute. (You can review Web 1.0 vs Web 2.0
in Chapter 2). Yet our first example of creative online activism
begins here, with Mexico's Zapatistas. Creative deployment of
the affordances of a young, sparse internet both saved
indigenous protesters in Chiapas, Mexico from slaughter
and allowed them to influence the new global economy.

NAFTA signing by leaders of Mexico, Canada, and the US

The beginning of the story was the end of life as many in rural
Mexico knew it. Governments of the US, Canada, and Mexico
began negotiating the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) in the early 1990s, forging
interdependence between their economies. Among other

257 | Activism
deals, this trade agreement would subsidize corporations
taking over Mexican land to grow cheap crops. Many Mexicans
- particularly the native, or indigenous, people - foresaw that
this would lead to drastic alteration of the land and to farming
by genetic crop modification and spraying of chemical
pesticides.

As their political leaders worked toward NAFTA, Mexican
farmers fought it using traditional methods. In the early 1990s,
protestors staged in-person demonstrations at the zocalo
(town square) in Mexico City. And they organized and wrote
impassioned statements in print media about the devastating
consequences NAFTA would have on farming and many other
aspects of life in their country. But North American
governments ignored these offline pleas and signed NAFTA
into effect in 1992 and 1993.

On January 1st, 1994, NAFTA became the law of the land in the
US, Mexico, and Canada - and the Zapatista National Liberation
Army (EZLN) rose up against the Mexican Government under
the leadership of a masked man known as Subcomandante
(Subcommander) Marcos. This army of "Zapatistas" - an army
of mostly poor, rural, indigenous people inspired by the historic
Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata - peacefully occupied
the city of San Cristóbal de las Casas in the state of Chiapas, to
demand that their protests against NAFTA be seen and heard.
Rising up against the Mexican government seemed like a
catastrophic move by the EZLN occupiers, many of whom were
poor indigenous farmers from the Chiapas area.

                                                                                    Activism | 258
The internet can be "a Janus machine, an engine of liberation and an
instrument of repression.'"

The Mexican government was enthusiastic about NAFTA, as
they would benefit financially from corporate NAFTA
investment even if their farmers suffered. So it seemed certain
the formidable Mexican army would covertly slaughter the
small EZLN forces before their protest could make Mexico look
bad as a corporate investment. But ironically, in this case, the
internet was what Martinez-Torres describes as Janus faced,
helping governments repress people while helping those
people protest that repression at the same time. While young,
online global networks made it possible for economies to
globalize and to crush poor people in the process, they also
made it possible to mobilize networks of popular protest and
fight back.

259 | Activism
Enter information warfare

When on-the-ground resistance alone got the Zapatistas little
traction in their resistance to NAFTA, they turned to the
internet and began a campaign of information warfare - the
strategic use of information and its anticipated effects on
receivers to influence the power dynamics in a conflict. Thanks
to the affordances of the early internet to connect people in
similar struggles in different places, international peace
activists were already networked online in the mid-1990s;
the Internet Archive has lists and snapshots of pages
describing some of these organizations. Some of these activist
organizations were witnessing or supporting similar struggles
in other countries, as poor people battled transnational trade
agreements that would destroy their ways of life.

The EZLN Army got the

international word out about

their cause with remarkable

speed, thanks to these online

peace networks. With the

charismatic masked leader

Subcommandante Marcos as        Subcomandante Marcos (on left):
                                Masked spokesman for the EZLN
a spokesperson, the EZLN        army of "Zapatistas" in Chiapas,
                                Mexico
Zapatistas  created  a

dramatic campaign online.

Their vivid imagery of the

EZLN's masked army of farmers spread rapidly across

international online networks.

At the height of their online visibility, twelve days after
declaring war on the Mexican Government, the Zapatistas
publicly called for a ceasefire. The Mexican government still
had the physical power to annihilate EZLN - but now the world
was watching. Once EZLN called for peace, any action against
their forces would make Mexico look evil - and risky as a

                                Activism | 260
corporate investment destination. As a result, the Mexican
government was forced to accept the EZLN ceasefire. They
could not reverse NAFTA; it would take more than an
awareness campaign to reverse such a powerfully backed
agreement. But the EZLN protesters lived and continued their
demands for social change.
The EZLN's Information War has inspired many civil society
movements visible today. These include current movements
against genetically modified food and the "fair trade"
compensation for farmers. In terms of online strategies, the
Zapatistas' activist campaign was an early example of how
activists can use media sociopolitically to demand civil rights -
and to recognize how, Janus-faced, those same media can also
work against those rights.
In the next sections, I demonstrate how the Zapatistas'
strategies fall under the umbrella of creative online activism
and why such strategies remain powerful.

Section 2: Creative online activism in
recent times

Organizers have continued using the internet to mobilize, and
their work has arguably been made easier with the
development of mobile phone apps and social media.
This timeline by Mashable gives a selective overview of noted
online activist movements through 2011.

261 | Activism
Algorithms: They can all be
reduced to simple steps, which
computers need in order to follow
them.

                                                     Arab Spring

Creative online activism has developed in conjunction with
social media apps since the mid-2000s. These apps are

                                                                                    Activism | 262
certainly not created equal when it comes to facilitating
activism; in fact, some have been found to intentionally hinder
the exposure of social injustice. For example, although they
have had a huge user base for the last decade, Facebook
algorithms have been found to hide or slow controversial and
"negative" stories from its users' feeds, making it a poor
platform for activism.
But the platform is only a small part of the recipe for an activist
movement. Human creativity has facilitated the use of
technologies in activism in ways software developers never
imagined. In a typical example of human shaping of
technology, Twitter leadership didn't build hashtags into the
platform intentionally and even rejected the idea that they
would be widely used; human users proved them wrong.
Several years later, Twitter hashtags began playing important
roles in online activism, including in the Arab Spring protests.

     Respond to this case study: What strategies made
     Tana's campaign uniquely suited to social media, as
     opposed to traditional electoral media like newspaper
     advertisements, television commercials, and campaign
     mailers? Describe another political messaging
     campaign or endorsement that grabbed your attention
     in recent years. Describe the platform(s) involved, the
     technological affordances, and how your various
     publics responded.

Social media platforms like Twitter are sometimes practically
credited with creating movements, but this technological
determinism fails to recognize how much complex human
wrangling is required to run an online campaign and keep
control of its message. Only a small percentage of protestors
used Twitter to exchange key information and then
disseminated that information through face-to-face
communication and other media. All messages that spread
widely online face the threat of oversimplification and

265 | Activism
appropriation; only the best-executed retain their depth and
complexity. And, regardless of platform, the real work for social
change still happens across various digital and analog (non-
digital) platforms - and most crucially, on the ground.

267 | Activism
Section 3: The Black Lives Matter
Movement

One of the most well-known online movements to date is Black
Lives Matter. The central phrase and hashtag of this movement
came from Alicia Garza and Patrisse Marie Cullors-Brignac in
July 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman
in the killing of 12-year-old Trayvon Martin. Armed with this
concise phrase - and fueled by outrage over injustices against
black citizens by American institutions including law
enforcement today - Black Lives Matter has built into a
sophisticated movement online and offline with profound
influence on government policy and popular consciousness.
Although its signature phrase began online, the Black Lives
Matter movement gained traction over the next year as Twitter
users deployed #BlackLivesMatter to mobilize on the ground.

                                                                                    Activism | 268
Subsequent hashtags used in connection with
#BlackLivesMatter networked protestors and helped them
assemble massive on-the-ground demonstrations very quickly
after subsequent police killings. These included #ferguson to
organize protests in Ferguson, Missouri after police were
acquitted in the killing of Michael Brown there in November
2014.

Black Lives Matter campaigns have deployed several strategies
that were key to the EZLN campaign, as well as to other online
activist movements. To make it easy to understand the
strategies these movements deployed in common, I will list
them and describe them in the next section.
Five strategies deployed by creative online activist
movements:

  · 1. Speed
  · 2. Visuals
  · 3. Performances
  · 4. Inclusiveness
  · 5. "Masked" leadership

271 | Activism
Speedy response has been key in the Black Lives Matter movement

1. Speed
Like the Zapatista online campaign, it was crucial in 2015 that
Black Lives Matter protestors mobilize with speed. Responding
fast to the actions of government or authorities allowed both
movements to gather large publics when outrage over
authorities' decisions was high. In Black Lives Matter, an
immediate response also sent the message that this public
would not tolerate police violence any longer - effective
immediately.

                                                                                    Activism | 272
Hands up, don't shoot is a powerful phrase: It became a hashtag , an
easily recognized gesture, and an on-the-ground synced
performance.

2. Visuals

In both the Zapatista and Black Lives Matter movements,
campaign organizers gathered attention through the effective
use of visual content. Images of the masked Zapatista army are
still widely circulated online. This article in WIRED Magazine
explores the spreadable content of the Black Lives Matter
movement, especially the visuals - photographs easily shared
online that evoked the in-person experience of being black, in
protest.

3. Performances

We must also remember the performances involved in each
of these protests. The Zapatistas called a truce at a dramatic
moment that would have cast the Mexican government as
the villain if they continued to fight the small EZLN army. In
Black Lives Matter, hashtags like #HandsUpDontShoot remind
us that these protestors moved together in synced gestures

273 | Activism
that gave tremendous energy to their on-the-ground protests.
Reenactment has also been an effective performance strategy,
exemplified in protestors using the #icantbreathe hashtag to
reenact the video of Eric Garner dying after police ignored his
repeated pleas of "I can't breathe."

Online activism scholar Paolo Gerbaudo phrases it this way:
Online media can be used for the "choreography of assembly"
in organizing on-the-ground demonstrations. That is, online
organizers can choreograph individual acts of cultural
repetition (memes, discussed more in Chapter 7), such as
clothing or gestures protestors can repeat to recognize and
reinforce one another's work. And they can organize the
meeting places, escape routes, and conduct massive groups
of people. Gerbaudo notes that these actions can influence
public consciousness most powerfully when they occur in a
symbolic center - some meaningful public place that serves as
a theatrical stage for activism to be seen and performed. A park
in a city center, a football field, the Olympic medal ceremonies,
and a memorial statue: All of these have been symbolic centers
for protest in the US and abroad.

4. Inclusiveness

Black Lives Matter's strategy was also similar to the Zapatistas'
in the inclusiveness of the campaign. It was understood and
stated by those in the movement that women must have equal
access to the rights being fought for, and that in-family
violence was part of what they were fighting. In Black Lives
Matter, rights around gender and sexuality were always part of
the discussion, as exemplified in this movement "herstory."

Today's social media-fueled movements tend to use rhetoric
that acknowledges differences in power among the people
they fight for or represent. This sets modern rights campaigns
apart from some rights movements in the past. Both the Civil
Rights and Black Panther movements focused on black men

                                                                                    Activism | 274
more than other citizens. The 20th-century women's rights
movements focused more on white women than any others.
The 20th-century gay rights movement centralized the
identities of white gay men. "Not your grandfather's civil rights
movement," is one way Black Lives Matter has been described,
reminding us that today's movements broaden the focus from
fathers and grandfathers to the rest of the family, the
organization, and the community.
5. "Masked" organizers
In modern online activism, leaders wear masks - literally, and
sometimes, figuratively. In the 20th-century, a much-
remembered feature of social activism campaigns like the Civil
Rights Movement was their visible leadership and culture of
"heroes." Dr. Martin Luther King is commonly remembered as
the "father" of the Civil Rights Movement. Meanwhile, as this
article by Jamil Cobb on Black Lives Matter reminds us, there
were other strategies at work in the Civil Rights movement
as well as leaders who shunned the spotlight, like Ella Baker
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Today, the
branding has shifted, with many declaring today's online
activist movements "leaderless."

275 | Activism
Anonymous as a masked activist

The Zapatista spokesman Subcomandante Marcos was a
bridge between these two styles of organization, the 20th-
century heroic leader versus the 21st-century decentralized
campaign. Marcos was the Zapatistas' most visible "hero." But
he wore a mask, hid his true identity, and chose the false title
of "Subcommander" (subordinate Commander) rather than
"Commander." A decade later, the "hacktivist" group
Anonymous began organizing actions on 4chan in which the
identities of the organizers and participants were not known;
Anonymous made significant appearances during protests
against the World Trade Organization. More recently, there
have been figurative masks on many popular online
movements including Occupy Wall Street, with all insisting
there are no leaders. The strategy of "masked" organizers

                                                                                    Activism | 276
makes a movement difficult to defeat, while also resisting the
persistent surveillance that is a function of the internet, and
that can get activists jailed or killed.

Section 5: Advancing and
complicating social activism through
online engagement

There are many critiques of online activism as inferior to more
traditional forms of activism. For example, techno-sociologist
Zeynep Tufecki argues that by removing the hard work and
shared risk of social organizing, social media technologies
gather demonstrators too quickly for them to understand one
another and think together. In another critique, scholar Evgeny
Morozov uses the term "slacktivism" to characterize certain
low-risk levels of "activism" such as signing online petitions,
which offer participants the illusion they are contributing
significantly, at zero risk to themselves. While these critiques
may overlook the subtle shifts in the public consciousness that
online chatter can affect, they have merit. As illustrated by the
Zapatistas in Chiapas and Black Lives Matter in Missouri, online
activism is at its most powerful when on-the-ground action
provides roots to online campaigns.

However they are branded, successful online activism
movements are never dependent only on leaders, and they
are also never leaderless. Rather, modern activist movements
in the US in particular are often ignited through interactions
between key driving forces or personalities and then mobilized
by networked groups of people who respond together. This
idea, which author David Karpf has called an "organizational
layer" of American political advocacy, may be the closest we

277 | Activism
can come to accurately describing the real effects of the
internet on how we do activism.

Core Questions

A. Questions for qualitative thought:

    1. Design a hypothetical online activist campaign
        for a cause you care about. Utilize the strategies
        discussed in the chapter and consider the
        potential challenges and opportunities you might
        face in the current digital landscape.

                                                                               Activism | 282
        2. Brainstorm ways to bridge the gap between
             online and offline activism, maximizing the
             collective impact of both spheres. How can online
             initiatives inspire on-the-ground action and vice
             versa?

        3. Compare and contrast how the Zapatista and
             Black Lives Matter movements utilized the
             specific technological affordances of their
             respective eras (early web vs. social media) to
             achieve their goals. How did historical and
             cultural contexts influence their choices and the
             overall effectiveness of their online strategies?

   B. Review: Which is the best answer?

climate once more, here's how the
movement and its tactics have
changed

On Friday, students will once again down textbooks
and laptops and go on strike for climate action. Many

                                                                              Activism | 286
     will give their schools a Climate Doctor's Certificate
     signed by three leading climate academics.
     These strikes - part of a National Climate Strike - mark
     five years since school students started walking out of
     schools to demand greater action on climate change.
     In 2018, the first students to strike defied calls by then
     prime minister Scott Morrison for "less activism" and to
     stay in school.
     Last year, Australia voted out the Morrison government,
     in what was widely seen as a climate election. Teal
     independents won Liberal heartland seats on climate
     platforms, while the Greens recorded high votes. Labor
     came to office promising faster action on climate.
     So why are school students still striking? Has the
     movement changed its focus? We have been
     researching these questions alongside young people
     involved in climate action in the ongoing Striking
     Voices project, as well as through the coauthor's Sapna
     South Asian Climate Solidarity project.
     We found the movement has expanded its demands
     from climate action to climate justice, stressing the
     uneven and unfair distribution of climate impacts. The
     movement itself has also become more diverse.

From climate action to climate justice

Across the world, young climate advocates such as
those from School Strike 4 Climate are calling for
"climate justice" alongside "climate action".
Why? Because climate change doesn't impact
everyone equally. As the Australian Youth Climate
Coalition puts it, it's "often the most marginalised in our
societies who are hit first and worst by climate impacts
and carry the burden of polluting industries".
Mere semantics? No. The idea of climate justice draws
attention to existing social and ethical injustices which
climate change amplifies. The phrase also points to the

                                                                              Activism | 288
     need for climate solutions that work for people in a
     transformative way and help create collective and just
     societies.
     In Australia, calls for climate justice are intimately
     connected with justice for First Nations people and to
     protecting, defending and "heal[ing] Country", as Seed
     Mob write, with First Nations-led solutions.
     Climate justice is central to the messaging of groups
     such as Pacific Climate Warriors diaspora, and Sapna
     South Asian Climate Solidarity.
     In our conversations with young people, climate justice
     appears highly compelling. High-school student
     Yehansa Dahanayake explained:

            I think I'd always thought of climate change as
            sort of a 2D thing. I thought about it as the
            temperature rise, deforestation, and sea caps
            melting - and while that is definitely true, I think
            [when] I started to learn about the justice
            aspects of climate change, [it] made me realise
            that there are many other factors that tie in,
            such as the Global North/ Global South
            difference and how that relates.

     High-school student Emma Heyink told us about the
     importance of what she called a "justice-centred lens":

            You can't look at climate change without
            looking at all these other issues. It just becomes
            so much more interlinked and solutions become
            so much more obvious.

289 | Activism
Diversifying networks and strategies

So who are these young people, and what have they
been doing in recent years?
Swedish student Greta Thunberg is frequently credited
as sparking the youth-led climate movement.
But the movement is much larger - and more diverse
- than one person, and increasingly so in recent years.
As a report by Sapna points out, Australia's youth-led
climate justice networks are more likely to be racially
diverse than mainstream climate movements.
Yet climate justice networks are not immune from the
oppressive dynamics they protest against. When the
coauthor interviewed 12 now-graduated school strikers
of South Asian heritage, they reported sometimes
feeling sidelined in climate spaces - which are often
white-dominated - as well as in media opportunities.
As one young person put it, it seemed "hard to tell a
brown person's climate justice story".
There are signs of positive change. The upheaval of the
COVID pandemic saw stronger connections emerge
between social movements, and clearer links between
intersecting crises and injustices, both globally and in
youth-led climate networks.
As recent high-school graduate and school strike
organiser Owen Magee explained:

       at our strikes, we are platforming First Nations

                                                                              Activism | 290
            people, rural and regional people who've
            directly been affected by the climate crisis,
            directly being affected by fossil fuel greed and
            corporation greed. That in itself is focusing on
            the intersectional nature of climate justice.
     You can see this cross-pollination in the support shown
     by young advocates across multiple climate justice
     networks in the Power Up gathering on Gomeroi
     Country in northwestern New South Wales to show
     solidarity with Traditional Owners fighting coal and gas
     projects on their lands.
     The targets and tactics of youth-led climate justice
     networks have shifted and proliferated in recent years -
     for example, to the banks that finance fossil fuel
     companies.

291 | Activism
Targets, tactics and strategies have evolved since 2018.
Student Strike 4 Climate/Flickr, CC BY
When school strikers graduate, some move into
different modes of climate-related action.
Some have taken part in strategic climate litigation in a
bid to create legislation embedding a climate duty of
care for young people in government decisions on
issues such as fracking approvals.

                                                                              Activism | 292
     Others are involved in non-violent direct actions, such
     as next week's Rising Tide People's Blockade of the
     world's largest coal port in Newcastle.
     Young climate advocates are battling for climate justice
     on a wide range of fronts. They are calling on politicians
     to do the same.

     Voices project research associates, Natasha

DIANA DALY

       Key points

            · The notion of content going viral suggests it
                spreads uncontrollably like a virus. However,
                content sharing is a deliberate act, driven by
                human agency and motivations.

            · Spreadability, proposed by Jenkins, Bell, and
                Green, replaces the viral metaphor. It
                emphasizes the role of users in sharing
                content within their networks and explores the
                dynamic nature of online cultures.

            · Crowdcultures, emerging from subcultures or
                art worlds, play a crucial role in making
                content spreadable. Advertisers must navigate
                and understand these cultures to create
                relevant and resonant content.

            · Ken Bone became an internet sensation
                during the 2016 presidential debate due to
                factors like memeability, relatability as a
                regular guy, offering a national ceasefire, and
                being an undecided voter - a rare find during
                a polarized election.

            · Holt's analysis of branding in the age of social
                media highlights the need for continuous
                innovation, understanding cultural flashpoints,
                and the challenge of remaining relevant.

Often when people talk about what works in advertising online,
they make it sound like it's the content itself that decides to
spread. This is the idea behind the word viral: It suggests some
content is just irresistible and spread by its human hosts almost
without their choosing.

The Salt Bae meme, from Turkish chef Nurs_et

Think about this. This virus idea just isn't how media works.
There wasn't some virus that made you share a meme last year,
or a song, or a video. If you shared that Salt Bae meme, it was
because you wanted people to see it, and you wanted them
to see it coming from you. You have human agency when you
share things online, and you invest a piece of your identity in
everything you share. You also may have strong reasons for
sharing content, whether those reasons are personal, social,
political, satirical, or all of these.

Why do larger, experienced companies sometimes falter in
making their content spreadable while some gestures,
phrases, pics, and videos spread in ways even their creators
could not predict and maybe didn't even want?
Misunderstandings abound as humans try to make sense of
the relatively new world of social media content trends.

301 | Memes
Still, in this chapter, we will brave the pitfalls and offer some
explanations and strategies for spreading content online. And
we look at a few cases of companies and creators who have
succeeded in making content spreadable, along with some
spectacular failures.

Section 1: What is spreadability, and
why is it important?

Social networks: To reach viewers today, advertisers must reach their
contacts, because social media users are looking at each other, not
directly at advertisers. (Image: Social networks connecting individuals

The vocabulary used to refer to online sharing trends is
unstable, with users adopting and spreading terms by users
that may misrepresent what they name. Humans understand

                                                                                      Memes | 302
new phenomena in the world by comparing them to what we
already know - which can be problematic, as the old and new
phenomena will not be the same.

Take the word meme, for example. It originated in the work
of a biologist (Richard Dawkins, in his 1976 book The Selfish
Gene) to describe something that spreads like a gene, only by
cultural rather than biological means. However, this definition
is based on a metaphor rather than an observation of how
content spreads. A better definition is one that acknowledges
the qualities of memes - for example, noting that users often
modify them as they spread them.

So it is with the concept of the media virus. Users and popular
media outlets refer incessantly to media "viruses" and "viral"
media. But viruses are biological phenomena. Can cultural
phenomena really behave the same way?

The theorists Jenkins, Bell, and Green, have written critically of
the notions behind the concept of "viral media;" Instead, they
offer the notion of spreadability. This relates to concepts we
began discussing in Chapter 2 of this book, in the section on
"The People Formerly Known as the Audience." In the 20th
century, advertising depended on one broadcasting outlet
keeping the eyes of audiences directly on that broadcaster's
content. In the age of social media, though, users are not
looking at that one broadcaster or television station; they are
looking at each other. And with limitless choices and content
online vying for their attention, to attract views, you have to
convince users to share your content with their publics: their
families, "friends," and networking contacts.

One of the crucial points in Spreadable Media is that online
cultures work together as agents to make content spread. A
company cannot do it alone. Consumers of the media content
a company desires to spread must become sharers, and even

303 | Memes
producers: liking, reposting, sharing with specific publics,
meming, creating fanfiction offshoots, and making the content
their own. Spreadability is Jenkins, Bell, and Green's theory of
how content spreads online - although it is not a strategy any
agent can control. Indeed, spreadability requires some loss of
control of content by the creator.
To begin to understand how to make content spreadable in
this way, let's look at an example of content that spread almost
inadvertently - without anyone really even planning for it to
explode.

Section 2: Ken Bone as meme, truce,
and unicorn

Ken Bone during the 2016 presidential debate, from The New
York Times
During the second presidential debate in 2016, a man named
Ken Bone asked a question and became an internet sensation
via #BoneZone. Why?
I always speak with my students about social media news. The
day the Ken Bone memes exploded, I asked one insightful
group I had why. Why did everyone go nuts over Ken Bone? In

                                                                                      Memes | 304
the discussion that followed, we went over several factors that
helped Ken Bone spread so fast. Here are four of them:

1. Ken Bone was easy to meme.

His sweater was red. His face was small. His glasses were neat
rectangles. His shape when cut out was roundy like a cloud.
Ken Bone was so memeable he was drawn by Disney before his
persona was born. With his collar shirt buttoned up all white
and snug, he appeared to have been lovingly dressed by his
mom. In Pictionary, it would take at least 60 seconds to draw
most people. Ken Bone, maybe 6 seconds. Instant recognition
enables easy imitation, making Ken Bone's image a very
spreadable social object. Plus his name only takes up 7
characters. That's spreadable.

2. Ken Bone was a regular guy - very unlike both 2016
Presidential candidates.

While their backgrounds were different, candidates Trump and
Clinton had both long occupied the high halls of the privileged.
Watching them battle one another on stage was like watching
Godzilla and Mothra. Fascinating... but where were the humans
to be tossed around in their struggle? Election cycles have
grown so long that the American public's attention span for the
two candidates had begun to peter out. And then came the
human caricature, Ken Bone - like switching the channel first
to a reality TV show, then a cartoon.

3. Ken Bone was a national ceasefire.

It has been a brutal election battle, with most of the American
public in filter bubbles echoing with rage, and occasionally
coming into hostile contact with the opposite side. And then
came Ken Bone - a Twitter user called him, "a human version of
a hug," which a popular blogger subsequently rephrased as "a
hug, personified." Everyone could like him. He was a safe topic

305 | Memes
at family gatherings. And maybe he was a messenger dove,
cooing in his kind voice that after that awful election, political
enemies might eventually be able to talk to each other again.
4. Ken Bone was an undecided voter - a unicorn.
For many, it was difficult to believe any Ken Bones even existed.
Viewers marveled when he appeared: There are undecided
voters? In this polarizing election? Where do they live? Is it
quieter there? Do rivers sparkle with the ether of forgetfulness?
Oh my goodness... there's one now! Bone's fame only grew
when it was discovered that before that pivotal 15 seconds of
exposure, he had only 7 Twitter followers - and two were his
grandmothers. What a wonderful little public that must be.
The end of Ken Bone's fame
Of course. the truce between Clinton and Trump supporters
could not last. Bone, online searches revealed, had posted
things online in the past that not everyone could love. His
brand was compromised. If only he'd lasted through
Thanksgiving, we might not have needed Adele.
The internet is a dangerous place for unicorns.

So if you are an advertiser, how do you do what Ken Bone did
- combined with what viewers created out of what Ken Bone
did - and how do you keep the resulting culture going? How
do you make a lasting brand with spreadable content?
One worthwhile analysis of this topic is in Holt's Branding in
the Age of Social Media in the March 2016 Harvard Business
Review. Some important terms to understand from the article
are branding, crowdcultures, and art worlds.
In the article, Holt explains branding as "a set of techniques

309 | Memes
designed to generate cultural relevance." What this means is
that branding requires paying attention to cultures online.
Cultures are like publics, except cultures have much deeper
roots. Cultures are practices, symbols, meanings, and much
more shared by people who have coexisted in a place or other
site or context. To brand successfully today you have to learn
about the cultures you are marketing to: their inside jokes,
trends, taboos, and so much that can be hard to understand to
cultural outsiders.

Holt writes that much of the internet is based in crowdcultures,
which are cultures around certain concepts, including
products. Crowdcultures can come from two sources,
subcultures or art worlds. These crowdcultures may be
subcultures - people who are deeply devoted to these
concepts. Or they may come out of art worlds, with people
talented in creating online content and making a culture more
attractive and resonant even if it's all very new. Ken Bone grew
out of art worlds, with artistic people quickly meming him into
videos and images, which attracted a crowdculture that
continued to spread him.

How did those initial art world creators know that Ken Bone
would spread quickly? Maybe they didn't. But if they did, they
understood some of the beliefs and interests of the American
people who spread him. They knew how to read the culture
their crowd would come from.

Holt breaks down the process of reading and marketing to
a culture. Below I list each of these steps followed by an
explanation. What is important to understand is that your
company cannot do it alone; you need the help of users,
tastemakers, bloggers, and others to become an internet
sensation.

1. Map the cultural orthodoxy.

                                                                                      Memes | 310
To read a culture and understand how to market to its
members, first ask, "What are the conventions to break from?"
If you want to attract the attention of Americans entrenched
in pre-election political warfare, you might notice at this point
that the cultural orthodoxy around the #debate at that time is
intensely negative and partisan.

2. Locate the cultural opportunity.

The cultural opportunity means finding whatever is missing
from the current landscape around that culture and seeing
how you can fill that gap. If you noticed that election debate
viewers are surrounded by negative, partisan media, the
cultural opportunity might involve imagining something
refreshingly hopeful and nonpartisan.

3. Target the crowdculture.

Once you've located the cultural opportunity, you must next
locate the tastemakers and hubs for spreading content in that
culture. What networks should you plug into once you have
content to spread? For example, Buzzfeed found some of the
initial user-created Ken Bone memes on social media sites like
Twitter and Reddit and then spread them more widely.

4. Diffuse the new ideology.

Your new content piece is the new ideology, and it should
"embrace subcultural mythologies" - joining the active
conversations already taking place in the networks and
cultures you are targeting. Still, you must be careful here to
avoid whatever your content is trying not to be. No content
mentioning Trump or Clinton spread in the Ken Bone meme.
Talk of the candidates had been the orthodoxy, and everyone
was tired of them! Referring to previous internet memes,
however, might reactivate meming internet cultures.

5. Innovate continually, using cultural flashpoints.

311 | Memes
Chipotle - Back to the Start from Nexus Studios on Vimeo.

This is where many brands face challenges for continued
success; new flashpoints are essential. Chipotle (as seen in the
video embedded above) got the content part right long
enough to do very well as a brand of healthy, natural food.
But over time they struggled to remain relevant, and several
outbreaks of foodborne illnesses drew into question Chipotle's
wholesome branding.

The internet is full of content sensations that never became
brands. #BoneZone and many other Ken Bone memes were
initially unstoppable! But Ken Bone did not last long as a highly
successful brand...which may have been ok with him as he
never endeavored to be a brand in the first place. Remaining
relevant in the age of social media requires constant
monitoring of the cultures you must entice to promote your
brand with you. And if you're a countercultural meme (or even
a countercultural brand), you can only last as long as your icon
resists being taken over by the mainstream.

Section 4: Failing at branding: Pepsi's
2017 "Black Lives Matter" ad

In one of the worst advertising mishaps in recent years, a large
company attempted to follow the steps for cultural branding
- but severely misread the targeted cultures and their own
product. In a 2017 commercial, the Pepsi corporation tried to
capitalize on widespread attention to the Black Lives Matter
movement (discussed in Chapter 6), while failing to hear all of
the demands of the protestors at the center of that culture. The
immediate backlash led them to take the ad down within 24
hours.

                                                                                       Memes | 312
How could Pepsi, a multinational corporation with decades of
marketing experience, have gotten it so wrong?

It is easy to speculate some of what Pepsi was going for. From
the imagery in the ad, we can reasonably assume that Pepsi ad
executives were inspired by dramatic images of real Black Lives
Matter protesters that struck chords with online publics. And
Pepsi execs may also have been trying to match the massive
success their competitor Coca Cola had achieved with their
Hilltop Ad, in which their product idealistically bonds young,
attractive people across national, racial, and ethnic boundaries.

But that Hilltop ad was in 1971. And those dramatic images
of Black Live Matter protestors involved real people putting
themselves at risk to address persistent, thorny issues. Black
Lives Matter had indeed gathered a formidable crowdculture -
but a can of Pepsi had no place in their conversations. Placing a
white woman with a Pepsi as the problem solver at the center
of an explosive racial issue was deeply insulting to many
people. Whichever Pepsi executive dreamed up the 2017 ad, it
was a bad idea.

This brings up a more important question: How did such a
bad idea make it out of the drawing board room? Eric Thomas,
a LinkedIn Brand Specialist, connects what happened in that
room to a lack of diversity:

       "This is what happens when you don't have enough
       people in leadership that reflect the cultures that you
       represent. Somewhere in the upper levels where this
       commercial was approved, one of two things happened.
       Either there was not enough diversity -- race, gender,
       lifestyle, age or otherwise -- or worse, there was a
       culture that made people uncomfortable to express
       how offensive this video is."

Internet cultures can dupe also advertisers in multiple ways.

313 | Memes
First, the level of bias and cultural appropriation online within
connected publics may make fool advertisers into seeing
widespread acceptance of these culturally insensitive
practices. A recent exploration of "digital blackface" by New
York Times journalist Amanda Hess captures one example of
a common online practice big advertisers would be wise to
avoid.

The other misleading quality is that brands today are far
more global than in the past, so branding is particularly tricky.
Reading cultures well requires teams of people who
acknowledge their own biases and think deeply about social
issues. The takeaway from Pepsi's spectacular failure, then,
may be this: Diversity is essential in successful branding in the
digital age. We have to welcome, listen to, and become all the
voices at the table to get it right - or at least avoid spectacular
wrongs.

From National Geographic's YouTube Channel

You probably saw it.

A "viral" video of an emaciated polar bear in 2017 led to
significant chatter about climate change on social media. Yet
there is another heating climate that has my colleagues and
I worried as Information Scientists. Social media is a hotbed
for videos, images, and memes about science: not just climate
change but news on NASA activities, the EPA, vaccinations, and
many other fiery topics for the American public. In this hot
mess, our concern was - and remains - how difficult it has
become, to tell the truth.

Why shouldn't science be packaged and spread online? In
recent years there has been an understandable push by
scientists and those who fund our work to make our findings
accessible. This has meant moving beyond peer-reviewed
journals and science-focused publications, creating flashy
media that will interest non-scientists, and unleashing it on
social networks. These strategies seem reasonable: Our work is
funded by the public, so it should be accessible to the public.
More importantly, to fight human-caused phenomena like
climate change we need to inspire shifts in human behavior
on a massive scale. Social media seem designed for the mass
appeal that our mission to educate requires.

The problem arises when we chase public attention at the
expense of good science. Yes, it is essential that scientists tell
engaging stories - but the stories have to be about our
findings, not just our observations. The video of the polar bear
filmed by a photographer for SeaLegacy was first spread with
no text on the video itself, separating the project's observations
from deeper analysis.

Was the bear's sad condition related to climate change? Yes
- but in complicated ways that the video did not convey. This

315 | Memes
lack of analysis invited users and media outlets like National
Geographic to omit the initial poster's description and meme it
with their own interpretations on social media. The video and
these less-than-scientific interpretations of its meaning spread
like wildfire, prompting a mass reckoning over the effects of
human behavior on our world - but also legitimate complaints
about the accuracy of claims attached to the video. This spark
of legitimate debate then quickly ignited across networks of
climate change skeptics, playing as evidence that scientists lie.

It is so tempting to package our stories to sell, rather than tell
the whole truth. Researchers have found that content based on
exaggerations and lies spreads faster on Twitter than content
based on truth. The less true a story is, the more it may appear
to be breaking news, and the easier it is to make it flashy.

Is it worth burning past steps in the scientific method to spread
our message? Even in a warming world, we don't think so.
A 2016 Pew study found that less than a third of Americans
believed scientists on the causes of climate change, and under
one fifth trusted scientists in general "a great deal." More than
half selected the second-highest option, saying they trusted
scientists "a fair amount." When we allow one video of one bear
to take the place of analyzed findings, we trade a fickle public's
attention for the more valuable asset of public trust. In August
2018 National Geographic published an acknowledgment that
they "went too far" in reducing the bear's condition to the
effects of climate change.

       We estimate that an astonishing 2.5 billion people were
       reached by our footage. The mission was a success, but
       there was a problem: We had lost control of the
       narrative. The first line of the National Geographic video
       said, "This is what climate change looks like"--with
       "climate change" highlighted in the brand's distinctive
       yellow. ~ SeaLegacy photographer Cristina G.

                                                                                       Memes | 316
       Mittermeier, in the 2018 issue of National Geographic
       Magazine
Today's scientists must all be good media producers. We need
to understand the climate not only of the Earth we live on, but
of the world that receives, spreads, and memes that media.
We need to transcend tribalism and understand how our
messages spread, to those who trust us and those who do
not. Most importantly, we need to apply the same rigor to our
media production that we apply to our studies. Seeing a
starving polar bear on snowless terrain did make some social
media users sweat over their own energy use. But it also
burned a little more public trust in scientific research and
institutions.

   Spiritual Narcissism

     Release Date: June 1st 2022
     In this episode, Jacquie explores how religious figures
     known for their hate and intolerance affect society
     through social media. Join her to see the impact one
     nationalist monk had on Myanmar, one preacher had
     on a past president's safety, and one minister who
     reminds us preaching just scripture isn't enough to
     spread true tolerance and love.

Core Questions

A. Questions for qualitative thought:

    1. How can creators and consumers of online
        content balance agency and influence while
        avoiding cultural appropriation and harm?

   2. How can scientists and other knowledge
        producers leverage meme-able content while
        maintaining accuracy and public trust?

                                                                                 Memes | 322
        3. What alternative models of online spreadability
             can foster meaningful engagement and cultural
             exchange?

   B. Review: Which is the best answer?

   Read it: Memes about animal
   resistance are everywhere -- here's
   why you shouldn't laugh off
   rebellious orcas and sea otters too
   quickly

     It's tempting to envision orcas attacking yachts as the
     forward troops in an animal uprising.

     Memes galore centered on the "orca revolution" have

inundated the online realm. They gleefully depict orcas
launching attacks on boats in the Strait of Gibraltar and
off the Shetland coast.
One particularly ingenious image showcases an orca
posed as a sickle crossed with a hammer. The cheeky
caption reads, "Eat the rich," a nod to the orcas'
penchant for sinking lavish yachts.
A surfboard-snatching sea otter in Santa Cruz,
California has also claimed the media spotlight.
Headlines dub her an "adorable outlaw" "at large."

Memes position the otter as a renegade revolutionary,
modeled on Ché Guevara.
thesurfingotter via Instagram
Memes conjure her in a beret like the one donned by
socialist revolutionary Ché Guevara. In one caption, she
proclaims, "Accept our existence or expect resistance ...
an otter world is possible."

                                                                                Memes | 326
     My scholarship centers on animal-human relations
     through the prism of social justice. As I see it, public
     glee about wrecked surfboards and yachts hints at a
     certain flavor of schadenfreude. At a time marked by
     drastic socioeconomic disparities, white supremacy
     and environmental degradation, casting these marine
     mammals as revolutionaries seems like a projection of
     desires for social justice and habitable ecosystems.
     A glimpse into the work of some political scientists,
     philosophers and animal behavior researchers injects
     weightiness into this jocular public dialogue. The field
     of critical animal studies analyzes structures of
     oppression and power and considers pathways to
     dismantling them. These scholars' insights challenge
     the prevailing view of nonhuman animals as passive
     victims. They also oppose the widespread assumption
     that nonhuman animals can't be political actors.
     So while meme lovers project emotions and
     perspectives onto these particular wild animals,
     scholars of critical animal studies suggest that
     nonhuman animals do in fact engage in resistance.

   Nonhuman animal protest is
   everywhere

     Are nonhuman animals in a constant state of defiance?
     I'd answer, undoubtedly, that the answer is yes.
     The entire architecture of animal agriculture attests to
     animals' unyielding resistance against confinement

327 | Memes
and death. Cages, corrals, pens and tanks would not
exist were it not for animals' tireless revolt.

Even when hung upside down on conveyor hangars,
chickens furiously flap their wings and bite, scratch,
peck and defecate on line workers at every stage of the
process leading to their deaths.

Until the end, hooked tuna resist, gasping and writhing
fiercely on ships' decks. Hooks, nets and snares would
not be necessary if fish allowed themselves to be
passively harvested.

If they consented to repeated impregnation, female
pigs and cows wouldn't need to be tethered to "rape
racks" to prevent them from struggling to get away.

If they didn't mind having their infants permanently
taken from their sides, dairy cows wouldn't need to be
blinded with hoods so they don't bite and kick as the
calves are removed; they wouldn't bellow for weeks
after each instance. I contend that failure to recognize
their bellowing as protest reflects "anthropodenial" -
what ethologist Frans de Waal calls the rejection of
obvious continuities between human and nonhuman
animal behavior, cognition and emotion.

The prevalent view of nonhuman animals remains that
of René Descartes, the 17th-century philosopher who
viewed animals' actions as purely mechanical, like
those of a machine. From this viewpoint, one might
dismiss these nonhuman animals' will to prevail as
unintentional or merely instinctual. But political
scientist Dinesh Wadiwel argues that "even if their
defiance is futile, the will to prefer life over death is a
primary act of resistance, perhaps the only act of

                                                                                Memes | 328
     dissent available to animals who are subject to extreme
     forms of control."

   Creaturely escape artists

     Despite humans' colossal efforts to repress them,
     nonhuman animals still manage to escape from
     slaughterhouses. They also break out of zoos, circuses,
     aquatic parks, stables and biomedical laboratories.
     Tilikum, a captive orca at Sea World, famously killed his
     trainer - an act at least one marine mammal
     behaviorist characterized as intentional.
     Philosopher Fahim Amir suggests that depression
     among captive animals is likewise a form of emotional
     rebellion against unbearable conditions, a revolt of the
     nerves. Dolphins engage in self-harm like thrashing
     against the tank's walls or cease to eat and retain their
     breath until death. Sows whose body-sized cages
     impede them from turning around to make contact
     with their piglets repeatedly ram themselves into the
     metal struts, sometimes succumbing to their injuries.
     Critical animal studies scholars contend that all these
     actions arguably demonstrate nonhuman animals'
     yearning for freedom and their aversion to inequity.
     As for the marine stars of summer 2023's memes,
     fishing gear can entangle and harm orcas. Sea otters
     were hunted nearly to extinction for their fur. Marine
     habitats have been degraded by human activities
     including overfishing, oil spills, plastic, chemical and
     sonic pollution, and climate change. It's easy to

329 | Memes
imagine they might be responding to human actions,
including bodily harm and interference with their turf.

What is solidarity with nonhuman
animals?

Sharing memes that cheer on wild animals is one
thing. But there are more substantive ways to
demonstrate solidarity with animals.
Legal scholars support nonhuman animals' resistance
by proposing that their current classification as
property should be replaced with that of personhood
or beingness.
Nonhuman animals including songbirds, dolphins,
elephants, horses, chimpanzees and bears increasingly
appear as plaintiffs alleging their subjection to
extinction, abuse and other injustices.
Citizenship for nonhuman animals is another pathway
to social and political inclusion. It would guarantee the
right to appeal arbitrary restrictions of domesticated
nonhuman animals' autonomy. It would also mandate
legal duties to protect them from harm.
Everyday deeds can likewise convey solidarity.
Boycotting industries that oppress nonhuman animals
by becoming vegan is a powerful action. It is a form of
political "counter-conduct," a term philosopher Michel
Foucault uses to describe practices that oppose
dominant norms of power and control.

     killed by motor vehicles encourages people to see
     them as beings whose lives and deaths matter, rather
     than mere "roadkill."
     Political scientists recognize that human and
     nonhuman animals' struggles against oppression are
     intertwined. At different moments, the same strategies
     leveraged against nonhuman animals have cast
     segments of the human species as "less than human"
     in order to exploit them.
     The category of the human is ever-shifting and
     ominously exclusive. I argue that no one is safe as long
     as there is a classification of "animality." It confers
     susceptibility to extravagant forms of violence, legally
     and ethically condoned.

     Otter 841 is the wild sea otter off Santa Cruz, California,
     who some observers suspect has had it with surfers in
     her turf.

   Might an `otter world' be possible?

     I believe quips about the marine mammal rebellion
     reflect awareness that our human interests are
     entwined with those of nonhuman animals. The desire
     to achieve sustainable relationships with other species
     and the natural world feels palpable to me within the
     memes and media coverage. And it's happening as

     human-caused activity makes our shared habitats
     increasingly unlivable.
     Solidarity with nonhuman animals is consistent with
     democratic principles - for instance, defending the
     right to well-being and opposing the use of force
     against innocent subjects. Philosopher Amir
     recommends extending the idea that there can be no
     freedom as long as there is still unfreedom beyond the
     species divide: "While we may not yet fully be able to
     picture what this may mean, there is no reason we
     should not begin to imagine it".

       Key points

            · Social media transforms truth, information,
                and knowledge into tangible, actively debated
                entities online, tracked by metrics like page
                views and shares.

            · The chapter explores the prevalence of "fake
                news" and "post-truth" in the social media era,
                contrasting traditional newspaper reliance
                with the instant dissemination through
                platforms.

            · Objectivity, presenting universally valid truths,
                is contrasted with subjectivity, where
                individual perspectives shape event
                presentations, including subjective
                interpretations of historical events.

            · Traditional views of knowledge as elitist are
                challenged by platforms like Wikipedia,
                emphasizing collective intelligence and
                negotiating multiple truths, leading to
                accurate knowledge production.

            · The chapter delves into motivations for
                creating and spreading "fake news," examining
                influences like profit, truth, and the
                democratization of content creation on the
                internet.

                                                                               Information | 334
            · Psychological factors like belief perseverance
                and confirmation bias contribute to the
                acceptance of misinformation, exacerbated by
                social media filter bubbles reinforcing existing
                beliefs.

In the age of social media, the notions of truth, information,
and knowledge are all changing. These notions were once
amorphous and invisible - the kinds of airy, invisible topics
only philosophers and a few scientists studied. But today truth,
information, and knowledge are all represented, constructed,
and battled about online. Page views, shares, and reactions
clue individuals and companies in to what spreads from
machine to machine and mind to mind. Content editable by
users online is negotiated and changed in real time. In this
chapter, we'll look at the problems and opportunities afforded
by social media in relationship with truths and knowledge.

Section 1: "Fake news" and
"post-truth"

Much has been made in recent years of "fake news." This is
a term, favored by the President of the United States among
others, that circulates ubiquitously through social as well as
traditional media. In 2016, Oxford Dictionaries presented "post-
truth" as its "word of the year." But what do these terms mean,
and what do they have to do with social media?

To understand these terms, we have to look closely at what we
expect with the word "news" and notions of truth and "fake"-
ness. These conversations start with the concepts of objectivity
and subjectivity.

Objectivity and subjectivity

To be objective is to present a truth in a way that would also
be true for anyone anywhere; so that truth exists regardless

                                                                               Information | 338
of anyone's perspective. The popular notion of what is true is
often based on this expectation of objective truth.
The expectation of objective truth makes sense in some
situations - related to physics and mathematics, for example.
However, humans' presentations of both current and historic
events have always been subjective - that is, one or more
subjects with a point of view have presented the events as they
see or remember them. When subjective accounts disagree,
journalists and historians face a tricky process of figuring out
why the accounts disagree, and piecing together what the
evidence is beneath subjective accounts, to learn what is true.

Multiple truths = knowledge production

In US society, we have not historically thought about
knowledge as being a negotiation among multiple truths. Even
at the beginning of the 21st century, the production of
knowledge was considered the domain of those privileged
with the highest education - usually from the most powerful
sectors of society. For example, when I was growing up, the
Encyclopedia Britannica was the authority I looked to for
general information about everything. I did not know who the
authors were, but I trusted they were experts.
Enter Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, and everything
changed.

The first version of Wikipedia was founded on a more similar
model to the Encyclopedia Britannica than it is now. It was
called Nupedia, and only experts were invited to contribute.
But then one of the co-founders, Jimmy Wales, decided to try
a new model of knowledge production based on the concept
of collective intelligence, written about by Pierre Lévy. The
belief underpinning collective intelligence, and Wikipedia, is
that no one knows everything, but everyone knows something.
Everyone was invited to contribute to Wikipedia. And everyone
still is.
When many different perspectives are involved, there can be
multiple and even conflicting truths around the same topic.
And there can be intense competition to put forth some
preferred version of events. But the more perspectives you see,
the more knowledge you have about the topic in general. The
results of a negotiation between multiple truths can be
surprisingly accurate. A 2012 study by Oxford University
comparing the accuracy levels of Wikipedia to other online
encyclopedias found Wikipedia had higher accuracy than
Encyclopedia Brittanica.

So what qualifies as "a truth?" Well,
truths are created and sustained from
three ingredients. The first two
ingredients are evidence and sincerity.
That is, truths must involve evidence -
pieces of information that could or can
be seen or otherwise experienced in the
world. And truths must involve sincerity
- the intention of their creator to be
honest.

And the third ingredient of a truth? That is you, the human
reader. As an interpreter, and sometimes sharer/spreader of
online information and "news", you must keep an active mind.
You are catching up with that truth in real-time. Is it true, based
on evidence available to you from your perspective? Even if it
once seemed true, has evidence recently emerged that reveals
it to not be true? Many truths are not true forever; as we learn
more, what once seemed true is often revealed to not be true.

Truths are not always profitable, so they compete with a lot

of other types of content online. As a steward of the world
of online information, you have to work to keep truths in
circulation.

Section 3: Why people spread "fake
news" and bad information

"Fake news" has multiple meanings in our culture today. When
politicians and online discussants refer to stories as fake news,
they are often referring to news that does not match their
perspective. But there are news stories generated today that
are better described as "fake" - based on no evidence.

So why is "fake news" more of an issue today than it was at
some points in the past?

Well, historically "news" has long been the presentation of
information on current events in our world. In past eras of
traditional media, a much smaller number of people published
news content. There were codes of ethics associated with
journalism, such as the Journalist's Creed, written by Walter
Williams in 1914. Not all journalists followed this or any other
code of ethics, but in the past, those who behaved unethically
were often called out by their colleagues and unemployable
with trusted news organizations.

Today, thanks to Web 2.0 and social media sites, nearly anyone
can create and widely circulate stories branded as news; the
case study of a story by Eric Tucker in this New York Times
lesson plan is a good example. And the huge mass of "news"
stories that results involves stories created based on a variety
of motivations. This is why Oxford Dictionaries made the
term post-truth their word of the year for 2016.

People or agencies may spread stories as news online to:

  · spread truth
  · influence others
  · generate profit

345 | Information
Multiple motivations may drive someone to create or spread
a story not based on evidence. But when spreading truth is
not one of the story creators' concerns, you could justifiably
call that story "fake news." I try not to use that term these
days though; it's too loaded with politics. I prefer to call "news"
unconcerned with truth by its more scientific name...

Bullshit!

           Bullshit is a
           scientific
           term for
           information
           spread
           without
           concern for
           truth.

Think I'm bullshitting you when I say bullshit is the scientific
name for fake news? Well, I'm not. There are information
scientists and philosophers who study different types of bad
information, and here are some of the basic overviews of their
classifications for bad information:

  · misinformation = inaccurate information; often spread
      without intention to deceive

  · disinformation = information intended to deceive
  · bullshit = information spread without concern for whether

      or not it's true

                                                                               Information | 346
Professors Kay Mathiesen and Don Fallis at the University of
Arizona have written that much of the "fake news" generated
in the recent election season was bullshit, because producers
were concerned with winning influence or profit or both, but
were unconcerned with whether it was true. Examples include
news generated by a fake news factory in Macedonia.

We believe bullshit, fake news, and other types of deceptive
information based on numerous interconnected human
behaviors. Forbes recently presented an article, Why Your Brain
May Be Wired To Believe Fake News, which broke down a few of
these with the help of the neuroscientist Daniel Levitin. Levitin
cited two well-researched human tendencies that draw us to
swallow certain types of information while ignoring others.

  · One tendency is belief perseverance: You want to keep
      believing what you already believe, treasuring a
      preexisting belief like Gollum treasures the ring in Tolkien's
      Lord of the Rings series.

  · The other tendency is confirmation bias: the brain runs

                                                                               Information | 348
      through the text of something to select the pieces of it
      that confirm what you think is already true, while
      knocking away and ignoring the pieces that don't confirm
      what you believe.

These tendencies to believe what we want to hear and see
are exacerbated by social network-enabled filter bubbles
(described in Chapter 4 of this book.) When we get our news
through social media, we are less likely to see opposing points
of view, which social networking sites filter out, and which we
are unlikely to see on our own.
There is concern that youth and students are particularly
vulnerable to believing deceptive online content. But I believe
that with some training, youth are going to be better at
"reading" than those older than them. Youth are accustomed
to online content layered with pictures, links, and insider
conversations and connections. The trick to "reading" in the
age of social media is to read all of these layers, not just the text.

Tips for "reading" social media news

 1. Put aside your biases. Recognize and put aside your belief
      perseverance and your confirmation bias. You may want a
      story to be true or untrue, but you probably don't want to
      be fooled by it.

351 | Information
2. Read the story's words AND its pictures. What are they
      saying? What are they NOT saying?

 3. Read the story's history AND its sources. Who / where is
      this coming from? What else has come from there and
      from them?

4. Read the story's audience AND its conversations. Who is
      this source speaking to, and who is sharing and speaking
      back? How might they be doing so in coded ways? (Here`s
      an example to make you think about images and
      audience, whether or not you agree with Filipovic's
      interpretation.)

 5. Before you share, consider fact-checking. Reliable fact-
      checking sites at the time of this writing include:

  · politifact.com
  · snopes.com
  · factcheck.org
That said - no one fact-checking site is perfect.; neither is any
one news site. All are subjective and liable to be taken over by
partisan interests or trolls.

   Read It: It's not just about facts:
   Democrats and Republicans have
   sharply different attitudes about
   removing misinformation from social
   media

     Your political leanings go a long way to determine
     whether you think it's a good or bad idea to take down
     misinformation.

     Misinformation is a key global threat, but Democrats

359 | Information
and Republicans disagree about how to address the
problem. In particular, Democrats and Republicans
diverge sharply on removing misinformation from
social media.
Only three weeks after the Biden administration
announced the Disinformation Governance Board in
April 2022, the effort to develop best practices for
countering disinformation was halted because of
Republican concerns about its mission. Why do
Democrats and Republicans have such different
attitudes about content moderation?
My colleagues Jennifer Pan and Margaret E. Roberts
and I found in a study published in the journal Science
Advances that Democrats and Republicans not only
disagree about what is true or false, they also differ in
their internalized preferences for content moderation.
Internalized preferences may be related to people's
moral values, identities or other psychological factors,
or people internalizing the preferences of party elites.
And though people are sometimes strategic about
wanting misinformation that counters their political
views removed, internalized preferences are a much
larger factor in the differing attitudes toward content
moderation.

Internalized preferences or partisan
bias?

In our study, we found that Democrats are about twice
as likely as Republicans to want to remove

                                                                         Information | 360
     misinformation, while Republicans are about twice as
     likely as Democrats to consider removal of
     misinformation as censorship. Democrats' attitudes
     might depend somewhat on whether the content
     aligns with their own political views, but this seems to
     be due, at least in part, to different perceptions of
     accuracy.

     Previous research showed that Democrats and
     Republicans have different views about content
     moderation of misinformation. One of the most
     prominent explanations is the "fact gap": the difference
     in what Democrats and Republicans believe is true or
     false. For example, a study found that both Democrats
     and Republicans were more likely to believe news
     headlines that were aligned with their own political
     views.

     But it is unlikely that the fact gap alone can explain the
     huge differences in content moderation attitudes.
     That's why we set out to study two other factors that
     might lead Democrats and Republicans to have
     different attitudes: preference gap and party
     promotion. A preference gap is a difference in
     internalized preferences about whether, and what,
     content should be removed. Party promotion is a
     person making content moderation decisions based on
     whether the content aligns with their partisan views.

     We asked 1,120 U.S. survey respondents who identified
     as either Democrat or Republican about their opinions
     on a set of political headlines that we identified as
     misinformation based on a bipartisan fact check. Each
     respondent saw one headline that was aligned with
     their own political views and one headline that was

361 | Information
misaligned. After each headline, the respondent
answered whether they would want the social media
company to remove the headline, whether they would
consider it censorship if the social media platform
removed the headline, whether they would report the
headline as harmful, and how accurate the headline
was.

Deep-seated differences

When we compared how Democrats and Republicans
would deal with headlines overall, we found strong
evidence for a preference gap. Overall, 69% of
Democrats said misinformation headlines in our study
should be removed, but only 34% of Republicans said
the same; 49% of Democrats considered the
misinformation headlines harmful, but only 27% of
Republicans said the same; and 65% of Republicans
considered headline removal to be censorship, but only
29% of Democrats said the same.
Even in cases where Democrats and Republicans
agreed that the same headlines were inaccurate,
Democrats were nearly twice as likely as Republicans to
want to remove the content, while Republicans were
nearly twice as likely as Democrats to consider removal
censorship.
https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GJnyn/1/
We didn't test explicitly why Democrats and
Republicans have such different internalized
preferences, but there are at least two possible reasons.

                                                                         Information | 362
     First, Democrats and Republicans might differ in
     factors like their moral values or identities. Second,
     Democrats and Republicans might internalize what
     the elites in their parties signal. For example,
     Republican elites have recently framed content
     moderation as a free speech and censorship issue.
     Republicans might use these elites' preferences to
     inform their own.
     When we zoomed in on headlines that are either
     aligned or misaligned for Democrats, we found a party
     promotion effect: Democrats were less favorable to
     content moderation when misinformation aligned with
     their own views. Democrats were 11% less likely to want
     the social media company to remove headlines that
     aligned with their own political views. They were 13%
     less likely to report headlines that aligned with their
     own views as harmful. We didn't find a similar effect for
     Republicans.
     Our study shows that party promotion may be partly
     due to different perceptions of accuracy of the
     headlines. When we looked only at Democrats who
     agreed with our statement that the headlines were
     false, the party promotion effect was reduced to 7%.

   Implications for social media
   platforms

     We find it encouraging that the effect of party
     promotion is much smaller than the effect of
     internalized preferences, especially when accounting

363 | Information
for accuracy perceptions. However, given the huge
partisan differences in content moderation
preferences, we believe that social media companies
should look beyond the fact gap when designing
content moderation policies that aim for bipartisan
support.
Future research could explore whether getting
Democrats and Republicans to agree on moderation
processes - rather than moderation of individual pieces
of content - could reduce disagreement. Also, other
types of content moderation such as downweighting,
which involves platforms reducing the virality of certain
content, might prove to be less contentious. Finally, if
the preference gap - the differences in deep-seated
preferences between Democrats and Republicans - is
rooted in value differences, platforms could try to use
different moral framings to appeal to people on both
sides of the partisan divide.
For now, Democrats and Republicans are likely to
continue to disagree over whether removing
misinformation from social media improves public
discourse or amounts to censorship.

Expressions of and searches for love and sexuality pervade all
corners of the web today, particularly the world of mobile
applications. If there is one area of life that we can say has been
deeply changed by technology today, it is the conflagration of

367 | Relationships
love, sex, loneliness, and marketing which we will simply call
online dating.

Section 1: Sexting and selfies

As always, history reveals that the changes enacted through
technology on online dating have been gradual; that there is
a great deal of convergence between how we have loved and
lusted in the past and how we do so now. For example, this
video by the Atlantic Monthly provides examples of sexual
texting or "sexting" style messages exchanged among lovers
and lusters in generations and centuries past.

                                                                                        Erotic

                                                                                        particularly
                                                                                        nudes of

                                                                                        have been
                                                                                        circulated
                                                                                        for

Selfies are a new genre of photography, and art, according
to Jerry Saltz in this article for New York Magazine. They also
may signify a new sense of self-reflection that is redefining
romance and sexuality. For example, images of nude women

                                                                            Relationships | 368
have been circulated on every type of medium used in history.
But in the age of selfies and sexting, women are now the most
frequent photographers of the female form; the sexualizing
gaze is directed at the self, and then shared with the world. In
her article entitled Sexting as Media Production, Amy Hasinoff
promotes the idea that sexting can be empowering for young
women. She also unveils the complications when laws
designed to punish people for circulating pornographic
images and abusing children are applied to young people who
are expressing sexuality over phones and online. As seen in the
erotic photos just above, the online circulation of sexualized
images is an old practice with new players.

Section 2: Connecting to the network
and infiltrating the tribe

A significant part of human social life is organized around who
we form lasting romantic relationships. The online world, once
idealized as a place of anonymity and separation from offline
life, now has networks devoted to replicating offline life online,
and building networks of relationships. These interconnected
relationships are what experts really mean when we talk
about social networks, which sociologists began studying
decades before online social networking sites existed.

Dating is important. It offers the rare invitation for someone
unconnected with one's social network to enter, at least
temporarily. Dating can be the preface to an intimate
relationship and potentially a lasting one. So, this invitation
can't be extended to just anyone; we have to vet people before
they can enter the inner sanctums of our lives, and biases can
play significant roles in that vetting. The discomfort of this
process for a new partner of a different race is captured in

369 | Relationships
two films about a young black man coming to the home of
the family of his white girlfriend: 1967's Guess Who's Coming
to Dinner, and 2017's Get Out, which explored these themes
through the lens of horror. Yet even when dating does not end
in horrific consequences, it is still a high-stakes activity.

But is dating always so serious? What if the connection is
intended, by one or more of those involved, to be just about

sex? Well, that is part of human history as
well. And it still has significant
emotional and social consequences.

Section 3: The sequence for seeking
someone special

A cellular phone number in one study represented a new layer of
intimacy. Does it still? (Image: https://pixabay.com/photos/
cell-phone-mobile-phone-technology-791365/, cell-phone-791365_640,
kaboompics, CC0)

In a 2014 article entitled From Facebook to Cell Calls, Yang and
coauthors found that college students progressed through
layers of electronic intimacy - different media chosen as
benchmarks in the progression of a romantic relationship.
When they were interested in someone, they began by
connecting with a "crush" through Facebook, which allowed

                                                                             Relationships | 372
the "crush" to see who their admirer's friends were and how
the admirer looked, communicated, and behaved. The next
layer was instant messaging - direct communication, but not
as direct as the use of one's "digits" or cellular connection. After
instant messaging, they moved to the more intimate sanctum
of text messaging. The final step was a face-to-face meeting.
Overall, this sequence of media they used followed a pattern:
they began by performing in front of and viewing one
another's social networks, then moved into more direct one-
on-one communication before meeting in person.

Data in the above study was likely collected in 2011 or 2012. So,
what might people like the participants in Yang and coauthors'
study be doing to find romance now, five years later? College
students today may be using some different platforms in their
pursuit of new connections than the students in Yang et al's
study; Instagram is likely high on the list.

However, it is also likely that at least some of the pursuit of
romantic interests that happened through different media in
the past is now consolidating in online dating sites. The Pew
Research Center published a report in 2016 about the growing
number of Americans who have used online dating. They
found that online dating usage by those aged 18-24 has nearly
tripled since 2013 and usage by those aged 55-64 has doubled;
other age groups' use has increased as well.

Section 4: Do dating apps do what we
did before?

Online dating apps afford the presentation of ourselves to
prospective friends, partners, mates, and hookups. On these
apps, users' imagery and self-description tend to be
idealized, sometimes to the point of deception. Apps such
as settleforlove.com have been developed around the desire
for more honesty in online dating, but their market share has
not been spectacular. It seems upfront honesty is not the best
way to gather a public of potential lovers.

Do dating apps also follow the sequence found in Yang and
coauthors' study, moving from social and tribal to direct
connections? That depends. Some apps leave out learning
about someone's social connections, relying instead on
complex algorithms to calculate who might be a good match -
even if scientific evidence does not show that these algorithms
work. Others just speed through the sequence by facilitating
immediate direct connection, and in some cases, quick sex.
Some use the language of sociality like "tribe" and
some connect you to matches through your social networks.

But we humans and our cultural norms still determine a great
deal of how dating apps are used. Just as bias affects
algorithms across the web, bias has been found to tip the
scales on dating sites in favor of white men, to the detriment

                                                                             Relationships | 374
of groups including black women and Asian men. Sites and
apps follow our leads as much as we follow theirs. And apps
only go so far; dating apps today function more like online
shopping than like relationship formation of the past. In the
BBC Horizon film How to Find Love Online, the romance-
focused anthropologist Dr. Helen Fisher says they are better
called "Introduction services," with the act of dating and the
final vetting before it is still conducted in person.

Section 5: Mobile dating apps

Mobile apps are particularly influential in the world of online
dating today. One of the pioneers was Grindr, a gay dating
app. Bae, an up and coming site branded "for black
singles," was recently acquired by a company aiming to make
it global. Her caters to queer women.

        humansrsocialmedia/?p=105#oembed-3

And then there is Tinder, the most popular in the US (although
not the world) at the time of this writing, which has taken the
heterosexual dating world by storm. There are many critiques
of Tinder's effect on heterosexual dating, however, including
studies finding that it favors men's usage norms over women's.
Tinder faces strong competition from numerous competitors
in the US market, however, including a direct challenge - with

375 | Relationships
a grudge - from a Tinder cofounder's site, Bumble, discussed
more below.

Section 6: The paradox of choice

Some scientists and users are critical of online dating apps
because of the wide selection they provide. As Aziz Ansari
points out in this podcast episode, and in this article, for some
people dating once meant choosing from an extremely small
selection of people. He and the podcast host cite studies
finding a "paradox of choice," psychologist Barry Schwartz's
theory that the more selection we have, the less likely we are to
choose something and feel satisfied with our choice - whether
it is a partner or a jar of jam. And today? Thanks to these apps,
users get exposed to a lot more jam.

For users in big cities, it is
possible to swipe almost
infinitely through prospects
for dating and potential sex.
As my friend Mary Franklin
Harvin describes it, it gives
"an air of disposability" to
people. Nancy Jo Sales'

exchanges Tinder facilitates -

                                                     blamed Tinder for a terrible
                                                     modern dating culture that leaves
                                                     young women dissatisfied.

                                                                             Relationships | 376
so little intimacy or rapport for feedback, men do not learn the
skills to be good lovers.
Many in the article linked above, including Sales, have charged
that Tinder encourages a culture of harassment of women.
That may be in part because the culture within the company
has been the site of harassment. Tinder co-founder Whitney
Wolfe left Tinder in 2014 after being sexually harassed there,
received a settlement, and started Bumble.
But online dating sites, like most technologies, depend on
humans to use them and shape their norms. To end with a
ray of hope for those who feel they have to use Tinder, artists
like Audrey Jones, Matt Starr, and Jarrod Allen use Tinder to
make art. If nothing else, they remind us that humans can
choose to use platforms in new ways - even if using them
differently than the crowd can be lonely.

Core Questions

A. Questions for qualitative thought:

    1. Consider the layers of electronic intimacy
        discussed in this chapter, and then consider your
        own generation and subculture. What layers of
        electronic intimacy do people you know often go
        through as they try to get to know another
        person?

   2. How has the evolution of technology influenced
        the perception and experience of intimacy in
        romantic relationships over time, particularly
        considering the transition from erotic
        photographs to contemporary practices like
        sexting and selfies?

   3. Building on the discussion of biases in vetting
        potential partners, could you share personal
        insights or observations on how societal norms,
        including biases related to race or other factors,
        impact the online dating experience and the
        formation of romantic connections?

   4. Reflecting on the content discussing dating apps,
        particularly the idealization of self-presentation
        and the potential influence on traditional dating

                                                                       Relationships | 382
             norms, how do you perceive the balance between
             personal agency and platform-driven
             expectations in the context of online dating?
             Share examples from your own experiences or
             observations.

   B. Review: Which is the best answer?

Why people ghost on social media

Research suggests that many people prefer ghosting
rather than open and honest conversations that might
lead to conflict and stress.

Royette T. Dubar, Wesleyan University
Check your phone. Are there any unanswered texts,
snaps or direct messages that you're ignoring? Should
you reply? Or should you ghost the person who sent
them?

                                                                       Relationships | 386
     Ghosting happens when someone cuts off all online
     communication with someone else, and without an
     explanation. Instead, like a ghost, they just vanish. The
     phenomenon is common on social media and dating
     sites, but with the isolation brought on by the COVID-19
     pandemic - forcing more people together online - it
     happens now more than ever.
     I am a professor of psychology who studies the role of
     technology use in interpersonal relationships and well-
     being. Given the negative psychological consequences
     of thwarted relationships - especially during the
     emerging adulthood years, ages 18 to 29 - I wanted to
     understand what leads college students to ghost
     others, and if ghosting has any impact on mental
     health.
     To address these questions, my research team
     recruited 76 college students through social media and
     on-campus flyers. The sample is 70% female. Study
     participants signed up for one of 20 focus groups,
     ranging in size from two to five students. Group
     sessions lasted an average of 48 minutes each.
     Participants provided responses to questions asking
     them to reflect on their ghosting experiences. Here's
     what we found.
     https://youtube.com/
     watch?v=QW7rPIf2RBQ%3Fwmode%3Dtransparent%2
     6start%3D0
     Millions have been ghosted by romantic partners,
     friends or potential employers.

387 | Relationships
The results

Some students admitted they ghosted because they
lacked the necessary communication skills to have an
open and honest conversation - whether that
conversation happened face to face or via text or email.
From a 19-year-old female: "I'm not good at
communicating with people in person, so I definitely
cannot do it through typing or anything like that."
From a 22-year old: "I do not have the confidence to tell
them that. Or I guess it could be because of social
anxiety."
In some instances, participants opted to ghost if they
thought that meeting with the person would stir up
emotional or sexual feelings they were not ready to
pursue: "People are afraid of something becoming too
much ... the fact that the relationship is somehow
getting to the next level."
Some ghosted because of safety concerns. Forty-five
percent ghosted to remove themselves from a "toxic,"
"unpleasant" or "unhealthy" situation. A 19-year-old
female put it this way: "It's very easy to just chat with
total strangers so [ghosting is] like a form of protection
when a creepy guy is asking you to send nudes and
stuff like that."
One of the least-reported yet perhaps most interesting
reasons for ghosting someone: protecting that person's
feelings. Better to ghost, the thinking goes, than cause

                                                                      Relationships | 388
     the hurt feelings that come with overt rejection. An
     18-year-old female said ghosting was "a little bit politer
     way to reject someone than to directly say, `I do not
     want to chat with you.'"
     That said, recent data suggests that U.S. adults
     generally perceive breaking up through email, text or
     social media as unacceptable, and prefer a person-to-
     person conversation.
     And then there's ghosting after sex.
     In the context of hookup culture, there's an
     understanding that if the ghoster got what they were
     looking for - often, that's sex - then that's it, they no
     longer need to talk to that person. After all, more talk
     could be interpreted as wanting something more
     emotionally intimate.
     According to one 19-year-old female: "I think it's rare for
     there to be open conversation about how you're truly
     feeling [about] what you want out of a situation. ... I
     think hookup culture is really toxic in fostering honest
     communication."
     But the most prevalent reason to ghost: a lack of
     interest in pursuing a relationship with that person.
     Remember the movie "He's Just Not That Into You"? As
     one participant said: "Sometimes the conversation just
     gets boring."

     Breaking up is hard to do.

The consequences

Attending college represents a critical turning point for
establishing and maintaining relationships beyond
one's family and hometown neighborhood. For some
emerging adults, romantic breakups, emotional
loneliness, social exclusion and isolation can have
potentially devastating psychological implications.
Our research supports the idea that ghosting can have
negative consequences for mental health. Short term,
many of those ghosted felt overwhelming rejection
and confusion. They reported feelings of low self-worth
and self-esteem. Part of the problem is the lack of
clarity - not knowing why communication abruptly
stopped. Sometimes, an element of paranoia ensues as
the ghostee tries to make sense of the situation.
Long term, our study found many of those ghosted
reported feelings of mistrust that developed over time.
Some bring this mistrust to future relationships. With
that may come internalizing the rejection, self-blame
and the potential to sabotage those relationships.
However, just over half the participants in our study
said being ghosted offered opportunities for reflection
and resilience.
"It can be partly positive for the ghostee because they
can realize some of the shortcomings they have, and
they may change it," said an 18-year-old female.
As for the ghoster, there were a range of psychological

                                                                      Relationships | 390
     consequences. About half in the focus groups who
     ghosted experienced feelings of remorse or guilt; the
     rest felt no emotion at all. This finding is not entirely
     surprising, given that individuals who initiate breakups
     generally report less distress than the recipients.

     Also emerging from our discussions: The feeling that
     ghosters may become stunted in their personal
     growth. From a 20-year-old male: "It can [become] a
     habit. And it becomes part of your behavior and that's
     how you think you should end a relationship with
     someone. ... I feel like a lot of people are serial ghosters,
     like that's the only way they know how to deal with
     people."

     Reasons for ghosting out of fear of intimacy represent
     an especially intriguing avenue for future research.
     Until that work is done, universities could help by
     providing more opportunities for students to boost
     confidence and sharpen their communication skills.

     This includes more courses that cover these challenges.
     I am reminded of a psychology class I took as an
     undergraduate at Trent University that introduced me
     to the work of social psychologist Daniel Perlman, who
     taught courses about loneliness and intimate
     relationships. Outside the classroom, college residential
     life coordinators could design seminars and workshops
     that teach students practical skills on resolving
     relationship conflicts.

     In the meantime, students can subscribe to a number
     of relationship blogs that offer readers research-based
     answers. Just know that help is out there - even after a
     ghosting, you're not alone.

Section 1: Managing our publics

In the world of mutual influence in which technologies and
humans exist, are our selves changing? It would certainly
appear so in an online search. Identity construction online is
sophisticated and constant; not just a full-time job but an
activity occupying all hours of our lives.

The need to manage our identities is a new phenomenon -
right? Well, mostly. One culture that has been dealing with
context collapse as an essential part of their work and lives
is celebrity culture. And an increasingly popular strategy for
pleasing multiple audiences in various contexts is to post like a
celebrity. Enter the influencers: Those figures, now ubiquitous
in online spaces, whose popularity is leveraged to sway the
opinions, preferences, and purchasing decisions of their
audience.

Influencers can be celebrities, but they can also be regular
people. Microcelebrity, a term introduced by Theresa Senft in
her book on "Camgirls" published in 2008, is a way of
presenting yourself like a celebrity: setting up your profile and
"brand" online, gaining followers, and revealing things about

yourself - valuable. The entire system around microcelebrity
is called "the attention economy" because, with so much
information out there vying for people's attention, anything
people choose to look at is perceived as more valuable,
including ourselves. Microcelebrity leads social media users,
regardless of their level of fame, to apply marketing
perspectives to their own identities.
Microcelebrity is big business. It can make ordinary people
famous, as when Youtubers can become household names
with lucrative marketing contracts. But more often,
microcelebrity helps ordinary users participate in social media
culture while managing their contexts with polish. We
understand increasingly that our social media presences are
like art exhibits of ourselves, and we spend extra time curating
them.

Here are a few of the characteristics of microcelebrity:
Niche Content: Microcelebrities often focus on niche topics
or interests, catering to specific communities. This targeted
approach helps them stand out and attract like-minded
followers.
Authenticity: Unlike traditional celebrities who may maintain
a curated public persona, microcelebrities often emphasize
authenticity and relatability. Followers appreciate the
unfiltered and genuine nature of microcelebrity content.
Engagement: Microcelebrities actively engage with their
followers, fostering a sense of community and connection. This
two-way communication distinguishes microcelebrity from
traditional, one-sided celebrity-fan relationships.
DIY Approach: Microcelebrities frequently employ a do-it-
yourself (DIY) approach to content creation. This self-produced
content often resonates with audiences looking for a more
personal and grassroots connection.

Section 2: Paradoxes in microcelebrity

Media theorist Alice Marwick has written about a paradox in
microcelebrity: As ordinary people are acting more famous,
famous people are acting more ordinary. Kim Kardashian
presents a selfie of herself and Kanye West in a bathroom;
Michelle Obama and Ryan Seacrest mug goofily for a selfie.
Graeme Turner called this leveling of the everyday toward
celebrity culture and vice versa "the demotic turn" in celebrity
culture. "Celebrity culture is increasingly populated by
unexceptional people who have become famous and by stars
who have been made ordinary," according to author Joshua
Gamson.

Social media has accelerated the demotic turn in celebrity.

                                                            Our Transformed Selves | 400
Many people quote Andy Warhol's comment in the past that
each person, no matter how ordinary, would have 15 minutes
of fame. Today, technologically connected societies offer a
lifetime of potential discovery by audiences. High-profile
celebrities perform the masses for the masses. And you all are
superstars, to at least a small public.
Microcelebrity can be understood as a form of online fame that
transcends traditional celebrity boundaries. Unlike mainstream
celebrities who achieve fame through mass media and
entertainment industries, microcelebrities gain recognition
within specific online communities or platforms. These
individuals amass followers, often numbering in the thousands
or tens of thousands, by creating content that resonates with
niche audiences.
Early social media influencers paved the way for
microcelebrities by connecting with audiences through
personal narratives, relatable content, and niche expertise.
Platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube have become
breeding grounds for microcelebrity, allowing individuals to
build personal brands and cultivate communities around
shared interests.

Section 3: Visibility labor

Media scholar Crystal Abidin has conducted numerous studies
of microcelebrities and influencers; one example is in her
article "Visibility Labour: Engaging with Influencers' Fashion
Brands and #OOTD Advertorial Campaigns on Instagram,"
which explores the concept of visibility labor within the context
of influencers' engagement with fashion brands and Outfit of
the Day (#OOTD) advertorial campaigns on Instagram. The
term "visibility labor" refers to the effort influencers invest in
curating and maintaining their online presence to attract and
retain followers. The study examines how influencers
contribute to the promotion of fashion brands and campaigns,
shedding light on the dynamic relationship between
influencers, brands, and the platform. The focus is on the role of
Instagram as a space where influencers perform and negotiate
visibility labor to establish themselves as influential figures in
the realm of fashion.

The labor of microcelebrities and influencers, though often
portrayed as glamorous, comes with hidden challenges. The
constant pressure to create content leads to potential burnout,
and the invasion of privacy blurs the line between public and
private life. Online harassment is a significant issue, impacting
mental health, and dependency on algorithms can result in
unpredictable income. Short-lived fame, the pressure to
monetize, and a culture of comparison contribute to anxiety
and self-doubt. Overall, the negative impacts extend beyond
the surface of the seemingly glamorous influencer lifestyle.

Microcelebrity, at its best, showcases the power of individuals
to create meaningful connections and influence positive
change through authentic content. Many microcelebrities
leverage their influence to raise awareness about social issues
and promote charitable causes. For instance, beauty and

403 | Our Transformed Selves
lifestyle microcelebrities have been known to use their
platforms to advocate for inclusivity and body positivity,
contributing to broader societal conversations. This aligns with
the idea that microcelebrity culture has the potential to be a
force for positive social change, as explored in the work of Senft
and Baym (2015).
Additionally, microcelebrities often serve as relatable role
models, breaking away from the unattainable perfection
associated with traditional celebrities. Abidin's study above
highlights that audiences appreciate the authenticity and
approachability of microcelebrities, finding inspiration in their
stories and experiences. This aspect of microcelebrity culture
fosters a more intimate and genuine connection between
content creators and their followers, emphasizing the
democratization of fame and influence in the digital age.

Section 4: Digital ethnography,
thanks to the students in this book

In my chapters in this book, I have included students'
compositions about their lives through photos, writing, audio,
and video. This work is part of the larger iVoices Media lab
project, which included hundreds of student's media stories
and artifacts about technologies in their lives. I designed

405 | Our Transformed Selves
iVoices to be a digital (or virtual) ethnography, teaching us
about the digital world through stories about people.

So what is digital ethnography more conventionally? It's a
qualitative research method that involves the study of online
communities, cultures, and behaviors through immersive and
participatory observation. It adapts traditional ethnographic
methods to the digital realm, aiming to understand how
people interact, communicate, and form communities in
online spaces. This Digital Ethnography Reading List is an
excellent guide to understanding how culture understood
through online presence.

There are many ways to conduct digital ethnography, but I
often draw on these methods:

Participant Observation:

         Example: An anthropologist might join an online
            gaming community, actively participating in the
            game, observing interactions, and documenting the
            culture, social norms, and communication styles
            within that digital space.

In-Depth Interviews:

         Example: A researcher might conduct virtual
            interviews with members of an online forum
            dedicated to a specific interest, exploring their
            motivations, experiences, and the role of the digital
            community in their lives.

Content Analysis:

         Example: Studying the content shared on a social
            media platform or blog to analyze the language,
            themes, and trends within a particular online

                                                            Our Transformed Selves | 406
            community, providing insights into the community's
            values and interests. iVoices students created digital
            artifacts: memes, hashtags, or user-generated content,
            which we collected and analyzed to understand how
            cultural expressions manifest within a digital
            community and how they contribute to identity
            formation.

Qualitative research methods like digital ethnography are
conducted through the researcher as the "human instrument".
So how do we make sure that instrument is working correctly?
Ethics, or considerations of how to minimize harm right thing,
are a crucial consideration in studying the lives of people.
Researchers consider ethical concerns such as privacy and
consent when studying people. To be ethical in the study of
culture, researchers must be reflexive, reflecting on their own
experiences and biases, and the practice of reflexivity works to
ensure that we as researchers are finding is not misunderstood
through our own biases.

Every iVoices participant gave permission for their work to be
openly licensed, and our team combed through their content
to make sure their privacy was protected beyond whatever
identifying information they chose to present. If you have
found the student work in my chapters of this book valuable
and you are a student, I hope you will take your experiences
with social media seriously as knowledge, and consider how
you can change with world with that knowledge in your
pocket.

If you are an instructor using this book in your course, I hope
you invite your students to teach you what they know.

Core Questions

A. Questions for qualitative thought:

    1. Consider the branding practices on social media
        of yourself or a non-celebrity acquaintance you
        know. Compare these practices to an actual
        brand. Are the practices similar? How does it feel
        to brand oneself - what is emphasized, and what
        is left out?

   2. In the context of microcelebrity, how has the
        phenomenon influenced your own identity
        construction on social media platforms, and to
        what extent do you find yourself applying
        marketing perspectives to curate your online
        brand?

   3. Reflecting on the "the demotic turn" in celebrity
        culture, how do you perceive the blurring of lines
        between the everyday and celebrity culture on
        social media platforms? Can you share personal
        examples or observations where ordinary
        individuals have achieved microcelebrity status,
        and do you believe this has impacted the way
        society views fame?

   4. How have you observed individuals tailoring their

                                                        Our Transformed Selves | 412
             online profiles to conform to or stand out within
             specific cultural contexts? In your own experience
             or observations, does social media play a
             significant role in shaping the identity and
             perception of individuals associated with Greek
             Life or other college communities?

     Social media and misrepresentation can go hand in
     hand - and that's especially the case in the loosely
     regulated fitness and nutrition industry.

415 | Our Transformed Selves
We both have experience with personal training, but
from different perspectives.
To improve his fitness regimen, Tim has sought out
experienced trainers, while Ashley ran an online fitness
and nutrition company before getting her doctorate.
She went through all the hoops to obtain credentials -
training as a bodybuilder, obtaining certifications from
the National Strength and Conditioning Association
and studying nutrition through the National Academy
of Sports Medicine. She also used Instagram to grow
her business.
And yet both of us realized that individuals with no
credentials or expertise were building their own brands
on social media - sometimes making more money
than those who were credentialed.
It made us wonder: How is this possible?
To explore this, we followed 488 fitness and nutrition
influencers on Instagram for six months, analyzing over
50,000 posts, 8 million follower comments and 620,000
influencer replies to figure out how they used words
and images to attract and interact with followers.
In our recent article for the Academy of Management
Journal, we explain how just establishing a social media
presence doesn't mean a would-be influencer can
easily reach clients, as the social media platform's
algorithm determines who sees what posts, and when.
And even if influencers do attract large followings,
social media users shouldn't necessarily buy what the
influencers are selling.

                                                       Our Transformed Selves | 416
   The rise of the influencer

     Social media use has more than tripled in the past
     decade, and many young people now aspire to become
     successful influencers. A Morning Consult poll from
     2019 found that 54% of Americans ages 13 to 38 said
     they would become an influencer if given the chance.
     But what exactly does it mean to be an influencer?
     Influencers are people who use social media to sell
     products or services - either their own or those of
     another company or brand. Successful influencers gain
     better placement in their followers' social media feeds,
     obtain brand endorsements, facilitate networking
     opportunities and cultivate other revenue streams.
     They do this by getting social media users to engage
     with their accounts - to follow their profiles, like their
     posts and write comments.
     Although the algorithms social media platforms use to
     decide what users see are shrouded in mystery, it's
     generally understood that algorithms will boost
     accounts that have a lot of followers and regularly
     interact with these followers.

   Gaming the algorithm

     Successful influencers will leverage these different
     degrees of user engagement to build and grow their

417 | Our Transformed Selves
businesses. But they need to be strategic about which
images and words they use, since each can influence
different parts of the algorithm.

Images generally attract someone's attention before
text, and they're also processed more quickly than text.
So influencers must choose their images wisely.

We found that images that reinforce the influencers'
competence - in the case of fitness influencers, photos
and videos highlighting their physiques and ability to
perform exercises, or "before and after" photos of
themselves and their clients - had the largest effect on
their number of followers.

Our data showed that for every image post signaling
their competence, fitness influencers boosted their
followers by almost 3%. That's significant when you
consider that each additional follower can result in
more revenue from sponsors and sales. According to
the music licensing site Lickd, Instagram users with
5,000 followers can earn about US$350 per sponsored
post, and influencers with 100,000 followers can earn
double that.

The trick, of course, is attracting sponsors.

But amassing lots of followers isn't the only path to
ensuring success on social media. Influencers also need
their followers to interact with their posts. This is
typically much more time-intensive for users than
clicking "follow" and mindlessly scrolling. But this sort
of engagement can easily sway the algorithm.

Most social media users want to feel they're building a
community, not just spewing their thoughts into a
digital void. So successful influencers can cultivate

                                                       Our Transformed Selves | 418
     connection by regularly replying to their followers'
     comments.
     This can be something as simple as "Hey
     @instagram_girl292, I love that you tried our new
     product. We are so excited to hear what you think
     about the next one!"
     We found that influencers who project warmth and
     reply to comments garner 21% more positive replies
     from current and new followers.

     Whether you're selling workout plans or beauty
     products, it's important to regularly interact with your
     followers.

   Buyer beware

     It's important to remember that influencers can project
     competence without actually having it - and that

419 | Our Transformed Selves
regular engagement with followers says little about the
quality of the product they're selling.

In the sample we used for our study, fewer than 20% of
the influencers reported having any credentials.

The fitness industry is especially prone to manipulation.
While brick-and-mortar gyms traditionally require their
personal trainers to have advanced credentials, such as
certifications in fitness or nutrition, there is no industry
governing body ensuring that people who call
themselves trainers have the necessary background
and experience. Therefore, anyone can become a
trainer and sell their products and services online and
through social media.

In fact, many fitness influencers doctor their images,
giving themselves unrealistic and unattainable bodies.

Worse, they may not ever follow through on their
promises.

For example, social media influencer Brittany Dawn
was sued by thousands of her followers in February
2022 after they claimed she sold them fitness and meal
plans she never delivered. Pitching herself as someone
who could help people rebuild their relationship with
food, Dawn had attracted followers and customers who
had struggled with eating disorders. Responding to the
criticism, Dawn, whose trial is set to begin on March 6,
2023, said, "I jumped into an industry that had no
instruction manual."

Providing custom meal plans is outside most personal
trainers' scope of expertise, unless they also happen to
be nutritionists. But given the lack of industry
oversight, few customers knew this. Instead, Dawn, like

                                                       Our Transformed Selves | 420
     many other social media influencers, lured followers by
     posting attention-grabbing photos and interacting
     with customers in ways that made them feel like they
     had a personal relationship with her.
     That means that it's up to everyone to do their
     homework on what they're buying - and not be
     blinded by shapely legs, an alluring smile and six-pack
     abs.

Section 1: Art with AI, and bias

                                                                                            Art | 424

Objective:
       Make Jacquie a new profile picture.

Artist and Technologist Jacquie Kuru has created cover images
for Humans R Social Media since 2022. For this edition, she
created the cover image using tools based on Artificial
Intelligence or AI, the development of computing systems to
perform intelligent tasks. Creating art with AI is a process based
on trial and error, machine learning and human intelligence. In
technical terms, she fed a combination of text and images to
an AI using a deep learning model called Stable Diffusion. In
human terms, she negotiated with a set of digital tools trained
in old biases to create something meaningful. To help you
understand how Jacquie generated the cover, we'll walk you
through a project Jacquie undertook that started with her own
profile picture.

1. The      Jacquie began with a photo of
photo       herself (Image 1), and created a
            graphic profile picture using her
            own graphic design skills (Image
            2), a simple image with no eyes.
            Then she decided to see what
            would happen when she asked AI
            to recreate her from just that
            eyeless graphic image.Image 3 is
            the AI's first output. The figure
            looks alert, machine-generated,

AI more information including her

ethnicity (Turkish-Asian), it

returned the more detailed image

(Image 4), which was closer to

what  she        wanted.What                       2. The

                                      artists like
button it starts moving. It opens a   Jacquie have

you can to prompt the server with                          Art | 426

text or images to create whatever

you want. It works with Natural

Language Processing or NLP, the

science of how computers can

understand what is asked of them

through language.For text, you can

assign heavier or lighter weight to

words, like an emphasis. If you

double the weight on angry, it will

make the face look more like a look

of rage; or decrease it and it looks

like an annoyance. For images, you

can tell the server to focus on

different aspects, such as depth of

field, or how close or far the

subject is from the camera. Or you

can add different weights and
want can be a  significance to various aspects of
slow and       the image. So after Jacquie writes
problematic    a prompt, she can tinker with it
exchange.      and teach the AI what it doesn't
               know--teach it out of its
               assumptions.

       Creation Prompt:

             an Asian-Turkish girl with brown flowy
             hair wearing a surgical mask, RAW
             candid cinema, woman, studio, 16mm,
             ((color graded portra 400 film))
             ((remarkable color)), (ultra realistic),
             textured skin, remarkable detailed
             pupils, ((realistic dull skin noise)),
             ((visible skin detail)), ((skin fuzz)), (dry
             skin) shot with cinematic camera

In next section, in principle of NLP, not means negative weight.
So not smiling would be a negative of smiling. To get a sad face
she could write happy face with a high weight for very happy,
or sad with a negative. So the negative prompt is all the things
you want the output not to be.

       Negative prompt:

             B&W, logo, Watermark, bad artist, blur,

             (76.94%)

That last step with the slider gave Jacquie what she wanted.
How? She first learned how that deep learning model "thinks",
including its biases. Then she did the work to correct them.
Will the AI learn from this exchange? Maybe, a little--but a lot
of people will have to push back against those initial outputs
for the model to learn in any meaningful way.

Section 2: Expanding what it means
to make art

By Jacquie Kuru

Art is a fluid concept, constantly shaped and redefined by new
ideas, tools, and avenues for creative expression. Thanks to the
internet, these elements have converged to create a unique
platform where art flourishes in unexpected ways. From the
ability to adopt different identities with VTubing to the
collaborative canvas of r/place, the ephemeral journey of Unus
Annus, and the thriving world of fanart and fan fiction, the
internet has become a transformative space for artistic
exploration.

VTubing has opened doors to a new realm of self-expression. In
this digital landscape, individuals have the freedom to embody
different character models, transcending their physical selves
and embracing the limitless possibilities of virtual identities.
People can fluidly change appearances while maintaining a
consistent online persona, allowing for dynamic and diverse
forms of creative expression.

Meanwhile, in the expansive canvas of r/place, millions of
participants around the world came together to collaboratively
create a shared artwork. This social experiment showcased the
power of collective creativity and community collaboration, as
individuals strategically placed pixels to form a sprawling
collage of images and patterns. It demonstrated how the
internet can foster a sense of unity and inspire collaborative
endeavors that transcend geographical boundaries.

Unus Annus emerged as a time-limited project that
challenged the notion of permanence in digital content.
Within the span of a year, the creators explored the fleeting

431 | Art
nature of existence and the impermanence of art itself. The
project prompted contemplation on the passage of time and
the preciousness of each moment, leaving a lasting impact on
those who engaged with its content.
Finally, fanart and fan fiction have become integral
components of online art communities. Fans form parasocial
relationships with artists, content creators, and fictional
characters, fostering a deep sense of connection and
admiration. Through these emotional bonds, fans are inspired
to create their own artistic interpretations, paying homage to
the source material while adding their unique perspectives.
Fanart and fan fiction celebrate and expand upon beloved
narratives, preserving fandoms and fostering communities
united by shared passion.
In this chapter, we will explore the dynamic interplay between
art and the internet, delving into the transformative nature
of VTubing, the collaborative spirit of projects like r/place, the
ephemeral journey of Unus Annus, and the profound influence
of fanart and fan fiction. Through these sections, we will
witness how the internet has revolutionized the artistic
landscape, providing new means of self-expression,
community collaboration, and the preservation of creative
endeavors.

Jacquie's Online Persona/Vtuber
Character: Amber. (Used with
artist's permission.)

VTubers have opened up a

new realm of self-expression

online by allowing individuals

to embody different models

of the same character. This

ability to adopt diverse

appearances provides a level

of flexibility and creativity

that       was  previously

unattainable in traditional

forms of self-presentation.

One of the key advantages of

VTubing is the freedom to

explore    various identities Jacquie's Actual Appearance in
while
           maintaining       a the Tangible World

consistent persona. VTubers

can seamlessly switch between different character models,

each representing a distinct visual style or concept. For

instance, an individual may choose to depict themselves as an

anime-inspired character one day and transform into a fantasy

creature or even an anthropomorphic object the next. The

435 | Art
versatility of VTubing allows for a dynamic expression of one's
personality and interests, offering a more fluid and adaptable
form of self-representation.

This fluidity is not limited to predefined character designs.
VTubers can also commission artists to create unique and
personalized renditions of their characters, ensuring that their
online identity evolves and remains fresh over time. This
collaborative approach to character design fosters a vibrant
ecosystem of artistic expression, where creators collaborate
with talented artists to bring their envisioned appearances to
life. The result is a rich tapestry of visual interpretations that
showcase the diversity and creativity of the VTubing
community.

Famous VTubers like IronMouse actively engage with artists
to commission new and distinctive character designs. By
collaborating with different artists, she can explore various
artistic styles and reimagine her character in exciting and
unique ways. This process not only keeps her online presence
visually stimulating but also allows her to tap into the immense
talent and creativity within the artist community.

Furthermore, some VTubers take the creative process into their
own hands, developing and refining their own character
designs. This level of autonomy empowers creators to fully
express their artistic vision and create an identity that aligns
with their personal preferences and aspirations. By crafting
their own character models, VTubers can showcase their
artistic skills, explore different art styles, and establish a
stronger connection between their online persona and their
creative abilities.

However, it's important to note that while VTubing offers a
unique platform for self-expression and creativity, it is not
without its challenges. The line between the VTuber's
authentic self and the character they portray can sometimes

                                                                                            Art | 436
become blurred, leading to questions about authenticity and
the potential for misrepresentation. It is crucial for VTubers to
maintain transparency and ensure that their online identities
are a reflection of their genuine selves, even if presented
through the lens of a character avatar.

VTubers have revolutionized online self-expression by offering
a dynamic and fluid way for individuals to embody different
models of the same character. This ability to adopt diverse
appearances enables a range of creative possibilities, allowing
VTubers to express themselves authentically while exploring
unique visual styles and collaborations with talented artists.
VTubing serves as a testament to the ever-evolving nature of
online art and the exciting opportunities it brings for
individuals to express themselves in a truly flexible and creative
manner.

Section 4: r/place: Art Through
Community Collaboration

Interactive Break down of 2022 canvas: https://place-
atlas.stefanocoding.me

The relationship between art and the internet has evolved
significantly in recent years, with social platforms providing
new avenues for creative expression and community
engagement. One notable example being r/place, a Reddit
social experiment that harnessed the collective creativity and
collaboration of its users. Launched on April 1, 2017, this
subreddit brought together millions of participants from
around the world to collectively create a shared digital canvas.
The canvas consisted of a 1000×1000 grid of pixels, and each
user could place a single colored pixel on the canvas every

437 | Art
five minutes. The simplicity of this interaction allowed users
to contribute to the artwork easily, resulting in a sprawling
collage of various images and patterns. The canvas became a
vibrant display of diverse artistic creations, ranging from pixel
art representations of famous characters and logos to national
flags and abstract designs. Reddit users worked together,
coordinating efforts through subreddit communities, Discord
servers, and other communication channels to bring their
visions to life. This event was so successful it was brought back
at a larger scale in 2022 with a 2000×2000 pixel grid and double
the color choices (32 colors).

One fascinating aspect of r/place was the formation of alliances
and the emergence of territorial battles on the canvas. As users
invested time and effort into creating and maintaining their
artwork, they sought to protect their creations from unwanted
modifications or destruction. Alliances formed to establish
designated areas and protect specific patterns or images.
These collaborations ranged from informal agreements
between individuals to elaborate coalitions between
subreddits and online communities. Users defended their
territory by placing pixels strategically, coordinating efforts to
outmaneuver competing factions, and sometimes engaging
in negotiations or diplomacy to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
The formation of alliances not only showcased the competitive
nature of human interactions but also highlighted the social
dynamics that can arise in online spaces. Users forged
connections, built trust, and developed intricate systems of
governance to maintain order and protect their shared artistic
endeavors.

After the 2017 event ended, academic researchers studied the
evolution of the canvas. It was found that quantitative methods
in visual artifact analysis can identify boundaries in the artwork
and generally predict users' "collaboration" (Rappaz et al., 2018).
However, the reason collaboration is in quotes is because these

                                                                                            Art | 438
quantitive methods could not discern between imagery
created by collaboration verse conflict. Thus, Litherland &
Mørch(2021) used qualitative and quantitive methods in their
attempt to understand the evolution of the r/place canvas -
focusing specifically on the development of the Mona Lisa
painting. They studied two types of artifacts: visual and social
which are defined as followed:

  · Visual Artifact: physical objects found in a particular
      culture or context that have been created or shaped by
      humans, refers to images created during this event.

  · Social Artifact: products of social beings and their social
      relationships, refers to the social interactions and
      relationships formed during the event.

According to their findings, the examination of social
interaction within online communities can be seen as a
dialectic process, influenced by artifacts that change at various
levels of abstraction and time scales. The different levels serve
two important purposes: preserving history by capturing the
lower level's history in a more lasting manner, and managing
complexity by controlling the lower level's growth rate. The
connection between two levels of the same artifact is
established through object transformation, where an object
from a lower level may reappear on a higher level in a modified
form. This concept of reconstruction, borrowed from the
analysis of symbolic communication in face-to-face
interactions (Mead, 1932, 1934), draws inspiration from
biological processes (Litherland & Mørch, 2021). The free,

As the canvas grew in popularity, users began to employ
automated scripts, commonly known as "bots," to assist with
the placement of pixels. These bots automated the process
of monitoring the canvas, identifying available spaces, and

strategically placing pixels according to predefined patterns or
instructions. Bots played a crucial role in optimizing efficiency
and precision, as they could rapidly respond to changes on
the canvas and work around the clock. By leveraging bot
assistance, participants could achieve complex designs that
would have been impractical or time-consuming to create
manually. However, the use of bots also sparked debates about
the balance between human creativity and automated
intervention in the artistic process. Additionally, bots were
controversial because a network of them could destroy entire
communities' works within seconds.

Section 5: Unus Annus: Challenging
the Permanence of Internet Content

The digital age has brought forth the notion that everything
on the internet lasts forever. However, in a world where content
is often preserved indefinitely, Unus Annus, a YouTube channel
created by Markiplier (Mark Fischbach) and CrankGameplays
(Ethan Nestor), emerged as a bold experiment to defy this
notion. With its one-year lifespan, Unus Annus aimed to explore
the fleeting nature of existence and the impermanence of
digital content.

Unus Annus, Latin for "One Year," was a collaborative YouTube
project launched on November 15, 2019, and concluded exactly
one year later. The channel's purpose was to create and curate
content that celebrated the passage of time, with the
understanding that once the year elapsed, the entire channel
would be permanently deleted. This experiment captivated
audiences worldwide, accumulating millions of subscribers
and fostering an active and dedicated fan base. The channel's
unique premise intrigued viewers, who eagerly followed the
creators' journey as they explored a wide range of topics, from
bizarre experiments and challenges to thought-provoking
discussions on mortality and the fleeting nature of life, albeit
mostly done in a humorous manner.

The limited time frame added an element of urgency and
exclusivity, intensifying the desire to experience and cherish
the content while it lasted. Fans actively engaged with the
channel, participating in live streams, submitting fan art, and
sharing their interpretations of the channel's messages. Unus
Annus became more than just a YouTube channel; it became a
shared experience and a community united by the impending
end.

When the one-year mark arrived, Markiplier and
CrankGameplays remained true to their initial intent. Without
hesitation, they followed through on their promise and
permanently deleted the entire Unus Annus channel, erasing

441 | Art
all its videos, comments, and interactions. The act of deletion
symbolized the acceptance of the ephemeral nature of digital
content, emphasizing that even creations with substantial
impact can be fleeting and transient. However, while the
majority of fans respected the deletion, there are a few who
downloaded and reloaded the videos from the channel in their
entirety. Even those who did respect the deletion also in many
ways kept the channel alive after its deletion with fanart and
parody videos. These actions, the deletion, and even the sale
of merchandise raises questions about the value and legacy of
digital content.

Section 6: FanArt, FanFic, and
Fandoms: Respecting and
Disrespecting The Source Material

Online, fanart and fan fiction have emerged as powerful
expressions of creativity. They not only contribute to the rich
tapestry of art but also play a significant role in the
preservation of fandoms (online communities surrounding a
creative project or something similar) and other art projects.
However, it is important to acknowledge that while fandoms
can be vibrant and supportive, they can also be negative
through blatant disrespect of the source material, such as the
imagining or compelling non-canonical relationships,
intentionally misinterpreting key messages, and fostering
toxicity towards the original creators.

What is Fan Art? Fan Art (fanart) refers to artistic creations
produced by fans, often inspired by existing works of literature,
films, television shows, video games, or other forms of media.
The internet has become a vast gallery for fanart, enabling
artists to showcase their talent and pay tribute to the source
material that inspires them. Fanart allows fans to reinterpret
characters, settings, and narratives, offering fresh perspectives
and expanding the visual representation of beloved stories.
Through fanart, online communities thrive by sharing,
appreciating, and engaging with artists' creations. Fanart
provides a sense of connection and camaraderie, fostering
conversations and collaborations among fans. It amplifies the
impact of the original work, extending its reach and leaving a
lasting impression on both creators and audiences.

Fan Fiction or fanfic, on the other hand, involves writing stories
that feature characters or settings from existing works of
fiction. It allows fans to explore alternative narratives, expand
upon existing storylines, or delve into unexplored aspects of
the source material. Fan fiction serves as a platform for fans to
engage in imaginative storytelling, experiment with different
genres, and explore character dynamics beyond what is

443 | Art
presented in the original work. Similar to fanart, fan fiction
thrives within online communities, fostering collaboration,
feedback, and discussions among readers and writers. It
provides an outlet for creative expression, allowing fans to
contribute their unique voices and interpretations to the larger
tapestry of the fandom. Fan fiction helps preserve and expand
upon the world of the source material, keeping fandoms alive
long after the original content has ended. Additionally, many
creative writers establish their own audiences through fan
fiction before writing and promoting their own original
concepts.

A list of well-known authors who started as fanfic writers:

https://lplks.org/blogs/post/21-published-authors-who-write-
fanfiction/

While both fanart and fan fictions can help preserve and
expand online fandoms, they can pervert the source material
in the process causing more harm than good. On one hand,
fandoms create a sense of belonging and support, providing
spaces for fans to engage in meaningful discussions, celebrate
their favorite works, and showcase their creative talents.
Fandoms often organize events, conventions, and online
initiatives that further contribute to the growth and
appreciation of the art they cherish. The other hand, fandoms
can exhibit behaviors that disrespect the source material and
its creators. The imagining or compelling of non-canonical
relationships, commonly referred to as "shipping," can
sometimes overshadow the original intent and narrative of the
work. This can lead to toxicity within fandoms, as fans argue
passionately in favor of their preferred pairings and engage in
heated debates, sometimes directing negativity towards the
creators themselves. Additionally, some of these characters
being shipped can be real people who are either actors in the
project or online personalities such as Youtubers and Twitch

                                                                                            Art | 444
streamers. Fans of these real world based-fandoms, can harass
these creators or original participants of the source material
with unsolicited sexualized fanart and fanfiction.
It is crucial for fandoms to strike a balance between expressing
their creativity and respecting the original creators' vision.
While fanart and fan fiction provide avenues for
reinterpretation and exploration, it is important to maintain
an understanding of the source material's boundaries and to
engage in respectful dialogue with both fellow fans and the
creators themselves. Constructive engagement ensures that
fandoms continue to contribute positively to the art and foster
an inclusive and supportive environment.

Section 7: It is All About Relationships

In writing this section, I (Jacquie Kuru) realized there was an
underlining theme to all of these new expressions of art -
relationships. Whether it is an ever changing relationship with
the self, as expressed through vtubing, or the collaborative and
combative dynamics of r/place, the relationships formed in
these realms shape and define the art created within them.
Even in the fleeting existence of Unus Annus and the parasocial
connections nurtured by fanart and fan fiction, relationships
underpin the very essence of these online art projects.

VTubing offers a unique relationship with the self, allowing
individuals to explore and express different facets of their
identity through diverse character models. The fluidity of
appearance fosters a dynamic connection with creativity,
empowering artists to embrace new forms of expression and
engage with their audiences in innovative ways.

In the collaborative canvas of r/place, relationships emerged
as users joined forces, formed alliances, and protected their
creations, showcasing the power of collective effort and the
strength of communal bonds. Simultaneously, the combative
nature of territorial battles demonstrated the complexities of
human interactions, highlighting both the collaborative spirit
and the occasional conflicts that arise within online
communities.

Unus Annus challenged our relationship with the concept of
time and permanence, urging viewers to contemplate the
impermanence of existence itself. The ephemeral nature of the
project emphasized the fleeting nature of art, leaving a lasting
impact on those who participated and observed. Through the
collective experience of Unus Annus, relationships with the
idea of impermanence and the preciousness of time were

447 | Art
fostered, urging reflection on the transitory nature of our own
lives and the art we create.
Within the realm of fanart and fan fiction, parasocial
relationships emerged as fans formed deep connections with
artists, content creators, and fictional characters. These one-
sided emotional bonds inspired fans to express their love and
appreciation through creative mediums, shaping a vibrant
community of artists and enthusiasts. The interconnectedness
of these relationships nurtured a cycle of inspiration and
artistic production, fueling the growth and evolution of
fandoms and online art communities.
In conclusion, relationships lie at the heart of online art.
Whether they manifest as relationships with the self,
collaboration and conflict among communities, connections
with profound ideas, or parasocial bonds, these relationships
shape and drive the creative expressions that flourish within
digital spaces. They inspire artists, foster collaboration, and
provide a sense of belonging and identity within online
communities. Through these relationships, the dynamic and
ever-evolving landscape of online art continues to thrive,
weaving together a tapestry that celebrates the diverse range
of human experiences and creative expressions.

   Read It: How r/place - a massive and
   chaotic collaborative art project on
   Reddit - showcased the best and
   worst of online spaces

Andrew Childs, Griffith University
Many would be familiar with Reddit as one of the
largest social networking sites, with a large group of
forums ("subreddits") catering to almost any interest.
Since the beginning of April, Reddit has played host to
a massive collaborative art project called r/place that
simultaneously shows us some of the best and worst
attributes of cybercultures.
Originally launched in 2017, r/place ran for 72 hours. The
lifespan of the new r/place was also short - ultimately
lasting for just five days. Beginning initially as a blank
canvas, r/place allows users to place one coloured pixel
every five minutes (or 20 minutes for unverified
accounts) as they attempt to build a collective art
piece.
Traversing through r/place takes you for a journey
through time, memes and cultures.
At any one moment you might be looking at a Nine
Inch Nails logo, the flags of various countries, a QR code
linking you to a YouTube video titled The Most Logical
Arguments AGAINST Veganism (In 10 Minutes), and a
homage to Zyzz - a popular bodybuilding figure who
passed away in 2011.
Some artworks on r/place don't seem to represent
anything at all. The sole mission of The Blue Corner is
(you guessed it) to have a blue corner depicted on the
final art piece.
The artwork constantly changes over its short lifetime.
But even if the drawings of some communities may
not go the distance, the time lapse videos depicting

                                                                                      Art | 456
     the ongoing mutation of the canvas has become a key
     part of this art piece, ensuring all contributions play a
     vital part in the lifecycle of r/place.

   Collaboration - and opposition

     r/place shows us the collaborative nature of humans in
     online spaces. After its emergence in 2017 it was hailed
     as "the internet's best experiment yet" and praised for
     capturing "the internet, in all its wonderful glory".
     This collaborative online art project allows people to
     express their individuality as well as collective identities
     formed through interactions with online spaces.
     This year's iteration of r/place, in contrast to the
     previous version, demonstrates the interconnectivity of
     communities in digital spaces. No longer is r/place
     solely reserved for Reddit users. Now, there is clear
     power in drawing on communities distributed across
     Twitch, Discord and Twitter.
     This influx of communities from all over the internet
     has not been well-received by all.
     There is a belief Twitch streamers are ruining the work
     of smaller communities and are attempting to
     sabotage the project.
     Instead of being a democratic representation of online
     communities and their art, the argument goes, Twitch

457 | Art
streamers are encouraging their fans, numbered in the
hundreds of thousands, to capture hotly contested
territory.

Twitch's xQc has up to 200,000 viewers on his streams
where he is encouraging a take-over of r/place.

Factions - such as those formed between Spanish
streamers and BTS fans - have become the primary
way to ensure power and influence over the art project.
Smaller communities are driven out at the expense of
larger influencers with more bargaining power in this
pixel warfare.
It is not just individuals taking part in this art project.
Many believe "bots" are running rampant, performing
automated tasks in a way that is antithetical to the idea
of this artwork as a representation of human
achievement as opposed to technical prowess.
These examples are just a fraction of the chaos over the
internet in the last few days: 4chan operated
coordinated attacks on the Trans flag and LGBTQ+
panels, and streamers are receiving an influx of death
threats.

   The best and worst of us

     At its best, r/place is a powerful illustration of strangers
     coming together about their passions online and the
     collaborative nature of the internet.
     At its worst, it represents everything we have come to
     dislike about the internet: the exclusion of smaller
     voices at the expense of influencer cultures, factions
     between communities, and the toxicity of some
     cybercultures.

     The end of r/place.

       Key points

            · Wellness is defined as a dynamic state of
                physical, mental, and social well-being, with a
                focus on low distress levels, overall good
                health, and a positive outlook.

            · Social media's influence on physical health
                ranges from positive aspects like nutrition
                advice to negative effects such as body image
                concerns, with platforms like Instagram linked
                to issues like anxiety and depression.

            · Social media's role in mental health is
                complex; it can be a tool for wellness, but also
                a source of damage, impacting emotional
                regulation, anxiety, and depression.

            · The importance of social health is highlighted,
                especially during the pandemic, where
                technology serves as a lifeline for connection,
                despite potential links between social media
                and social anxiety.

            · Online platforms play a crucial role in
                connecting individuals dealing with illness,
                emphasizing communication technology's
                affordances, such as control, anonymity,
                visibility, and availability.

            · Practical tips for maintaining a healthy

463 | Wellness
        relationship with social media are outlined,
        addressing the intentional design choices, self-
        reflection on the relationship, and active
        participation in curating online content.

Student insights: Toxic Social Media (by Perla, Spring
2021)"The Internet can crack us open to seeing so many
things that we would have never encountered
otherwise. And that's one of the most beautiful,

                                                                           Wellness | 464
       miraculous things about it. But it can also divide our
       attention and make us feel fractured."

       Chris Stedman, author of IRL: Finding Realness,
       Meaning, and Belonging in our Digital Lives.

Is social media good for us? Is it bad for us? Can it be both?
Research findings suggest many complex ways the use of
social media platforms can impact our mental and physical
health and well-being. In this chapter, we discuss a few relevant
findings on social media--along with the voices of students
who are consistently negotiating these issues in their lives.

Section 1: Dimensions of Wellness
and Well-being

According to the American Psychological Association (APA),
wellness is defined as, "a dynamic state of physical, mental,
and social well-being." However, the term "wellness" has
become so popular as a marketing buzzword that it has
countless meanings to different publics. For clarity, in this
chapter we have chosen to use the term well-being, defined
by the APA as, "a state of happiness and contentment, with low
levels of distress, overall good physical and mental health and
outlook, or good quality of life." In this section, we introduce
the next part of the chapter as a dive into each of these three
dimensions--with the understanding that these dimensions
overlap and interact with one another regularly.

Physical health, and body image

One wellness dimension is physical health. Social media may

465 | Wellness
be associated with physically health improvements due to
nutrition advice or "fitspiration", and to problems with physical
health caused by learning of unhealthy behaviors. One striking
link between social media and mental health lies along the
line of body image and satisfaction. For our social media
aficionados, think about how many images of people we see
each day. What do these folks look like? Do they have
"Instagram Face"? Conventionally attractive? White? Thin?
Able-bodied? Consider critically the seemingly perfect lives
and bodies you see, comparing yourself to the images of these
people, especially women, that may be surgically enhanced
and/or heavily filtered.

Facebook, the parent company of Instagram, has conducted
informal investigations of the app (Instagram) to see how it
affected the relationship one has with their body.
Approximately 32 percent of young women report feeling
worse about their bodies after using Instagram. Moreover, the
young women attribute Instagram for increases in the rate
of anxiety and depression," tying in the cyclical nature of
depression and/or anxiety in relation to social media as shown
by Hoge, Bickham, & Cantor (2017). Some of the adverse effects
are thought to be Instagram specific such as social
comparison, which is when people assess their own value in
relation to the attractiveness, wealth and success of others.

The Facebook researchers state that social comparison is worse
on Instagram than other platforms, asserting that TikTok is
grounded in performance, Snapchat is "sheltered" by jokey
filters that "keep the focus on the face." Meanwhile, Instagram
focuses heavily on the body and lifestyle. However, the research
team concluded this in 2020. Their findings may not hold up to
the current social media landscape, with the prevalence of Tik-
Tok and the affordance of video filters to edit people's bodies.
For Instagram specifically, the researchers note that essential
aspects of the platform such as norms around sharing only the

                                                                                   Wellness | 466
best moments and the pressure to look perfect combined with
an "addictive product" can send young folks "spiraling toward
eating disorders, an unhealthy sense of their own bodies and
depression." The internal researchers further state that the
Explore page, curated by an algorithm can show harmful
content.

In "The Paradox of Tik Tok Anti-Pro-Anorexia Videos" by scholars
Logrieco, Marchili, Roversi, and Villani (2021) , the shifting
stances around anorexia depiction content on TikTok is
paradoxically encouraging harmful behaviors. The, "What I Eat
in a Day," format is a common form of this. Moreover, the
numerous "Glo-Up" challenges on the platform reinforce
beauty standards (and generally come with weight-loss), while
staying away from fostering unconditional self acceptance.
Like Instagram, there are beautification filters which slim and
anglify the appearance of the face. What messages could
people, especially people who do not fit racist, thin, or ableist
societal standards of beauty internalize?

Meanwhile, many youth consider TikTok a respite from more
overtly image-conscious apps like Instagram. Although Tik-Tok
was released in 2016, the height of its popularity came about
in 2020. Thus research has yet to catch up to the trends we are
seeing on this platform. However, that does not mean that we
should not think critically about how this platform is used, what
is happening on this app, and the media we consume from it,
and all platforms we use, when considering their impacts on
physical health.

Section 2: Mental health

Another wellness dimension we are exploring related to social
media is the second dimension, mental health, including

467 | Wellness
anxiety and depression, as well as emotional regulation. In the
digital age, social media can play a powerful role in our stress,
happiness, and mental health. Social media has the capability
of being a powerful tool in our wellness. For instance, many
"mindfulness" podcasts have social media accounts where
they share health experts' tips on mindful living.) However,
social media also has the potential to damage mental health
and wellbeing as well--and as whistleblowers revealed in 2021,
social media platforms may be aware of these impacts, yet do
little to stop them.

          Respond to this case study: This student
          compares social media to drugs and asserts that
          people are often unaware of what they are
          getting into when they download it. Imagine
          you have the opportunity to help decide if
          warnings should come with social media
          downloads. Write a paragraph either (1)

469 | Wellness
          explaining whether you would support such
          warnings appearing, how they would function,
          and what they would say; or (2) why there
          should not be warnings, based on evidence.
          Then, write another paragraph in which you
          imagine you were introducing someone you
          care about to social media use for the first time.
          What would you tell them is a healthy practice?
          Include the practice, and evidence of how you
          know it is healthy.

Emotional regulation is a vital part of mental health.
Specifically, it is a skill developed in childhood and adolescence
by experiencing strong emotions and developing internal
regulatory processes. Having this skill is a tool. The lack of and
problems with emotional regulation are associated with
mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety,
conditions that individuals who "overuse" the internet report
using the internet to avoid. Moreover, research has shown that
depression symptoms predict internet usage to regulate
mood. Thus our internet and social media use can be seen
as a feedback loop, using the internet to avoid emotions, not
emotionally regulating, experiencing emotional distress, then
back to using the internet to avoid emotions once more.

Social media can be a mixed bag when it comes to our mental
health and well-being. Hoge, Bickham, and Cantor (2017) state
that , "although there is evidence that greater electronic media

                                                                                   Wellness | 470
use is associated with depressive symptoms, there is also
evidence that the social nature of digital communication may
be harnessed in some situations to improve mood and to
promote health-enhancing strategies." They further state that
much more research is needed to explore these possibilities. In
what ways can social media help us connect with others and
positively contribute to our mental well-being?

Section 3: Social Health

Another important wellness dimension and another is social
health. Access to technology was a lifeline for many at the
start of the pandemic. We limited our in person social contact
as many businesses, schools, restaurants, and workplaces shut
down or reduced capacity for the initial quarantines. According
to Pew Research Center (2021), the internet has been personally
important to 90% of adults with 58% saying the internet has
been essential. Since the beginning of the pandemic we have
relied on the internet and digital world to connect with others,
whether family, friend, or for school.

Pew Research Center (2021) reports that about 81% of
Americans have utilized video calls since the onset of the
pandemic, and many researchers have found sharp increases
in social media use since the pandemic began. Social media
have become vital connection points to work, school, and social
networks--our connections to nearly all other people when
in person contact was scarce. However, these findings are
complicated by the digital divide, as affordability and
connection issues are frequent barriers to internet access and
thus to connection with other people.

We must also consider links between social media and social
anxiety, or fear of embarrassment or humiliation, leading to the
avoidance of social situations. The social media landscape is a

                                                                                    Wellness | 472
wonderful way for us to connect to other human beings. On
the other hand, it can lead to some distress as well. According
to Hidge, Bickham, & Cantor (2017), the preference to
communicate over text/IM/email over face to face increases the
risk of social anxiety in folks that are more prone to develop
it. Over time, choosing to substitute digital media for
interpersonal communication to avoid feared situations (that
can trigger anxiety) may become cyclically reinforced. Thus,
this is yet another cycle. An individual prefers digital
communication and displaces face-to face interactions, which
may worsen the symptoms and severity of social anxiety,
leading to the individual using the internet and social media
again as an emotional outlet.

Social media has the potential to initiate and sustain
relationships. Given the potential benefits of social media,
perhaps we should consider how to navigate it intentionally to
protect ourselves and well being. After all, these technologies
will be with us for a while. It's not going anywhere any time
soon. Knowing that, how can we protect ourselves and our
mental well-being? Technology and people can mutually
shape each other (Ellison, Pyle, and Vitak, 2022), but in order to
do so we have to rethink our relationship to social media and
realize how our behaviors can actively and positively contribute
to the virtual landscape.

Connecting through Illness

In his book, Coping with Illness Digitally (2018), Communication
researcher Stephen Rains outlines how the digital landscape
connects folks to find community while living with illness.
However, many of his findings can be generalized to how we
connect and find community online generally in relation to
our social health. The technologies we use to connect with

473 | Wellness
each other in order to communicate can be referred to as
communication technology. This includes our phones,
messaging apps, blogs, and other platforms. The use of these
according to Rains is motivated by a desire to overcome
isolations, reach others similar to use, and strengthen existing
relationships with friends and family. Communication
technology is similarly used by a large number of American
adults and settings like online communities, platforms, and
blogs are resources for support that is associated with well
being. Informational and emotional support are common
types of support found in online communities.

Rains identified four affordances to creating social support,
including control, anonymity, visibility, and availability.

Control relates to the ability to manage aspects of human
interaction, like editing a message before sending it. This is
quite contrary to face to face interactions where one is unable
to do that. This allows people to carefully curate messages.

Anonymity is the concealing of one's identity from others. This
can be seen by the use of pseudonyms. Think back to the
ASKfm days or how reddit is used to gather support. It allows
folks to feel less nervous about asking questions online.

Visibility is the affordance that involves the degree of
observable behavior online. This allows folks to observe their
digital landscape (ie: a viral twitter thread) or who gets to see a
post. In the area of social support, seeing how others go about
a situation or do something can be a valuable resource to us.

Availability is the potential to connect with others when they
are most needed (Rains, 2018).

Together, according to Rains, these affordances enable us to
seek social support online to cultivate community, connect
with friends and loved ones, and find support online.

                                                                                    Wellness | 474
Tips for a healthy life with social media

Read more about life balance and social media from
NPR<https://www.npr.org/2021/07/16/1016854764/social-media-
balance-relationship-boundaries>.

NPR's Lifekit gives us some considerations to keep in mind
when defining or rethinking our relationship to social media.
Keep these in mind:

  · Social media is designed to encourage repetitive
      behaviors and compulsions, but social media is not
      physically "addictive" in the same way as drugs and
      alcohol.
         Features like pull to refresh, endless scroll, autoplay
            and the algorithms are intentional choices made to
            keep us on the apps by showing us more of what we
            might like
         Push notifications, (Made) For You Pages, Click to See
            Image are all tactics to capture our attention
         Remember: "Technology and people can mutually
            shape each other" (Ellison, Pyle, and Vitak, 2022). How
            might the above features keep us on platforms?

  · Think of your relationship with social media as a
      meaningful one with the capacity to show certain aspects
      about ourselves. Ask yourself:
         What does a healthy relationship look like to me?
         What needs am I trying to meet right now?
         Scan your body - how do you feel after an hour online?

  · Be an active participant in your relationship - declutter
      and reorganize
         Go through `following' list on social media and clean it
            out - what is bringing joy and/or value into your life
         Block, mute, and other functions let you restrict the

475 | Wellness
            kind of content you don't want to see, which further
            fine tunes your algorithm to you.

Section 4: Personal Conclusion

Is it possible to have a good relationship with social media?
What steps can we take for positive impact?
Personally, I (Ally Fripp) can struggle with being bombarded
by body types I feel are ideal that do not include mine. This
weighs on me heavily some days, but I have to understand that
these images are not always natural and real. Thus in order
to give myself some tools combat this, I frequent a subreddit
that spots body editing and am learning how to spot when
other women use these filters and photoshop. Knowing that
these folks don't look the way they portray themselves on social
media is comforting and fills the space in my mind for negative
self comparisons.
Social media is here to stay for a while. And I actually do quite
enjoy it. It can be a fun outlet. However, I can feel when it does
take a toll on my mental health. Armed with the knowledge
presented in this chapter, I take steps to protect myself. This
includes taking breaks from social media, limiting my time
on it, and being critical of the content that I consume. Our
relationships with social media.

        seen other ask a question related to physical or
        mental health in a forum, on your story, or in any
        other online format. How did that go? What was
        that process like? Did people respond? If so, how
        did they respond?

   2. Reflect on a moment when you encountered an
        image on social media that made you question
        your own body image. How did you navigate
        those feelings, and did it influence your
        subsequent online interactions?

   3. Look back an experience where you turned to
        social media for emotional support during a
        challenging time. How did the online community
        respond, and did it impact your emotional well-
        being?

   4. Think about a time when you used social media
        to connect with others during the pandemic.
        How did this digital connection influence your
        sense of social health, and did it bring any
        unexpected challenges or benefits?

   Read It: Why it's important to think
   about social media use as a form of
   dissociation, rather than addiction

     When you dissociate, you become so absorbed in an
     activity that you lose track of time.

     In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, I had an
     unfortunate Saturday routine. I would wake up in my
     studio apartment and immediately turn to my phone,
     telling myself that I would get breakfast after quickly
     checking Twitter.
     An hour or so later, I would look up and realize what

483 | Wellness
time it was - and how ravenous I'd become. I had
become totally absorbed in looking at memes, snark
and the 24 hour news cycle.
This experience sparked an idea: What if, instead of
people becoming "addicted" to social media - as users
often characterize their excessive engagement -
they're actually dissociating, or becoming so engaged
that they lose track of time?
I've researched people's social media use for four years
as a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, and
my collaborators and I decided to design a study to test
this theory.

What is dissociation?

Many researchers think dissociation occurs on a
spectrum. On one end, there is the kind of dissociation
that is spurred by trauma and associated with PTSD
flashbacks.
Then there are common, everyday experiences of
dissociation, which involve attention being limited to a
narrow range of experience. Everyday dissociation can
be passive or active. Spontaneous daydreaming is a
form of passive dissociation, while reading a book is an
example of active dissociation. In both cases, you can
become so immersed in a fantasy or story that time
falls away and you lose track of your surroundings. You
might not be able to hear someone calling your name
from another room.
Dissociation is part of healthy cognitive functioning, as

                                                                             Wellness | 484
     mind-wandering helps you learn, and combating stress
     though deeply engaging in hobbies can boost your
     mood.

     Dissociation is a process that is defined by focused
     attention that leads to a reduced sense of the passage
     of time and reduced self-awareness.

   What does dissociation look like
   online?

     When online, however, dissociation can reflect zombie-
     like behavior - scrolling for hours without realizing it,
     not being aware to one's surroundings while scrolling,
     or scrolling on autopilot and then realizing you haven't
     actually paid any attention to what you've read. Have
     you ever seen someone so absorbed in their phone
     that they start walking across a street, oblivious to
     oncoming traffic? They're likely dissociating.
     Typically, behavior like this is classified as smartphone
     or internet addiction.
     However, researchers have begun to push back against
     the narrative of addiction to describe excessive

485 | Wellness
smartphone use, explaining that the behavior - even if
it's a source of distress - should not be considered
addiction if it's better explained by an underlying
disorder, is a willful choice, or is part of a coping
strategy.
I am of the belief that choosing to play Candy Crush for
three hours a day is not necessarily "addiction." I do,
however, think that the complete disconnect people
experience from their surroundings and sense of time
passing is an interesting phenomenon to explore.
Therefore, I wanted to understand if people are
dissociating during their phone use.
In our study, we recruited volunteers to use a custom
mobile app alternative to Twitter, called Chirp. Forty-
three people used Chirp for four weeks, cycling through
four different design interventions, coupled with in-app
surveys. We then selected 11 of them to interview about
the experience.
We found dissociation occurred in nearly half of our
participants, and they often expressed a sense of
disappointment afterwards, saying that they would
have rather have engaged in a different activity with
the amount of time they had spent online. However,
some said their time on social media was meaningful
to them, and the fact that they were connecting with
real people was valuable, even as they dissociated.

Cultivating online agency

Understanding social media overuse as a byproduct of

                                                                             Wellness | 486
     dissociation, rather than addiction, can help
     destigmatize social media use while empowering
     users. This framing also helps explain why social media
     sits in a paradoxical position: people have frustrating
     relationships with social media platforms that they are
     simultaneously unwilling to quit.
     Seeking escape from the present moment through
     deep absorption - including absorption in social media
     - is a natural, common, and often beneficial thing to
     do. However, when users spend much more time
     dissociating online than they would have consciously
     chosen for themselves, they become frustrated and
     conflicted. And many social media platforms exploit
     this tendency by keeping people "on the hunt" for new
     content through algorithmic design.
     This suggests that it is possible for users to have
     healthy and satisfying relationships with social media -
     even when dissociating is involved - if the platforms
     can also help their users disengage.

   How design can reduce dissociation

     In our study, we deployed several interventions to help
     pause or reduce dissociation while scrolling on Chirp.
     One intervention that was particularly effective was
     requiring our participants to sort their content into lists
     by topic - say, news, sports and reality TV - rather than
     having all subjects appear as an avalanche of
     information on one main feed. People could then click
     different tabs to view their lists. We found that many

487 | Wellness
users would only scroll through one or two tabs before
exiting the app.
We paired this intervention with a "reading history"
label that informed our users when they were "all
caught up" with previously viewed tweets. Participants
said that this helped them feel more in control and less
likely to lose track of time.
Of course, many current social media companies, such
as TikTok, rely on algorithmically-determined,
constantly updating content. Similarly, on Instagram
and Twitter, popular and trending content gets
inserted into a feed of followed content. This makes it
impossible to ever get "all caught up."
In these cases, past research shows that many people
would appreciate reminders to log off before 30
minutes of use. Otherwise they become disappointed
with the time they've spent. These reminders could be
inserted into regular content, which is something
TikTok already does.
Users can do this for themselves by becoming familiar
with the suite of digital well-being tools at their
disposal. Viewing usage page statistics and setting
timeouts is already available across many sites,
although many of these settings are turned off by
default.
However when more people use these tools, it signals
to the companies that they should continue to invest
time and resources into developing them.

Virtuality 3.0: SXSW in Austin, TX

Release Date: April 1st 2022
The SMO podcast team was at SXSW 2022 with the University
of Arizona Wonder House. In this episode, Diana sets out to
disentangle the culture of the city of Austin and the
hyperconnected projection that is SXSW. Are they in a
codependent relationship? What has SXSW done to Austin's
music scene? Why do even tech-savvy people prefer f2f to
online? And what does all this mean for the next frontier of
tech experiences, Virtuality 3.0? Interviews with Austin
residents and visitors include Thor Harris of Swans, Luke Savisky
of the 1990 film Slacker, and the crew of the food truck Cocina
de Carnival aka Big Bertha.

Metas And MasterChef

Release Date: February 1st 2022

world of Twitch. A site that dominates the live streaming world,

With boundaries being pushed to create the hottest new trend,
we run into the latest meta: the "react" meta, in which

out on Instagram, Snapchat, and Greek Rank. Produced by

@Reality

Release date: November 1st 2021
The internet can seem like a faraway place. It can seem fictional
and like it cannot affect you. But today we see relationships,
politics, and cultural movements echoing attitudes that
originate on the web. How can this be? In this episode, we listen
to stories from people who thought they were impervious to
the internet's influence. Instead, they found their realities
perturbed by things they first saw on-screen. Produced and
narrated by Gabe Stultz with support from Jacquie Kuru and
Diana Daly of iVoices Media Lab at the University of Arizona. All
music in this episode by Gabe Stultz.

than to most academic journals, and personal or first-person
perspective is welcome but not required. Writers should avoid
long paragraphs in favor of shorter ones, and include images

Conclusion

Why is it important to know ourselves in order to understand
social media? This book is called Humans R Social Media
because the development of social media culture, including
norms and technological affordances, is wrapped up in you, us,
and other humans. And we are also wrapped up in that culture;
as we shape it, it shapes us.
We've tried to show how social media technologies and human
culture partnership plays out in this book. We began with the
reverberations of this partnership on identity. We examined
our society's communication practices informing early social
media technologies. We looked at how human-created
algorithms bounce against human behaviors, reinforcing them
but also sometimes being rejected by them. We learned about
the ways humans have learned to use social technologies to
seek what we want through online activism, branding, and
lying. And we looked at the ways our bodies and needs for love
play out in the digital landscape, performing new relationships
and spectacular selves.
We hope this book has helped you to understand how
important your role is as a human in a technological revolution.
And we hope that you will share what you've learned.
