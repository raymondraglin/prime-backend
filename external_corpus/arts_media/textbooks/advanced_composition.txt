INTRODUCTION

   Collette Bliss and Ashleigh Severson

Welcome to Advanced Composition! In this course, we embark on a journey
through the art and craft of writing, exploring various forms, styles, and purposes of
composition. Over the semester, we will delve into four distinct units, each designed
to equip students with the necessary information to complete the four major
assignments in the course.

   This course will also equip you with invaluable tools and strategies to navigate
the complexities of the rhetorical situation. Understanding the interplay between
audience, purpose, context, and genre is essential for crafting effective written
communication in any setting.

   Throughout the semester, we will explore how to tailor your writing to various
audiences, whether academic, professional, or personal, and how to adapt your
message to different rhetorical contexts. By considering the unique needs,
expectations, and perspectives of your audience, you'll learn to communicate with
clarity, relevance, and impact.

   Moreover, we will delve into the importance of identifying and clarifying your
purpose as a writer. Whether you seek to inform, persuade, entertain, or provoke,
articulating your objectives with precision is essential for crafting focused and
purposeful writing. By honing your ability to articulate your intentions, you will
develop a stronger sense of authorial voice and agency in your writing endeavors.

   Context, too, plays a pivotal role in shaping effective communication. We'll explore
how cultural, historical, social, and institutional factors influence the reception and
interpretation of written texts. By situating your writing within its broader context,
you will learn to craft messages that resonate with your audience and resonate with
contemporary discourse.

   Finally, we will delve into the nuances of genre, examining how different forms
and styles of writing serve distinct purposes and audiences.

   The course units are organized to follow the course schedule and subsequent
major assignments to hone your skills and broaden your understanding of effective
communication. Each unit and assignment will build upon the foundations and
skills learned in the previous weeks.
2 | INTRODUCTION

The Writing Process

serve as a valuable resource throughout your college journey and beyond. From
brainstorming and outlining to drafting, revising, and editing, you will learn to
navigate each stage of the writing process with confidence and efficiency.

We will emphasize the importance of prewriting strategies, such as freewriting,
clustering, and outlining, to generate ideas, organize your thoughts, and establish a
clear direction for your writing. Through workshops, peer review sessions, and one-
on-one conferences, you'll receive constructive feedback and guidance to refine
your drafts and strengthen your arguments.

   We will explore strategies for effective revision, helping you develop the critical
eye and editorial skills necessary to polish your writing to perfection. By learning
to identify weaknesses, clarify ideas, and fine-tune your prose, you'll cultivate a
rigorous approach to revision that yields polished, polished, and persuasive final
drafts.

   By mastering the rhetorical situation and developing a systematic writing
process, you'll be equipped with the tools and techniques necessary to excel in your
academic endeavors and beyond.

Unit Breakdown

UNIT 1

In Unit 1, we will Discover A Community. Through this unit, you'll explore your
understanding of community and communication in order to set up for the rest
of the semester. After this unit, you'll know what we mean by "discourse," and
feel comfortable discussing "discourse communities." Additionally, you'll learn to
identify your own discourse communities, and begin to narrow your focus into a
research project that will span the whole semester.

UNIT 2

Moving forward to Unit 2, we'll shift our focus to the intricacies of community
engagement and analysis in the Provide Background assignment. Through
                                                                                                                                            INTRODUCTION | 3

research, interviews, and observation, you'll learn to capture the essence of a
community and convey its complexities through the written word. You will then
expand this community profile into a multi-modal project which utilizes visual and
digital communication to better articulate the details of your community.

UNIT 3

In Unit 3, we'll delve into the power of storytelling with the Tell A Story assignment.
Here, you'll unleash your creativity as you explore the art of narrative construction,
character development, and plot dynamics. Whether crafting fiction, memoir, or
creative nonfiction, you'll learn to captivate your audience, evoke emotions, and
craft memorable stories that resonate long after the final page is turned.

UNIT 4

Finally, in Unit 4, we'll sharpen our persuasive prowess with the Make An Argument
assignment.

Reflective Work

This course will also provide opportunities for self-reflection, allowing you to deepen
your understanding of your relationship with writing and cultivate a more mindful
and intentional approach to your craft.

   Midterm and final assignments will allow you to engage in self-reflection
assignments designed to prompt introspection and exploration of your writing
process, habits, strengths, and areas for growth. Through guided prompts,
journaling exercises, and reflective worksheets, you will have the opportunity to
gain greater self-awareness, resilience, and agency in your writing journey. You'll
learn to recognize patterns, identify areas for improvement, and set meaningful
goals for your ongoing development as a writer. These self-reflection assignments

WHAT IS A DISCOURSE COMMUNITY?

   Tracy L.F. Worley, DM PMP

Everyone belongs to a discourse community, but what exactly is it? A discourse
community is a group with shared customs, practices, disciplines, beliefs,
assumptions, goals, and/or values. The discourse of the community has a common
way of communicating, and it can be a local community (like a school or business)
or a focal community (like an accounting or project management association).
Determining your discourse community requires an assessment of your interests,
academic major, employment, social group, or organizational memberships.
Knowing your discourse community will help you to create within a context that is
common to your audience. Knowing your discourse community will also help you to
craft a compelling treatise that uses lexis (lingo, language) that is common to your
discourse community.
10 | DISCOURSE AND DISCOURSE COMMUNITY

2.

DISCOURSE AND DISCOURSE COMMUNITY

   Christian J. Pulver

The term discourse community combines two key concepts--community and
discourse.

   Generally speaking, community refers to the local groups we live and work with,
our neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. While living in proximity with other
people is an important aspect of community, other aspects beyond location play
an important role. Those aspects have to do with our shared ways of using
language and the common values and beliefs that emerge from how we
communicate with each other. Such shared language practices are called
discourse, and people who share similar ways of talking and thinking, and do it
frequently together, are part of a discourse community.

   Conventionally, we can think of discourse as the exchange of words and ideas
among those who share a common purpose for continually interacting. We
discourse about the weather, last night's game, politics, and art. Discourse is like
conversation, but conversation is just one way that discourse is exchanged within
the larger language and communication patterns that we engage in, from our
local discourse communities to the larger public. Discourse is also shared through
written texts, videos, podcasts, and other discursive genres. So, not only does our
proximity to each other shape the communities we are a part of, discourse
communities also share particular genres, styles, and accepted ways of
communicating with each other, and they tend to gravitate around particular
problems that are of shared concern.

   Though the word community is often thought of as people who get along well,
not all discourse communities get along, and members don't always like each
other. That is to say, discourse communities come in all shapes in sizes, and the
language practices that occur within them can vary widely as a result. Some
discourse communities can be confrontational or argumentative (legal discourse,
for example), and others might be more intimate and caring (parent-child
discourse, for example). And discourse communities don't exist in a bubble--they
are embedded in the larger public and cultural discourses that include
                                                                                                      DISCOURSE AND DISCOURSE COMMUNITY | 11

entertainment, national politics, and public debates that circulate broadly via mass
and social media. The discourse communities we are part of at work or in college,
with family and friends, are always embedded in these larger discourses.

   Understanding the shape of a discourse and the problems that matter to a
discourse community are vital to understanding the nature of the particular
problem you are considering and how to solve it. To achieve this kind of
understanding, it is always useful to map out the basic contours of the discourse
by looking at the where, when, what, who, how, and, why of that discourse.

     Mapping the Discourse of a Problem or Controversy
12 | DISCOURSE AND DISCOURSE COMMUNITY

Mapping a discourse in these ways is an ongoing activity that will help you develop
a richer, broader understanding of the problem you are exploring. Not only will it
help you understand the nature and nuances of the problem, it will help you
                                                                                                      DISCOURSE AND DISCOURSE COMMUNITY | 13

understand how to enter the conversation and contribute towards its solution
(what is known as discourse competence).
14 | IDENTIFYING YOUR DISCOURSE COMMUNITY

3.

IDENTIFYING YOUR DISCOURSE COMMUNITY

   Tracy L.F. Worley, DM PMP

You may be a business major or perhaps you haven't declared a major yet. In either
case, try answering the following questions to identify the discourse community
or communities you could be a part of. As you move through Composition and
Research in the business discipline, knowing your discourse community will be
helpful in identifying potential organizations you may use in research. This self-
assessment will help focus your thinking on what a discourse community is and
identifying the written genres they use.

UNIT 1 CONCLUSION

   Collette Bliss

Now that you've completed this unit, you should know what a discourse community
is, have a good sense of your own discourse communities, and be able to propose
two different discourse communities that you would like to study, ultimately
selecting one to explore for the rest of the semester.

   Looking forward, we'll begin to apply this knowledge, learning how to deepen our
understanding of communities and how to advocate for them. So far, we've been
mostly working with concepts and texts, but in the next unit we'll get into digital
and multi-modal genres for presenting information.

   As we close out, begin to reflect on your experience in Unit 1. What have you
learned? Has anything surprised you or changed the way you see things? Why did
you choose the community that you chose? What are you hoping to get out of the
next units? What do you hope to get out of this course?

UNIT 2 INTRODUCTION

   Collette Bliss

Welcome to Unit 2: Provide Background, where you will expand your knowledge
of the community you chose in Unit 1. Initially, you'll deepen your research into a
written description of your community, using the information from your proposal
as a starting point. Then we'll move into digital and multi-modal forms of
communication, as you create an infographic to showcase the information from
your written assignment in a compelling and visual way. The goal of the infographic
is to show outsiders the most important things to understand about this
community in an accessible format.

   In order to prepare you for this project, the four chapters in this unit will be
focused on digital media and related concepts, from basic design principles to
accessibility in digital spaces. By the end of this unit, you should be prepared to
create a multi-modal version of any data set you encounter, in college and beyond.
18 | MULTIMODALITY

MULTIMODALITY

   Cara Miller

Did you know that in the early days of the internet, there weren't online videos or
even pictures? Communication was almost entirely text-based, and even the text
wasn't formatted like it is now in a variety of fonts, colors, sizes, and spacing options
(Murphy). Can you imagine? You'd land on a web page and be confronted with a
wall of text that you had to sift through in order to find the information that you
were looking for. By today's standards, that would be considered a terrible website,
and most people would quickly bounce off the page due to boredom or frustration.

         Fortunately, the internet evolved rapidly to provide the capabilities for web
pages to be thoughtfully designed, pulling together a variety of visual and even
auditory elements that engage visitors and help them quickly and easily find the
information that they need. In fact, digital communication is increasingly complex if
you consider the types of "texts" that can be produced using video editing software,
animation tools, live stream capabilities, and web applications that make it easy
to incorporate a variety of media on a single web page without requiring HTML
expertise. Understanding how to effectively combine these design elements to
enhance the meaning of a message is not simply a nice skill to have; it's crucial
to effective digital communication. In fact, composition courses are increasingly
expanding instruction to go beyond text-based writing and include multimodal
writing strategies that integrate visual and aural elements as well. This further
develops literacy skills across multiple platforms and allows the writer to think
more deeply and creatively about how to best convey information to the intended
audience.

         This chapter focuses on multimodality and the effects of layering different
modes together in a single message. The term multimodality literally means more
than one "mode" or method to communicate meaning (University of Illinois
Springfield). A message often has words, for instance, and that is one mode.
However, a written message will also include things like font choice, font size,
font color, and other formatting effects, such as bold or italic font. These are also
methods of communicating, and they have a significant effect on the way that
                                                                                                                                         MULTIMODALITY | 19

someone reads and interprets the meaning of the words, which is why it's so
important to consider your communication goals and how different
modes--beyond word choice--can influence your effectiveness. In this chapter,
we'll study the different modes that make up multimodality--linguistic, visual,
gestural, spatial, and aural. We'll also talk about a range of tools within each mode
as well as strategies for making a message cohesive, engaging, and easy for readers
to understand.

     Learning Objectives

          · Know what multimodality is and what the different modes are.
          · Be able to discern various examples of a particular mode.
          · Understand how multimodality can enhance the meaning and persuasiveness of a

             message.
          · Consider the creative possibilities for a given message and the ways that modes can be

             layered in countless ways to engage an audience and provide subtle nuances.
          · Understand the rhetorical nature of multimodality and how modes can be used to target

             specific audiences for a particular purpose.
          · Learn important rhetorical considerations that will guide your choices regarding

             multimodal messages.

Understanding the Different Modes

The point of multimodality is to combine elements that will enhance the
effectiveness of a message with the intended audience, which means that you
have to be thoughtful about the way that you put a message together. That's
one important reason that this textbook includes a unit on rhetorical literacy in
addition to practical literacy. Knowing how (the practical aspect of digital writing)
is a different, more surface-level skill than knowing why or to what effect (the
rhetorical aspect). For instance, most people know how to make text bold, create
a bar graph, paste an image into a document, or even embed a video. Certainly,
there are a wide range of platforms available that require a great deal of training
20 | MULTIMODALITY

and experimentation to understand how to do something specific. For instance,
learning how to use iMovie or WordPress or Moovly and understanding the range
of tools available would take some time and probably some additional instruction.
However, just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should. (This
is why we focus so heavily on critical and rhetorical literacy before diving into the
functional aspect--to provide a framework that will guide your decisions.) There
are hundreds of websites out there that do a terrible job of combining imagery
and text and color--often trying to emphasize too many things with the end result
that nothing stands out. Visitors are quickly overwhelmed or frustrated because
it's difficult to find the information that they are looking for. On the other hand,
websites and other types of messaging that fail to utilize various tools, focusing
instead on large blocks of text, also fail to engage readers' attention or compel
action. In other words, it's crucial to think about multimodality from an audience's
perspective, combining elements in such a way as to capture readers' attention,
help them understand key ideas, build a sense of trust and connectedness, and
elicit a response that is consistent with your underlying communication goals.

         Obviously, these objectives are more easily said than done. As we've already
discussed, in a digital era full of clickbait and pop-up advertising, it can be difficult
just to capture a reader's attention, let alone to facilitate the deeper engagement
required to read the entire message and respond to the call to action. However,
being creative and intentional about how various modes are combined in a single
message will significantly increase your chances of success. This section discusses
all five modes, providing examples of each one and a deeper discussion of how it
might be used effectively. Of course, each message provides an opportunity to be
creative--to combine elements in different ways. There isn't one "right" way, but
there are certainly some strategies that go against best practices. We'll talk about
those as well.

                                                                                          BY)

Linguistic

Let's start with the most obvious mode of communication--written and spoken
words. In chapter 8, we discussed the symbolic nature of words. They represent
objects as well as more complex ideas, concepts, and processes. In our daily
communication, these words are our primary tools to express our meaning to
others--in conversation, in text messages, in emails, in letters, in blog posts, and so
on. Within this category, there are several elements that can either clarify meaning
or, if not done well, can create confusion (Fillmore):

   · Word choice. As the Writing Center at the University of North Carolina Chapel
      Hill points out, "Writing is a series of choices." Different words carry different
      connotations. For instance, calling someone "stubborn" has a more negative
      meaning, implying that the person is hard-headed and not easy to get along
      with. On the other hand, if you called that person "tenacious," suddenly those
      same qualities have a more positive connotation, implying determination and
      self-confidence. Additionally, in some cases, words and phrases can come
      across as vague to your audience so that they don't have the same depth of
22 | MULTIMODALITY

      meaning as they might have with more precise wording. As a simple example,
      if you send a friend to the store with a shopping list with the word "vegetables"
      on it, who knows what you might get. That word can mean a lot of things. But
      if you write "carrots" or, more specifically, "baby carrots," you're much more
      likely to get the item you want because the wording is much more precise.
      You'd also be sure in specific situations to select vocabulary that matches your
      audience's understanding. Using big words and jargon that others might not
      understand or using vocabulary that is too simplistic or immature for a given
      audience can hinder communication as well as the ethos of the speaker. Word
      choice is significant in the way that others interpret meaning.
   · Grammar. Grammar dictates the way that words are structured within
      sentences to create complete thoughts. We can't put words in just any order,
      especially when it comes to more complex ideas and sentences. Following
      grammatical rules allows others to process information more easily, focusing
      more on the content of a message instead of the structure. Certainly, there are
      grammar rules that are more common and important than others. Subject-
      verb agreement and complete sentences are examples of grammar rules that
      help another person understand the meaning of a message. However, the rule
      that says you shouldn't end a sentence with a preposition isn't usually that
      important, especially in more informal contexts. Audience members will still
      understand the meaning and probably not think twice about the preposition.
      In other words, using effective grammar is contextual, depending on the
      audience, the occasion, and the method of communication. While verbal
      communication might naturally flow with starts and stops and incomplete
      sentences, some forms of written communication (especially emails or longer
      articles) tend to stick to the grammar rules. However, more informal
      messaging, such as text messaging or social media posts, breaks grammar
      rules intentionally to engage readers or communicate a specific tone. The
      same can be said of punctuation. While correct punctuation can be very
      effective and important in clarifying the meaning of written communication,
      occasionally rules are broken on purpose to enhance meaning. Importantly,
      though digital writing has expanded to include hashtags, emojis, and "texty"
      language, correct grammar still matters (Banner).
   · Sentence structure. Sentence structure does relate to grammar and many of
      the considerations mentioned above. It's separated here because different
      types of sentences exist that are grammatically correct but that come across
      differently to audiences. You might already know that a lot of short, simple
                                                                                                                                         MULTIMODALITY | 23

      sentences create messages that seem choppy and disjointed, whereas long,
      complex sentences can be difficult to follow, especially when there are several
      strung together. Once again, the "right" sentence structure is somewhat
      contextual. For younger audiences or for topics that are more complex or
      unfamiliar, it might be better to use shorter sentences (or even bulleted lists) to
      make it easier to understand. When you're writing a formal paper or
      communicating casually about general topics, it's more common to use a
      variety of sentence structures--both simple and complex--to create fluidity.
   · Organization of sentences and paragraphs. Especially for longer messages,
      such as essays, articles, and speeches, the organization of information requires
      careful consideration so that one idea builds on the next in a way that is logical
      and easy for audiences to follow. For instance, the reason that academic essays
      have a thesis statement and topic sentences is that it makes the essay more
      cohesive and easier for readers to follow. They are given the main point in the
      thesis, and (hopefully) each topic sentence relates directly to that main idea.
      Similarly, blog articles might not have a formal "thesis," but they do still have
      an introduction and a sentence or two that gives the main idea, often called a
      nut graph (Bethune). They also have paragraphs, often grouped together
      under various headings that expand on that one main idea. Even in shorter or
      more informal communication, organization is key. An email, for instance,
      wouldn't start out with a list of bullet points. Readers would be confused right
      away. Instead, it would begin with a short introduction clarifying the subject of
      the email and contextualizing the purpose of the bulleted list.

         While the linguistic mode is an important--often the most important--tool
for communicating meaning, it doesn't stand alone. Other modes of
communication are used alongside the linguistic mode to enhance meaning.
What's more, the linguistic mode isn't always the most important. Consider, for
example, the climactic scene of a movie. Would you understand that scene more
fully--and be more emotionally connected--if someone else described that scene
to you or if you watched it for yourself? Or maybe think about a class lecture that
will last for a full hour. Would you find it easy to pay attention and follow along
with the topic if the instructor spoke in a monotone voice the whole time? Probably
not. The tone and inflection in their voice paired with appropriate pauses, gestures,
facial expressions, and maybe even a few visual aids with text and images would
make that same lecture much more engaging and easy to understand. In the next
24 | MULTIMODALITY

few sections, we turn to other modes that go beyond linguistics to communicate
meaning.

Visual

Another important communication method relates to the visual mode--the things
that people see that help them interpret the meaning of a message. This can refer
to simple visual cues as well as more complex images and videos. As mentioned
above, these visual cues can greatly enhance a message to make it more engaging
and readable. Here are some examples:

   · Font. Beyond the meaning of the words in a written message, there are always
      visual elements to be interpreted. For instance, there is always a font choice,
      even if it's a very basic font like Arial or Times New Roman, it's a visual element
      that coincides with the linguistic mode, and it might suggest a message that
      is more academic or serious. There are countless font choices, and each one
      carries a certain "personality" that may or may not be appropriate for a given
      message. For instance, a script font like Edwardian is more formal and
      sophisticated, and it would be very appropriate for a wedding invitation. It
      wouldn't be as appropriate for an academic essay or the banner at a kid's
      birthday party. Something playful and fun like Curlz might be better suited for
      a birthday party, but it would send the wrong message on a funeral bulletin or
      a political ad. In addition to font choice, there are other font strategies that you
      might use to emphasize parts of a message: larger font, bold, italics,
      underlined words. These visual font elements demonstrate the importance of
      certain words or ideas when used appropriately. Similarly, larger bold font can
      be used for headings in a blog post or essay to help readers follow the larger
      structure of a text and easily find main ideas.

   · Formatting. Another subtle visual cue relates to the formatting of a message.
      The simple act of breaking up a large block of text into separate
      paragraphs--with a space between text blocks and/or a tab at the beginning
      of a new idea--is extremely helpful in making a text more readable and easier
      to follow. Formatting also refers to things like line spacing (i.e., leading),
      alignment, the horizontal spacing between letters (i.e., kerning), line breaks,
      inset text, and hanging indents. These are pretty basic formatting cues that we
      tend to take for granted because they seem so obvious, but when they are
      ignored, a message becomes much harder to read. An article that is right
                                                                                                                                     MULTIMODALITY | 25

  aligned, for instance, is harder to read and would likely frustrate readers. On
  the other hand, when you are intentional in your choices--even formatting
  choices that go against standard conventions--it can grab readers' attention
  and complement a message. An ad with right-aligned text, for instance, might
  be very helpful in balancing the elements on a page or in creating a sense of
  unbalance or tension with the audience.
· Color. Not only are colors effective in catching people's attention and
  enhancing the aesthetic of a message, but they are often used in symbolic
  ways to evoke certain emotions or moods (Incredible Art Department). Black
  and white or sepia, for instance, are sometimes used to evoke a sense of
  nostalgia or timelessness. Bright, vibrant colors can imply energy and
  positivity. What's more, color can be used strategically to draw the audience's
  attention to a particular text or part of an image. In Schindler's List, for
  instance, the film is in black and white except for the red coat that one of the
  Jewish girls is wearing, which forces audiences to pay attention to that one
  object and consider the significance. In a similar way, color can be used in text-
  based documents to draw readers' attention to headings or titles. Similarly,
  readers generally know that blue, underlined text contains a hyperlink that
  they can click on for more information. Finally, colors are also strategically used
  by organizations as a branding tool. They select a color palette that
  corresponds with their logo, and then they integrate those colors into their
  website and other marketing materials as a subtle way to reinforce their
  image.
· Images. Pictures and other graphics can significantly enhance a message. If a
  friend tells you about a trip that they took to the Grand Canyon, you'd probably
  understand their story based on the descriptions that they use, but it would be
  much easier and more effective to show you pictures from the trip so that you
  can see the rocks and canyons for yourself. Similarly, instruction manuals often
  come with pictures of the various parts so that you can better visualize how
  the pieces go together. Once more, the use of imagery in a message has
  several purposes. It helps audiences understand a particular scene or idea or
  process, but it also engages their attention and can be effective in evoking an
  emotional response. A good example is the SPCA (Society for the Prevention of
  Cruelty to Animals) commercial with Sarah McLachlan. It blends several modes
  together, including sound (the song), text on the screen, and imagery to evoke
  feelings of sympathy and compassion in the audience. All of these elements
  work together to meet that purpose, but an important element in that
26 | MULTIMODALITY

      commercial is the imagery--the pictures of animals in cages, some of them
      who have clearly been abused--that evokes the strongest reaction. This pathos
      appeal using imagery isn't always about sympathy. An amusement park will
      use photos of people having fun on rides. A hotel will feature photos of clean,
      luxurious rooms and swimming pools. The purpose is to create a sense of
      desire in the viewer, who feels compelled to participate.
   · Videos and GIFs. Like still photos, videos, GIFs, and animations have a variety of
      purposes. They can be extremely helpful in conveying information. How many
      times have you gone to YouTube to find a video that provides a step-by-step
      demonstration of how to do something? Particularly when paired with verbal
      descriptions and instructions, a video provides richer details of an event or a
      process. Consider, for instance, football games on television that provide
      instant replays, zooming in on particular areas and using slow motion to
      carefully examine the details of a play. That video, along with the
      commentators' discussion and telestration capabilities, helps viewers
      understand exactly what happened. Also like still photos, videos are extremely
      effective in engaging an audience. Consider how popular YouTube and TikTok
      videos are in capturing viewers' attention. They also can be used to create
      emotional connections--perhaps even more so than still photos--because
      they depict detailed scenes and allow viewers to hear people's voices and
      other sounds, providing the sense that they are right there in the moment
      (Slice).
   · Charts and graphs. In many instances, a bar graph, pie chart, or some sort of
      illustration can go a long way to clarify an idea or process. Particularly when it
      comes to numerical data, a graph or chart with colored lines is much easier for
      viewers to process than verbal or written text filled with a string of numbers.
      The same is true of tables, flow charts, figures, and illustrations. Audiences are
      much more likely to make sense of data when they are organized in a visual
      format like this.

Gestural

Like the name implies, the gestural mode allows meaning to be interpreted based
on the speaker's gestures--body movements and facial expressions. This is an
aspect of communication that is missing in written text and phone conversations.
You don't get to see the physical gestures of the person speaking, which give you
a much clearer sense of that person's attitude toward the subject as well as their
                                                                                                                                         MULTIMODALITY | 27

implied meaning. In many instances, the gestures and facial expressions are crucial
in helping you understand the meaning of a message. Consider, for instance, sign
language, in which the entirety of a person's message is encoded using physical
signs. Similarly, the game of charades is based on our ability to communicate
through body language and signals. In other instances, physical cues might not
embody the entire message, but they can help you interpret another person's
mood and even gauge how your own message might (or might not) resonate with
them. This mode might include the following:

   · Hand gestures. Simple cues like pointing a person in the right direction or
      giving a thumbs-up to let someone know that you are OK can go a long way in
      communicating information. Scuba divers, for instance, have a series of hand
      gestures that they use to communicate with each other underwater. In that
      case, the thumbs-up signal means that the person needs to go to the surface,
      whereas a flat hand across the throat signifies that the person is out of air--an
      incredibly important message that they would need their partner to
      understand. Hand gestures are also used in sign language to communicate a
      variety of ideas. In fact, just like written language, sign language has its own
      grammar, and it can vary significantly from one region to the next (National
      Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).

   · Facial expressions. Another important gestural cue--whether in an online
      conversation, in a video, or in person--is facial expression. Sometimes a
      person's face says it all in terms of their attitude or mood. It can communicate
      information to others. A wink, for instance, might signal that a comment
      should be taken as a joke. A raised eyebrow might indicate surprise or
      suspicion. At the same time, it's probably important to keep in mind that facial
      expressions can be--and often are--misread (Cimons). Someone's frown
      might be misunderstood for anger or sadness when they are really just
      daydreaming or concentrating. Another thing to consider is the effect that
      facial expressions can have on other people, often evoking similar emotions
      and facial expressions in the audience (Dimberg et al.).

   · Body language. Body language can also be a form of communication. Your
      posture, stance, proximity to other people, and other body movements are all
      signals to other people about your attitude, feelings, and reactions. Think
      about the perspective of a teacher, standing in front of a classroom full of
      students. Maybe there are several students right up front, taking notes, raising
      their hands with questions, nodding along to the lesson. These are clear
28 | MULTIMODALITY

      signals about the students' attitudes toward the teacher and the class. So too
      are the signals of students who are sitting at the very back of the classroom,
      arms folded across their chests, eyes fixed on their phones. This distinction
      might not seem important, but consider how much easier it is to
      communicate openly with someone who seems to be receptive to your
      message and has a positive attitude toward you versus someone who doesn't.
      In many instances, your body language will be the first thing that makes an
      impression on other people, and it can go a long way to build your image in a
      positive way--or not.

Spatial

The fourth mode is spatial, related to the spacing and overall layout of a document
and the connections this implies to readers. Even the most basic black text on a
white document has an arrangement that influences the order in which readers
take in information, and as other elements are placed on the page, that placement
determines the way that readers understand the message. The primary elements
included in the spatial mode are the following:

   · Arrangement. In some instances, the arrangement of elements on a page
      might be obvious. The title of a document should go at the top. Different
      sections or chapters in a longer document are usually separated by space to
      show the separation. In other instances, it might not be so clear, especially as
      more elements are added. When pictures or charts accompany the text, for
      instance, what's the most appropriate placement so that the visual elements
      effectively complement the text? What about a large web page that includes
      several different sections of text, photos, banner graphics, social media icons,
      and maybe even a video or two? The choices that you make to arrange these
      items on the page can aid in the viewers' ability to easily find and process
      information, or it can make it much more difficult. Of course, there are several
      design options to choose from (Babich), depending on the purpose of the
      website and the types of elements that you have to work with. Further, many
      websites are "responsive," meaning that the layout shifts for mobile users so
      that the information is still easy to read on a smaller screen.

   · Proximity. In addition to the arrangements of objects and design elements on
      a page, proximity also influences the way that readers interpret a message. It's
      probably obvious that elements that go together should be close to each
                                                                                                                                         MULTIMODALITY | 29

      other. A caption that goes along with a photo, for instance, is usually directly
      underneath that photo. Similarly, groups of similar things tend to be grouped
      together. For example, items in a list, perhaps across the top of a website as a
      navigation menu or in bullets within the text, will likely be close together to
      signify that they go together. In contrast, additional white space can be used
      to separate items that don't go together, to signify a transition or distinction.
   · Contrast. Using contrasting elements can be an extremely effective way of
      drawing a viewer's attention to a particular focal point, perhaps through
      opposing colors, sizes, shapes, textures, or even white space. While this might
      seem like a simple task, knowing how and when to create contrast can be
      tricky. The main idea is to use contrast effectively to set elements apart or to
      highlight key takeaways while still maintaining an overall aesthetic that is
      pleasing to the eye and consistent (see repetition below).
   · Repetition. Repetition refers to the use of the same element over and over in a
      composition. For instance, most designs have a specific color palette, often
      using two to five colors that work well together and can be used in certain
      instances to create contrast. However, the composition sticks to these basic
      colors to create a sense of uniformity. If too many colors are used, then it
      creates a sense of chaos, and nothing is emphasized effectively. The same
      principle applies to other elements like shapes and textures. Importantly, this
      type of repetition is often seen across a family of publications by the same
      organization, which helps to establish branding and familiarity with the
      audience.

Aural

The final mode is aural, referring to the many different sounds that can bring
meaning to a message. We'll talk in the next section about the fact that all
messages are multimodal, including verbal messages. There are the actual words
(linguistic) and then a range of other aural cues that allow the audience to interpret
the meaning of the words more fully:

   · Volume. For one thing, the volume with which someone speaks can
      significantly impact the way the message is interpreted. A louder volume
      implies a sense of urgency and importance, suggesting that the words
      demand your immediate attention. Similarly, if someone is yelling, it's obvious
      that they are excited in some way, perhaps angry, scared, or happy. On the
30 | MULTIMODALITY

      other hand, someone speaking in a low whisper might be sharing something
      personal or secretive, which might also influence the way that you react to the
      information.
   · Tone. A person's tone is also important. Most of us are familiar with sarcasm, in
      which a person really means the opposite of what they say. If someone says,
      "Well, that's fantastic" in a sarcastic tone, you know that they aren't really very
      happy. In the same way, a person's tone of voice can tell you a lot about their
      attitude toward the information--if they are joking, excited, somber, or serious.
   · Pitch. As the pitch of our voice goes up and down, certain ideas within our
      sentences are emphasized in a way that gives meaning to our words.
      According to the University of Minnesota Libraries Publishing, "Pitch refers to
      how high or low a speaker's voice is....Each person has the capability to
      intentionally change their pitch across a range large enough to engage an
      audience." The chapter goes on to discuss the ways pitch can be used to
      emphasize certain ideas, communicate emotion, or signal to the audience that
      a transition is coming.
   · Rhythm. In poetry and in music, rhythm is the speed at which a speaker
      moves through the text, and as you probably know, it can be extremely
      effective in engaging an audience, who find themselves moving to the beat.
      It's the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables that creates rhythm. A
      faster rhythm is more energetic and tends to be happier, whereas a slower
      rhythm is often more sad, soothing, or sentimental. Not only can rhythm evoke
      an emotional response in an audience, but it can also be used to emphasize
      certain words and ideas, especially when the pattern is disrupted.
   · Music. Have you noticed that the climactic scene of most movies has a song
      playing in the background? It might be an upbeat song as the good guy
      triumphs over evil, or it might be a slower, crescendoing song that matches
      the intensity of feeling as two lovers reunite. Similarly, the SPCA commercial
      with Sarah McLachlan is so emotionally moving partly because of the song
      "Angel" that plays while pictures of dogs and cats are displayed, which
      reinforces the feelings of sadness a viewer feels and further compels them to
      take action. You probably already know that music can have a significant effect
      on a person's mood and emotional reactions (Heshmat). Upbeat music can
      energize and spark a more positive mood while a slower song can spark
      feelings of sadness or nostalgia. That's why pairing an appropriate song to fit
      an occasion or the underlying purpose of a message can have such a powerful
      effect.

· Sound effects. Many digital tools used for editing videos or even putting
  together a slideshow come with standard sound effects and allow you to
  upload others that you created on your own or purchased somewhere else.
  While some sound effects might be a bit hokey (think of the "bing," "bang,"
  "pow," "boing" that a lot of kids' cartoons include to draw a laugh), they can
  also be used in other ways to intensify a scene and sway the emotional
  reaction of the audience. A simple example are the laugh tracks that used to
  accompany popular sitcoms, signaling to viewers that a scene was meant to
  be funny and compelling them to join in. Movies and plays also use sound
  effects--train whistles, footsteps, door slams, gunshots--to add clarity to a
  scene and further engage the audience into the plot.

· Pauses. Sometimes just as powerful as the words and sound effects are the
  pauses in dialogue and other sounds. Consider the long silence that might
  follow the sound of a gunshot and all of the thoughts and emotions that might
  occur during that pause. Strategic pauses can also be used during a
  conversation or a speech to engage attention. A pause automatically builds
  suspense as the audience waits to see what the speaker might say or do next.

 Activity 10.1

 Find an example of an online video, ad, or website that utilizes a number of modes. Review the
 content and come up with a list of all of the multimodal elements that are used. This includes
 not just the mode (e.g., visual) but also the specific tool (e.g., photo or color).
 After you've created your list, consider how these elements work together in this message. How
 do the multimodal tools help engage the audience or clarify the meaning of the message? What
 kinds of feelings or emotions might they invoke that work toward a particular purpose?
 Keep in mind that not all messages are effective. It might be that the message you selected is
 ineffective in some way, maybe because some of the tools seem to contradict the larger
 meaning of the text or because there are too many elements vying for the audience's attention.
 Perhaps there aren't enough modes utilized to the fullest potential, and the message comes
 across as boring or vague. Consider how multimodal tools might have been used more
 effectively.
32 | MULTIMODALITY

The Power of Multimodality

All messaging is inherently multimodal, requiring audiences to pay attention to
multiple features in order to gain a clear understanding of the speaker's intention.
For example, text-based messages include not only the linguistic mode but also
visual elements related to font, color, and formatting. Similarly, verbal messages
(over the phone, for instance) also include the linguistic mode along with aural
elements, such as volume, pitch, tone, and meaningful pauses. Even a simple wave
from a friend accompanies other visual elements like the speed of the gesture
and the context of their surroundings. In other words, the categories provided
above can be a helpful framework, but it's also a bit deceiving, as a single message
will automatically span across different modes, bringing with it a variety of subtle
nuances. It's also important to point out that multimodality isn't limited to the
digital realm, which is a common misconception. Hopefully it's clear by now that in-
person conversations as well as printed materials are also multimodal.

         Given the importance of multimodal communication, it's no wonder that
most people prefer to have important conversations in person. With a range of
linguistic, audiovisual, and gestural cues, it becomes easier and quicker for an
audience to interpret the meaning of a message more fully because there are
more cues present (Drijvers and Holler). It's also easier for a conversation to flow
more naturally because visual and gestural cues help signal when one person's
turn is over and another person's begins. Certainly, there are digital tools that make
it possible to have synchronous conversations with other people using a range
of audiovisual cues. Zoom and Google Meet, for instance, simulate face-to-face
conversions so that we get a better sense of the communicator's meaning through
facial expressions and gestures. Screen sharing features make it possible to show
pictures, text, and videos while on a video call, which further expands the range
of modes available. However, there are still some significant limitations to video
conferencing, including the fact that participants aren't in a shared space, they
can't fully see each other, and there are often problems with sound or video quality
that can significantly interfere with the conversation (Karl et al.). The minor lag that
occurs in video conferencing makes it more difficult to read the other person's
signals, which disrupts the normal flow of a conversation. What's more, following
the COVID-19 pandemic, many people complained of Zoom fatigue, related to the
fact that their facial expressions seemed to be under constant focus, and they have
to rely more on exaggerated gestures to get their meaning across (Drijvers and
Holler).
                                                                                                                                         MULTIMODALITY | 33

         However, while all messages automatically rely on a range of modes to create
meaning, the benefit of understanding multimodality is that you can be intentional
about the ways that you combine modes to engage audiences, clarify meaning, and
compel action. This is particularly true given the range of digital tools that allow you
to quickly and easily edit a video, create voice overs, and add music or snippets of
text to a video or animation. More than ever before, professional tools are available
to the masses to plan, create, edit, and disseminate multimodal messages, but what
sets apart an effective message from one that gets "swiped" could be the way
that multimodal elements are layered to create one coherent message that works
toward a clear purpose.

Multimodality as a Rhetorical Tool

The best way to think about multimodality is with a focus on rhetoric--the intended
audience for a particular message and the underlying purpose(s) of that message.
What is it that you hope an audience will do or think as a result of your message?
What tools are available in a given situation--whether in person or online--and
which ones would be most effective in enhancing your message or might be a
distraction or deterrence? As you've probably already figured out, combining
modes into a single, coherent message requires quite a bit of strategy, focusing on
the audience's expectations and predicting their questions and reactions. Layering
as many modes on top of one another as possible isn't a strategy. It would
overwhelm an audience and make it difficult for them to attend to all of the
different signals available. Pflaeging and Stöckl call this "multimodal rhetoric,"
defined as "functions and structures realized by and constructed in the strategic
conjunction of several semiotic modes, which ultimately carry rhetorical action."

         While there aren't any set rules on how to combine multimodal elements to
create an effective message, there are some important rhetorical considerations:

   · Who is the audience? What type of modes will be most effective in engaging
      their attention and helping them understand the message? It's also important
      to consider what particular element will be most effective. For instance, you
      might decide that a photo is appropriate for this audience, but not just any
      photo will engage their interest and persuade them to act. Considering the
      target audience and your message, you'd have to determine what type of
      picture will resonate with their experiences, values, and perspectives.
34 | MULTIMODALITY

   · What are the genre conventions? Each genre has its own set of standards
      that align with the audience's expectations. A TikTok viewer, for instance, is
      expecting a short video while someone on Instagram is likely to expect vivid
      and interesting photos.

   · What modes align most with your goals? For more complex content that
      might be harder for an audience to understand, pairing spoken words with
      bulleted text, charts, and other images can help them understand the
      information. If the main goal is persuasion, think about the types of
      content--whether it's a well-developed argument or a photo or a bar graph (or
      maybe all three)--that will be the most compelling.

   · How can you leverage various modes to invoke different appeals? Do you
      remember the different rhetorical appeals of logos, ethos, and pathos? As you
      integrate different types of content using various modes, you can strengthen
      the persuasive effect of your message in powerful ways. Depending on the
      content, the genre, and the audience, one type of appeal might be more
      appropriate than another. What's more, different modes work better with
      certain types of appeals. For instance, written and spoken words often work
      well with logos appeals while images and music are often more effective as
      pathos appeals.

   · Which modes are readily available on the platform you are using?
      Sometimes the affordances and constraints of a particular application will
      dictate some of the choices you will make.

   · What type of resources do you have available? Do you have high-resolution
      photos or quality footage that would be effective? Do you have the means to
      obtain or create these media? Obviously, you can only work with what you
      have, and it's always better to use high-quality, original materials than stock
      photos or something low-quality.

         The main idea is to think creatively and about how different modes might be
combined to convey a message, to persuade your target audience, and to compel
action. Truly effective digital communication utilizes a variety of communication
tools, requiring a deeper understanding of the rhetorical situation and the most
appropriate means of persuasion.

     Activity 10.2
                                                                                                                                   MULTIMODALITY | 35

For each of the following scenarios, consider the best method of communication (in-person,
text, email, social media post, etc.) and why. What modes are available to you in a given method
that would allow you to communicate more clearly and effectively?

     · You missed an important assignment in one of your classes, and you want to talk to the
        professor about how you can make up for that assignment.

     · You want to invite some of your friends to your birthday party, which is at a location they
        might not be familiar with.

     · You need more information about how to put together the new entertainment center you
        ordered.

     · You just got back from an amazing vacation in the Bahamas, and you want to encourage
        others to do something similar.

WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

   Cara Miller

The previous chapter identified some of the best practices for digital writing that
will help engage readers' interest and make it easier for them to pick out the main
ideas in a text. Most of those general principles are consistent across different web
genres, but the reality is that not all web writing is the same. Writing strategies and
accepted standards differ depending on what it is that you are writing--depending
on which genre. A genre is a type of writing, a category that can be distinguished
because it has certain qualities. Often when you think of a genre, you might think
of a type of literature--for instance, fantasy, science fiction, romance--and you can
tell which genre it is because of the type of story that it is and the way that the
plot unfolds. Or you might think about types of music--for example, country, rap,
heavy metal, classic rock. Again, you'd probably be able to identify the genre of a
song pretty quickly based on the melody, the instruments involved, and the lyrics.
Webster's Dictionary defines genre as a "category of artistic, musical, or literary
composition characterized by a particular style, form, or content." However, even
that definition is too narrow to accurately capture the idea of a genre because it
doesn't have to be "artistic" or "literary." A text message, for instance, is a genre
with defining qualities that separate it from other writing styles--the use of emojis,
acronyms, GIFs, and short conversational messages. Text messages tend to be
less formal, reserved for close family and friends, which helps dictate what is
appropriate. In contrast, a résumé is a completely different genre, written for a
different audience and purpose and with very different elements of format, tone,
and content. If you'd never written a résumé before, you'd have to learn how to
format your document appropriately and what type of information should be
included. You'd also pay attention to writing style and tone, which is more formal
and serious in nature. You'd never (hopefully) write a résumé with emojis, text
acronyms, or memes. Your résumé wouldn't be taken seriously.

         In a similar way, there are a variety of web genres with specific features that
help distinguish one from another, and those features correspond with particular
purposes and audience expectations. In fact, like all rhetorical considerations, your
40 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

selection of genre and your choice to follow certain genre conventions relate
directly to your purpose and audience. The School of Writing, Literature, and Film
at Oregon State University calls genre a "typified rhetorical action," meaning that
certain features are repeated across different genres "because audiences expect
certain things to happen or they want certain kinds of experiences" (Pflugfelder).
In other words, the audience is more receptive to a message when it follows
conventional patterns that they are familiar with. While there might certainly be
occasions to stray from particular genre conventions in specific rhetorical
situations, following the accepted standards helps build your credibility with the
audience, enhances readers' understanding of the message, and increases the
chances that the audience will respond favorably.

         This chapter takes a closer look at the most common web genres and the
conventions and rhetorical considerations of each one. It also provides a deeper
explanation of genre convention, which will allow you to identify these conventions
in other types of writing that aren't discussed here. The main idea is to consider the
audience's needs and expectations and how certain conventions will create more
positive and compelling reader experiences.

     Learning Objectives

          · Understand what a genre convention is and how it is used to meet rhetorical objectives.
          · Think deeper about the social function of genre conventions and the ways that they aid in

             the reader's experience with a text.
          · Identify the conventions of writing genres that you are familiar with and be able to apply

             the concept of genre convention to genres that may be new to you.
          · Understand the rhetorical functions of a website and how individual components of a

             website work toward these larger goals.
          · Learn the specific genre conventions of a website and how each one aids in the reader

             experience and helps move them through the customer journey.
          · Learn content strategies for other types of digital writing, including blogs, social media

             posts, and email campaigns. Be able to identify the conventions of each genre.
          · Consider ways to learn the conventions of other, more specialized genres that you

             encounter.

Defining Genre Convention

Before we look at specific web genres, it might be helpful to take a closer look at
genre conventions in general and why they are so important for all kinds of writing.
If a genre is a particular category of writing, then a genre convention is a particular
feature that is definitive of that genre, helping readers to easily understand what it
is and how it should be read. You might remember from chapter 8 in this textbook
that rhetoric is inherently social. It facilitates human relationships and activities,
which is why so much emphasis is placed on the audience. A genre is also social.
New genres emerge alongside new technologies and new ways of interacting with
other people. An X post, for instance, is a relatively new genre that has expanded the
ways people can communicate and the variety of audiences they can communicate
with. It enhances communication, and because it continues to address specific
needs, people still use it. In contrast, handwritten letters and postcards, though
not completely out of fashion, aren't nearly as popular as they once were because
new genres (and technologies) have taken their place. They aren't needed because
newer and faster ways of communicating are available.

         So when we consider various genres and the conventions that define each
one, it's helpful to think more deeply about their social function--the activity or
type of communication that a particular genre affords. In discussing the rhetorical
interplay between genre and medium, the Purdue OWL explains that "genre is
a form of writing with set functions determined by its social need" ("Genre and
Medium"). For instance, a grocery list developed out of the need to remember a
large number of items that you need to purchase, and so the list--along with its
classic convention of short, bulleted items, separated on different lines--emerged
as a way to quickly and easily identify the things you want to purchase.

         Perhaps the social function of a genre and its corresponding conventions
becomes easiest to understand when we consider a genre that doesn't follow the
standard convention. What if you were asked by a friend to go to the store to
purchase a few items, and they handed you a grocery list they had created, but
instead of following the typical format of each item on a separate line, their "list" had
everything running together so that it looked more like a paragraph. And instead of
having just the name of each item they need, they wrote everything out in sentence
form, explaining more about the item and why they need it. You'd have an entire
page full of words, and it would be incredibly difficult to pick out the items on
their list. It would take you a long time to read through everything, and because
42 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

everything is run together, chances are that you'd miss some of the things on their
list.

         Another classic example of genre is the job résumé. Obviously, the content
of a résumé is very personal, tailored to highlight individual qualifications and
experiences and also adapted to a specific audience/employer. You might also have
noticed if you have used some sort of template to create your own résumé that
the layout might change slightly depending on your design preferences and the
types of information that you want to highlight. However, there are some basic
features that all résumés have in common. You can probably name several off the
top of your head. They are typically written in black type with a legible font like
Arial or Times New Roman. They have the person's name and contact information
at the top. They have clear headings for professional experience, education, special
skills, and references. They are short, typically no longer than a single page. These
are fairly simple conventions, but they are important. They facilitate the rhetorical
purpose of the résumé by making it easier to quickly highlight key qualifications
and skills that will be persuasive to an employer. They also make it easier to write
the résumé, since the formatting and basic content are already established. What's
more, these genre conventions make it easier for the audience to read and interpret
the résumé. Assuming an employer would be familiar with the genre of a résumé,
they can quickly scan the document and easily pick out key information that will
help them move forward in the decision-making process.

         As you can see, a single genre often includes several conventions that make
it distinct, and these conventions include a lot of different elements including
formatting, tone, organizational structure, and the content itself. Understanding
the underlying reason for various conventions and how they aid in the reader
experience will enhance your writing in a few different ways. First of all, it will be
more readable because it adheres to writing patterns that readers are familiar with,
so they can more easily pick out your main ideas. Any time you come across a
new genre, you will likely struggle at first to understand what the conventions are
and how to adapt your writing so that it seems authentic but still adheres to the
audience's expectations. However, cultivating an awareness of genre will help you
make this transition, as it will play a key role in the writing and revision processes.
Second, genres provide greater opportunity for creativity and deep critical thinking.
That might seem counterintuitive given that genres create parameters that seem
to limit your creative options, but the reality is that a genre is a productive lens
that guides your writing and thinking process. In terms of the rhetorical situation,
genres are created to meet particular purposes that respond to certain exigencies;
                                                                                                                WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB | 43

therefore, focusing on the genre conventions will enhance your ability to write
something meaningful. Finally, following genre conventions increases your
credibility because it signals to readers that you are experienced in this genre and
have thought about their needs and expectations. Even conventions that seem
relatively minor will demonstrate your expertise and attention to detail, which will
go a long way to spark goodwill and similar generosity in your audience.

     Activity 13.1

     Make a list of all of the different genres that you write in each day. This might include anything
     from the more mundane texts, such as lists or text messages, to documents that are longer and
     more complex. Which genres are you most familiar with? Which ones are you still learning? See
     if you can identify the social function of each genre.
     Now pick one or two of the genres from your list and see how many conventions you can list for
     each one. Be sure to include formatting rules as well as conventions related to formality, tone,
     organizational structure, and content. How do these conventions aid in the readability of texts in
     that genre?

Emails

We'll begin with a genre that most people are already familiar with--the email.
From a rhetorical standpoint, your approach to an email depends largely on the
context of your message--who your audience is and the subject of your email--but
generally speaking, emails are considered more formal than text messages and
should avoid being overly informal or using "texty" language and emojis. From a
professional standpoint, there are a couple of different types of emails that you
might have to write. The first and most obvious is a work-related email to a
colleague, client, or vendor, in which case you obviously want to be friendly but
also to the point. Just like other types of digital writing, emails should be fairly
brief if possible with content broken down into individual paragraphs and bulleted
information for enhanced readability. You might also need to hyperlink to websites
and other documents that are pertinent to the conversation. You'd probably also
44 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

have some sort of call to action (CTA) at the end, even if just to invite that person
to let you know if they have more questions or to request that they get back to you
about a specific question or issue.

         The second type of professional email is a marketing tool, a message that is
part of a targeted campaign, and it's a way of reaching out individually to leads that
your company has acquired. Remember that one of the functions of a website is to
generate leads. Companies then use that list of current and prospective customers
to send targeted emails, often giving them more information about a specific
promotion, letting them know that the latest blog post is available, inviting them to
an event, and so on. Obviously, these types of emails can get annoying, and people
will quickly "unsubscribe" or assign them to their spam folder if they don't find
the information to be useful. That's why you should be very intentional about the
type of content (and how much content) that you send and focus on the leads that
have expressed genuine interest in your organization. For emails that are part of a
concerted marketing campaign, several genre conventions can be applied:

   · Have a clear subject line. Just like blog articles and social media posts will
      engage attention with a specific and catchy title, so will an email title. Since
      most people get hundreds of emails each day, you want to create a title that
      will grab their attention and says something specific about what the message
      entails. While different email platforms vary, you'd generally want your title to
      be shorter than 60 characters so it doesn't get cut off.

   · Write preview text. Some email platforms also show preview text, sort of like a
      subtitle that provides additional information or a slightly different hook,
      typically 45 characters or less (Slater).

   · Keep it short. Once again, less is more. A couple of short paragraphs are all you
      really have to engage the reader so that they understand the value of what you
      are offering and feel compelled to take action.

   · Have a clear CTA. Since these emails are often used as an internal marketing
      tool to draw people to your site, the call to action does just that. It prompts
      readers to click a link so they can read the new blog article, get more
      information about a product or event, and so on.

   · Provide contact information. A professional signature should include the
      sender's name, company logo, phone number, and email address so that the
      reader can easily follow up with questions.

Websites

Almost all businesses maintain a website as the "front door" to their organization,
realizing that before most customers set foot in the store (if there is a physical
space), they will go to the website to get information about store hours, products,
mission, and so on. It's the first impression most people will have about the
organization, so providing useful content, organizing information effectively, and
using rhetorical strategies to engage readers will create a positive user experience
and strengthen the organization's brand. Even individuals sometimes maintain
websites for personal or professional reasons, knowing that they will reach a much
wider audience and have access to design tools that will create a positive
connection.

         As we discuss the various other web genres--blogs, social media posts,
emails, and so on--it's important to keep in mind that these are often used as
collateral marketing tools that serve the primary function of guiding people back
to the website, where they can learn more information about a particular event or
product, make a purchase, schedule an appointment, and so on. Leland Dieno, an
entrepreneur and expert in digital marketing, says, "Your website is the center of
your digital ecosystem," meaning that everything else revolves around the content
you provide there. It's the place where users will go to find information, and if it's
organized well, it will create a clear path to help them learn about your organization
and respond positively to your call to action, whatever that might be. Kunjan Mehta
explains it like this:

    Web development can help you create a clear path for where you want your
    customers to go, how they will get there, and what the goals are for your
    audience. Everything else you do stems from these aspects and connects
    back to your website. No matter what else is involved with your digital
    ecosystem, the ultimate goal is to direct all online activity back to your
    website.

         Website development is a very big topic, and there are many nuances in
functionality (which continue to evolve quickly with new integrations and plugin
updates) and differences from one web platform to the next. Many businesses
pay web developing companies thousands of dollars to create and update their
website, but advancements in digital tools and user-friendly platforms have also
made it possible for people to create and maintain their own website--if they
are willing to take some time to learn how. While it's beyond the scope of this
textbook to discuss the "how-to" aspect of the different web hosting platforms,
46 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

there are numerous resources available that do. For instance, WebsiteBuilderInsider
has created a resource guide for web development that discusses many different
aspects of the planning stages (Brandon). There are also a number of articles online,
like this one by Niel Patel, that give an overview of the different website platforms
and the pros and cons of each one. Once you decide on a platform, there are also
numerous YouTube videos, created by the hosting services as well as experienced
users, to help you get started and to troubleshoot various issues.

         The main goal of this section of the textbook is to help you think more clearly
about the purpose of the website and how to develop content to help you meet that
purpose. We'll also discuss best practices in website design.

Functionality

A website has a number of different purposes, and while the specific functions of a
website will obviously vary from one circumstance to another, at its core, a website
is typically designed with five key purposes in mind:

  1. Attract visitors. One of the main functions of a website is to attract people's
      attention, to engage them with the information presented and the overall
      mission and service that is provided. We'll talk in more detail in the next
      chapter about SEO and ways to optimize a website so that users can easily find
      your web page. For right now, we'll focus on the idea of inbound marketing,
      which relates to strategies that web developers and content writers use to
      draw people to their sites (Hubspot). As opposed to outbound marketing
      tactics that push content out to a broad audience (think billboards, magazine
      ads, television commercials), inbound marketing works harder to identify the
      wants, needs, and values of the target audience and to create web content
      that is relevant to those expectations. As content is developed, there is special
      consideration given to users' pain points and the potential search terms
      (keywords) they might use to find information about how to solve those
      problems. This is one way that a website becomes "optimized" so that a
      website becomes easier to find and use (Fitzgerald). Other strategies include

          Creating unique meta descriptions for each web page. A meta description
            is the information that appears on the search engine results page (SERP)
            (Google Search Central), and it includes the URL, a title of the page that
            users can click on to get to the web page, and a "snippet" of text that gives
                                                                                                             WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB | 47

          a description of the content on that page (Riddall). By providing relevant
          and interesting information and a call to action, a website is much more
          likely to attract visitors. The image below is an example of a meta
          description of what a snippet might look like if you searched for the best
          beach destinations in the United States. It even includes a picture to entice
          visitors.

                                                                                                                 Woman Lying on
                                                                                                                 White Sand
                                                                                                                 Beach, by
                                                                                                                 Riccardo under a
                                                                                                                 Pexels license,
                                                                                                                 Snippet text by
                                                                                                                 Cara Miller.

        Creating meta tags for other content on the page--titles, alt tags for
          images and graphics, headers (Hughes).

        Creating a Google Business Profile that provides contact information,
          business hours, customer reviews, and other helpful information for
          potential customers (Caplan). It not only builds awareness about a
          business but also builds credibility and provides a path directly to the
          website.

2. Provide useful content. This goes hand in hand with the purpose listed
    above--to attract visitors. Many of the strategies used to attract visitors have to
    do with meta descriptions and strategies that make a website visible to
    potential customers. However, there are many SEO practices designed to
    mislead users so that it looks like a web page has relevant and interesting
    content. For instance, keyword stuffing is an attempt to rank higher on the
    SERP by continually repeating keywords and phrases over and over
    (BigCommerce Essentials). Even if this were to position a web page higher on
    the SERP (which it doesn't), it creates a negative user experience because a
    page that uses this strategy is often difficult to read and doesn't provide the
    types of information that a visitor is looking for. So they will very quickly
    bounce off the page. Successful content writers carefully consider the needs
    and expectations of their target audience. They think through the types of
    information that users will be looking for, the questions that they might have
    as they navigate the site, and they are intentional about making that
48 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

      information easy to find and easy to understand. In fact, a large part of an
      organization's content strategy revolves around pinpointing the type of
      content that users are looking for and making it easy to find (Forsey). This
      relates directly to the meta descriptions you provide for each page, but it also
      includes choices regarding website navigation, titles and subheadings, the way
      information is organized on a page, and the design choices you make. It also
      relates to the language you use and your effort to be upfront and specific. This
      will not only engage visitors but create a positive experience and help build
      trust with potential customers.
 3. Strengthen your brand. An obvious function of a website is to communicate
      the unique identity and mission of an organization to the audience. It's an
      opportunity to fully develop your story--the history of the organization, profiles
      of organizational leaders and staff members, the mission of the organization,
      customer testimonials, and so on. Remember that a brand is your image--the
      way that you want others to perceive you. It relates directly to the way that
      people perceive your values, personality, work ethic, community culture. When
      visitors have positive experiences and impressions on a website, it not only
      strengthens their perception of the organization, but it increases the chances
      that they will leave positive reviews, share information about the organization,
      and use their personal social media accounts to like, share, and repost content
      that will shape others' perceptions of the organization as well. Since we talked
      at length about branding in chapter 9, we won't rehash it here. Suffice it to say
      that an organization's efforts at branding can sometimes be explicit, related to
      things like its logo and tagline, mission statement, history, credentials and
      certifications, staff photos and profiles, charity involvement, and customer
      reviews. It can also relate to more subtle cues--how easy it is to find
      information on the website, how well information is organized, how company
      policies are communicated, the tone of the language and overall design, and
      of course, how satisfied customers are with the service they receive when they
      do engage with an organization.
 4. Prompt action. Remember that rhetorically, websites are developed with a
      purpose in mind--a particular way that the speaker wants the audience to
      respond. To that end, everything on the website should be working toward
      that end goal to compel readers to respond. However, an effective website will
      also give a call to action (CTA) that explicitly tells readers what they should do
      next and then points them in the right direction (Optimizely). Of course,
      different messages might have different CTAs depending on their purpose and
                                                                                                                WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB | 49

      where visitors might be in their buyer journey. Some CTAs might simply
      prompt readers to "read more" about a particular service or concept or to
      "schedule an appointment" or "get a free quote" to help move them forward in
      the buyer journey. Others might want readers to sign up for a newsletter, share
      something on social media, volunteer for an event, sign up for a free trial, or
      "buy now." Web pages that direct readers about what they should do next and
      provide a clear path to take that action are much more likely to meet their
      communication goals.
 5. Generate leads. It's probably not a first priority to collect contact information
      of potential customers, but one important function of a website is to generate
      leads so it's easy to communicate with current and potential customers about
      services, events, and product updates (Boyarsky). For instance, many websites
      have contact forms where users can put in their information (an email
      probably and maybe an email address or mailing address) in order to get more
      information or to receive a response about a question or problem. Other
      websites have pop-up windows inviting users to subscribe to a newsletter or
      sign up for a free trial. Using these and many other strategies, user information
      is collected and stored in a spreadsheet or a lead management platform that
      makes it easy to deliver content directly to users via email, text message, or
      mail. This can be a very effective way to drive more traffic to your website and
      create consistent engagement with people in your target market. On the other
      hand, many websites use deceptive strategies to collect user information
      (Baydin). Maybe a visitor wants to get more information about a product or
      service, but they are required to put in their email address in order to access
      that information. Deceptive lead generation strategies trick users into
      providing their contact information or they collect this information without
      user permission, through some sort of third-party organization that sells leads.
      That's when people receive what they consider to be spam emails and text
      messages and feel bombarded, even harassed, by marketing schemes they
      don't care about. Those are the types of experiences that create negative
      impressions and undermine the brand that you are trying to create.

Genre Conventions for a Website

Genre conventions are always connected to purpose, allowing readers to quickly
and easily engage with the ideas of a text. Website conventions are no exception.
However, a visitor arrives on a web page--via a Google search or a link on a social
50 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

media post or in an email--chances are they are looking for specific information.
They are interested in learning more about the product, service, mission, event, or
concept highlighted on that page, but as we've already discussed, most visitors
don't spend much time at all reading a web page. They scan headlines and
subheadings. They skim through bulleted lists. They might quickly scan the
navigation bar at the top. And if they don't find what they are looking for, they
will bounce away. The best practices for a website listed below are reader-centered,
geared toward engaging visitors and making it easy for them to quickly find the
information they need.

   · Streamline the content. Be selective as you prioritize the information on a
      page and the number of pages on a website. Though larger organizations
      might need larger websites with more menu items and web pages, big
      websites are often more difficult for users to navigate because there is more
      content to sift through, and it's often harder to find the information they are
      looking for. Having a streamlined site map with a few key menu items and
      shorter web pages that are easy to read will go a long way to keep readers
      engaged. In other words, sometimes less is more.

   · Put the most important information first on the page. This is called an
      inverted pyramid structure (Purdue OWL, "The Inverted Pyramid"). Putting the
      most important information first will help it stand out to readers, who can then
      read on to get more detailed information about that particular topic as they
      move down the page. However, if they have to scroll or if the key information is
      buried within large chunks of text, readers are much less likely to stay on the
      page. And if they don't stay to read the entire page (as most readers don't),
      then they will have at least gotten the main idea. Clearly labeled titles and
      subheadings (in larger, bold font than the rest of the text) will also help.

   · Be intentional about organization. According to The Web Project Guide,
      successful website organization entails three things: grouping like content
      together, creating a logical navigation system, and providing clear labels
      (Vilhauer et al.). Often a useful way to organize content on your website is
      through categories, where pages are grouped together because they have
      similar content. For instance, many websites have an "About" section on the
      main navigation menu at the top of the home page. This could include a drop-
      down menu with several content pages: mission statement, employee profiles,
      company history, and so on. Figuring out how similar items should be grouped
      together is the first step. Then you need to create a site map, demonstrating
                                                                                                           WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB | 51

  the organizational structure of your site and using clear menu labels. This
  Creately.com website provides free tools that allow users to create their own
  site map, or you can always draw it out on a piece of paper.
· Focus on readability. This includes all of the strategies that guide a reader
  through the content of a web page so it's easy for them to pick out the main
  idea: Headings, subheadings, bulleted lists, short paragraphs, simple sentence
  structures, and word choice that is clear and specific. Readability also relates to
  the formatting choices that you make. For instance, websites tend to use a font
  that is sans serif, which makes it easier to read. Similarly, higher-level text like
  titles and subtitles might be in bold and in a larger font than the rest of the
  text. Items should be spaced appropriately so that things aren't crammed
  together, but readers can still tell which items go together.
· Be specific. People visiting the site are looking for certain types of information
  about products, services, upcoming events, pricing, and so on. It's your job to
  carefully consider the information that readers are looking for and to provide
  that information so that it's clear. Readers will quickly become frustrated with
  vague, flowery text that doesn't really tell them anything. Product descriptions,
  for instance, would go beyond a list of adjectives to also include product
  dimensions, items that are included, capabilities, other outside items needed
  for use, and any other information that would help them determine whether
  they want to buy the product. Certainly, there's a balance between
  streamlining content and providing enough detail. The point is to use the
  space that you have to give content that is meaningful for readers, and to
  provide opportunities to get more information.
· Use hyperlinks. Hyperlinks help visitors make connections. This can be
  especially helpful as they are navigating your site. Internal links to relevant
  pages guide readers to more detailed information on your website about a
  specific topic. Similarly hyperlinks at the bottom of a web page that coincide
  with the call to action to schedule an appointment or get more information
  increase the likelihood of a user taking that action. External links to credible,
  relevant web pages are also useful in building your own credibility and
  providing important information to readers without taking up more room on
  the page. Obviously, you'd want to be strategic about hyperlinks, limiting the
  amount on a given page so readers aren't overwhelmed. You'd also want to be
  selective about the words that you choose for a hyperlink so that it's fairly clear
  what type of information readers will find if they follow the link. For example,
  let's say that a fitness blog has the following sentence: "There are many
52 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

      different methods for increasing your stamina during a workout." If the words
      "different methods" or "increasing your stamina" were hyperlinked (as
      evidenced by the telltale blue, underlined text), then readers would expect that
      it links to more information about what those methods are. On the other hand,
      if they are taken to a product page with running shoes for sale, they'd likely be
      confused and probably a little frustrated.
   · Use visuals. Consider the types of pictures and other images that will help
      engage readers. Visuals have several different purposes on a web page. On one
      hand, they can be used to help clarify information. A map or a pie graph, for
      instance, is a visual that can be used to support written content on a page and
      help readers more easily process that information. The same might be said for
      a table, chart, or photo. A company that sells cars, for instance, would obviously
      include pictures of the car that they are trying to sell so that readers have a
      clearer understanding of what it looks like. Visuals can also be used for
      branding--to help visitors get a clear sense of the personality or mission of a
      person or organization. For instance, a children's hospital would likely use
      photos of doctors working with children, particularly pictures where the
      children are smiling. These types of photos would go a long way to
      demonstrate the level of care and compassion the hospital provides. It would
      also be a very persuasive element that would make visitors more likely to bring
      their children to that hospital or to donate money. Visuals serve several
      different rhetorical functions, which is why they are so important to include on
      your website.
   · Think aesthetics. A website that is visually appealing is much more likely to
      engage readers. As discussed in chapter 10, various design elements can be
      used to help convey meaning. Color choice, font size, font design, graphics, and
      images can all be used to direct readers' attention and help them more easily
      read and understand the information. But design choices also affect the
      overall user experience and develop the ethos of the organization. According
      to this Crowdbotics article about the "Aesthetic of Modern Web Design," the
      aesthetics of a website includes the overall layout with different components,
      menus, buttons, images, icons, colors, fonts, and so on. It also incorporates
      interactive features, such as sounds, animations, and symbols. Together, these
      features create a user-friendly appearance and leave an impact on the
      intended audience.
   · Provide clear calls to action. Almost every page on a website has a call to
      action that explicitly invites users to take the next step to find out more
                                                                                                           WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB | 53

  information, to donate money, to buy a product, to read a full article, and so on.
  These might be as buttons or clear statements with a hyperlink at the bottom
  of the page.
· Keep content updated. One way to quickly lose credibility is to have
  information on your website that is clearly outdated. Maybe there are links that
  no longer work or information that is no longer relevant. Perhaps the calendar
  of events still hasn't been updated and still includes information from previous
  months. This is a cue for readers that maintaining the website isn't a big
  priority for you and that much of the information might not be accurate. In
  addition to updating the information, swapping out new pictures or videos is a
  great way to keep the website fresh, demonstrating an active online presence
  and an effort to continually engage with your target audience.

 Activity 13.2

 Identify a local organization or company that you are familiar with and write down a few things
 that you know about this company. What do they do? What do you think is their mission? What
 are some ways that you would describe this company's brand?
 Now visit the website and consider the messaging that is available there. How does the website
 develop the organization's brand? In what ways does it help visitors navigate the site? What key
 information is available on the site that would be important for first-time visitors?
 Now draw a rough sketch of the organization's site map. This should include the main menu
 items that are available from the home page as well as secondary and tertiary pages that stem
 from those menu items.
 How are content items organized into similar groupings? Does this make it easier to navigate
 the website? Are there any pages that seem to be missing or out of place?
 Finally, evaluate the site and its use of the genre conventions listed above. See if you can find an
 example of each genre convention and explain how you think this might be useful in helping the
 organization meet its overall communication goals.
54 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

Blogs

While blogs are often housed as part of a larger website and utilize similar genre
conventions, they are listed here as a separate genre because their rhetorical
function is a little different. For most organizations, the purpose of a blog is to
further develop their brand with the target audience, strengthen their credibility in
a particular area of expertise, solidify connections with readers through meaningful
content, and increase traffic to their website (Cardenas). One of the genre
conventions listed above for a website is to keep the content "fresh." However, this
might be difficult to do on the larger website since the overall mission and service
offerings aren't likely to change very often. Posting blog articles every week or so
is a great strategy for keeping the content fresh, offering readers new and relevant
information, and getting people to come back again and again to your website,
where they are more likely to not only read the article but also follow your call to
action at the end to get more information, share your blog post with others, or buy
a product.

         Before we get into the genre conventions of a blog post, let's talk about
niche. All successful blogs have a particular niche or an area of focus (Connell).
It helps build their brand as an expert in a particular field or topic, and it keeps
readers in the target audience, who are also interested in learning about that
particular topic, engaged. For instance, there are quite a few travel bloggers on
various platforms who write about their experiences in various travel destinations,
providing travel tips and an overview of things to do and see. Their "niche" is travel,
which means that if they suddenly began posting about DIY projects around the
house or gardening tips, their audience would be confused. Their brand as a travel
expert would be weakened by messaging that doesn't relate. This is a mistake
that many novice bloggers make--trying to write about a lot of different things,
which makes their blog somewhat eclectic and scattered. It might do a good
job demonstrating their own interests and experiences, which might engage that
person's immediate family and friends, but it won't be as effective in attracting
other followers.

         Obviously, whatever niche you pick should relate directly to your
brand--either your individual brand if you are developing your own website and
blog or your organizational brand. A hardware store, for instance, might develop a
blog around DIY projects and home repairs, which is a way of developing expertise
in that area and showcasing the products they have available for those jobs.
Readers get useful information about how to do these types of projects, and they
                                                                                                                WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB | 55

are more likely to visit the store to get individualized advice or buy specific tools.
Similarly, a daycare might focus on a blog about childhood development and best
practices for engaging with different age groups. A university might write a blog
about student success, with topics related to academics, financial aid, housing,
and so on. A local yoga studio might write a blog about different yoga techniques,
benefits, basic exercises, and underlying principles, which would be of great interest
to people who are interested in trying yoga. It provides them with useful content
and it positions the yoga studio as an expert in this area who is genuinely interested
in helping people be successful.

         While it's important to have a focused niche, you also want your topic
selection to be broad enough that there are lots of new and interesting things to
write about in that area. That way, you can easily post a new blog article every week
or so. All of the examples above could be developed into very robust and dynamic
blogs because there is so much room to write about various topics. The university
blog about student success, for instance, is a very flexible niche. Blog articles could
be about time management, how to decode a syllabus, how to schedule classes,
how to understand graduation requirements, how to effectively study for an exam,
how to get a meaningful internship, and on and on. Specific article topics in that
larger niche would be never-ending and provide lots of meaningful information for
current students, prospective students, and parents, who would develop a deeper
connection with the university as they continue to engage with the blog. As you are
considering your own niche, a good test would be to see whether you can come
up with 10-15 article ideas within that niche. If you can't, it might be a sign that
your niche is too narrow and that you need to expand it a little more. For example,
student success is a lot more broad of a niche than study skills. DIY is a much
broader niche than window replacement. It might take some time to land on the
right niche that is narrow enough to build your brand and yet broad enough that
there are lots of things you could write about.

         Once the overall niche is established, there are several standard genre
conventions that most blog posts follow, which, once again, are directly related to
the primary goal of engaging readers and persuading them to take some sort of
action. Every genre convention is rhetorical in the fact that it influences the way that
a reader will respond to the message. Some important genre conventions for a blog
article include the following:

   · Stay focused. A blog article should clearly relate back to the niche you've
      established and it should stay focused on the topic that it advertises in the title
56 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

      and the introduction. While blogs come in varying lengths, some as short as
      300 words and others as long as 2,000 words, they should stay focused on the
      topic at hand and avoid unnecessary tangents. While longer blogs might
      spend more time developing background information or elaborating on each
      subpoint, everything should clearly work together to develop one main idea
      that you think will be of value to your target audience.
   · Chunk your content. While staying focused on one key idea, it's also useful for
      readers if blog articles are broken down into subsections with clear headings
      that make it easy to follow along with the structure of the article. For instance,
      a blog article about the cognitive benefits of yoga might begin with a brief
      hook about the obvious physical benefits of yoga and then transition into the
      little-known fact that it also benefits cognition. It might then have a section
      that defines "What Is Cognition," followed by subsections that identify some of
      the main cognitive benefits: "Improved Memory," "Better Focus," "Enhanced
      Problem-Solving." Each of these headings would help categorize different
      parts of the article so that it's easier to follow. Each section might then have
      three to five short paragraphs focused on that particular subtopic.
   · Be concise. Once again, you want to be concise with your writing. Keep
      paragraphs short with two to four sentences each. Use bullets when
      appropriate. Use simple sentence structures, and find ways to eliminate
      unnecessary words and phrases. Certainly, it might happen that you need to
      add words to your blog post to hit your desired word count (as blog articles
      should generally be consistent from one post to the next), but that doesn't
      mean filling up the article with "fluff." Instead, you'd add examples, statistics, or
      descriptions that add meaning and keep readers interested.
   · Have an engaging, specific title. Blog titles engage readers because they are
      clear about the value proposition--the thing that readers will gain from
      reading the article. For instance, an article titled "Ten Best Travel Destinations
      on the East Coast" or "Reduce Your Debt in Three Easy Steps" are both very
      specific titles that tell readers exactly what the articles are about and how
      readers will benefit from reading them. This, in turn, is more likely to attract
      readers than titles that are vague or obscure.
   · Use hyperlinks. Your blog article should be well researched and be transparent
      about where your information came from. Yes, you are building your own
      brand as an expert in a particular area, but it also greatly enhances your own
      credibility when you are able to link to other credible sources that support your
      ideas. The key word here is "credible," meaning that you might connect to a
                                                                                                           WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB | 57

  recent study, a reputable organization, another well-known expert, a recent
  new article, and so on. You wouldn't link to content that is old or where it is
  difficult to identify who the author is. You'd also avoid websites with a clear
  financial motive or bias. You might also avoid linking to a competing blog or
  company website that might steal readers' focus. Hyperlinks can also be used
  internally as a way to link readers to relevant information on the website or
  previous blog articles about a particular topic. You'd want to be sparing with
  this to avoid too much self-promotion and writing that comes across as
  disingenuous, but a couple of internal links here and there could be useful to
  further engage readers.
· Write in a friendly, conversational tone. Blogs are generally less formal than
  the content of an organization's website, which gives you the freedom to be
  more conversational. This is a great way to engage readers and build a rapport.
  If done well, it can also help develop your brand in particular ways. Generally
  speaking, a more conversational tone is more accessible. You'd avoid jargon
  and long-winded complex sentences that might otherwise come across as
  pretentious. You'd also have the opportunity to use language that's a little
  more lighthearted and fun. However, you'd still want to maintain a level of
  professionalism, maintaining a focus on the main idea of the article and
  providing relevant information and hyperlinks to supporting information.
  Depending on the context, you might also want to avoid first person, which is
  completely appropriate for a personal blog but would come across as
  confusing and a little too informal for an organization's blog.
· Post pictures and other visuals. Once again, pictures that are relevant to the
  content provided can be a great way of engaging readers and deepening their
  level of understanding. Charts, tables, and other graphics can also be a great
  way to break up written text.
· Proofread. Yes, a blog is more informal, but that doesn't mean you can relax
  your standards for correct grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.
  Proofreading errors can be incredibly distracting, making it difficult to
  understand a text and diminishing the credibility of the author. Do your due
  diligence and proofread carefully.
· Update often. While other parts of a website tend to be more static, meaning
  they aren't updated very often, a blog is meant to be dynamic with new
  content added consistently. Be sure to date your blog posts and provide new
  content every couple of weeks. This is crucial to reader engagement as well as
  other communication goals related to branding, increased traffic to your
58 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

      website, and the overall customer journey.
   · End with a CTA. Remember that a lot of digital messaging ends with a call to

      action, explicitly directing readers to the next steps they should take and
      providing a clear path to take that action, usually in the form of a hyperlink.
      Many companies have boilerplate information that goes at the bottom of a
      blog article, meaning that it's repeated word-for-word every time, perhaps
      reminding readers of their overall mission, the ways that they can help
      customers with specific tasks, and directing them to resources where they can
      find more information and get in touch with an associate.

Social Media Posts

You're probably familiar with the ways that individuals use social media platforms
to post personal updates and photos, documenting important events or finding
ways to connect with a larger group of family members and friends. While chapter
2 in this textbook dives into the positive and negative effects of social media usage
from a personal perspective, this section focuses more on the genre conventions of
social media posts from a professional perspective. Not surprisingly, the majority of
businesses both large and small use social media as a key aspect of their marketing
strategy because it's a quick and inexpensive way to engage with customers, and
it leverages algorithms and user-driven data to provide targeted marketing to the
people who are most likely to be interested in their products and services (Turner).
Also, as the LinkedIn article by Josh Turner confirms, the advantages go both ways.
Customers also benefit from the ability to quickly connect with a business, and
it affords a platform for them to share useful content and reviews with their own
followers.

         One reason that social media marketing is so popular is because it's an
incredibly effective way to reach people in the target audience with updates and
engaging content that will (ideally) drive them to the website. Thus, companies
are very intentional about their social media presence, selecting platforms where
their target audience is likely to be and planning out content that will effectively
grab their attention. Since there are literally hundreds of social media platforms, it
doesn't make sense that an organization would have an account on every single
one. Instead, they'd do some research into the target market to find out which
social media sites are most popular (Dean) and how certain demographics tend to
use which platforms (Barnhart). For instance, a yoga studio would probably be most
                                                                                                                WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB | 59

interested in targeting women in their thirties and forties, so they would focus on
the social media platforms that women in their target market use.

         Another key aspect of social media marketing is consistency. Some
businesses post on social media every day in order to continuously engage with
new and existing customers. However, they need meaningful content to post. That's
why many organizations create a social media calendar where they plan out the
content they will post for the next month, often to promote upcoming events
or report on recent organizational news (Kenan). However, to fill in the gaps in
between events, many organizations will utilize content buckets, where they
consider the different types of content they want to feature each month
(Chickering). For instance, one bucket might be employee profiles, another bucket
could be customer testimonials, and yet another bucket could be product
highlights or an expert tip of some kind. However many buckets there are, content
would be created so that a certain number of posts go into each bucket and then
are placed on the monthly calendar to ensure that there are a variety of posts with
unique content from one day to the next.

         Finally, social media posts must be appropriate for the specific platform.
For instance, LinkedIn is a social media platform geared toward professional
advancement, highlighting career opportunities and professional development, so
it wouldn't be an appropriate place to highlight the latest yoga technique. The same
goes for platforms like Tinder or Flixster. The content of your post should match
the overall theme of the platform. Similarly, you'd want to match the specific genre
conventions of a specific platform. There are far too many to list out here, so some
general guidelines are listed below. Before posting on a social media platform you
aren't familiar with, you should get a clear sense of the types of the format that is
most appropriate. X and Facebook, for instance, are more conducive to text-based
posts, while Instagram is focused more on photos. YouTube is obviously geared
toward videos. While you want your message to stand out to your target audience
in a positive way, creating messaging that isn't appropriate for a given platform will
likely create confusion and weaken your credibility.

         Specific platforms aside, there are some best practices for social media posts
that span across all platforms:

   · Be concise. Yes, this is a theme across all digital writing, but it's especially true
      for social media platforms where readers tend to continuously scroll through
      their feed. You want to catch their attention right away and make it easy for
      them to quickly get the main idea of your post--probably in a sentence or two.
60 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

      X is a good example of a platform that limits the amount of characters you can
      use for each post, pushing users to be as succinct as possible. Other platforms
      don't impose those limits, but they do collapse longer posts so that users have
      to click "read more" to see the entire post. Often readers don't, and if they do,
      they will quickly move on if they are confronted with a wall of text.
   · Use hashtags. You probably don't want to overdo it with 7 to 10 hashtags, but
      having two or three hashtags (indicated by the # symbol) is a great way to
      connect the content of your post to other groups and to spread your message
      to larger audiences. Most platforms have a way for you to research popular
      hashtags for given topics so that you can use them appropriately.
   · Title your post. Individual social media posts don't usually have a title, but
      professional posts often do because it focuses readers' attention and provides
      the same value proposition that a blog title does.
   · Use appealing images. Readers are more likely to read your post if you engage
      their interest with a picture. For instance, a travel agency that posts an ad
      about "Affordable Beach Bungalows" would probably garner a lot more
      interest if they featured tropical pictures of happy vacationers lounging on
      their own bungalows. Some posts also use short videos and influencer
      testimonials to grab people's attention.
   · Give full URLs. Unless you have a button at the bottom of the post (which is
      often a good idea), social media platforms don't use hyperlinks. If you want to
      link to a website, you have to give the full URL.
   · Give a call to action. Once again, social media posts often give a call to action
      for people to learn more, which often links to a website or email address.
   · Be engaged. As people in your audience engage with your post, commenting
      on the content, asking questions, giving reviews, then you should occasionally
      respond. You might not be able to respond to every single comment, but your
      presence will create a positive impression that you are genuinely interested in
      connecting with people. You might also receive more likes and followers if you
      are intentional about making connections with other people and
      organizations that are in your community or that are somehow
      complementary to your organization. They, in turn, would be more compelled
      to follow, like, and share your social media posts.
               WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB | 61

Activity 13.3

     Do a little bit of research about a company and its digital marketing efforts. This could be the
     same company that you selected for the website activity above or it could be something
     different, but it should be an organization that has a large enough digital media presence that it
     has a blog as well as social media accounts on a couple of different platforms. It might also be
     a company that you receive emails (or text messages) from, so you get a larger sense of this
     company's content strategy.
     What strikes you about the consistency across these digital messages? In what ways are they
     similar or obviously working toward similar purposes? How do they link to one another? What
     makes each piece distinct? And how do specific genre conventions aid in reader engagement
     and readability.
     Now create another piece of collateral messaging for this company--perhaps a social media
     post or an email about an upcoming event or sale. You could also consider additional topics for
     the company's blog and maybe even outline one. Do your best to fit in with the established brand
     of this organization and to follow the genre conventions outlined above.

A Final Note about Genre

Of course, this chapter didn't cover every digital writing genre. There are simply
too many to cover. What's more, the idea of genre gets even more complex when
you consider the countless genres in specialized fields. For instance, while there are
some basic principles that hold true for all websites, there are also different types of
websites that have their own set of conventions. A university website, for instance, is
substantially different from that of a restaurant, local charity, or used car dealership.
A university would obviously post pictures of campus life, give details about the
application process, and post specialized information about different majors and
graduation requirements. When you look across a bunch of different university
websites, you'll see that most of them are organized in very similar ways and that
they use very similar language to explain these concepts. Another example might
62 | WRITING THE GENRES OF THE WEB

be fitness blogs or churches' Facebook posts. These too will be unique, having
particular qualities that are unique that that more narrowed genre.

         The point is that if you are confronted with a genre that you aren't familiar
with--as will probably happen at some point--then you can easily gather
information from other examples in that genre and evaluate which elements seem
to define it. What types of content are typical? What about graphic elements? Tone
of voice? Design elements? Organizational structures? Once you understand the
concept of genre, then you can evaluate new forms of writing and apply those
genre conventions with confidence.

     Discussion Questions

        1. What is a genre? What is the purpose of identifying standard elements of a particular
             genre? How do you think understanding genre can help you become a better writer?

        2. Define a genre convention and give some examples from a genre of your choosing. How
             do specific conventions aid the reader's experience and facilitate larger rhetorical goals?

        3. What does it mean to say that a genre convention serves a social function?
        4. What are the major rhetorical functions of a website? Give examples to show how specific

             elements on a typical website work toward these larger goals.
        5. Identify the primary genre conventions for a website. Which ones were you already

             familiar with? Which ones are new or perhaps less obvious?
        6. What does it mean that a blog writer usually develops a niche? How does this relate to

             things like branding and audience engagement?
        7. Why is social media marketing so popular for many businesses? What are some content

             strategies that help keep audiences engaged?
        8. Name some of the genre conventions that are consistent across different forms of digital

             writing. Which ones are unique to genres such as emails, blog posts, and social media
             posts?
        9. How can you apply the concept of genre conventions in order to learn to write effectively
             in new genres as they emerge?

BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES

   Cara Miller

An important concept in the world of digital writing is the user experience (UX),
which the Nielsen Norman Group defines as "all aspects of the end user's
interaction with the company, its services, and its products" (Norman and Nielsen).
This is obviously a broad area that extends beyond content writing. It includes
things like market research, product design, price structures, customer service, and
even the larger organizational structure in place to optimize workflow and attend to
specific customer needs. However, as we've discussed in previous chapters, the user
experience usually begins online when someone in the target market first lands
on the organization's website. There are lots of things that have attracted them to
the site--a social media ad, a flier they received the mail, a meta description on
their search engine results page (SERP). Whatever it might have been, it sparked an
interest, probably related to some sort of problem or desire that this person wants
to address. And as we've also discussed previously, once they are on the website, it
takes only a few seconds for them to judge whether or not the potential reward is
worth their effort. (See System 1 and System 2 discussion in chapter 12). And while
this snap decision happens quickly, it's actually a pretty nuanced decision-making
process based on a number of visual cues--colors, pictures, navigation menu, page
layout and readability, and so on. Several design elements come together to create
an impression in the user's mind about the company itself, about how relevant their
offerings are to the user's needs, and about how easy or difficult it will be to get the
information they are looking for.

         All of this relates to design--how things are organized to enhance the user
experience and create a positive impression, which in turn increases their chances
of staying on the page longer, navigating through other pages of the website, and
progressing through the various stages of the customer journey. (Hopefully, you are
making the connection back to our unit on rhetoric: purpose, audience, message.)
Not every person who lands on a web page will fit into the target audience,
primarily because the service, product, or experience being offered doesn't match
their needs; but for those who are in the target audience, engaging their attention
                                                                                                                           BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES | 67

is directly related to rhetorical strategy. Yes, this is about word choice and
organization of written content, but it's also so much more. In fact, the concept of
"design" could be taken a couple of different ways. On the one hand, web design
encompasses the organizational structure and functionality of a website--how
pages are organized in similar groupings on the navigation menu, how easy it is
to navigate from one page to the next, how hyperlinks and buttons are used to
direct users to specific information. It also relates to the usability of the website so
that pages load quickly and so that structures are in place to aid users in specific
tasks, whether that be filling out a form or making a purchase. Effective web
design makes these processes intuitive for users and provides useful feedback
along the way, maybe to show what they have in their shopping cart or to generate
a receipt and tracking number for their purchase. Obviously, this type of web design
is complex, and it extends outside the scope of this textbook on digital writing;
nevertheless, it's an important topic that directly relates to the overall success of
a website. Content writers and web designers often work very closely together to
create effective messaging, and it's helpful for writers to have a sense of this bigger
picture. This web design guide from Adobe (Babich) is a good place to start, as is
this LinkedIn article by Andy Crestodina.

         On the other hand, design can also include visual elements and page layout.
While this is certainly relevant to the aesthetics of a page, these design
considerations go beyond the simple purpose of making something look good.
When done well, the visual design of a page adds to the readability of the content,
creates emotional connections with the audience, builds trust, and has a significant
impact on the user experience. Consider the difference between a simple web page
with black font on a white background and a page that has color, bold headings,
pictures, buttons, and graphics. Even if the written content were exactly the same,
users would be much more likely to engage with the page that has more dynamic
design elements because it's more interesting and readable, and it comes across as
more professional.

         This chapter focuses on these visual elements of design that enhance digital
writing and facilitate a more positive user experience. In particular, we will look at
principles of design that should guide some of your choices when it comes to the
overall layout of a page and the way specific visual elements work together to focus
the user's attention and hold their interest. The goal is to be able to apply these
principles to your digital writing projects, ranging from the simple structure of an
email or social media post to something more advanced like a blog or web page.

From Content Strategy to Page Design

As always, it's important to keep in mind two critical aspects of your message as
you begin designing the layout: your audience and your purpose. These two things
should be at the forefront of your mind as you make design choices. Specifically,
what do you want your audience to know after reading this page? What do you
want them to do? A successful designer will think carefully about these rhetorical
purposes and use basic design principles to engage the audience's attention, to
draw their eyes to certain parts of the page, and to create a sense of order and
direction that helps the reader process the information and follow the steps you've
outlined for them. In this section, we'll look at the fundamental principles of design
and the different ways they might be applied to a web page, blog post, or social
media ad. Then in the next sections, we'll drill down to consider some of the design
strategies that are particular to digital writing.
                BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES | 69

Page Structure

Often the first design decision relates to the bigger picture of the overall page
structure--which different elements (or modes, if you think back to our chapter
on multimodality) will be placed on the page and where they will go. While the
layout of a page is partially about aesthetics and creating a positive first impression,
it's also about usability. Your job is to direct the reader's attention to the most
important items on the page and help guide their process for taking in information
and responding appropriately to key prompts. Remember that design principles
are based on the user experience--how people perceive the meaning of a message
based on the selection and arrangement of design elements. In this Elementor
blog post, Alina Khazanova reminds us that design principles are based on research
in the areas of psychology and behavioral science (among others), which provide
insight into the cognitive process of a user and the design strategies that will
increase their likelihood of engaging with your message. With that in mind, there
are several design principles that should inform the way that you structure
elements on a page:

· Limit the amount of information on the page. Too much information
  becomes overwhelming for readers and limits their ability to respond
  appropriately. Think about the key purpose of the page, and highlight the
  most important information related to that purpose. If there are several pieces
  of information on the page, then consider how they might be "chunked"
  together to help readers more easily process the information.

· Emphasize the most important information. This goes hand in hand with the
  principle of visual hierarchy, discussed below. It's important to draw readers'
  attention to key ideas and action items. Readers are more likely to pay
  attention to things that are higher up on the page, bigger, and set apart from
  other information through spacing or color contrast.

· Stick with what readers know. Khazanova suggests using "familiar scenarios
  and logic" that will make a page more intuitive for readers, who are used to
  certain page structures and design elements. This allows them to focus less on
  trying to understand how your web page works and more on the information
  you've provided. For instance, most users would expect the navigation menu
  to be at the top of the page and to be the same from one page to the next.
  They'd expect appropriate spacing and sizing of information, so it's easy to tell
  how things are connected. They'd expect the call to action to be prominent
70 | BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES

      and clearly stated.
   · Create a page that has balance. According to Steven Bradley in this Smashing

      Magazine article, "Balancing a composition involves arranging both positive
      elements and negative space [white space] in such a way that no one area of
      the design overwhelms other areas." The elements work together to create a
      page that is visually pleasing and "stable." While some items on the page
      might have more "weight" because of their size and visual appeal, a balanced
      page arranges elements on the page so that, if there were a vertical line down
      the center of the page, both sides have equal weight, perhaps with several
      smaller elements on one side to balance a larger element on the other side.
      Bradley's article gives examples of both symmetrical and asymmetrical
      balance, along with some examples.

                                                                                                                  Ad layouts, by
                                                                                                                  JuralMin, on
                                                                                                                  Freerange under
                                                                                                                  Equalicense.

         Designers use several different techniques to plan out the overall layout of
a page. For instance, Paul Boag says that all websites operate on a grid system,
with evenly spaced columns and rows. This grid system helps with the alignment
of items on the page, which helps with balance and makes it easy to plan your
                                                                                                                           BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES | 71

layout. Similarly, designers also use wireframes to plan out the elements on the
page (Technology Transformation Services). This typically uses boxes (to represent
images) and dummy text to plan the placement of various elements on the page
and to get an overall impression of the layout before you invest time in putting it
together.

         For some examples of different types of page layouts, take another look at
Paul Boag's article on WebsiteSetup.org. It not only provides layout options, but it
explains how the different options fit with different types of content and purposes.

Visual Hierarchy

The visual hierarchy and overall structure of a design go hand in hand. While an
effective page structure creates visual appeal and makes the information easier to
navigate, visual hierarchy directs readers' attention to the most important elements
on the page, often because of their placement as well as their size. This is why
article titles are at the top of the page and the font is much bigger, often set off in
bold, colored lettering. Readers will see it first, and it helps frame their perception
of everything else on the page. Another thing that will draw readers' attention
to specific elements is contrast--setting an item apart visually using color and
negative space. For instance, call-to-action buttons are often set apart from the rest
of the text so they are easier to see, often using a button icon in black or some other
bright color that stands out against the background.

         Setting up a page with a clear visual hierarchy also improves readability
because it guides readers through the content, providing cues for what to pay
attention to first, second, and so forth, which improves their ability to quickly scan
the page. Once again, having a visual hierarchy that draws on familiar patterns will
help readers more quickly move through the information. Babich identifies the F-
shaped pattern and the Z-shaped pattern as two very common ways to organize
information on a page that fits with readers' "natural scanning patterns."

                              by Cara Miller (CC
                              BY)

Grouping Similar Items

Several of the Gestalt principles of design relate to the way people will naturally
group items together based on visual cues, which once again helps them
understand how items relate to each other and engage with the content of a page
more quickly. Let's look at some of those principles and how they affect the reader's
perception of content:

   · Proximity. According to the Gestalt principle of proximity, readers will naturally
      group items together if they are close to each other. Take, for instance, a photo
      caption, which is usually placed directly underneath the photo, close enough
      to it so that readers will naturally perceive it as being connected with the
      photo.

   · Common region. Similar to proximity, the principle of common region is about
      the way that items are grouped together because of the way they are set apart
      in a particular area--often in an enclosed box or with a background that is a
      different color than the rest of the page. The navigation menu for most
      websites is usually at the top, and the items are set apart in a different
      background color. Also many web pages are set up so that as users scroll, they
                                                                                                                           BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES | 73

      can quickly identify different content areas, which are set apart with different
      background colors.
   · Similarity. Finally, items will be perceived as similar if they have similar design
      features, perhaps with the same border, color scheme, and font. They would
      also be the same size so that readers perceive them as having equal weight.

         An example of how similar items might be grouped together might be
helpful. The USA.gov home page uses all of the elements discussed above to make
it immediately clear to readers how items relate to one another. The navigation
menu at the top is set apart in a white background, separated from the banner
graphic below. And because each of the menu items is close together and in the
same basic black font, it's clear right away what their purpose is and how they relate
to one another. Similarly, as you scroll down the page, different content items are
grouped together, and they are easy to spot because of the background shading
(the white box with "How do I..." for instance). Also, items within each grouping use
similar design elements, using the same font style and size as well as color choices.
The content section below, for instance, uses three pictures that are all the same
size, evenly spaced, and directly below the text that describes what each link is
about. This, in tandem with the "Life Events" heading that would naturally draw
readers' attention first, helps readers to clearly see the relationship between the
photos, which underscore the different ways the organization helps the community.

                              USA.gov (CC0)

Consistency

Many of the design principles we've already discussed relate to consistency (also
known as repetition) so that readers know what to expect and can easily read
and interpret the content provided. This relates to a lot of different choices, from
organizational structure to smaller design considerations like color, spacing, and
font. Perhaps the best way to think about the importance of consistency is to
imagine a page that isn't consistent--that uses different font shapes and sizes and
lots of different colors throughout. Not only would it be unattractive and difficult
to determine what to look at first, but it would be harder to understand the
relationship between elements, as discussed above, because the similar features
that connect elements would be missing. Consistency also relates to the branding
of an organization. The website should be strategically designed using a color
scheme and design patterns that align with the overall image the organization is
trying to create, and using these same structures consistently within a page and
                                                                                                                           BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES | 75

from one page to the next helps develop that brand. Below are a few specific ways
to develop consistency:

   · Page structure and organization. As discussed above, you can create
      consistency by utilizing organizational patterns that readers are already
      familiar with, which will make your site more intuitive for users. Once you've
      decided on a structure, then you'd try to be consistent with that structure
      throughout. For instance, the navigation menu should be the same from one
      page to the next. If you have a blog with different articles, each article would
      be laid out in similar patterns.

   · Color scheme. Often the color scheme is consistent with other branding
      elements like the logo and other marketing materials so that everything looks
      like it goes together. Color is also an important element that can evoke
      readers' emotional responses, so it should be used appropriately to build the
      brand. A kids' laser tag facility would obviously use bright, electric colors to
      create a feeling of excitement in the audience. In contrast, a funeral home
      would obviously use more subtle, soft colors.

   · Font. Because readers group similar items together based on design choices,
      it's important to be consistent with font--page titles, headings, second-level
      headings. These would probably all be the same font style and color. Headings
      of equal importance would be the same font size with the same amount of
      spacing between.

   · Other design elements. Whatever treatment you give to one element, you
      should apply it to all similar elements. If, for instance, one of your call-to-action
      buttons is a black rectangle with sharp corners, they should all look like that so
      they are easier to spot. If one callout box has a drop shadow, they should all
      have drop shadows.
76 | BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES

                              Consistency, by
                              Cara Miller (CC
                              BY)

         While not everything on every page has to be exactly the same (see below
about variety), creating consistency between key elements makes the overall
design seem more unified, and it creates a more even and intuitive experience for
the user.

Variety

An effective design uses a variety of design elements to engage readers as well as
to clarify information. Chapter 10 in this textbook discussed multimodal messages
and the power that various modes--images, text, color, video, sound--have to help
clarify and enhance the meaning of a message. For that reason, and because it's
more visually appealing and interesting, you should think about how to use a variety
of elements to draw readers' attention.

         Importantly, you can still be consistent while drawing on a variety of design
elements. Take color, for instance: a web page would be boring and more difficult
to read if it were just one color throughout. However, if you use the same two or
three colors consistently--across various types of texts and content areas--then you
have a variety of colors that direct readers' attention without being overwhelming.
Another way to use variety is through imagery, breaking up text blocks with photos
                                                                                                                           BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES | 77

and other graphics elements (icons, pie charts, tables, cartoons) that are relevant
to the overall message and that help inform the readers' interpretation of the
message.

         Once again, it's important not to go overboard. When too many things are
happening on a page, it's overwhelming for readers. Nothing is emphasized
because there are too many elements to look at. Being strategic about the
elements that should go on a page and how to utilize variety with a couple of
different modes of communication will go a long way.

Quality

It should probably go without saying that the elements that you do include on a
page should be high quality, creating a professional look and feel. This relates to
all of the design principles we've discussed up to this point, but here let's focus
specifically on pictures and videos. A quality photo, for instance, is one that is in
focus and is a high enough resolution so that it isn't pixelated or blurry. It has a clear
focal point with the image positioned appropriately, so that it fits comfortably into
the frame. There wouldn't be anything in the foreground or in the background that
would create a distraction. If you've taken very many candid photos, you know that
this is easier said than done. We often take photos that are slightly out of focus or
where the lighting is off, so there isn't a good view of a person's face. Fortunately,
there are photo editing tools that can help with some of these issues, but it's better
to start with a high-quality image. The main point is to only include the best photos
on your website or digital design.

         The same thing can be said for videos, which are an increasingly common
way to engage visitors either on a website or through social media. Videos can be
an excellent tool because they provide clear visuals that can help viewers see a
particular process, event, or product. They can also create emotional connections as
viewers see people's faces and hear their voices. However, there's a lot that goes into
creating an effective video that reduces background noise, that creates interesting
and dynamic scenes, that avoids "dead air" or transitions that are too slow as well
as camera movements that are too fast or wobbly, that uses effective voice overs
and sound effects, that has the appropriate lighting, that effectively integrates text
and other visual elements, and so on. Once again, video editing tools have evolved
significantly in the last few years, which makes it possible for anyone to enhance the
quality of the videos they put online. There are also plenty of YouTube videos--for
video editing as well as photo editing techniques.

     Activity 14.1

     Let's put some of the design principles listed above into action. Review the FedEx home
     page--or any other website of your choosing. You should go through the design principles listed
     above and consider how they are applied on the page. Which ones strike you as being the most
     effective in both engaging readers (both visually and emotionally) and helping them easily
     navigate the information on the page.
     Now reverse engineer the page by creating your own wireframe of the page structure. You can
     do this with a pencil and paper and really basic boxes and text blocks to represent the various
     elements.
     Now consider how the page might have been structured differently. Create a new wireframe that
     organizes the elements in a different way. Consider how you could utilize some of the other
     design principles listed above to engage readers in this new page design.

Other Design Theories

While this chapter isn't intended to be an exhaustive resource on visual design, it
would probably be helpful to at least mention some of the other design theories
that could be useful in your decision-making process as you put together the
visual elements of a web page, blog post, or digital ad. The principles listed above
are the most basic and also the most foundational design principles that can be
immediately applied to your digital writing and design projects. This section will
mention other prominent design theories that may provide a deeper
understanding of the audience perception and some of the nuances in your design
choices that can have a significant impact.

Gestalt Design Principles

Many of the principles identified above draw from Gestalt psychology, which is
the study of how people perceive design elements on a page to create meaning
(Encyclopedia Britannica). Gestalt theory looks at the entire layout of a design and
                                                                                                                           BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES | 79

considers the way that elements work together to create meaning. Thus, elements
aren't viewed in "isolation" but as contributors toward the entire message. There
are seven classic Gestalt principles, some of which we've already mentioned
(ManyPixels), but they are listed briefly again here so they can be viewed all
together:

   · Similarity. As already discussed, the principle of similarity helps readers group
      items together that have similar features. However, it can be used to make
      certain items stand apart from the group in some way.

   · Good figure of simplicity. Viewers will always reduce a complex design to its
      simplest form because it's easier to process. The ManyPixels blog uses the
      example of the Olympics logo, which most people will perceive as five
      overlapping circles as opposed to something more complex. This relates
      directly to the principles discussed above about limiting the amount of
      information and visual elements on the page. Simpler designs are much easier
      for readers to process and to remember.

   · Proximity. Viewers are more likely to group items together when they are near
      each other. This is a good way to demonstrate a relationship between these
      elements and also to make other elements--spaced further away--stand out.

   · Continuity. Our minds have the tendency to connect items if they follow the
      same line or curve. According to this principle, simply lining information up in
      a line from left to right or top to bottom, sometimes using actual lines or
      arrows to connect them, will help readers group items together and sequence
      how they process information.

   · Closure. For shapes and images that are disconnected in some way, viewers
      will automatically fill in the gaps so they can perceive the entire image. A
      classic example is a circle that is formed along a dotted line. Despite the fact
      that it isn't a closed circle, a viewer will automatically close the gaps to see the
      circle shape, instead of seeing a smattering of random dots.

   · Figure/ground. When looking at a picture or other page layout, we will
      immediately try to discern what is in the foreground (the figure or focal point
      of the picture) and what is in the background. Obviously, the more important
      items that you want viewers to pay attention to should be in the foreground,
      contrasted in some way from the background.

   · Common fate. This principle states that people will tend to group items
      together that seem to be moving in or pointing in the same direction. A simple
      example might be italicized text that is all pointing in the same direction. We'd
80 | BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES

      be more likely to see that text as connected together because of the common
      angle of the font.

                                                                   Gestalt Design
                                                                   Principles, by Cara
                                                                   Miller (CC BY)

Color Theory

There are lots of different ways to talk about color and the effect it can have on
the audience. For starters, there is a difference between hue (what we normally
think of as the color of something--e.g., green or blue) and other visual qualities,
such as shade (light or dark) and saturation (how pale or bright the color appears).
                                                                                                                           BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES | 81

Obviously, colors that are more vibrant--a brighter, more saturated color--will have
more visual weight and be more likely to draw the viewer's attention.

         Color theory also relates to the emotions that different colors evoke in the
audience. You probably already know that there are "warmer" colors like red,
orange, and yellow and "cooler" colors like blue, purple, and green. These colors
can be used strategically to enhance a message or the overall tone of a design.
Similarly, different colors are often associated with different meanings (Bowman).
Red is often associated with love, anger, or warmth. Yellow is often connected with
happiness and excitement. And so forth. Color choice can have a significant impact
on how a message is interpreted and the feelings that the audience associates with
that message.

         Finally, color theory focuses on the ways that colors work together to create
an overall visual impression or experience (Interaction Design Foundation). The
only way that one element would be emphasized using color is if other items
were de-emphasized with contrasting colors that were less vibrant. There are also
the dynamics of how different color combinations pair together to create
complementary (opposing) or analogous (similar) effects. The main goal is to use a
consistent color palette that has a variety of colors that work well together and to
use color strategically throughout the design to create emphasis. As always, color
choice is one key element in a much larger strategy to convey a particular message,
build your brand, engage viewers, and evoke particular responses.

Typography

As the name suggests, the study of typography relates to the way that text is
designed so that a message is both readable and interesting. While the particulars
of typography--the different classifications of fonts and the different parts of a
letter--can be quite detailed and specific (Bowers), here we will focus on the
primary considerations of typography, assuming that you will be making font
selections instead of creating your own.

         The main consideration when it comes to typography is readability. Obviously,
the text comprises an important part of the overall message, and you want readers
to be able to easily read it, from the largest headings and titles down to the smaller
text blocks. There are a few basic strategies that will make the font easier to read:

   · Size. Obviously, the bigger the font, the easier it is to read. As previously
      mentioned, your titles and headings will be larger than some of the other text
82 | BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES

      blocks and will therefore naturally pull readers' attention, but they should also
      be able to read the "smaller" print of an article or web page. A good rule of
      thumb for digital writing is to use 11-point font or larger. Of course, the size will
      vary depending on the context. If the text is going on a digital screen in an area
      where readers will be reading it from a distance, the font size will be
      significantly larger.
   · Font choice. As we'll discuss below, different fonts have different personalities
      that might enhance the emotional quality of your message, so it's probably
      okay to play around with different font styles for titles and ad copy where only
      a few words are selected and the font is relatively large. However, for larger
      blocks of text that require more sustained readability, it's much better to stick
      with a standard sans serif font, meaning that it doesn't have additional strokes
      and projections at the ends of a letter. For example, look at the two F's below.
      The one on the left is in a sans serif font, and the one on the right is in a serif
      font.

          As you can see, the serif font on the right has extra marks at the base and
       at the ends. While this might create a more formal look, it is harder to read,
       particularly for large text blocks in a smaller font. And obviously, the more
       pronounced and ornate the serfs become, utilizing lots of different swirls and
       other elements, the more difficult it would be to read.

   · Contrast. The final consideration with readability is about contrast, so that the
      lettering is set apart from the background enough so that it is easy to read.
      One of the biggest mistakes novice designers make is to use a font color that
      doesn't have enough contrast with the background--a light gray font on a
      white background, for instance, or red font on a black background. There has
      to be enough contrast so that the text easily stands out. You'd especially want
      to keep this in mind for text that goes over the top of an image. Once again,
      without the right contrast, it can be extremely difficult to read the text over an
      image. That's why many designers use the negative space of a picture, create
                                                                                                                           BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES | 83

      drop shadows around the text, or use text boxes--all of which can be used to
      increase the contrast so that the text stands out.

         The other consideration with typography is about the overall emotional
quality personality of various font styles and how they might be used to enhance
your message. Again, readability is key, so you wouldn't use different font
treatments for larger chunks of text, but for a title or a short line of ad copy, a unique
font can have a significant effect on the audience's interpretation. It might help
if you first consider the overall purpose and tone of the message, the impression
that you are trying to create in the mind of the reader, and that will likely guide
your font choices. Is the tone of the message serious? In that case, it might make
sense to go with a more traditional sans serif font. Are you trying to demonstrate the
elegance of a particular product or event? In that case, a more formal script font like
Edwardian would be more appropriate. On the other hand, if you want to invite a
bunch of children to a kid's birthday party, then you'd want a font that seems playful
and fun--Curlz, for instance. While there are lots of different fonts to choose from
that might create the right impression in your audience, there are definitely fonts
that would be the wrong choice. Consider, for instance, a wedding invitation that
is created in Curlz font. Instead of sending the message that the event would be
formal and sophisticated, the invitation would probably create some confusion and
maybe even some anxiety about what to expect.

     Activity 14.2

     Consider the list of messages below. What type of font do you think would be most appropriate
     for each one? Give an example for each one:

          · Job résumé
          · Yard sale sign
          · Graduation open house
          · Funeral bulletin
          · Ad for a neighborhood block party
          · Public service announcement about suicide awareness
84 | BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES

          · Course syllabus
          · Divorce papers
          · "Closeout" sale
          · Feel free to come up with your own

Special Considerations for Digital Design

As you put together designs that will be viewed on digital devices, there are a few
special considerations that enhance usability:

   · File sizes. We've already discussed the fact that you should only use quality
      images and videos to engage viewers, but the other side of that is that higher-
      resolution images and high-quality videos are usually really big files that take
      up precious storage space and often result in longer loading times, which can
      quickly frustrate impatient users. Fortunately, web graphics don't need to be
      as high-resolution as print graphics (72 dpi compared to 300 dpi), which
      means the files will be significantly smaller. Further, saving the file as a .jpg or
      .png results in a smaller file than a .tif or a .psd file. For videos, there are online
      applications you can use to compress video files into something smaller.
      Alternatively, you might consider uploading video files to YouTube and then
      embedding the video link on your website, which means that the video will still
      play on your web page, but the video itself isn't housed there.

   · Cascading style sheets. With so many WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You
      Get) platforms, it's no longer necessary for you to know how to code a website
      in HTML to create one. Cascading style sheets describe a way of coding the
      elements on a web page so that they are consistent across different pages--so
      that the title of each page, for instance, has the same font style, font size, color
      choice, and spacing. Most web platforms have these types of choices built in so
      that you can make selections that will be consistent across different pages of
      your website without having to know the HTML code. Utilizing these options
      will help you more easily create consistency and unity.

   · Hyperlinks and buttons. Here's where your design choices can leverage
      concepts that your audience is familiar with, and since your hyperlinks and
                                                                                                                           BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES | 85

      buttons usually accompany your call to action--inviting readers to take some
      sort of step toward your desired goal--it's important that they recognize these
      elements. It's pretty simple, really. A hyperlink is usually in blue font,
      underlined. This is the universal signal that the text is a hyperlink to a relevant
      page, and following this convention will make it much more likely that readers
      will recognize the hyperlink and click it. Usually, pages are structured so that
      internal links open in the same screen, whereas external links will open up a
      new window, making it possible for readers to return to the original page. In
      that case, it's helpful to set up your hyperlinks so that they change colors once
      they have been clicked (maybe from blue to purple) so that readers can
      visually see where they've already been. Similarly, buttons are more often used
      as the overall call to action--to "read more," to "apply now," to "subscribe," and
      so on. While some of the more subtle style choices might vary, it would be to
      your benefit to make your buttons look similar--not only from one page to the
      next but also in comparison to other websites.
   · Mobile responsiveness. A mobile-responsive website is one that reformats for
      maximum readability and usability depending on the user's device (Constant
      Contact). So instead of displaying the same, shrunken-down version of the
      home page on your cell phone, the overall format changes so that key items
      are bigger and formatted vertically, so it's easier to scroll through and click on
      the items that you want. This is helpful not only when going from a laptop to a
      cell phone but also when switching from one screen size to the next or one
      type of browser to the next. It ensures that the items are reformatted
      appropriately. Once again, many web platforms are mobile responsive and
      make it possible for you to toggle back and forth between multiple views as
      you put a page together.
   · Testing. One great thing about digital design is that it's relatively easy to
      change. Content strategists and web developers are constantly "testing" the
      effectiveness of their pages, not just through form feedback but also through
      various metrics that show how long viewers stayed on a specific page, how
      many people clicked on the CTA, and so on. Playing around with different
      versions and monitoring the results lets you gauge how your design choices
      are landing with your audience and to make improvements along the way.

         There is a lot to consider when it comes to the design of your digital projects,
and sometimes having so many options can be overwhelming. The good news is
that there are lots of online resources that you can draw from as well as successful
86 | BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES

(and unsuccessful) websites where you can draw inspiration and remind yourself of
various pitfalls.

     Discussion Questions

        1. What is the user experience (UX) and how does the overall "design" of a website influence
             the user experience? Consider the different types of "design" discussed in the
             introduction.

        2. How does the design of a message relate to rhetoric? Be specific about how it relates to
             some of the terms we've already discussed: purpose, audience, genre, persuasive appeals,
             and so on.

        3. The design principles identified in this chapter are based on research in the area of
             psychology and behavioral sciences that look closely at how people process and respond
             to information. Explain this reciprocal relationship between audience perspective and
             design.

        4. The chapter lists six foundational principles of web design. Identify each one, and give a
             brief overview of what each one means and how it might be applied.

        5. What is a wireframe and how might it be used to help you plan your design?
        6. Many of the foundational web design principles identified near the beginning of the

             chapter overlap in some ways. For instance, the principles of page structure and visual
             hierarchy both relate to the arrangement of elements on the page and strategies to
             emphasize important ideas. What other ideas overlap across some of the design
             strategies discussed in this chapter?
        7. Explain how a digital design can have both variety and consistency.
        8. What are the Gestalt design principles? How do they relate to some of the principles
             discussed in the first part of the chapter?
        9. In what ways do the sections on color theory and typography build on the design
             principles already discussed?
       10. Explain some of the special design considerations that are unique to digital writing. Can
             you think of any others that aren't specifically mentioned in the chapter?

ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION

   Cara Miller

Chances are that you've noticed a common thread throughout most of this
textbook: the importance of audience. It's common sense that you'd create content
with your audience in mind to capture their attention, guide their understanding,
and compel deeper levels of thought and action. However, it's often easier said than
done, especially when the audience is unknown. You're not writing a text message
to one of your friends, for instance, but you're posting a blog article on your website,
and you're not really sure who exactly might read the article. It's also difficult to
predict the needs, expectations, and perceptions of people in an audience who
are unlike you in some way. You might easily reread and revise content for people
whose background, experiences, and identities are similar to your own because you
probably have a very similar way of engaging with and interpreting information.
But what about people who are a different age, gender, race, nationality, religion, or
sexual orientation than you? What about people with disabilities who can't engage
with some forms of digital communication the way that other people do? These
people are also part of your audience, and it's crucial that you create content with
them in mind, prioritizing their needs and experiences so that your content is both
accessible and inclusive.

         The goal in this chapter is to focus on marginalized identities: minority groups
who are often overlooked or devalued in digital content, which not only creates
a more negative user experience but limits their ability to have meaningful
interactions online or even to complete basic tasks. It also reinforces their
marginalized positions. To improve the quality of your digital content for these
groups (and for everyone else, too), we'll be focusing on accessibility and inclusion.

         The accessibility of your content refers to users' ability to understand and
interact with the material provided. The Bureau of Internet Accessibility defines
accessibility as "a set of practices intended to remove barriers for people with
disabilities." These disabilities might include physical impairments, such as limited
vision or hearing, as well as cognitive limitations. Though more than a billion people
worldwide suffer from some sort of disability (World Health Organization), often
90 | ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION

affecting their ability to interact meaningfully online, WebAIM reports that 96.8%
of home pages aren't compliant with accessibility standards. This includes things
like poor color contrast, color usage as the only method of conveying information
(on a pie chart for instance), lack of alt text information, lack of captions for videos
and audio files--all things that could limit a disabled person from understanding or
navigating through digital content.

         Similarly, inclusive web content is welcoming to all potential audiences. It's
an umbrella term that includes the accessibility of a web page but also takes
into account other factors that might cause someone to feel excluded in some
way. Bianca Belman-Adams from Elementor explains, "It is important to keep in
mind when designing a website that not every user interacts with it the same
way....Inclusive web design removes bias and assumptions from a website so that
users won't feel excluded due to an impairment, demographics, or other temporary
or permanent circumstances." Assumptions or biases about language,
socioeconomic status, race, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality can all create feelings of
exclusion.

         This chapter focuses on how to create web content that is accessible and
inclusive so that users can engage meaningfully with your content. In both
instances, we will consider the experiences of users who are often marginalized
from web content, and we'll identify best practices in the design and
implementation of your content that will remove these barriers. In the end,
developing inclusive content isn't just beneficial to those specific users. It's good for
your brand, and it sends a positive message to all audiences about the importance
of equality and social justice.

Accessibility

This section of the chapter focuses on accessibility of web content for people with
disabilities, who are limited in their ability to understand or use various aspects of
a web page. Yes, this includes people with visual or auditory impairments who will
struggle to read the text, see the pictures, or hear sounds in a video or audio file, but
it also includes people with neurological, cognitive, speech, and physical limitations.
The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) explains that true accessibility allows
people with permanent or temporary disabilities to "perceive, understand, navigate,
and interact with the web" as well as "contribute to the web" with their own content.
Providing tools and accommodations for various situations not only helps people
with permanent disabilities but also people with temporary limitations--maybe
because they have a broken arm, they are in an environment with a bright glare on
the screen, or they don't have their glasses (W3C). Explained that way, it's easy to
see how most people would benefit at some point from improved accessibility.

         Before we dive into accessibility standards and best practices, let's pause for
a moment to consider why this is such an important concept. As stated above, the
vast majority of websites don't meet accessibility standards, but there are several
fundamental reasons why accessible web content should be a priority:

   · Legal. Most websites are bound by either the Americans with Disabilities Act
      (ADA.gov) or Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (Department of Justice,
      "Section 508"). While the ADA is very broad, encompassing a wide variety of
      public spaces that should be accessible, the law was created to be flexible and
92 | ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION

      to adapt to changing circumstances. Therefore, the internet is considered as a
      public space that must accommodate the needs of people with disabilities.
      Violators are subject to lawsuits and hefty fines (Userway).
   · Financial. Obviously, paying a fine or a lawsuit settlement would be expensive,
      but that doesn't include the loss of revenue from people who aren't able to
      interact with your content and therefore don't continue through the buyer
      journey. According to a 2018 report from American Institutes for Research,
      people with disabilities have a significant amount of purchasing power and are
      much more likely to make a purchase when they are provided with a positive
      user experience.
   · Social. Being sensitive to the needs of different people can go a long way to
      strengthen your brand. A website that is accessible, that has taken every
      measure to ensure a positive experience for people with disabilities, not only
      makes it possible for those people to engage with the content but also
      cultivates a sense of trust and goodwill so that people want to engage. This
      includes not only people with disabilities but everyone who considers
      accessibility to be an important issue and appreciates your effort.
   · Ethical. All of the other reasons aside, providing accessible content is simply
      the right thing to do. This is especially true following the COVID-19 pandemic,
      where so many of our basic activities and daily interactions shifted to the
      digital realm. Recently the U.S. Department of Justice noted that "people rely
      on websites like never before for all aspects of daily living," citing examples like
      voting information, bus schedules, health care information and resources, and
      so on ("Guidance"). Everyone should have the ability to access the information
      they need and to contribute in various ways to share their ideas and
      perspectives.

WCAG Standards

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the most comprehensive
and widely accepted standards of accessibility. It's currently on its third revision
with version 2.2 scheduled for completion in May 2023, which builds on existing
versions but will enhance "accessibility guidance for three major groups: users with
cognitive or learning disabilities, users with low vision, and users with disabilities
on mobile devices" (Web Accessibility Initiative, "WCAG 2 Overview"). In essence,
as new technologies, trends, and problems emerge, the guidelines are updated
so they remain as relevant as possible. Because they are developed collaboratively
                                                                                                                    ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION | 93

with constituents in the "global accessibility community" and because they offer
broad principles in conjunction with specific techniques and technical applications,
the WCAG guidelines are widely used by web designers, content writers, software
developers, and marketing professionals. According to Mark Shapiro, president of
the Bureau of Internet Accessibility, "Rarely does a single document have such
a direct impact on people's lives, but the guidance that WCAG provides allows
developers and content creators to include people who have historically been
excluded from digital experiences" (qtd. in Bureau of Internet Accessibility).

         The WCAG has four fundamental principles of accessibility, and each one
is further developed with guidelines and success criteria, which provides more
specific strategies for how each principle can be applied. Each of those principles as
well as the guidelines and some of the success criteria are identified below:

   · Perceivable--content must be provided in such a way that users can perceive
      what it is. The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative explains, "This means that users
      must be able to perceive the information being presented. (It can't be invisible
      to all of their senses)" ("WCAG 2.1"). Guidelines and specific strategies for these
      principles are listed below, taken from the Web Accessibility Initiative ("How to
      Meet"):
          Provide text alternatives for nontext content. This includes labels and short
            descriptions for objects, photos, and buttons. It also includes descriptive
            information for things like diagrams and charts, which wouldn't provide
            the same information but would give users an idea of what the
            information is about.
          Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia. Captions are
            especially important for prerecorded videos and audio content as well as
            live content. This category also includes sign language alternatives.
          Create content that can be presented in different ways, including by
            assistive technologies, without losing meaning. This relates specifically to
            the way information is sequenced and the relationships between elements
            on a page, which can often be done with labels and headings tags,
            grouping related content, and using standard text formatting conventions.
          Make it easier for users to see and hear content. This includes separating
            the foreground and the background with color and contrast, providing
            options to pause audio and control the volume, making the font large
            enough, and providing enough spacing for the text.

   · Operable--elements on the page must be functional. "This means that users
94 | ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION

      must be able to operate the interface. (The interface cannot require interaction
      that a user cannot perform)" (Web Accessibility Initiative, "Introduction").

          Make all functionality available from a keyboard. In other words, users
            should be able to perform the same tasks using keyboard commands as
            they would with a mouse. This includes providing keyboard shortcuts,
            providing keyboard-triggered handlers, avoiding keyboard traps (in which
            a user can't move away from an element on the screen), and so on.

          Give users enough time to read and use content. This includes letting
            users know if there is a time limit, allowing users to adjust or turn off time
            limits, allowing content to be paused, getting rid of time limits when it's
            not an essential part of the content, preventing interruptions, and
            preventing users from losing data if they do hit the time limit.

          Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions. More
            specifically, "web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than
            three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general
            flash and red flash thresholds" (W3C). It also includes allowing users to
            disable animations.

          Help users navigate and find content. This can be accomplished through
            page titles and headings, consistent navigation links on each page, labels
            that identify a logical reading order or tab order, information about the
            purpose of each link, and providing multiple ways for users to access a web
            page.

          Make it easier to use inputs other than the keyboard. W3C explains, "The
            intent ... is to ensure that content can be controlled with a range of
            pointing devices, abilities, and assistive technologies. Some people cannot
            perform gestures in a precise manner, or they may use a specialized or
            adapted input device such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-
            controlled mouse emulator." The specific strategies here allow for different
            pointing methods, as opposed to only allowing users to drag and drop
            content, for instance, or to swipe right.

   · Understandable--"Users must be able to understand the information as well
      as the operation of the user interface. (The content or operation cannot be
      beyond their understanding)" (Web Accessibility Initiative, "Introduction").
          Make text readable and understandable. This includes applying page
            attributes that identify the default language used, providing a mechanism
            for defining unusual idioms and jargon, providing the expanded form of
            abbreviations, and writing content that isn't more advanced than the
                                                                                                                    ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION | 95

            lower secondary education level.
          Make content appear and operate in predictable ways. For example, new

            windows and tabs would only open when necessary, users should be able
            to update settings without changing the context of a page, navigation
            should be consistent from one page to the next, and similar elements
            should be identified in similar ways.
          Help users avoid and correct mistakes. This includes providing text that
            helps identify errors on forms, indicating items on a form that are required,
            identifying the rules for how data must be submitted, providing other clear
            instructions, and providing suggestions for how to correct input errors.
   · Robust--Content should be developed so it can be interpreted accurately by a
      wide variety of users and assistive devices. "This means that users must be able
      to access the content as technologies advance. (As technologies and user
      agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)" (Web Accessibility
      Initiative, "Introduction").
          Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools. This includes
            using markup languages that conform with specified instructions,
            validating the type of web page it is, using labels appropriately, and using
            HTML according to relevant specifications.

         Obviously, the specific guidelines and strategies can get very technical, often
requiring a deeper knowledge of HTML and other principles of web design. The
W3C Web Accessibility Initiative provides much more detailed information about
practices that they consider "sufficient" (necessary) for accessibility as well as
"advisory" (recommended but not required) ("How to Meet"). While you may or may
not become familiar with the more technical aspects of accessibility standards, it's
important that digital writers, content strategists, and marketing professionals have
a working understanding of the principles as well as the basic guidelines that can
easily be incorporated into the design of a web page. Another helpful resource is
provided by the U.S. Access Board, which provides guidelines based on Section 508
of the Rehabilitation Act.

     Activity 16.1
96 | ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION

     Select a website for a local business, maybe even an academic institution or a business
     organization that you are a part of. Use the checklist below provided by the Bureau of Internet
     Accessibility to determine which aspects of the website are compliant and which ones are not
     ("5 Quick Ways"). The article gives more information about how to check for each item. Write up
     your own audit report of the site.

        1. Check alt text for images and nontext content. You can use a screen reader or other
             assistive technology on desktop and mobile (Bureau of Internet Accessibility, "Free
             Accessibility"). You can also right click on an image and select "inspect" to see the HTML
             code, where you can check for "alt" tags.

        2. Check for closed captions and video transcripts. Go to a video and within the player, see if
             there is a button or option to turn on closed captions (if the captions are open, they'll
             appear automatically and can't be turned off). Make sure the button works with a mouse
             and keyboard. Then, identify if there is a text transcript that accompanies the video.

        3. Check color contrast. When we talk about contrast ratios, we're talking about an actual
             numerical value that identifies the level of contrast. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
             (WCAG) success criterion 1.4.3 states that normal text must meet a minimum contrast
             ratio of at least 4.5:1 and large text (18 point or larger, or 14 point or larger and bold) must
             meet a minimum contrast ratio of at least 3:1 (Bureau of Internet Accessibility, "WCAG
             2.1-SC 1.4.3"). The a11y® Color Contrast Accessibility Validator is a free instant color
             contrast analysis provided by the Bureau of Internet Accessibility ("A11y").

        4. Make sure the site is keyboard friendly. Keyboard testing is something you can try yourself
             right now. Using common key commands, like the Tab and Shift-Tab keys, you can begin
             to get a sense of the accessibility condition of your website. If you notice that there are
             certain elements you can't reach or it's easy to get lost on the page, there might be
             keyboard-accessibility issues.

        5. Make sure the site can be zoomed without loss of content or functionality. It's a WCAG
             requirement that content can be zoomed to 200% and still work without assistive
             technology. Additionally, screen magnification should not interfere with other accessibility
             requirements. Fortunately, testing for this to some extent can be pretty easy. Zoom your
             web browser to 200% and see what happens to the content and layout of the web page.
             Do you notice that content elements overlap or disappear, or do they stack and adjust
             nicely? Can all the tasks still be performed with both a mouse and keyboard? Do
             navigation elements and menus still work well? Performing this preliminary testing isn't
             exhaustive or comprehensive, but it can help you identify some obvious accessibility
             issues with the display.

     Self-check the Accessibility of a Website")

Inclusion

In addition to being accessible to people with disabilities, web content should
also be inclusive, providing a space where people of all different backgrounds and
demographics feel welcome. Obviously, making the website accessible is one very
important step toward that larger goal because it provides very tangible and
specific strategies--color contrast, alt text, closed captioning--that influence
whether or not a person can engage with your content. Other aspects of inclusion
are a little more subtle, pertaining to the assumptions that are made about the
audience, about the kinds of identities that are "normal" or acceptable. It has to do
with the way that groups of people are portrayed in language and in photos. For a
person to feel welcome on a website, they would see themselves reflected positively
in the content, or they would at least get the sense that the text was written with a
wide range of identities in mind. This type of content creation can be tricky because
it requires you to identify your own assumptions and biases and to consider your
text from the perspectives of people who are different from you. It's also just as
much about what you don't say or the types of identities that you don't feature in
the imagery as what you do. In other words, the inclusivity of a website exists on a
spectrum, and the more positive steps you can take in the right direction, in a spirit
of openness and humility, the better your content will be for all audiences.

         Hopefully it's obvious why inclusion is important. In fact, we can point to many
of the same reasons that explain why accessibility is important. Similarly, inclusive
content has financial, social, and ethical implications, many of them directly
benefiting the individual or the organization sponsoring the content as well as the
larger community. For the individual organization, the benefits are largely financial.
A 2019 article by Adobe reports that 61% of Americans said they find diversity
important when it comes to marketing content, and "38% of consumers are more
inclined to trust brands that effectively embrace diversity in advertising" (CMO.com
Team). On the flip side, the article reports that LGBTQ+, Black, and Gen Z audiences
were apt to boycott brands that they felt did not adequately represent their
identities. This can have significant financial and social consequences. Just as
98 | ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION

importantly, efforts toward diversity and inclusion reinforce larger movements
focused on equality and social justice. According to Crownpeak, "Diversity, equity,
and inclusion matter because they help build a fairer society, strengthening the
bonds between people and within organizations. Companies have a responsibility
to act against the barriers and historical factors that have caused unfair conditions
for underrepresented groups."

         As a brief reminder from chapter 5, inclusion is part of a larger framework
called DEI, which should guide many of the decisions within an organization, going
far beyond the written digital content on a web page to also include things like
employment practices, audience research, product development, and so on. It's an
entire culture that seeks to include and understand a variety of identities. Let's take
a brief look at the elements of DEI:

   · Diversity is about representing a wide range of identities based on age, race,
      gender, ability, sexuality, and so on. An organization that values diversity and a
      range of different perspectives engages a diverse group of people--as
      employees, managers, consumer research participants, product testers, and so
      on. They also strive to include those perspectives as they communicate
      externally about their brand. Influencer Marketing Hub says that diversity is the
      first step because it extends the invitation, making people feel that they are
      welcome (Molenaar). They are more likely to feel welcome, for instance, if they
      see positive representations of their identities in an organization's digital
      messaging.

   · Equity refers to the actions you take to cultivate an environment of diversity
      and inclusion, reflected in your policies and daily practices that ensure
      different groups of people participate and that their perspectives are valued.
      Equitable practices provide resources and opportunities to groups that have
      traditionally been marginalized.

   · Inclusion goes beyond inviting diverse groups of people to be present. It
      encourages them to take an active, important role in the development of
      ideas. "Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being asked to dance,"
      says Verna Myers, an author and influencer (qtd. in Molenaar). Inviting people
      to participate might include the way that you invite feedback from various
      audiences or the way that you use that feedback to improve digital marketing
      strategies or product development. It's about inviting participation from
      diverse groups in every aspect of the business process, from product
      development to customer service and everything in between.
                                                                                                                    ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION | 99

         Before we look at specific best practices for inclusive digital content, it might
be helpful to distinguish between being exclusive and crafting content for a target
audience. As we've discussed all along, identifying your target audience and the
characteristics that define that audience is an important aspect of effective
communication. For instance, a company that caters specifically to women's
athletic gear--shoes, sports bras, running shorts, and so on would obviously feature
women more prominently in their advertising and create content that addresses
the concerns and experiences of women. They'd also probably target women in
a certain age group, perhaps in a particular income bracket if the clothing is
expensive. That company would rely heavily on market research to discover who is
in its target market and to create content that those people would find compelling.
However, using our same example of a company that sells women's athletic gear, it
would be a mistake to exclude (either implicitly or explicitly) certain types of women
who do fit in the target audience--women of color, women with disabilities, and
women with all different body types. These are segments of the target audience
that may very well be interested in purchasing workout gear, but because they
don't feel fully welcomed on the site perhaps because of language that is used or a
lack of diversity in the photos, they aren't likely to engage. Not only that, but their
marginalized status is reinforced by their experience on the website.

DEI Best Practices for Digital Writing

Hopefully it's clear that DEI is more than checking off a box on a to-do list or "tacking
on" language or pictures that will appease certain groups. It's an entire culture in
which inclusivity is fostered at every level of decision-making and management.
Crownpeak also reminds us that DEI should go beyond tokenized representations
of minorities during certain times of the year--featuring a Black person on the
front page of the website exclusively during Black History Month, for instance:
"It's essential to lay the groundwork for year-round DEI with fair and thoughtful
representation of underrepresented groups throughout your content--both
internally and externally." Many organizations struggle with creating inclusive web
content because it requires that, at their core, they establish practices and policies
that actually are inclusive. What's more, people with identities that are more
mainstream often feel intimidated by the process of talking through inclusivity
issues with other people or by writing text that is sensitive to the many different
types of experiences and identities that exist. Fortunately, as discussed by Ann
Gynn, the key to writing inclusive content is to have an open mind and to be
100 | ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION

intentional at every step of the production process to include other voices. She
identifies several strategies for making content more inclusive:

   · Be intentional about market research that helps you identify different
      segments of your target population. As noted above, this doesn't mean trying
      to cater to people who are clearly outside of your target population. It does
      mean that you'd conduct thorough research to get a better sense of who they
      are: "Look at the available data to understand representations that can be
      documented such as gender, income level, geography, race, etc. Then go
      deeper. Ask front-line team members, go to industry events, conduct focus
      groups in part to better understand those characteristics that are not easily
      tracked, such as physical ability or point of view" (Gynn). Gynn goes on to
      suggest that this type of research can be used to create personas of people
      with different characteristics that can be used to humanize those members of
      your target audience and help you better understand their needs.

   · Include diverse voices in the content. Ideally, an organization will prioritize
      diversity and inclusion at all levels of staffing, so that different identities are
      represented across various departments and in all decision-making activities.
      It would also be ideal if content was written by people from a variety of
      backgrounds in order to better understand and engage with different parts of
      the audience: "At a minimum, a team should be sensitized and trained to ask
      tough diversity and inclusion questions and encouraged to consult with those
      communities where a possible problem or misunderstanding could arise."

   · Use inclusive language. On one level, inclusive language relates to a friendly
      and professional tone, writing that is clear and easy to understand, and a
      respectful approach to different topics that resists making biased assumptions
      about what is "normal" or "right." On another level, it's about being sensitive to
      the way that language is used, demonstrating that you've made an effort to
      research and effectively incorporate preferred terminology that people won't
      find offensive. For instance, the 2019 version of the Associated Press Stylebook
      added an entire section on race-related topics, identifying language that
      people of color from various journalism organizations said they preferred
      (Berendzen). Another great resource is the Conscious Style Guide, which covers
      a wide variety of sensitive topics and recommends specific terminology (Yin,
      Conscious). The guide's author, Karen Yin, says her mission is to "help writers
      and editors think critically about using language--including words, portrayals,
      framing, and representation--to empower instead of limit" ("About").

   · Think about representation. While it might not be possible to provide
      representation for every type of identity in your target audience, making an
      effort to be diverse will go a long way to build trust with your audience. This
      means using photos that have different types of identities represented in a
      positive way. It might also mean including testimonials from a variety of
      different customers or writing employee profiles in order to highlight the
      diverse voices from your team.

   · Don't overdo it or be inauthentic. Gynn ends with a warning not to "go
      overboard" when it comes to being diverse. You don't want to come across as
      inauthentic or like you are using people's marginalized identities to make
      yourself look better. You also don't want the content to come across as
      unnatural, as if you are forcing a message of diversity into a context where it
      doesn't fit. "Make sure your content reflects a sincere commitment to diversity
      but in a way that's organic for your brand and your audience" (Gynn).

     Activity 16.2

     Have every student in class create a chart with two columns. The first column should include
     external identifiers that are visible (approximate age, for instance, or height or race). The second
     column should include internal characteristics that people wouldn't know just by
     looking--preferences, experiences, hobbies, skills, everyday challenges. Ideally these would be
     things that might go against the stereotypes people might initially have when they see this
     person's appearance. Students should go around the room and share their lists.
     Next, write a brief reflection about the types of stereotypes you often encounter, particularly in
     your digital experiences. What do people tend to assume about people with your identity? How
     do those assumptions and biases affect your personal experiences and decisions online? What
     would an "inclusive" web page look like for you?

         Writing content that is accessible and respectful of all audiences is crucial
to effective communication and the success of your brand, but as you can see
from this chapter, writing content that is truly inclusive is a complex process and
requires a great deal of intentionality, planning, and critical thinking. It also requires
102 | ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION

both courage and humility. Taking steps toward social justice is always a risk. Not
everyone will be on board for different reasons and may choose to disengage from
your brand. It's also possible that despite your best efforts at being inclusive, you'll
say something wrong or something that is taken the wrong way by someone
in your audience. That's where humility comes in--a genuine apology for the
misunderstanding and an effort to better understand that person's perspective so
you can address that concern in the future. There's always room to improve your
inclusivity efforts and to better understand the people in your target audience if you
are willing to listen.

     Discussion Questions

        1. What is a marginalized identity, and why is it important to consider the user experience of
             different people from marginalized groups?

        2. What does it mean to make your digital content accessible?
        3. What types of disabilities can create challenges for people who want to engage with web

             content?
        4. The introduction explains that inclusivity is an umbrella term that includes accessibility,

             but it includes other considerations as well. What are some of those considerations?
        5. In what ways does providing accessible content help everyone in the audience?
        6. What are some reasons why creating accessible content should be a priority for writers

             and web designers?
        7. What does WCAG stand for, and why has it become the standard for accessibility

             practices?
        8. Identify the four major principles of accessibility as outlined by the WCAG. Summarize

             some of the basic strategies that coincide with each principle.
        9. What does DEI stand for? Define each term that is in the acronym.

UNIT 2 CONCLUSION

   Collette Bliss

Now that you've completed this unit, you should know how to deepen and expand
your research. You should also be familiar with basic principles of design and multi-
modality, and be comfortable applying these skills in order to communicate your
ideas in a more robust way.

   Looking forward, we'll move into a more narrative-driven understanding of
community, building towards argument and advocacy before your final reflection.

   As we close out, begin to reflect on your experience in Unit 2. What have you
learned? Has anything surprised you or changed the way you see things? What did
you learn from the multimodal aspect of this project? What are you hoping to get
out of the next units? What do you hope to get out of this course? How can you
apply the skills you've learned in this project outside of this class?

UNIT 3 INTRODUCTION

   Ashleigh Severson

Welcome to Unit 3: Tell a Story, where we embark on a journey into the art of
narrative writing, weaving together the threads of observation, reflection, and
imagination to craft compelling stories that illuminate the essence of the
community you used in the previous units. In this unit, you will draw upon the
insights and experiences gathered from the first two units of our course as building
blocks of storytelling.

   To guide you through the process of crafting your narrative, we have structured
this unit around three essential chapters, each addressing key elements necessary
for the development of a rich and immersive story.

PURPOSE OF NARRATION

   Andrew Stracuzzi and André Cormier

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

        1. Determine the purpose and structure of narrative writing.
        2. Understand how to write a narrative essay.

Rhetorical modes simply mean the ways in which we can effectively communicate
through language. This chapter covers nine common rhetorical modes. As you
read about these nine modes, keep in mind that the rhetorical mode a writer
chooses depends on his or her purpose for writing. Sometimes writers incorporate
a variety of modes in any one essay. In covering the nine modes, this chapter
also emphasizes the rhetorical modes as a set of tools that will allow you greater
flexibility and effectiveness in communicating with your audience and expressing
your ideas.

The Purpose of Narrative Writing

Narration means the art of storytelling, and the purpose of narrative writing is to
tell stories. Any time you tell a story to a friend or family member about an event
or incident in your day, you engage in a form of narration. In addition, a narrative
can be factual or fictional. A factual story is one that is based on, and tries to be
faithful to, actual events as they unfolded in real life. A fictional story is a made-up,
or imagined, story; the writer of a fictional story can create characters and events as
he or she sees fit.

   The big distinction between factual and fictional narratives is based on a writer's
purpose. The writers of factual stories try to recount events as they actually
happened, but writers of fictional stories can depart from real people and events
110 | PURPOSE OF NARRATION

because the writers' intents are not to retell a real-life event. Biographies and
memoirs are examples of factual stories, whereas novels and short stories are
examples of fictional stories.

               TIP

     Because the line between fact and fiction can often blur, it is helpful to understand what your
     purpose is from the beginning. Is it important that you recount history, either your own or
     someone else's? Or does your interest lie in reshaping the world in your own image--either how
     you would like to see it or how you imagine it could be? Your answers will go a long way in
     shaping the stories you tell.

Ultimately, whether the story is fact or fiction, narrative writing tries to relay a series
of events in an emotionally engaging way. You want your audience to be moved by
your story, which could mean through laughter, sympathy, fear, anger, and so on.
The more clearly you tell your story, the more emotionally engaged your audience
is likely to be.

    EXERCISE 1

     On a separate sheet of paper, start brainstorming ideas for a narrative. First, decide whether you
     want to write a factual or fictional story. Then, freewrite for five minutes. Be sure to use all five
     minutes, and keep writing the entire time. Do not stop and think about what to write.
                                                             PURPOSE OF NARRATION | 111

The following are some topics to consider as you get going:

   1. Childhood
   2. School
   3. Adventure
   4. Work
   5. Love
   6. Family
   7. Friends
   8. Vacation
   9. Nature
 10. Space

The Structure of a Narrative Essay

Major narrative events are most often conveyed in chronological order, the order in
which events unfold from first to last. Stories typically have a beginning, a middle,
and an end, and these events are typically organized by time. Certain transitional
words and phrases aid in keeping the reader oriented in the sequencing of a story.
Some of these phrases are listed in Table 5.1 "Transition Words and Phrases for
Expressing Time".

TRANSITION WORDS AND PHRASES FOR
EXPRESSING TIME
112 | PURPOSE OF NARRATION

after/afterward             as soon as     at last     before
currently                   during         eventually  meanwhile
next                        now            since       soon
finally                     later          still       then
until                       when/whenever  while       first, second, third

The following are the other basic components of a narrative:

   · Plot.The events as they unfold in sequence.
   · Characters. The people who inhabit the story and move it forward. Typically,

      there are minor characters and main characters. The minor characters
      generally play supporting roles to the main character, or the protagonist.
   · Conflict. The primary problem or obstacle that unfolds in the plot that the
      protagonist must solve or overcome by the end of the narrative. The way in
      which the protagonist resolves the conflict of the plot results in the theme of
      the narrative.
   · Theme. The ultimate message the narrative is trying to express; it can be either
      explicit or implicit.

            CONNECTING THE PIECES: WRITING
AT WORK

When interviewing candidates for jobs, employers often ask about conflicts or problems a
                                                                                                                           PURPOSE OF NARRATION | 113

     potential employee has had to overcome. They are asking for a compelling personal narrative.
     To prepare for this question in a job interview, write out a scenario using the narrative mode
     structure. This will allow you to troubleshoot rough spots, as well as better understand your own
     personal history. Both processes will make your story better and your self-presentation better,
     too.

    EXERCISE 2

     Take your freewriting exercise from the last section and start crafting it chronologically into a
     rough plot summary.
     Collaboration
     Please share with a classmate and compare your rough plot summary.

Writing a Narrative Essay

When writing a narrative essay, start by asking yourself if you want to write a factual
or fictional story. Then freewrite about topics that are of general interest to you. For
more information about freewriting, see The Writing Process: Where Do I Begin?.

   Once you have a general idea of what you will be writing about, you should
sketch out the major events of the story that will compose your plot. Typically, these
events will be revealed chronologically and climax at a central conflict that must be
resolved by the end of the story. The use of strong details is crucial as you describe
the events and characters in your narrative. You want the reader to emotionally
engage with the world that you create in writing.
114 | PURPOSE OF NARRATION

  TIP

     To create strong details, keep the human senses in mind. You want your reader to be immersed
     in the world that you create, so focus on details related to sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch
     as you describe people, places, and events in your narrative.

As always, it is important to start with a strong introduction to hook your reader
into wanting to read more. Try opening the essay with an event that is interesting
to introduce the story and get it going. Finally, your conclusion should help resolve
the central conflict of the story and impress upon your reader the ultimate theme
of the piece.

    EXERCISE 3
     On a separate sheet of paper, add two or three paragraphs to the plot summary you started in
     the last section. Describe in detail the main character and the setting of the first scene. Try to
     use all five senses in your descriptions.

   Ultimately, whether the story is fact or fiction, narrative writing tries to relay a
series of events in an emotionally engaging way. You want your audience to be

   To create strong details, keep the human senses in mind. You want your reader to
be immersed in the world that you create, so focus on details related to sight, sound,
smell, taste, and touch as you describe people, places, and events in your narrative.
For more information on sensory details, see the chapter on Description.

The Structure of a Narrative

Every day, you relate stories to other people through simple exchanges. You may
have had a horrible experience at a restaurant the night before, or you may have
witnessed a curious interaction between other people. In each one of these
experiences, there's a story, and when you begin to share a personal experience, you
often communicate in a narrative mode.

   There are two main types of narratives: narratives about a personal experience
and narratives about other people's experiences.

   Narratives about the writer's personal experience typically use the first-person
"I" pronoun because the narrator is the person who was physically present for the
events described. The writer chooses details and language that reveal the narrator's
feelings about the events that are taking place.

   Narratives written about other people's experiences typically use the third-person
pronouns "he, she, it, they." Some writers opt to report third-person narratives
objectively to relay events in a way that is both accurate and dispassionate.
Examples include history books, lab reports, and news stories.

   Regardless of the narrator's point of view, major narrative events are most often
conveyed in chronological order, the order in which events unfold from first to last.
Stories typically have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and these events are
typically organized by time. Certain transitional words and phrases aid in keeping
the reader oriented in the sequencing of a story. Some of these phrases are listed
here:

   · Characters - The people who inhabit the story and move it forward. Typically,

      there are minor characters and main characters. The minor characters
      generally play supporting roles to the main character, also known as the
      protagonist.
   · Conflict - The primary problem or obstacle that unfolds in the plot that the
      protagonist must solve or overcome by the end of the narrative. The way in
      which the protagonist resolves the conflict of the plot results in the theme of
      the narrative.
   · Theme - The ultimate message the narrative is trying to express; it can be
      either explicit or implicit.

Writing a Narrative Essay

When writing a narrative essay, start by asking yourself if you are writing a factual
or fictional story. Then freewrite, brainstorm, or mind map about topics that are of
general interest to you.

   Once you have a general idea of what you will be writing about, you should
sketch out the major events of the story that will compose your plot. Typically, these
events will be revealed chronologically and climax at a central conflict that must be
resolved by the end of the story.
                                                                                                                               WRITING A NARRATIVE | 119

   As always, it is important to start with a strong introduction to hook your reader
into wanting to read more. Try opening the essay with an event that is interesting
to introduce the story and get it going. Finally, your conclusion should help resolve
the central conflict of the story and impress upon your reader the ultimate theme,
or unifying idea, of the piece.

Professional Writing Example

"Fish Cheeks" by Amy Tan is an example of a well-written personal narrative. As
you read the following narrative, try to determine the narrative's point of view, plot,
characters, transitions, conflict, and theme. See if you can identify areas where the
author has included descriptive details.

      Fish Cheeks

       I fell in love with the minister's son the winter I turned fourteen. He was not Chinese, but as
       white as Mary in the manger. For Christmas I prayed for this blond-haired boy, Robert, and a
       slim new American nose.
       When I found out that my parents had invited the minister's family over for Christmas Eve
       dinner, I cried. What would Robert think of our shabby Chinese Christmas? What would he
       think of our noisy Chinese relatives who lacked proper American manners? What terrible
       disappointment would he feel upon seeing not a roasted turkey and sweet potatoes but
       Chinese food?
       On Christmas Eve I saw that my mother had outdone herself in creating a strange menu. She
       was pulling black veins out of the backs of fleshy prawns. The kitchen was littered with
       appalling mounds of raw food: A slimy rock cod with bulging eyes that pleaded not to be
       thrown into a pan of hot oil. Tofu, which looked like stacked wedges of rubbery white
       sponges. A bowl soaking dried fungus back to life. A plate of squid, their backs crisscrossed
       with knife markings so they resembled bicycle tires.
       And then they arrived - the minister's family and all my relatives in a clamor of doorbells and
       rumpled Christmas packages. Robert grunted hello, and I pretended he was not worthy of
       existence.
       Dinner threw me deeper into despair. My relatives licked the ends of their chopsticks and
120 | WRITING A NARRATIVE

       reached across the table, dipping them into the dozen or so plates of food. Robert and his
       family waited patiently for platters to be passed to them. My relatives murmured with
       pleasure when my mother brought out the whole steamed fish. Robert grimaced. Then my
       father poked his chopsticks just below the fish eye and plucked out the soft meat. "Amy, your
       favorite," he said, offering me the tender fish cheek. I wanted to disappear.
       At the end of the meal my father leaned back and belched loudly, thanking my mother for her
       fine cooking. "It's a polite Chinese custom to show you are satisfied," explained my father to
       our astonished guests. Robert was looking down at his plate with a reddened face. The
       minister managed to muster up a quiet burp. I was stunned into silence for the rest of the
       night.
       After everyone had gone, my mother said to me, "You want to be the same as American girls
       on the outside." She handed me an early gift. It was a miniskirt in beige tweed. "But inside
       you must always be Chinese. You must be proud you are different. Your only shame is to
       have shame."
       And even though I didn't agree with her then, I knew that she understood how much I had
       suffered during the evening's dinner. It wasn't until many years later - long after I had gotten
       over my crush on Robert - that I was able to fully appreciate her lesson and the true purpose
       behind our particular menu. For Christmas Eve that year, she had chosen all my favorite
       foods.

Student Writing Example

The following essay, "Bayou Monster," was written by an English 101 student, who
wrote this personal narrative to challenge the idea that a monk's life is boring. As
                                                                                                                               WRITING A NARRATIVE | 121

you read this story, look for places where the author has incorporated the same
narrative techniques found in Amy Tan's essay.

      Bayou Monster

       It was a scorcher that day. The wind and trees were no help. The shade was only being
       supplied so far off the bank. Baseball caps can only do so much to protect the head from the
       sun's powerful rays. The mosquitoes were rampant, their feeble attempt at survival. There
       was a lack of warm-blooded animals for them to prey on. We were the likely targets, the only
       ones that would dare venture that far out into a swamp. In addition to the nagging pests, the
       feebleness of the body takes its toll on the mind. Doubts began to swirl in my head of when
       we would ever stop to rest. Thoughts of unrest, discomfort, and selfishness shot from my
       bones up to my brain, causing a disinterested taste on my part for this "lovely day out."

       Just as my thoughts became increasingly negative and the downward swirl of discomfort
       was reaching the highest degree, I heard, "Get ready; it's our first one!" Suddenly a slight rush
       of energy came out of nowhere, pushing me forward onto my toes, ready for what came
       next. As the boat slowed for the approach, I snapped a quick glance around. I noticed the
       others received the same kind of rejuvenation that I had experienced. Their heads moved
       forward toward the front of the boat, their bodies posturing upward to get the best look.
       Suddenly, I found myself hanging halfway off the front bow reaching down for a rope that
       had spent most of its existence submerged in nature. After I grabbed the rope, the next
       hardest thing to get a handle on was my fear, which manifested itself in the form of unsteady
       hands. As I pulled the rope further into the boat, I thought, "This stuff only happens in
       movies." The partner boat was only a few feet away, readied with cameras, and smiles
       behind the lenses.

       What I saw next was unutterable. Coming up behind the rope was a massive net. The net
       wasn't the problem, though; rather, what the net contained had my mind tangled a bit. At first
       glance, anyone would say, "It's a fish." It looked like a fish, moved like a fish, and it certainly
       smelled like a fish. Drawing closer to this mysterious creature, I tried to get a better look at it.
       Suddenly there was an eerie sound. Caused by a mix of fluid and air being pushed through a
       small hole at a high rate of speed. I told myself, "This beast has lungs." As the rest of its
       body surfaced, it became clear that the creature I had helped pull from the water was not just
       any old fish. It was a prehistoric monster that made its way through the waters of history
122 | WRITING A NARRATIVE

       until now. It had teeth the size of my fingers, eyes that had seen little sunlight, and a head the
       size of my torso. It suddenly became difficult to breathe normally. I was in shock.

       Thanks be to God and all that is good for our fearless boat captain. He had seen this sort of
       thing before. This became clear when I glanced up to find a smile bigger than the sun on his
       face. Though a few teeth were missing, it did not seem to stifle his cheer. Oh, the laughter
       that came from this large man. His amusement caused my discomfort. Sheepishly, I
       managed to ask, "What are we going to do with that thing?" His answer was clear, striking,
       and firm. Looking over the specimen wrapped in the net behind me, he said, "We're going to
       kill it and eat it." Indeed, we did. Carefully and with much fear, we pulled this living hunk of
       marsh onto the deck of the boat. Watching its every move as he untied what was left of the
       mangled nets. He then calmly requested his "special tool" from behind the steering wheel.
       With a crooked smile and a strange sense of confidence, he said smoothly, "Just a little
       amnesia." Then the inevitable happened. Thud! Thud! Thud! He raised the hatchet high in the
       air and delivered several deadly strikes to the uppermost part of the beast's head. After the
       third swing, the beast ceased to move about on the deck of the bayou cruiser. It let out its
       final breath, almost a sigh of relief. We all stood there in silence for a moment, trying to
       process the most eventful and mysterious five minutes of our lives.

       Before we knew it, we had the monster back at the camp to be cleaned and packaged.
       Several grown men had to grab its slimy body to fashion a hoist over its snout to get it onto
       the deck of the cleaning station. As we grabbed it, our eyes were fixed on its massive teeth.
       We wondered if the beast would awake from its seeming lethargy seeking revenge. Once a
       few pictures were snapped of us with our accidental catch, we began to clean the alligator
       garfish with much frustration. Fish that large have skin like armor, making it difficult even for
       the experienced veterans. Research showed that although it is an exceptionally large fish, it
       wouldn't have topped the world record holders. I like to share this fishing story from time to
       time with friends and men who tend to boast of their "biggest catches." It is a fond memory
       to share with many, especially those who call my life "boring." If they only knew.

Summary

Narration is the art of telling lively, engaging stories. Personal narratives are true
stories that authors tell about either their lives or the lives of people around them.
The elements common to most narratives include narration, description, point of
view, transitions, characters, plot, conflict, and theme. By using these elements in
your writing, you will be able to successfully complete a personal narrative essay.

   Reflective Response

     Now that your personal narrative is complete, reflect on the writing process. What was the most
     challenging part of composing your narrative? Which part would you consider the easiest?

Live-On-Tape

Normally, podcasts are edited programs. Interviews sound live because they're
recorded "live-on-tape" and edited for time and clarity. Taping the interview can be
comforting to guests and new hosts. It also means you can get rid of egregious
stumbles and drawn-out stories. But don't worry if you make a few minor flubs; the
audience also appreciates spontaneity.

Podcast show planning involves three overlapping stages that call for creative
storytelling and are covered in this chapter.

    Show Planning Stages

     Pre-Production is the show planning stage where you decide the podcast title, description,
     cover artwork, show type or format, and show length.
     Production is script writing - whether it is entirely scripted, or sketched out as bullet points. It is
     also the recording and editing of interviews as well as finding any other appropriate sound that
     will enhance the podcast. The sound could be a person-on-the-street interview, a clip from a
     news report or a street protest. Radio reporters excel at getting sound from the scene and while
     the subject is doing something -- collecting oysters during a harvest or planting a sustainable
     garden. Interviewers can ask the subject to describe what they are doing and conduct all or part
     of the interview while on location.
     Post-Production involves additional editing and sound mixing, as well as deciding on further
     story transitions, use of music, publication, and show promotion.

Be A Fan & Listen To Other Podcasts
130 | PODCAST SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS

You're probably creating your own podcast because you've been a fan of listening
to podcasts.

   But when it comes to planning your own show, the best thing you can do is to
listen to other podcasts. See Ch. 1 for unique ways on how to find podcasts beyond
just listening apps. This kind of listening isn't just for enjoyment, however, you need
to listen to carefully deconstruct how shows are put together. This will help you
decide your own style, budget, and production capabilities.

                                Graphic from Pixaboy.com

Deconstructing Podcasts

If you want to create a podcast, then listen to shows in the same category (fiction
or nonfiction); the same genre (news, true crime, pop culture, religion) etc., and the
same format (interview, monologue, co-host, roundtable, storytelling/investigative)
to see how others have put together their shows.

   It's helpful if you can find a transcript for the podcast but you can also use
technology to quickly transcribe a show.

    Basic Criteria In Podcast Deconstruction

     Listen carefully & take notes to decipher how podcasts are put together:
          · The podcast name - does the name tell you what the podcast topic is about?
          · Is the podcast description accurate to what you heard? What about the episode
                                                                                         PODCAST SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 131

             description, if there is one?
          · Is there music? How long and where is the music used in the podcast and does it match

             the tone of the podcasts?
          · What is the podcast open? Is there a standard pre-taped open with music? Does the host

             just dive into the interview or do they use an edited clip from later in the interview to draw
             your interest in staying around to listen?
          · How does the host handle the show episode opening?
          · How does the host handle introductions of guests and topics?
          · How does the host transition from one topic or interview to another?
          · Does the podcast artwork fit the theme of the podcast?
          · How interesting or compelling is the content? Does the podcast use audio clips to
             illustrate points they're trying to make?
          · How well is the technical portion of the podcast done? Think about audio quality and
             speaking clarity.
          · Does the podcast have disclaimers, to advise about explicit or disturbing content?

          · Are there advertisements or public service announcements?
          · Does the host ask for show reviews and how?
          · How does the show end? Does the host tease what is coming in the next show?
          · What is one thing that you DO or DO NOT want to imitate?

Script or Ad-Lib?

Scripting should always be done for podcasts to some degree. It's a guide for
getting across your key message while also leaving room for your personality. Even
shows that seem spontaneous have usually been planned and written out and take
one of these various forms:

   Word-for-word Script - you write the way you talk and read the script. This makes
sure you cover specific points and cuts down on production time.

   Ad-lib - you wing it at the moment. Pros can make this seem easy but in reality,
it's very hard to do well without lots of experience.

   Outline - an outline is a hybrid between the script and ad-lib; with bullet points
for key talking points and a plan to smoothly transition from one area to the next.

Script Writing Tips

Scripting keeps interview podcasts on track, allowing the host to fill in the gaps
when a story goes too long or sideways. This is where the hard work of producing a
podcast comes into play because a well-edited podcast takes time for the producer-
host to accomplish, doing the interview is just the starting point.

   Public radio uses the term "driveway moment" to describe listeners who arrive
home but stay in their cars to hear the end of a story because it's so captivating. But
achieving such a storytelling moment doesn't come without a lot of hard work in
scripting -- and involves writing a setup to the story to build interest, having strong
story elements to solidify flow, with a strong lead and a satisfying ending.
                                                                                         PODCAST SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 133

                            Photo by Artem Sapegin on Unsplash

The 4 Tools of Audio Storytelling

Audio storytelling is fueled by four elements that need to work together - words,
your voice, audio sounds (music to sound effects or natual sound), and editing. All
four need to work together, meaning that when you write an audio script you are
simultaneously using all four elements - words written using your voice with audio
sounds, and edited as a whole. When done well it makes for a very rich storytelling
experience for the listener.

   Write short sentences and talk out loud as you write because we write
differently than we speak and it helps not to sound scripted. It works to do this.
Remember that your show is for the ear, not the eye.

   Repeat for emphasis. If you want a certain point to clearly stand out to an
audience you can repeat what is said in a sound clip, as Rachel Maddow does in her
podcast, Deja News

Script In Chunks

Podcast scripts are written one step at a time or in chunks:
   There should be a script for a short, standard pre-produced show open with music

and narration that says the show's name and description. This open is heard on
every show and works well as a way to make clear to new listeners what the show is
about.
134 | PODCAST SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS

   It is often followed by a separate episode introduction which introduces the topic
of the day and guest introductions. Some podcasts have only an episode open.

   Once an interview is done, the host/producer listens to the audio and decides
what parts of the interview to use, and writes a script. Most good interviews are not
used in their entirety but are edited to sustain interest, provide greater clarity, and
perhaps for time. Think about how to transition from one interview to another, or
from one topic to another.

    Storytelling Leads

                                                                                                     Pixabay.
                                                                                                     com

          · In a first-person lead, the host talks about their own experience and says they will share
             more during the podcast.

          · In an anecdotal lead, the host can tell a real story to explain a situation or scenario.
             Political leaders often use such examples to illustrate their points.

          · In an observational lead, the host can illustrate the big picture by discussing longer-term
             trends.

          · In a scene-setting lead, the host can paint a picture in the listener's mind of what's
             happening or could happen.

Show Rundown

Every podcast needs a show rundown that indicates the order of show elements.
The rundown assigns approximate times for each show element, which is vital to
keeping a standard show length.
                                                                                  PODCAST SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 135

Guest Introductions

Resumes are written for the eye so be sure to rewrite any guest bio for the ear.
That means writing shorter and sharper - include major achievements of the guest
related to your episode topic but don't list everything. Most importantly, read the
introduction out loud to see how it sounds and how long it takes. Additional details
can always be put in episode Show Notes on your website.

Standardize Your Show Format

A podcast rundown is not as rigid as the "clock" that runs commercial and public
radio programming -- that template follows a strict pattern of when news, traffic,
and other segments are repeated on an hourly basis. But podcast listeners also
expect some routine in their listening habits.

Typical Interview-Type Show Format:

Music with pre-produced standard open - "This is the XXXXX podcast, a show about XXXXX,"
and then the music comes up at full strength.
EPISODE Introduction by host. "Welcome back to another episode of XXXXX...(podcast name)
I'm your host XXXXX." Do an episode signpost on what to expect. "On today's episode, we'll talk
about some of the more unique animals being adopted: bearded dragons, hedgehogs, miniature
donkeys ... which ones are really safe to be home pets? How hard are they to care for? Are they
legal?"
Music bumper
Topic #1: Introduction of guest by host. Avoid reading any long bio the guest may have sent
because it will sound stuffy and stilted because it's usually meant to be read and not heard.
Rewrite it to be short and clear for the ear. You can put their full credentials on your website.

Creative Show OPENS

The decision on how to open your podcast can make or break building an audience
because listeners decide within minutes whether to invest their time or move
on. NPR One found that most podcasts lose 25-35 percent of the listening audience
in the first five minutes.

The podcast, Baby, This is Keke Palmer has a unique opening where the actress
and TV personality voices a note in her diary related to the show's content, and then
sings an original song opening.Show Opens & Episode Open
                                                                                         PODCAST SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 139

   Don't just wing it when starting your show; take the time to plan things out. But,
also don't be so tied to a script that you sound robotic.

   Keep in mind that most shows really have two opens - starting with the
standard pre-produced open with music and narration that says the show name
and tagline or description that explains what the show is about.

   The second open can be the episode open that explains what the content for the
day will be, the host's name, and who the guests will be. Episode opens can have
some very creative and different styles, as explained below.

    Techniques For Creative Opens

          · The host could use a teaser hook saying, "It seemed pretty clear what the outcome would
             be ..... but that's NOT what happened, we'll learn about that in this next episode."

          · The host could pose a controversial or probing question, then explain that experts will
             offer their views during the podcast.

          · The host could tell the audience three things they'll hear in today's episode. The magic of
             three works well for the ear.

          · The host could pose a multi-choice question, then give the audience three options to
             consider. Tell the audience that the answer(s) will be shared during the podcast.

          · Have the host use the word IMAGINE, then create a short scenario that will be explained
             during the podcast. This open might work well for a topic that has an uncertain outcome,
             such as whether humans might someday be routinely traveling to distant planets for
             vacations

     Host Michael Barbaro discusses the news of the day. His show opens with the podcast music
     theme and the host's name introduction.
     Barbaro sets up the topic to be discussed using clips from news coverage about the issue. The
     sound helps set the scene for the listener and pulls them into the story because they're
     experiencing the event and not just being told about it. It is followed by an edited interview with
     a reporter who covered the story.
     The episode is The Overlooked Scandal of Priests Sexually Abusing Nuns.

Host Ezra Klein talks with newsmakers and about public policy.

In this episode, he begins the podcast with an edited quote taken from his interview expert.
Use of compelling audio at the top of a show about what's coming up serves as a lure for the
audience to stick around and listen.
The episode is Ending the age of animal cruelty.

Writing BUMPERS {Audio examples}

Podcast bumpers are quick 10-to-15 second transitions within the podcast. It's an
easy way to remind an audience of the podcast they're listening to. It can also work
144 | PODCAST SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS

as an easy way to make an edit and break up a long interview. "You're listening to
XXXX, exploring the topic of XXXXX. I'm your host, XXX"

   Here are two examples of bumpers (the first one can also work as an open):
           1. Stepping into the Light podcast with psychic medium Julia Treat.

(:19) "Welcome to `Stepping Into The Light' with Julia Treat, a weekly podcast
devoted to helping you open up to your own unique abilities so you can receive

    Show ENDINGS

     A good podcast shouldn't end just because you stop talking, but instead have a planned ending.

The Unexpected Ending

One of the most creative and satisfying parts of being a podcast creator is coming up with your
own idea in show production. Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, in her podcast, Wiser Than Me, has a
unique show ending that uses her mother as a kind of side-kick after she has completed a guest
interview.
More routinely, podcasts end with thanks, credits, and reminders of how to find the podcast.
Certainly you want to thank your listeners for investing time with you:

(:50) HOST: "If this podcast means something to you, it would mean so much to us if you'd be
willing to take 30 seconds to do each or all of these three things.
First, can you please follow or subscribe to We Can Do Hard Things? Following the pod helps you
because you'll never miss an episode, and it helps us because you'll never miss an episode. To do
this, just go to the We Can Do Hard Things show page on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
listen to podcasts, and then just tap the plus sign in the upper right-hand corner or click on follow.
This is the most important thing for the pod.
While you're there, if you'd be willing to give us a five-star rating and review and share an episode
you loved with a friend, we would be so grateful. We appreciate you very much."
Show endings often put a spotlight on show creators and production staff:

Scriptwriting For Fiction Podcasts

Nonfiction podcasts greatly outnumber fiction podcasts even though the dramas
are rooted in the radio shows that started in the 1940s. Successes like Welcome to
Night Vale or The Amelia Project are difficult to do and expensive because they call
for multiple creators and many more resources and costs.

   Across the world, listening to fiction podcasts has grown 338% in Sweden,
according to Spotify's Nordic manager.

UNIT 3 CONCLUSION

   Ashleigh Severson

Unit 3: Tell a Story has provided a comprehensive framework for crafting compelling
narratives that vividly capture the essence of your chosen community. Throughout
the exploration of the four chapters within this unit, we have delved into the
intricacies of narrative writing and storytelling.

   As we reflect on our journey through these four chapters and on the Tell a Story
assignment, we emerge with a deeper understanding of the craft of storytelling
and the power of narrative to illuminate, inspire, and connect us to the world around
us. Armed with the knowledge, skills, and confidence gained from this unit, we
are ready to embark on the journey through argumentation in Unit 4: Make an
Argument.

UNIT 4 INTRODUCTION

   Ashleigh Severson

Welcome to Unit 4: Make an Argument, where we will delve into the art of
constructing persuasive arguments in preparation for the "Make an Argument"
assignment. In this unit, we will harness the power of rhetoric and critical thinking
to craft compelling arguments that advocate for change, challenge, assumptions,
or provoke thought about your chosen community. Building upon the insights and
experiences gained from the previous on narrative and storytelling, we now turn to
our focus to persuasion, where words become tools for advocacy and influence.

   To guide you through the process of crafting your argument, we have organized
this unit into five chapters, each addressing key elements necessary for the
development of a strong, persuasive, and successful argument.

What Is Argumentation?

Arguments are everywhere, and practically everything is or has been debated at
some time. Your ability to develop a point of view on a topic and provide evidence is
the process known as Argumentation. Argumentation asserts the reasonableness
of a debatable position, belief, or conclusion. This process teaches us how to
evaluate conflicting claims and judge evidence and methods of investigation while
helping us to clarify our thoughts and articulate them accurately. Arguments also
consider the ideas of others in a respectful and critical manner. In argumentative
writing, you are typically asked to take a position on an issue or topic and explain
and support your position. The purpose of the argument essay is to establish the
writer's opinion or position on a topic and persuade others to share or at least
acknowledge the validity of your opinion.
                                        WHAT IS ARGUMENTATION? | 155

Structure of the Argumentative Essay

An effective argumentative essay introduces a compelling, debatable topic to
engage the reader. In an effort to persuade others to share your opinion, the writer
should explain and consider all sides of an issue fairly and address
counterarguments or opposing perspectives. The following five features make up
the structure of an argumentative essay:

Introduction

The argumentative essay begins with an introduction that provides appropriate
background to inform the reader about the topic. Your introduction may start with
a quote, a personal story, a surprising statistic, or an interesting question. This
strategy engages the reader's attention while introducing the topic of the essay.
The background information is a short description of your topic. In this section, you
should include any information that your reader needs to understand your topic.

Thesis Statement

A thesis statement is one sentence in your introductory paragraph that concisely
summarizes your main point(s) and claim(s) and presents your position on the topic.
The thesis statement or main claim must be debatable. In other words, the thesis
must be something that people could reasonably have differing opinions on.

Body Paragraphs and Supporting Details

Your argument must use an organizational structure that is logical and persuasive.
There are three types of argumentative essays, each with differing organizational
structures: Classical, Toulmin, and Rogerian.

Organization of the Classical Argument

The Classical Argument was developed by a Greek philosopher, Aristotle. It is the
most common. The goal of this model is to convince the reader about a particular
point of view. The Classical Argument relies on appeals to persuade an audience
specifically: ethos (ethical appeal) is an appeal to the writer's creditability, logos
156 | WHAT IS ARGUMENTATION?

(logical appeal) is an appeal based on logic, and pathos (pathetic appeal) is an
appeal based on emotions. The structure of the classical model is as follows:

   · Introductory paragraph includes the thesis statement
   · Background on the topic provides information to the reader about the topic
   · Supporting evidence integrates appeals
   · Counterargument and rebuttal address major opposition
   · Conclusion restates the thesis statement

The Following Words and Phrases: Writing an Argument

Using transition words or phrases at the beginning of new paragraphs or within
paragraphs helps a reader to follow your writing. Transitions show the reader when
you are moving on to a different idea or further developing the same idea.
Transitions create a flow, or connection, among all sentences, and that leads to
coherence in your writing. The following words and phrases will assist in linking
ideas, moving your essay forward, and improving readability:

   · Also, in the same way, just as, likewise, similarly
   · But, however, in spite of, on the one hand, on the other hand, nevertheless,

      nonetheless, notwithstanding, in contrast, on the contrary, still yet
   · First, second, third..., next, then, finally
   · After, afterward, at last, before, currently, during, earlier, immediately, later,

      meanwhile, now, recently, simultaneously, subsequently, then
   · For example, for instance, namely, specifically, to illustrate
   · Even, indeed, in fact, of course, truly, without question, clearly
   · Above, adjacent, below, beyond, here, in front, in back, nearby, there
   · Accordingly, consequently, hence, so, therefore, thus
   · Additionally, again, also, and, as well, besides, equally important, further,

      furthermore, in addition, moreover, then
   · Finally, in a word, in brief, briefly, in conclusion, in the end, in the final analysis,

      on the whole, thus, to conclude, to summarize, in sum, to sum up, in summary

     Universal Health Care Coverage for the United States

       By Scott McLean

       The United States is the only modernized Western nation that does not offer publicly funded
       health care to all its citizens; the costs of health care for the uninsured in the United States
       are prohibitive, and the practices of insurance companies are often more interested in profit
       margins than providing health care. These conditions are incompatible with US ideals and
       standards, and it is time for the US government to provide universal health care coverage for
       all its citizens. Like education, health care should be considered a fundamental right of all US
       citizens, not simply a privilege for the upper and middle classes.

       One of the most common arguments against providing universal health care coverage (UHC)
       is that it will cost too much money. In other words, UHC would raise taxes too much. While
       providing health care for all US citizens would cost a lot of money for every tax-paying
       citizen, citizens need to examine exactly how much money it would cost, and more
       important, how much money is "too much" when it comes to opening up health care for all.
       Those who have health insurance already pay too much money, and those without coverage
       are charged unfathomable amounts. The cost of publicly funded health care versus the cost
       of current insurance premiums is unclear. In fact, some Americans, especially those in lower
       income brackets, could stand to pay less than their current premiums.

       However, even if UHC would cost Americans a bit more money each year, we ought to reflect
       on what type of country we would like to live in, and what types of morals we represent if we
       are more willing to deny health care to others on the basis of saving a couple hundred dollars
       per year. In a system that privileges capitalism and rugged individualism, little room remains
       for compassion and love. It is time that Americans realize the amorality of US hospitals
       forced to turn away the sick and poor. UHC is a health care system that aligns more closely
       with the core values that so many Americans espouse and respect, and it is time to realize
       its potential.

       Another common argument against UHC in the United States is that other comparable
       national health care systems, like that of England, France, or Canada, are bankrupt or rife
       with problems. UHC opponents claim that sick patients in these countries often wait in long
       lines or long wait lists for basic health care. Opponents also commonly accuse these
158 | WHAT IS ARGUMENTATION?

       systems of being unable to pay for themselves, racking up huge deficits year after year. A fair
       amount of truth lies in these claims, but Americans must remember to put those problems in
       context with the problems of the current US system as well. It is true that people often wait
       to see a doctor in countries with UHC, but we in the United States wait as well, and we often
       schedule appointments weeks in advance, only to have onerous waits in the doctor's
       "waiting rooms."

       Critical and urgent care abroad is always treated urgently, much the same as it is treated in
       the United States. The main difference there, however, is cost. Even health insurance policy
       holders are not safe from the costs of health care in the United States. Each day an
       American acquires a form of cancer, and the only effective treatment might be considered
       "experimental" by an insurance company and thus is not covered. Without medical coverage,
       the patient must pay for the treatment out of pocket. But these costs may be so prohibitive
       that the patient will either opt for a less effective, but covered, treatment; opt for no
       treatment at all; or attempt to pay the costs of treatment and experience unimaginable
       financial consequences. Medical bills in these cases can easily rise into the hundreds of
       thousands of dollars, which is enough to force even wealthy families out of their homes and
       into perpetual debt. Even though each American could someday face this unfortunate
       situation, many still choose to take the financial risk. Instead of gambling with health and
       financial welfare, US citizens should press their representatives to set up UHC, where their
       coverage will be guaranteed and affordable.

       Despite the opponents' claims against UHC, a universal system will save lives and encourage
       the health of all Americans. Why has public education been so easily accepted, but not
       public health care? It is time for Americans to start thinking socially about health in the same
       ways they think about education and police services: as rights of US citizens.

Student Writing Example

Salvaging Our Old-Growth Forests

It's been so long since I've been there I can't clearly remember what it's like. I can only look at
the pictures in my family photo album. I found the pictures of me when I was a little girl
standing in front of a towering tree with what seems like endless miles and miles of forest in
the background. My mom is standing on one side of me holding my hand, and my older
brother is standing on the other side of me, making a strange face. The faded pictures don't
do justice to the real-life magnificence of the forest in which they were taken--the Olympic
National Forest--but they capture the awe my parents felt when they took their children to
the ancient forest.

Today these forests are threatened by the timber companies that want state and federal
governments to open protected old-growth forests to commercial logging. The timber
industry's lobbying attempts must be rejected because the logging of old-growth forests is
unnecessary, because it will destroy a delicate and valuable ecosystem, and because these
rare forests are a sacred trust.

Those who promote logging of old-growth forests offer several reasons, but when closely
examined, none is substantial. First, forest industry spokesmen tell us the forest will
regenerate after logging is finished. This argument is flawed. In reality, the logging industry
clear-cuts forests on a 50-80 year cycle, so that the ecosystem being destroyed--one built up
over more than 250 years--will never be replaced. At most, the replanted trees will reach only
one-third the age of the original trees. Because the same ecosystem cannot rebuild if the
trees do not develop full maturity, the plants and animals that depend on the complex
ecosystem--with its incredibly tall canopies and trees of all sizes and ages--cannot survive.
The forest industry brags about replaceable trees but doesn't mention a thing about the
irreplaceable ecosystems.

Another argument used by the timber industry, as forestry engineer D. Alan Rockwood has
said in a personal correspondence, is that "an old-growth forest is basically a forest in
decline....The biomass is decomposing at a higher rate than tree growth." According to
Rockwood, preserving old-growth forests is "wasting a resource" since the land should be
used to grow trees rather than let the old ones slowly rot away, especially when harvesting
the trees before they rot would provide valuable lumber. But the timber industry looks only at
160 | WHAT IS ARGUMENTATION?

       the trees, not at the incredibly diverse bio-system which the ancient trees create and nourish.
       The mixture of young and old-growth trees creates a unique habitat that logging would
       destroy.

       Perhaps the main argument used by the logging industry is economic. Using the plight of
       loggers to their own advantage, the industry claims that logging old-growth forests will
       provide jobs. They make all of us feel sorry for the loggers by giving us an image of a
       hardworking man put out of work and unable to support his family. They make us imagine
       the sad eyes of the logger's children. We think, "How's he going to pay the electricity bill?
       How's he going to pay the mortgage? Will his family become homeless?" We all see these
       images in our minds and want to give the logger his job so his family won't suffer. But in
       reality giving him his job back is only a temporary solution to a long-term problem. Logging in
       the old-growth forest couldn't possibly give the logger his job for long. For example,
       according to Peter Morrison of the Wilderness Society, all the old-growth forests in the
       Gifford Pinchot National Forest would be gone in three years if it were opened to logging (vi).
       What will the loggers do then? Loggers need to worry about finding new jobs now and not
       wait until there are no old-growth trees left.

       Having looked at the views of those who favor logging of old-growth forests, let's turn to the
       arguments for preserving all old growth. Three main reasons can be cited.

       First, it is simply unnecessary to log these forests to supply the world's lumber. According to
       environmentalist Mark Sagoff, we have plenty of new-growth forests from which timber can
       be taken (89-90). Recently, there have been major reforestation efforts all over the United
       States, and it is common practice now for loggers to replant every tree that is harvested.
       These new-growth forests, combined with extensive planting of tree farms, provide more
       than enough wood for the world's needs. According to forestry expert Robert Sedjo (qtd. in
       Sagoff 90), tree farms alone can supply the world's demand for industrial lumber. Although
       tree farms are ugly and possess little diversity in their ecology, expanding tree farms is far
       preferable to destroying old-growth forests.

       Moreover, we can reduce the demand for lumber. Recycling, for example, can cut down on
       the use of trees for paper products. Another way to reduce the amount of trees used for
       paper is with a promising new innovation, kenaf, a fast-growing, 15-foot-tall, annual herb that
       is native to Africa. According to Jack Page in Plant Earth, Forest, kenaf has long been used
       to make rope, and it has been found to work just as well for paper pulp (158).

       Another reason to protect old-growth forests is the value of their complex and very delicate
       ecosystem. The threat of logging to the northern spotted owl is well known. Although
                                                                                                               WHAT IS ARGUMENTATION? | 161

loggers say "people before owls," ecologists consider the owls to be warnings, like canaries
in mine shafts that signal the health of the whole ecosystem. Evidence provided by the World
Resource Institute shows that continuing logging will endanger other species. Also, Dr. David
Brubaker, an environmentalist biologist at Seattle University, has said in a personal interview
that the long-term effects of logging will be severe. Loss of the spotted owl, for example,
may affect the small rodent population, which at the moment is kept in check by the predator
owl. Dr. Brubaker also explained that the old-growth forests also connect to salmon runs.
When dead timber falls into the streams, it creates a habitat conducive to spawning. If the
dead logs are removed, the habitat is destroyed. These are only two examples in a long list
of animals that would be harmed by logging of old-growth forests.

Finally, it is wrong to log in old-growth forests because of their sacred beauty. When you walk
in an old-growth forest, you are touched by a feeling that ordinary forests can't evoke. As you
look up to the sky, all you see is branch after branch in a canopy of towering trees. Each of
these amazingly tall trees feels inhabited by a spirit; it has its own personality. "For spiritual
bliss take a few moments and sit quietly in the Grove of the patriarchs near Mount Rainier or
the redwood forests of Northern California," said Richard Linder, environmental activist and
member of the National Wildlife Federation. "Sit silently," he said, "and look at the giant living
organisms you're surrounded by; you can feel the history of your own species." Although
Linder is obviously biased in favor of preserving the forests, the spiritual awe he feels for
ancient trees is shared by millions of other people who recognize that we destroy something
of the world's spirit when we destroy ancient trees, or great whales, or native runs of salmon.
According to Al Gore, "We have become so successful at controlling nature that we have lost
our connection to it" (qtd. in Sagoff 96). We need to find that connection again, and one
place we can find it is in the old-growth forests.

The old-growth forests are part of the web of life. If we cut this delicate strand of the web, we
may end up destroying the whole. Once the old trees are gone, they are gone forever. Even if
foresters replanted every tree and waited 250 years for the trees to grow to ancient size, the
genetic pool would be lost. We'd have a 250-year-old tree farm, not an old-growth forest. If
we want to maintain a healthy earth, we must respect the beauty and sacredness of the old-
growth forests.

Summary

In argumentative writing, you are typically asked to take a position on an issue
or topic and explain and support your position with research from reliable and
credible sources. Argumentation can be used to convince readers to accept or
acknowledge the validity of your position or to question or refute a position you
consider to be untrue or misguided.

   · The purpose of argument in writing is to convince or move readers toward a
      certain point of view, or opinion.

   · An argument is a reasoned opinion supported and explained by evidence. To
      argue, in writing, is to advance knowledge and ideas in a positive way.

   · A thesis that expresses the opinion of the writer in more specific terms is
      better than one that is vague.

   · It is essential that you not only address counterarguments but also do so
      respectfully.

   · It is also helpful to establish the limits of your argument and what you are
      trying to accomplish through a concession statement.

   · To persuade a skeptical audience, you will need to use a wide range of
      evidence. Scientific studies, opinions from experts, historical precedent,
      statistics, personal anecdotes, and current events are all types of evidence that
      you might use in explaining your point.

   · Make sure that your word choice and writing style are appropriate for both
      your subject and your audience.

   · You should let your reader know your bias, but do not let that bias blind you to
      the primary components of good argumentation: sound, thoughtful evidence
      and respectfully and reasonably addressing opposing ideas.

   · You should be mindful of the use of I in your writing because it can make your
      argument sound more biased than it needs to.
164 | WHAT IS ARGUMENTATION?

   · Facts are statements that can be proven using objective data.
   · Opinions are personal views, or judgments, that cannot be proven.
   · In writing, you want to strike a balance between credible facts and

      authoritative opinions.
   · Quantitative visuals present data graphically. The purpose of using

      quantitative visuals is to make logical appeals to the audience.
   · Qualitative visuals present images that appeal to the audience's emotions

RHETORIC OF ARGUMENTATION

Terri Pantuso

Argument is not the loud, assertive, unwavering statement of your opinion in the
hopes of conquering the opposition. Argument is the careful consideration of
numerous positions and the careful development of logically sound, carefully
constructed assertions that, when combined, offer a worthwhile perspective in an
ongoing debate. Certainly you want to imagine yourself arguing with others--and
certainly you want to believe your ideas have superior qualities to theirs--but the
purpose of argument in the college setting is not to solve a practical problem or
shut down a conversation. Rather, it's to illuminate, expand, and further inform a
debate happening on a worthwhile subject between reasonable, intelligent people.
In other words, calling the opposition stupid is not good argument, it's an ad
hominem attack. For a review of this and other logical fallacies, refer to section 3.7
of this text.

   Some of the key tools of argument are the strategies that students are asked to
consider when doing a rhetorical analysis. Before beginning an argument of your
own, review the basic concepts of rhetorical appeals below. As you plan and draft
your own argument, carefully use the following elements of rhetoric to your own
advantage.

Rhetorical Appeals

Logos

The use of data, statistical evidence, and sufficient support to establish the
practicality and rationality of your claims should be the strongest element of your
argument. To have a logically sound argument, you should include:

   · A debatable and supportable claim
   · Logical reasoning to support your claim
166 | FEATURES OF AN ARGUMENT

   · Sound evidence and examples to justify the reasoning
   · Reasonable projections
   · Concessions & rebuttals
   · Avoid logical fallacies

Ethos

The ethical and well-balanced use of all of the strategies above will help you to
present yourself as trustworthy and intelligent in your consideration of the topic
and in the development of your argument. This balance should include the use of
credible, relevant sources which can be accomplished through research methods
utilizing the strategies governing your discipline. Following those strategies will
build your credibility as a writer of argument, particularly in the college setting,
as you pay attention to the needs of the audience with regard to presentation
and style. In college, this means that you have used the style manual (MLA, APA,
Chicago, etc.) required for the assignment and appropriate to the audience. In so
doing, make certain to cite the sources you have used according to the style manual
you are using.

Pathos

The use of examples and language that evoke an appropriate emotional response in
your reader--that gets them to care about your topic--can be helpful in argument.
For academic essays, pathos may be useful in introductory sections, concluding
sections, or as ways to link various parts of the paper together. However, if your
argument is based solely or primarily upon emotional appeals, it will be viewed as
weak in an academic setting, especially when data or ethical sources can disprove
your claims. Therefore, college writing often puts more emphasis on logos and
ethos.

Approaches to Argument

A well-structured argument is one that is carefully and optimally planned. It is
organized so that the argument has a continuous building of ideas, one upon the
other or in concert with the other, in order to produce the most persuasive impact
                                                                                                                      FEATURES OF AN ARGUMENT | 167

or effect on the reader. For clarity, avoid repeating ideas, reasons, or evidence.
Instead, consider how each idea in your argument connects to the others. Should
some ideas come before others? Should you build your reasons from simple to
complex or from complex to simple? Should you present the counterargument
before your reasons? Or, would it make more sense for you to present your reasons
and then the concessions and rebuttals? How can you use clear transitional
phrases to facilitate reader comprehension of your argument? Consider these
questions while constructing and revising your argument.

Simple to Complex/Complex to Simple

Whether structuring a paragraph or a research paper, the simple to complex (or
reverse) method can be an effective way to build cohesion throughout your writing.
Just as the phrase implies, simple to complex is when a writer introduces a simple
concept then builds upon it to heighten interest. Sometimes, the opposite structure
works to move the reader through your position. For example, if you choose to write
on the topic of pollution as it impacts the world, you might begin with the concept
of straws and sea turtles. Your simple topic of sea turtles swallowing straws thrown
away might then move to the complex issues of consumption, consumerism and
disposal. Conversely, if you begin with the broad, complex topic of consumerism,
you could then move to the story of the sea turtles as a way of building pathos in the
reader. Whichever method you choose, make sure that the relationship between
the topics is logical and clear so that readers find validity in your position.

Cause/Effect

The cause/effect method is a way of establishing a reason, or reasons, why
something has occurred. For example, if you live in south Texas, then you
understand the problem that mosquitoes cause in the hot, humid summer months.
While there is no way to eliminate all mosquitoes, there are ways to minimize their
growth in your backyard. If you research the ways in which mosquitoes are born,
you would understand the importance of things such as emptying containers of
all stagnant water so that they cannot incubate or keeping your grass mowed
to eliminate areas for them to populate. The process by which you go through
to determine the cause of mosquito infestations is the cause and effect method.
In argumentation, you might use this method to support a claim for community
168 | FEATURES OF AN ARGUMENT

efforts to prevent mosquitoes from growing in your neighborhood. Demonstrating
that process is effective for a logos based argument.

Chronological

Sometimes an argument is presented best when a sequential pattern is used.
Oftentimes, that pattern will be based on the pattern of time in which the sequence
occurs. For example, if you are writing an argumentative essay in which you are
calling for a new stop light to be installed at a busy intersection, you might utilize
a chronological structure to demonstrate the rate of increased accidents over a
given period of time at that intersection. If your pattern demonstrates a marked
increase in accidents, then your data would show a logical reason for supporting
your position. Oftentimes, a chronological pattern involves steps indicated by signal
words such as first, next, and finally. Utilizing this pattern will walk readers through
your line of reasoning and guide them towards reaching your proposed conclusion.

Emphatic

Another method for organizing your writing is by order of importance. This method
is often referred to as emphatic because organization is done based upon
emphasis. The direction you choose to go is yours whether you begin with the
strongest, most important point of your argument, or the weakest. In either case,
the hierarchy of ideas should be clear to readers. The emphatic method is often
subjectively based upon the writer's beliefs. If, for example, you want to build an
argument for a new rail system to be used in your city, you will have to decide which
reason is most important and which is simply support material. For one writer, the
decrease in the number of cars on the road might be the most important aspect as
it would result in a reduction of toxic emissions. For another writer, the time saved
for commuters might be the most important aspect. The decision to start with your
strongest or weakest point is one of style.

Style/ Eloquence

When we discuss style in academic writing, we generally mean the use of formal
language appropriate for the given academic audience and occasion. Academics
                                                                                                                      FEATURES OF AN ARGUMENT | 169

generally favor Standard American English and the use of precise language that
avoids idioms, clichés, or dull, simple word choices. This is not to imply that these
tropes are not useful; however, strong academic writing is typically objective and
frequently avoids the use of first-person pronouns unless the disciplinary style and
conventions suggest otherwise.

   Some writing assignments allow you to choose your audience. In that case, the
style in which you write may not be the formal, precise Standard American English
that the academy prefers. For some writing assignments, you may even be asked to
use, where appropriate, poetic or figurative language or language that evokes the
senses. Additionally, instructors should be cognizant of second language learners
and the variations in style when writing in a non-native language.

   In all cases, it is important to understand what style of writing your audience
expects, as delivering your argument in that style could make it more persuasive.

BASIC STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF
ARGUMENT

   Amanda Lloyd; Emilie Zickel; Robin Jeffrey; and Terri Pantuso

When you are tasked with crafting an argumentative essay, it is likely that you will
be expected to craft your argument based upon a given number of sources-all of
which should support your topic in some way. Your instructor might provide these
sources for you, ask you to locate these sources, or provide you with some sources
and ask you to find others. Whether or not you are asked to do additional research,
an argumentative essay should contain the following basic components.

Claim: What Do You Want the Reader to Believe?

In an argument paper, the thesis is often called a claim. This claim is a statement
in which you take a stand on a debatable issue. A strong, debatable claim has at
least one valid counterargument, an opposite or alternative point of view that is as
sensible as the position that you take in your claim. In your thesis statement, you
should clearly and specifically state the position you will convince your audience to
adopt. One way to accomplish this is via either a closed or open thesis statement.

   A closed thesis statement includes sub-claims or reasons why you choose to
support your claim.

     Example of Closed Thesis Statement

     The city of Houston has displayed a commitment to attracting new residents by making
     improvements to its walkability, city centers, and green spaces.
                                                                                          BASIC STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF ARGUMENT | 171

In this instance, walkability, city centers, and green spaces are the sub-claims, or
reasons, why you would make the claim that Houston is attracting new residents.

   An open thesis statement does not include sub-claims and might be more
appropriate when your argument is less easy to prove with two or three easily-
defined sub-claims.

     Example of Open Thesis Statement

     The city of Houston is a vibrant metropolis with a commitment to attracting new residents.

The choice between an open or a closed thesis statement often depends upon the
complexity of your argument. Another possible construction would be to start with
a research question and see where your sources take you.

   A research question approach might ask a large question that will be narrowed
down with further investigation.

     Example of Research Question Approach

     What has the city of Houston done to attract new residents and/or make the city more
     accessible?

As you research the question, you may find that your original premise is invalid or
incomplete. The advantage to starting with a research question is that it allows for
your writing to develop more organically according to the latest research. When
in doubt about how to structure your thesis statement, seek the advice of your
instructor or a writing center consultant.

A Note on Context: What Background Information About the
172 | BASIC STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF ARGUMENT

Topic Does Your Audience Need?

Before you get into defending your claim, you will need to place your topic (and
argument) into context by including relevant background material. Remember,
your audience is relying on you for vital information such as definitions, historical
placement, and controversial positions. This background material might appear in
either your introductory paragraph(s) or your body paragraphs. How and where
to incorporate background material depends a lot upon your topic, assignment,
evidence, and audience. In most cases, kairos, or an opportune moment, factors
heavily in the ways in which your argument may be received.

Evidence or Grounds: What Makes Your Reasoning
Valid?

To validate the thinking that you put forward in your claim and sub-claims, you
need to demonstrate that your reasoning is based on more than just your personal
opinion. Evidence, sometimes referred to as grounds, can take the form of research
studies or scholarship, expert opinions, personal examples, observations made by
yourself or others, or specific instances that make your reasoning seem sound
and believable. Evidence only works if it directly supports your reasoning -- and
sometimes you must explain how the evidence supports your reasoning (do not
assume that a reader can see the connection between evidence and reason that
you see).

Warrants: Why Should a Reader Accept Your Claim?

A warrant is the rationale the writer provides to show that the evidence properly
supports the claim with each element working towards a similar goal. Think of
warrants as the glue that holds an argument together and ensures that all pieces
work together coherently.

   An important way to ensure you are properly supplying warrants within your
argument is to use topic sentences for each paragraph and linking sentences
within that connect the particular claim directly back to the thesis. Ensuring that
there are linking sentences in each paragraph will help to create consistency within
your essay. Remember, the thesis statement is the driving force of organization in
                                                                                          BASIC STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF ARGUMENT | 173

your essay, so each paragraph needs to have a specific purpose (topic sentence) in
proving or explaining your thesis. Linking sentences completes this task within the
body of each paragraph and creates cohesion. These linking sentences will often
appear after your textual evidence in a paragraph.

UNDERSTANDING AND COMPOSING
RESEARCHED ARGUMENTS

   Cynthia Kiefer and Serene Rock

Introduction

                                                        Thinking by LAFS
                                                        from the Noun
                                                        Project

Unit 4 brings together and further develops your academic composing,
metaliteracy, and rhetorical knowledge and skills. The content in the chapter
assumes some previous experience with college research and writing, so after a
brief introduction to argument, the chapter will focus on two major projects: the
synthesis project and the solution proposal project. In the first project, you will
analyze and synthesize two different perspectives on the same issue through a
synthesis paper or project to sharpen your critical thinking and analytic skills. In
addition, the arguments analyzed and compared in the project's source material
serves as a model of the different ways writers develop and support their arguments
with rhetorical appeals, evidence, rhetorical language choices, and explanatory
commentary. The second project asks you to develop a proposal solution in an
argument in which you immerse yourself in researching a current narrowed issue
or problem, provide background to the problem, explain why it is a problem and
must be addressed now, and provide feasible solutions to the problem. The second
                                                                                                                                              ARGUMENT | 175

project also includes several suggestions for creating related digital projects to
share your knowledge and solutions with your peers and others.

     Learning Objectives

     In this chapter, you will :

          · identify features and types of argument.
          · apply your rhetorical knowledge and skill when analyzing varying perspectives on the

             same topic.
          · compose a formal academic written synthesis paper or project comparing two different

             texts with opposing perspectives on the same issue.
          · create a research question related to an issue or problem in a state, national, or global

             context/s.
          · conduct a thorough research process and select the most relevant, credible key sources.
          · select and narrow sources to detail in a formal, written Annotated Bibliography.
          · create an "explainer" video on your argument's topic (what is happening and background

             to the problem).
          · create and narrow an argumentative stance (position) on a researched topic.
          · plan, organize, and draft a formal proposal argument paper or project.
          · apply feedback from peers, tutors, and instructors on written and digital compositions
          · create an infographic containing a call to action, focused your argument's proposal.

Understanding Features and Types of Arguments

                                                    fahmionline, the Noun
                                                    Project

This section assumes you have some knowledge and experience with argument,
but just to make sure we share a common understanding, the content in this
section will provide sufficient background to refresh and expand your knowledge
of argument and academic argument vocabulary terms.

Features of ACADEMIC Argument

A clear and arguable position: You must present a reasonable argument for which
both evidence and opposing or alternate views (counterarguments) exist. If few
would disagree with you or you cannot find any evidence of a credible opposing
view, you should consider rethinking and revising your position. A common error
occurs when students try to present a statement of fact as an argumentative
position. See the examples at the end of this section to learn how an idea or
statement of fact can be developed and revised to become an effective thesis
statement.

   An obvious organizational structure: A solid argument takes planning. If your
argument is disorganized or the thesis and/or the key reasons are unclear or placed
in a confusing order, your argument and supporting content may not be taken
seriously. Taking the time to plan the essay with a rough phrase-form outline
including your citations will save you hours of time when you start writing.
                                                                                                                                              ARGUMENT | 177

       Although many teachers begin to teach some version of argument with the writing of a thesis
       statement, in reality, good argument begins with looking at the data that are likely to become
       the evidence in an argument and that give rise to a thesis statement or major claim. A thesis
       statement arises from a question, which in turn rises from the examination of information or
       data of sort. -- George Hillocks, former professor emeritus at the University of Chicago in the
       Departments of Education and English Language
       and Literature

Necessary background information: You must present the issues, history, or larger
contexts that provide the foundation for understanding your argument so that your
readers (and you) can comprehend and see the urgency in the specific argument
you are making. That is, you must acknowledge the current rhetorical context and
provide a sense of the argument's importance or exigence.

   Viable reasons for your position: Your argument offers valid reasons for your
position for which you provide relevant evidence. These reasons usually become the
key points expressed in your topic sentences.

   Convincing evidence: You present convincing, credible, relevant researched
evidence including facts, statistics, surveys, expert testimony, anecdotes, and
textual (i.e. such as history, reports, analyses) evidence. You may also include
personal testimony if you have direct experience you can provide as evidence,
but primarily, you are providing researched evidence. (Think logos, ethos, pathos,
Kairos when selecting your evidence. Varying evidence types will help you vary the
rhetorical appeals and create a more balanced argument and greater audience
appeal.)

   Appeals to readers' values: Effective arguments appeal to readers' emotions,
values, wants, and needs. You might appeal to your readers' sense of compassion
or justice through a compelling narrative/anecdote, for example. (Think pathos
and ethos when appealing or acknowledging your audience's concerns or possible
thoughts.)

   A trustworthy tone: Through a confident tone, clear focus, knowledgeable voice,
and well-researched, credible evidence, you can develop readers' confidence in your
credibility. (Convey to your audience that you possess internal ethos!) Also, vague
or shallow evidence and writing that is unedited and/or too informal in tone will
reduce your audience's trust in your argument.

   Careful consideration of counterarguments: You present your awareness of
178 | ARGUMENT

opposing views about your argument to address the audience's needs or
expectations and to reinforce your internal ethos with their trust. If you do not
address the "yeah, but" or "what about" in your readers' or listeners' minds, your
argument may not be taken seriously and, even worse, your audience will think
you have not researched your topic well enough or that you underestimate their
existing knowledge. You should concede some points the opposition makes and
refute others through evidence when you can.

   Appropriate use of patterns of development to present your argument: Your
argument reflects application of the most effective patterns of development (i.e.
exemplification, explanation, analysis, classification, comparison/contrast,
definition, description, narration), with which to develop the content supporting
your reasons (typically your reasons are the discussion points or topic sentences for
your body paragraphs).

     Example: Can a statement of fact evolve into a strong argumentative thesis statement?

     When presenting your stance in an argumentative thesis statement, make sure you have stated
     an argument and not a simple statement of fact or an expository thesis statement like you
     would write for a report.
     Statement of Fact: Some social media users develop unhealthy attitudes about their body
     image because of the constant portrayal of "ideal" body types they encounter online.
     Expository Thesis Statement: Excessive social media use can cause unhealthy physical and
     mental conditions, particularly for girls and young women.
     Overarching Point Argumentative Thesis Statement: Social media users should restrict
     themselves from the exposure to unrealistic photos and from the portrayal of the "ideal" body
     type in order to prevent the development of significant health issues.
     Argument Thesis Statement with Broadcasting of Discussion Points (Reasons/Minor
     Premises): Social media users should restrict themselves from the exposure to unrealistic
     photos and from the portrayal of the "ideal" body type in order to prevent harmful physical and
     mental health conditions linked with excessive social media use.
     Proposal Solution Argument Thesis Statement: To help users moderate their exposure to
     unrealistic photos and "ideal" body types associated with harmful physical and mental health
                                                                                                                                              ARGUMENT | 179

     conditions, social media companies should provide users with informative public service
     announcements focused on healthy body image, display advertising promoting healthy body
     images and attitudes, and develop filters and messaging preferences to help end users control
     their media stream content.
     THESIS TIPS: When you compare the statements above, it is clear that a solid expository or
     argumentative thesis statement can contain factual information, but it must be a more complex
     idea that requires more development and evidence. The simple statement of fact above does
     not pass the "so what?" or "why?" test. When a thesis makes a claim about what a person or
     organization should do, think, or say, you are in the realm of argument. A useful strategy for
     developing a strong argumentative thesis statement is to answer this question: Who should do
     what and why?

ACTIVATING AN INQUIRY-BASED MINDSET FOR CREATING
ARGUMENTS

Using a questioning heuristic can help you generate ("invent") an academic
argument. Just as you pre-research a possible argument topic to see what others
are saying about it ("the current conversation" in public discourse) or just bubble
map or list to generate some ideas or list some research questions, you also need
to "interrogate" the argument you are forming before you go too far with your
research. In fact, working through these questions about the argument will help
you identify holes in the argument you can address with specific research questions
for your next round of rhetorical research.

                              QUESTIONING HEURISTIC FOR INVENTING AN ARGUMENT
       Questions are at the core of arguments. What matters is not just that you believe that what
       you have to say is true, but that you give others viable reasons to believe it as well--and also
       show them that you have considered the issue from multiple angles. To do that, build your
       argument out of the answers to the five questions a rational reader will expect answers to.
        In academic and professional writing, we tend to build arguments from the answers to these
       main questions:
180 | ARGUMENT

           1. What do you want me to do or think?
           2. Why should I do or think that?
           3. How do I know that what you say is true?
           4. Why should I accept the reasons that support your claim?
           5. What about this other idea, fact, or consideration?
           6. How should you present your argument?

       When you ask people to do or think something they otherwise would not, they quite naturally
       want to know why they should do so. In fact, people tend to ask the same questions. As you
       make a reasonable argument, you anticipate and respond to readers' questions with a
       particular part of argument:

       1. The answer to What do you want me to do or think? is your conclusion: "I conclude that you
       should do or think X."

       2. The answer to Why should I do or think that? states your premise: "You should do or think
       X because . . ."

       3. The answer to How do I know that what you say is true? presents your support: "You can
       believe my reasons because they are supported by a thorough review of the available
       information and this carefully selected, credible evidence . . ."

       4. The answer to Why should I accept that your reasons support your claim? states your
       general principle of reasoning, called a warrant: which is/are assumptions and/or values the
       author holds and possibly the audience holds as well). "My specific reason supports my
       specific claim because whenever this general condition is true, we can generally draw a
       conclusion like mine." "I know people in my audience value the importance of X, just as I do."

       5. The answer to What about this other idea, fact, or conclusion? acknowledges that your
       readers might see things differently and then responds to their counterarguments.

       6. The answer to How should you present your argument? leads to the point of
       view, organization, and tone that you should use when making your arguments.

       As you have noticed, the answers to these questions involve knowing the particular
       vocabulary about argument because these terms refer to specific parts of an argument. The
       remainder of this section will cover the terms referred to in the questions listed above as well
       as others that will help you better understand the building blocks of argument.

Types of Academic Arguments

       ARGUMENT GENRES

       rhetoric/chapter/argument-genres/
       Sometimes writing instructors assign specific types of arguments. These genre
        arguments have different purposes and will require different writing strategies. These
       purposes and strategies require writers to assume different roles. If assigned one of these
       arguments, you may find yourself investigating a cause, defining a term, evaluating a
       product, or solving a problem. You'll still be arguing and using rhetorical principles to make
       these arguments, but you'll need to consider your role as you compose your argument.

     Causal Arguments

       In a causal argument, a writer must argue about a problem's or controversy's cause. Causal
       arguments are difficult because most controversial issues have complicated causes. Many
       people will also tend to believe causes that correspond to their political beliefs when
       considering causes. Consider the various explanations for school shootings. Some will insist
       the problem is the easy availability of firearms while others will insist that shooters are
       inspired by violent video games and entertainment. When making a causal argument, a
       writer should consider their biases and rely on evidence to support their claims.
       In a causal argument, writers may be tempted by logical fallacies. For example, it's important
       to remember the correlation is not equal to causation. If two events happen at the same
       time, that doesn't necessarily mean that one event caused the other. We only have to
       consider an extreme example to see this. Imagine someone saying, "John wrecked his car
       last night when the moon was full, and Jim did the same. The full moon must have affected
182 | ARGUMENT

       their driving." While most people wouldn't believe this, we can investigate other possible
       causes. Were there poor road conditions? Were Jim and/or John drunk? Driving unsafely?
       People will make similar errors when one event follows another. To avoid making these
       mistakes, writers should consider alternative causes when making a causal argument; these
       are opposing views that should be considered. If you find an alternative explanation stronger
       than your initial version, then you should make that your paper's conclusion.

     Definition Arguments

       This type of argument may seem puzzling. How do we argue about a word's definition? Isn't
       that what dictionaries are for? For most definition arguments, the real argument isn't the
       precise meaning of the word. Instead, the argument is about the implications of that
       definition and how the definition may be applied to specific situations. Consider the word
       "obscene." One dictionary defines "obscene" as "offensive or disgusting by accepted
       standards of morality and decency." A writer may want to argue that Playboy is obscene. Or
       that a recent controversial film is obscene. By making this kind of argument, the writer would
       suggest some course of action: the obscene material should be age-limited, should be
       condemned, or should be banned. In this kind of paper the author would make claims about
       "accepted standards" and "offensive or disgusting" as they apply to the potentially obscene
       item.
       Many popular arguments rely of definitions. Determining whether something is obscene or
       offensive is just one popular item. As part of the War on Terror, we've argued about the
       meaning of "torture" and its justification. Many death penalty arguments rely upon the terms
       "cruel and unusual punishment." The Iraq war inspired many arguments about "just" and
       "unjust" wars, as did the Vietnam war did decades earlier.

     Evaluation Arguments

       You may be more familiar with evaluation arguments than you realize. If you've ever read a
       movie, restaurant, or other product review, you've read an evaluation argument. As online
       shopping and social media have expanded, you may have even written your own evaluation
       argument on Amazon, Google, or Yelp. A good evaluation argument will rely upon clear
       criteria. "Criteria" (singular "criterion") are the conditions by which you make your evaluation;
       these conditions could be used to evaluate any thing that's in the same category. A
                                                                                                                                     ARGUMENT | 183

restaurant review may be based upon the food quality, price, service, and ambiance of the
restaurant. An evaluation should also consider the specific category of what's being
evaluated: one shouldn't evaluate a local pub with the same criteria as a fine dining
establishment. By establishing a narrow category, the writer can write a more accurate
evaluation.

A writer should strive to be fair when writing a review. You've probably seen a one-star
Amazon review that says something like "The product arrived three days late." This probably
isn't a fair review of the product, as its makers may have had no role in the product's untimely
delivery. When directing praise or blame in an evaluation consider how much to weigh each
criteria and even the criteria against each other. Audience is important for a review. For
example, a writer reviewing a horror movie for a horror fan website would probably offer a
different review than a writer for The New York Times.

Evaluation arguments aren't only used with products or services. Evaluation arguments are
useful for supporting or opposing public policies or proposed laws. A community may
propose several solutions to deal with a school district's budget woes. A teacher from that
district may write a guest editorial arguing for the best policy, or write an article criticizing a
poor choice.

Proposal Argument (Problem/Solution)

Proposal arguments require the writer to perform two tasks: argue that there is a problem,
and then propose a solution to that problem. Usually, the problem will be a local problem:
Pueblo, Colorado has a high teen pregnancy rate. It's good to focus on a smaller community
because national or global problems or much more complex. In the United States, many
states have varying laws and approaches to problems, so arguing about a problem is
difficult. Additionally, Portland, Oregon may suffer from different problems than Portland,
Maine. Writing an argument that addresses those complexities is often beyond the capability
of most first year students and beyond the scope of the short papers assigned in a
composition class.

Proposals have two separate arguments. The first is the problem: it's not enough to label an
issue a problem; a writer must prove that the problem is severe to an audience. Take, for
instance, the opioid crisis. A writer may need to convince community members who aren't
addicts why the crisis is a problem for their community, so it's not enough to discuss how
addiction hurts addicts. Showing how the community is harmed by the crime associated
184 | ARGUMENT

       with addiction might motivate a community to solve the problem. The key to establishing a
       problem is showing that the problem is severe to the audience because a proposal is asking
       readers to fix the problem.
       The second argument is the solution. Explain what the solution is and how it solves the
       problem. A writer should establish that their solution is the best solution. The best solution is
       the cheapest solution that best addresses the problem. "Cheapest" here refers not just to
       monetary costs. While monetary costs are important, there are other costs. What are the
       labor costs of the solution? How will people's lives be changed? How might people be
       angered by the solution or its implementation? "Addressing the problem" is an
       acknowledgment that most proposals won't completely solve a problem. The goal is a
       reasonable solution that eliminates most of the harm, or the most serious harm, caused by
       the problem. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of proposals is considering the unintended
       consequences of a solution. These can be positive or negative. Writers should ask "What
       happens next?" of their solutions. Will a solution that lowers teen pregnancies also improve
       the dropout rate in the school district? Will it also require more resources be moved from
       other school programs?

     Key Takeaway: What are Key Features of Argument?

     With this brief introduction, you can see what rhetorical or academic argument is not:
          · An argument need not be controversial or about a controversy. (It could, for example,
             promote a solution that most would agree is needed.)
          · An argument is not a mere fight supported with beliefs and emotional reasoning.
          · An argument does not have a single winner or loser.
          · An argument is not a mere opinion.
          · An argument is not a statement of fact.

     Furthermore, you can see what rhetorical argument is:
                                                                                                                                              ARGUMENT | 185

          · An argument is a claim asserted as true. (That is, you state your argument as fact. You
             avoid "I think" or "it seems to me" which would weaken your stance. That's one reason
             most academic arguments are written in third person, formal point-of-view.)

          · An argument is arguable.
          · An argument must be reasonable.
          · An argument must be supported with reasons and supporting evidence.
          · An argument in a formal essay is called a thesis. Supporting arguments (minor premises)

             can be called topic sentences.
          · An argument can be explicit or implicit. (Directly stated or inferred)
          · An argument must be adapted to its rhetorical situation.

How Logical Reasoning, Rhetorical Appeals, and
evidence Work to support an Argument

                                                 from the Noun Project

Now that you understand the basic features, and types of argument more fully,
186 | ARGUMENT

you are ready to dig a more deeply into understanding how effective arguments
are developed. This requires critically analyzing the viewpoints of others-and
yourself-using logical reasoning to test the ideas and assumptions on which an
argument is founded. The first subsection below will give you the thinking tools
to do that. In addition, examining how you and other rhetors use a balance of
rhetorical appeals and types of relevant, effective, and ethically presented evidence

     Key Vocabulary

          · Conclusion--a claim that is asserted as true. One part of an argument.
          · Premise--a reason behind a conclusion. The other part of an argument. Most

             conclusions have more than one premise.
          · Statement--a declarative sentence that can be evaluated as true or false. The parts of an

             argument, premises and the conclusion, should be statements.
          · Standard Argument Form--a numbered breakdown of the parts of an argument

             (conclusion and all premises).
          · Premise Indicators--terms that signal that a premise, or reason, is coming.
          · Conclusion Indicator--terms that signal that a conclusion, or claim, is coming.
          · Support--anything used as proof or reasoning for an argument. This includes evidence,

             experience, and logic.
          · Warrant--the connection made between the support and the reasons of an argument.
          · Counterargument--an opposing argument to the one you make. An argument can have

             multiple counterarguments.
          · Complex Arguments-these are formed by more than individual premises that point to a

             conclusion. Complex arguments may have layers to them, including an intermediate
             argument that may act as both a conclusion (with its own premises) and a premise (for
             the main conclusion).

Logos: Appeal to Logic

Rhetoric pertains to how authors use and manipulate language in order to persuade an
audience.

To be rhetorically effective (and thus persuasive), an author must engage the audience in a
variety of compelling rhetorical appeals. We can classify these as Logos, Pathos, and Ethos.

Logic. Reason. Rationality. Logos is brainy and intellectual, cool, calm, collected, objective.

Logically sound writing often includes many examples to support a point - and those
examples come from citation of credible data and statistics, reference to sound theories,
reference valid research conducted by credible organizations.

Logical appeals rest on rational modes of thinking, such as

     · Inductive reasoning: you use several specific examples or cases and use them to

Pathos: Appeal to Emotions

Pathos is deeply human - an author using pathetic appeals wants the audience
to feel something: anger or pride or joy or rage or happiness. Pathetic appeals rest on
emotion-based modes of communication . To engage the audience on an emotional level,
the author may

     · add expressive descriptions of people, places or events that helps the reader to feel or
        experience those events

     · include vivid imagery of people, places or events that helps the reader to feel like he or
        she is seeing those events

     · share personal stories that help the reader feel connected to the person being
        described

     · use vocabulary or sentence structure that revolves around a particular emotion:
        sadness, happiness, fear, joy, anger, disgust, horror.

     · try to include any information that will evoke an emotional response from the
        audience. This could involve making the audience feel empathy or disgust for the
        person/group/event being discussed, or perhaps connection to or rejection of the
        person/group/event being discussed.

Pathos-based strategies are any strategies that get the audience to "open up" to the topic or
to the author. Emotions can make us vulnerable, and rhetors can use this vulnerability to get
the audience on his or her side.
190 | ARGUMENT

     Ethos: Appeal to Values/Trust/Authority or Expertise

       Ethical appeals have two facets.

       External ethos is supported when a rhetor cites an expert or moral authority. For example, if
       you quote a scholarly researcher with expertise in a field, you are creating ethos. Sometimes
       that expert also conveys information within the quote from an expert, so this support serves
       two function. One the one hand, an ethical appeal also taps into the values that the audience
       holds, for example, patriotism, tradition, justice, equality, dignity for all humankind, self
       preservation, or other specific social, religious or philosophical values (Christian values,
       socialism, capitalism, feminism, etc). These values can sometimes feel very close to
       emotions, but they are felt on a social level rather than only on a personal level. If an author
       can evoke the values that the audience cares about in his or her argument, then he or she
       has a chance of persuading that audience because the audience will feel that the author is
       making an argument that is "right" (in the sense of moral "right"-ness).

       This sense of referencing what is "right" in an ethical appeal connects to the moral
       character of the speaker/author - the author's internal ethos. The author may draw
       attention to who he or she is as a way to engage the audience (i.e., "Because I support this
       - and you all you trust me because we share the same values! - you should, too"). If an author
       can present his or her moral character, one that the audience trusts because they (author
       and audience) share values, then he or she has a chance of persuading that audience. In
       this sense, the audience will feel that the author is the right person to make this argument
       and should therefore be believed. Another way to build your audience's sense of your internal
       ethos is to use rhetoric and evidence responsibly. Your argument should reflect sound
       reasoning and sufficient and highly credible ethos. That is, how you use external ethos,
       logos, and the emotional appeals in presenting your argument reflects your internal ethos or
       trustworthiness.

       In building ethical appeals, we see authors

            · referring either directly or indirectly to the values that matter to the intended audience
            · using reasoning or logic that relies on these values
            · using language, phrasing, imagery or other writing style common to people who hold

                those values - tapping into the discourse community of people with those values
            · doing anything else that shows the audience that the author understands and shares

                their values

Here are some things to think about avoiding when attempting to develop a strong source-
based essay. Just as understanding what logical fallacies are so you can avoid them in your
own writing, understand what weak evidence is can help you to avoid falling into the trap of
using it in your own work.

Failures in evidence occur when a reader says, "I do not accept your evidence". Here is why
that might happen:

     · The evidence that you have provided is inaccurate: You've misread information or
        misquoted; you are not interpreting the quoted material in an accurate manner

     · The evidence that you have provided is insufficient: You are using just a small piece of
        evidence to support your reasoning. You need more. You probably have a
        "generalization" fallacy.

     · The evidence that you have provided is unrelated to the reason: Your evidence does not
        clearly or directly relate to the point that you are trying to make.

     · The evidence that you have provided is incomplete or too narrowly chosen: You have
        "cherry picked" certain examples or pieces of information to the exclusion of others,
        so while you do have evidence to support your point, you are also neglecting a lot of
        other information

     · The evidence that you have provided is old: The information that you are citing is not
        relevant anymore. It is outdated!

     · The evidence that you have provided does not come from an authoritative source: The
        source of your evidence is not credible; the person being cited is not an authority on
        the Often paragraphs focus on sub-topics, or more specific examples of the topic. For
194 | ARGUMENT

                instance, the focus of an essay might be higher education, one topic discussed within
                it is marketing higher education, and a supportive sub-topic might be the use of social
                media to attract students.">topic
       One of the bigger issues with evidence is not so much with the evidence itself, but with the
       way that you integrate it into the paper. A reader needs to understand clearly how and why
       the evidence you chose relates to the point that you are making. As noted in Section
       4.4. evidence must always be explained. Whenever you integrate evidence into your papers, it
       is important to answer the question "How does this evidence support the point that I am
       making?". Never assume that the reader sees what you see in evidence. Always make it as
       clear as possible how the evidence supports the reason. It may be useful to you to draft your
       papers with Section 4.4 ready for reference so that you can avoid the pitfall of evidence with
       no explanation.

What is synthesis?

When you write a paper based on research, you typically blend a variety of evidence
from multiple sources. That is, you synthesize your research and integrate it into
                                                                                                                                              ARGUMENT | 195

your argument or report to support your claims and subclaims. most of you have
had experience synthesizing information this way. We use synthesis across many
genres and for different purposes. In another type of synthesis, you may have
used synthesis in analysis or critique papers, comparing how two different authors
critique a performance, film, or literary piece or two different poems about the same
concept.

   In composition and rhetoric courses, a common form of synthesis paper
instructors assign to students is the argument analysis of two different viewpoints
on the same issue. The arguments students analyze are typically written as
newspaper editorials, commentary pieces, and viewpoint essays. Instructors may
assign the argumentative pieces, or you may select your own on a topic you find
most interesting.

IDENTIFYING OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS ON KEY TOPICS

Some instructors will assign text sets for a synthesis essay project while others will
ask you to research and select your own source material for a synthesis assignment.
If you are asked to select your own viewpoint texts for a synthesis essay, take time
to carefully consider the sources and the authors' biases and motivations for their
arguments.

   From debates about which sports team are the best to whether self-driving cars
are the transportation of the future, there are as many viewpoints as there are ice
cream flavors exist.

   On the topic of ice cream flavors, my opinion is that cookies and cream is the
tastiest. Why do I think it is the best? First, it is made with Oreo cookies, my
favorite chocolate cookie. However when it comes to ice cream, I prefer a vanilla
to a chocolate base, and cookies and cream's base flavor is a creamy vanilla. On
the surface, these are pretty solid argumentative points for a low stakes ice cream
debate based on my flavor preferences, and my explanation would probably satisfy
your curiosity without a need for further evidence or explanation.

   However, let's complicate the frozen dessert conversation. What if you were to
learn that I was employed by Nabisco as the Oreo product sales manager for the
western region? Do you think this information is important? How might this fact
influence my preference for cookies and cream ice cream? Would you wonder if
it is my favorite because I really do love Oreos, or because if I pump it up enough
to people I talk to, it will help my job as an Oreo sales manager?[1] Regardless,
knowing what my job is could help YOU determine if you think my opinion is an

might have (like selling more Oreos and Oreo products!).

Of course, this is a simplified example of the way personal connections to a topic

bias our perspectives and bias our opinions, but you can see how even a harmless

topic like ice cream

can quickly get muddled when we introduce the element of bias and/or a

motivated agenda. Understanding the basis of a given opinion or viewpoint can

Analyze the Logical Soundness of the Arguments Presented Using
Syllogisms

More complex and controversial topics such as healthcare and climate change are
breeding grounds for opinions filled with underlying agendas, biases, and
emotional reasoning. As a rhetorical researcher and critical thinker, you must
understand how to critically read, listen to, and analyze a range of viewpoints with
an impartial eye. Some of these viewpoints will
be based on valid premises and credible evidence while others will be based on
personal, political, religious, or economic biases or agendas that distort the
foundational premises you would expect of a valid argument. When assessing and
comparing several two viewpoints on the same issue, a critical thinker and
rhetorically aware person will not "buy" arguments based on illogical or unsound

major premise that the only valid vote is

one made when a person is physically present. Does that premise stand up to

critical analysis? Is it true that votes made in person with an ID are the only valid

votes? Since mail in voting has been successful and stood up to voting audits

embedded in each state's counting processes every year in many states for over ten

years, the warrant is flawed and the major premise is not true. The argument falls

apart because the argument's basic assumptions and premise do not hold up to

logic based on available and credible evidence.

The following two syllogisms illustrate the faulty premise at play in these

examples.

· Major premise: All people who vote in person cast a valid vote.
· Minor premise: Jenny cast her vote in person.
· Conclusion: Jenny's vote is valid.

This categorical syllogism presents a fallacy in logic because the major premise
suggests that all people who vote in person are who they say they are. That may not
be true. Jenny may not, in fact be Jenny, but her sister.

   We can test an IF/THEN syllogism as well.

· Premise: If a voter votes in person and presents an ID, then their vote is a valid
  vote.

· Minor Premise: Jenny voted in person and presented an ID.
· Conclusion: Therefore, Jenny's vote is valid.

This IF/THEN or hypothetical syllogism presents a fallacy in logic because the major
premise suggests that all people who vote in person with an ID are who they say
                                                                                                                                              ARGUMENT | 199

they are. That may not be true. As explained above, Jenny may not, in fact be Jenny,
but her sister or other voter of close resemblance, ethnicity, and age.

   Here's another syllogism with a different premise:

   · Premise: If a voter votes by a mail-in ballot, then their vote is not a valid vote.
   · Minor Premise: According to the Arizona Republic, the "overwhelming majority

      of voters in the state cast their ballots by mail, with nearly 90 percent doing so
      last year amid the coronavirus pandemic . . ."
   · Conclusion: Therefore, almost 90 percent of the votes in Arizona were not valid.

Is it true that 90% of voters are not who they say they are (that's assumption behind
the premise) and their votes should not count? The syllogism's major premise does
not hold up as "true." Testing your major premise and the assumptions underlying
it can help you see the flaw in your logical reasoning. Once you understand how to
determine if you are operating from a valid premise, your audience will accept, you
can ensure your argument is based on a sound premise.

   It is important to learn about and contrast alternative viewpoints and opinions
because

      topic. Most issues are not simply right versus wrong.

   · It will help you develop your own opinion on the topic since you'll likely read
      about a new aspect you haven't thought about before.

   · You will be able to defend your opinion because you will be well-aware of what
      the counter arguments are.

Using Recursive metaliteracy Processes to Compose a
SOLUTION Proposal Argument

                                                    Solution by SBTS

Because the overarching purpose of Claim Your Voice is to help you develop the
agency to use your academic literacies to address real-world issues and achieve
your academic, career, and personal goals, the key argument assignment for this
chapter is centered on proposing a solution or set of solutions to solve or reduce
the negative effects of a current problem or issue. Writing a solution proposal
argument, as discussed in Section 4.1 in "Argument Genres" generally has two
key arguments. First, you establish that there is a significant problem and argue
that this problem necessitates action. You use deep research to provide evidence
that there is a problem and current solutions are not adequate to address it.
Then, the second part of the argument is focused on your proposed a solutions
or set of solutions during which you make a clear call to action. This is a in depth
project designed to engage you in a variety of activities that will take your writing,
reading, research, and metaliteracy knowledge and skills to a new level. In this
set of assignments, you will have the opportunity to develop your proposal and
seek multiple points of feedback through a series of assignments, both written and
digital.

Write a Research Question

Writing your a research question should begin with a current issue you have
identified and some invention exercises.

   Once you have worked through some pre-researching and writing, generate a
list of questions. What do you know, for sure, that you do not know? At this point,
                                                                                                                                              ARGUMENT | 201

conduct some informal pre-researching online and in the library databases to learn
what the public discourse is saying about that issue. Once you have a little more
information and have ascertained that sufficient information and resources are
available to research the issue in depth, proceed with developing your research
questions. As you learned in Chapter 3, a good research question should begin with
a "How," "In what way?,"or "Why?" question.

   As you being researching, another useful process for understanding your topic
as it is discussed in public discourse and research material is to perform a media
ecology assessment. What kind of source material is available? Is the topic getting
a lot of attention right now? What is going on? The assignment below will help you
see a full range of the media ecosystem in which your topic is discussed (or not!).

                THE MEDIA ECOLOGY SURROUNDING YOUR TOPIC
         Assignment for Discussion Board Post or Small Group Sharing

Purpose

   1. To understand the realm of information surrounding your topic.
   2. To broaden your scope of how information systems from various mediums

Quote to Chew On

"Media ecology is distinct from communication studies proper in its focus on the integration,
interdependence, and dynamism of media and technology in human affairs. It assumes that
the symbol systems and technologies people use to think with, communicate, and represent
our experiences play an integral role in how we create and understand reality." (Milberry,
"Media Ecology," Oxford Bibliographies, 2016).

Post Description

Consider what you know about the media ecology surrounding your topic. (Read the
complete introduction defining and describing the term "media ecology" (Links to an external
site.) on Oxford Bibliographies.) In order to get an idea of the realm information around your
topic, this post assignment asks you to post your research question, then state the kinds of
information from different types of media sources across a wide assortment of disciplines.

Assignment Structure

1. RESEARCH QUESTION: Write out your current research question.
202 | ARGUMENT

           2. Go to Google News and search your issue. List three articles that offer current
                information relevant to your topic (author, article title, article venue, date) with a brief
                description.

           3. List the title of two academic journals in which recent articles on your topic are likely
                to be found. (Use Academic Search Premier db and/or Google Scholar (Links to an
                external site.) to identify the title of the journal. You can always search the title on
                Wikipedia which will tell you more about that journal.)

           4. List the title of two books written in the last five years with the authors' names/
                credibility that address your topic (you can use e-book databases, the library catalog,
                etc.).

           5. Search the Credo Database and the Gale Reference database and list two specific
                reference articles (use the Works Cited bib) about your topic. Also state what
                disciplines are represented in/associated with the article.

           6. List two Twitter accounts (@so and so with the account title) in which this topic is
                dominant. Next to each Twitter account, explain who the account holder is (establish
                ethos) and what you think their perspective is.

           7. List two Podcasts (title and name of key podcaster) in which this topic is dominant.
                Next to each Podcast title, explain who the account holder is (establish ethos).

           8. List two blogs with their titles and authors where an informed discussion on your topic
                is taking place. (You can also go to other channels such as Reddit, but keep in mind
                that we are looking for expertise in the contributors that you can defend.)

           9. List the title and the URL of two resource pages from a government source (.gov)
                where a researcher might find more information related to your topic.

         10. List the title and description of at least two films, documentaries, pieces of music, art,
                or other creative venue in which your issue is a topic.

       WRITE A REFLECTION PARAGRAPH: After you have completed this pre-research
       assignment, write a paragraph or two reflection on this exercise. What did you learn? What
       did you notice about the media ecology around your issue? Does the issue have public
       resonance? Does the issue cross several disciplinary areas? Do you believe a further
       investigation of this issue is warranted? Why? How might you narrow your issue or change
       your research question/s?
                                              ARGUMENT | 203

Create a Working Thesis

If you have created a strong series of research questions, your answers to those
questions should help generate your thesis. Because a project like this is complex,
you probably have two major research questions: one to build the argument
supported by reasons and evidence that some action, plan or policy must be
implemented. The second research question is probably more focused on finding
solutions. Typically, the question "Who/what organization should do what and
why?" will help you generate a solid proposal argument thesis statement.

Example: Proposal Argument Thesis Statements

     Practical Argument: Social media companies should develop artificial intelligence filters and
     personalized messaging to help endusers restrict themselves from the exposure to unrealistic
     images and marketing portraying "ideal" body types in order to prevent the development of
     significant mental and physical health disorders.
     Policy: In order to prevent the weaponization of space, governments across the world must
     develop and agree on a policy in line with the principles of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 (OST)
     and the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space Treaty, The Threat or Use of
     Force Against Outer Space Objects (PPWT).

Plan and Propose Your Solution proposal Argument

Prompt

Identify and select a current major issue, define or frame the problem, and present
feasible solutions, policies, or approaches to solve and/or at least reduce the impact
of the problem in a well-developed academic essay. Follow MLA guidelines for the
essay format, citations and Work Cited.

   Where to begin: Research a current societal, scientific, legal, medical, political,
environmental, cultural, or other significant issue. The issues can be local, national,
or global in scope, but should be narrowed to a specific issue within the larger
204 | ARGUMENT

issue once you have thoroughly researched it. Learn about the background history
of how the issue evolved over time and identify the issue's relevant causes and
effects. As you review the relevant research on the narrowed topic, begin to explore
current solutions. What actions have stakeholders taken to address the problem?
Why hasn't the problem been solved by the stakeholders? You will discover your
original solutions or approaches to the problem by critiquing the current solutions
and approaches. Look for gaps - what is NOT being done that could be done.
Consider solutions from other fields that have helped address similar problems.
"Think out of the box," as the cliché goes.

General Writing Criteria:

   · Use MLA format; Include in-text citations and Works Cited page (both
      REQUIRED for credit).

   · Write in a formal, academic tone using "academic register" (write in third
      person using formal diction, specific word choice (diction), no clichés, and no
      slang).

   · Carefully revise and edit - Writing Center is open through the last day of
      classes. After that, contact me for Monday and Tuesday appointments.

   · Follow the outline organizational structure provided.
   · Write clear, grammatically correct thesis and section topic sentences.
   · Support your claims with 8-12 credible, relevant, carefully evaluated sources

      (database articles, well-chosen web articles, credible media sources).
   · Cite from a minimum of three (3) library database sources.
   · Make sure each body section / discussion point features a topic sentence and

      relevant cited evidence from 2-4 sources, blended coherently.
   · Use transitional words and phrases to guide the reader as you develop and

      support your argument.
   · Apply the feasibility heuristic* to your solutions - make sure you solutions

      would pass!
          Is it doable? What would it take to implement the solution?
          Is it worth doing? What does a cost/benefit analysis reveal about the
            feasibility of the solution?
          Would it work? How do you know?

Compose Digital Projects to Develop and Share Your
Argument

Digital Literacy and Real World Applications

By conducting one or more digital projects during the proposal solution process,
you can engage with your topic more deeply while educating and seeking feedback
from your peers. Two digital projects to consider during the proposal solution paper
process are the Explainer Video and the Infographic. These two forms of digital
communication are very popular in the business world and in organizations as
a means of efficiently and effectively connecting with their clients and end
consumers or to general public awareness.

Explainer Video Project

Prompts: Create an explainer video in which you communicate the seriousness of
a problem so that your viewer will recognize its exigence. OR, create an explainer
video in which you "sell" your solution as being the best approach to solving the
problem. If you make the video at the beginning of the problem after you do
your initial research, then making a video to create a sense of exigence and a
call to action could help you connect to the topic and gather feedback from your
audience. If you are creating the video while you write the paper or afterwards, then
creating a pitch explainer video is a better choice.

   An "explainer video" is a short video of less than two minutes that quickly
communicate and pitch a service or product.

   Here are two popular explainer videos to give you the idea. One features humans
and the other animation. Obviously, you might do something like create a video
206 | ARGUMENT

starring yourself or your peers, integrate Google slides, home made memes, and/or
basic animations. Every though you are not selling a product or service, what you
are doing is providing background information on your solution proposal topic that
generates exigence, that communicates that something must be done. Or, you are
explaining and "selling" your solution to the problem. Doing either in two minutes
will be a challenge, but a fun one!

   Vyond offers examples and gives tips on creating explainer videos that will help
you develop your explainer video. This project does not have to be complicated or
sophisticated, but it does have to display rhetoric at work.

Infographic Project

Prompt: Use a tool such as Piktochart to create an infographic that provides
compelling information leading to call to action that your problem must be solved
or that your solutions must be implemented. An infographic has to be highly visual
and easy to ready at a distance. Piktochart's website offers videos and helpful
documentation.

Chapter Conclusion

     Key Takeaways

       · Analyzing arguments using comparison and synthesis is an effective way to learn about
          and more deeply understand arguments.

       · Arguments come in many genres including the Aristotelian argument, the Rogerian
          Argument, the Toulmin Argument, and Proposal Argument to name a few.

       · Evidence and rhetoric work together to achieve effective rhetorical appeals.
       · Evidence must connect with the audience's wants, needs, values, and/or expectations

          through a warrant (or set of assumptions) the audience can understand and relate to your
          claim.
       · Working with your topic, research and arguments in different digital modalities provide a
          platform for publicly sharing your ideas and eliciting feedback.

15.

FAILURES IN EVIDENCE: WHEN "LOTS OF
QUOTES" CAN'T SAVE A PAPER

Emilie Zickel

In a strong essay, the author or writer's own thesis and reasoning drive the
argument, and then credible, valid evidence is used to support that reasoning.
Arguments, in particular, are interactions between writer and audience. The author
wants to persuade the audience to accept his or her claim, so he or she tries to
provide sufficient compelling evidence that will sway the audience to his or her
perspective.

   Research questions might be easy to come up with. Claims or thesis statements
can be easy to come up with. Even reasons or ideas to support the thesis or claim
may be fairly easy to come up with. But for your ideas in a paper to be valid, for
them to be accepted by a reader, they must be supported and developed with solid,
credible, sufficient, accurate, relevant and compelling evidence.

   Evidence is not simply "a bunch of quotes." Nor is evidence a bunch of facts or
statistics from an article, no matter how credible that article may be. For evidence to
truly work in the sense of supporting a thesis/claim, it has to be accurate, sufficient
to prove your point, directly related to the reason, ethically chosen, current, and
credible. That is a lot to think about. It is certainly more than "a quote that looks
good".

   Here are some things to think about avoiding when attempting to develop a
strong source-based essay. Just as understanding what logical fallacies are so you
can avoid them in your own writing, understanding what weak evidence is can help
you to avoid falling into the trap of using it in your own work.

   Failures in evidence occur when a reader says, "I do not accept your evidence".
Here is why that might happen:

   · The evidence that you have provided is inaccurate.
      You've misread information or misquoted; you are not interpreting the quoted
      material in an accurate manner

   · The evidence that you have provided is insufficient.
210 | FAILURES IN EVIDENCE

      You are using just a small piece of evidence to support your reasoning. You
      need more. You probably have a "generalization" fallacy.
   · The evidence that you have provided is unrelated to the reason.
      Your evidence does not clearly or directly relate to the point that you are trying
      to make.
   · The evidence that you have provided is incomplete or too narrowly chosen.
      You have "cherry picked" certain examples or pieces of information to the
      exclusion of others, so while you do have evidence to support your point, you
      are also neglecting a lot of other information
   · The evidence that you have provided is old.
      The information that you are citing is not relevant anymore. It is outdated!
   · The evidence that you have provided does not come from an authoritative
      source.
      The source of your evidence is not credible; the person being cited is not an
      authority on the topic

One of the bigger issues with evidence is not so much with the evidence itself, but
with the way that you integrate it into the paper. A reader needs to understand
clearly how and why the evidence you chose relates to the point that you are
making. Evidence must always be explained. Whenever you integrate evidence into
your papers, it is important to answer the question "How does this evidence support
the point that I am making?" Never assume that the reader sees what you see in
evidence. Always make it as clear as possible how the evidence supports the reason.

Unit 4: Make an Argument has equipped you with a comprehensive toolkit for
constructing persuasive arguments that advocate for your chosen community with
clarity, credibility, and impact. Through the readings in the four chapters within this
unit, we have explored the intricacies of persuasion, from understanding rhetorical
appeals to researching evidence, organizing our arguments, and addressing
counterarguments.

   As we reflect on our journey through these four chapters, we emerge with a
deeper understanding of the art of persuasion and the transformative power of
well-crafted arguments. Armed with the knowledge, skills, and strategies gained
from this unit, we are prepared to advocate for change, challenge assumptions, and
effect positive change in your chosen community, and beyond.

growth and development as a writer. As such, you will be tasked with writing two
self-reflection essays-one at midterm and the other during finals-which will provide
you with an opportunity to critically assess your writing process, progress, and
achievements over the duration of the course.

   Midterm Self-Reflection Essay
   For your midterm self-reflection essay, you will reflect on your writing journey up
to the midpoint of the course. Consider the assignments, readings, discussions, and
feedback you have encountered in the first half of the semester. You will reflect on
your strengths and weaknesses as a writer, the challenges you have faced, and the
strategies you have employed to overcome them. Additionally, you will assess your
progress in meeting course expectations and goals through questions such as: How
have your writing skills evolved since the beginning of the semester? and What
areas do you still need to focus on for improvement?
   Your essay should be a thoughtful and introspective analysis of your writing
process and progress up to midterm.
   Final Self-Reflection Essay
   For your final self-reflection essay, you will revisit your writing journey and assess
your growth and development as a writer over the duration of the course. You will
use the midterm self-reflection essay as a starting point, addressing the concerns
you might have had at the midpoint in the semester and how those challenges
changed as the semester progressed. Follow the same critical analysis and
assessment guidelines from the midterm self-reflection essay with the entire
course in mind. Emphasize how your writing process has changed and how
insecurities present in your first self-reflection have been overcome. Explain how
you will apply what you learned in this course to your field of study or future courses
and jobs.
   Note: Self-reflection if an essential component of the writing process, allowing
you to gain insight into your writing strengths and weaknesses, identify areas
214 | SELF-REFLECTION: MIDTERM/FINAL ASSESSMENT

for growth, and set goals for future improvement. Take this opportunity to reflect
thoughtfully on your writing journey and celebrate the progress you have made
thus far.

   Submission Guidelines:

   · Your self-reflection essays should be typed, double-spaced, and formatted
      according to the guidelines provided by your instructor.

   · Each essay should be approximately 500-750 words in length.
   · Use specific examples, anecdotes, and evidence from your writing experience

      to support your reflections.
   · Reflect critically and honestly on your strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and

      achievements as a writer.
   · Reference your midterm self-reflection in your final self-reflection.*

REFLECTIVE WRITING

Reflective Writing Techniques
   Many students have concerns about their ability to engage in reflective writing,

yet reflective writing is a skill utilized more frequently than one might realize.
From academia to the workplace, reflective writing is a common task encountered
in both professional and educational contexts. This chapter aims to demystify
reflective writing by equipping you with techniques and a better understanding of
the purpose of reflective writing.

   What is Reflective Writing?
   Reflective writing involves critically analyzing an experience, documenting its
impact on you, and outlining your plans for utilizing new information and
knowledge. This process enables deeper reflection, as the art of articulating
thoughts on paper often facilitates a deeper understanding of an experience. The
key to reflective writing lies in being analytical rather than merely descriptive. Think
about it this way, you want to analyze how something affects the bigger picture,
than simply describing that thing or experience. Also, consider the reason why
specific writing decisions were made. Doing so can lead to discovering what
possible misunderstanding or gap in knowledge led to the decision or what you
understand well and apply those learning and writing strategies to parts of the
writing process where you are challenged.
   Reminders: Reflective writing is: written in first person, analytical, and subjective.
Reflective writing is not written in the third person, descriptive, or objective.
   Crafting Effective Reflective Writing
   Effective reflective writing employs several key techniques to convey depth and
resonance:

   · Starting with a Prompt: Prompts provide a starting point for reflection,
      guiding thoughts, and facilitating exploration.

   · Embracing Honesty: Genuine reflection requires honesty, even when
      confronting negative emotions or experiences.
                                                                                                                                 REFLECTIVE WRITING | 217

   · Utilizing Descriptive Language: Vivid descriptions enhance the impact of
      reflective writing, bringing experiences to life through rich imagery.

   · Connecting to Broader Themes: Tying personal experiences to universal
      themes amplifies the relevance and impact of reflective writing.

Challenges and Opportunities
   While reflective writing presents numerous benefits, it also poses challenges.

Some struggle with honesty and vulnerability, while others navigate the
complexities of sharing personal stories. However, with practice and patience, these
challenges can be overcome, paving the way for growth and self-discovery.

   The Evolving Landscapes of Reflective Writing
   In an era of personal blogs and digital storytelling, reflective writing finds new
avenues for expression. As technology continues to evolve, the art of reflective
writing adapts, resonating with readers in ever-changing ways.

BACK TO BASICS: THE PERFECT PARAGRAPH

Amy Guptill

Paragraphs

As Michael Harvey writes, paragraphs are "in essence--a form of punctuation, and
like other forms of punctuation they are meant to make written material easy
to read."1 Effective paragraphs are the fundamental units of academic writing;
consequently, the thoughtful, multifaceted arguments that your professors expect
depend on them. Without good paragraphs, you simply cannot clearly convey
sequential points and their relationships to one another. The purpose of this
chapter is to highlight strategies for constructing, ordering, and relating paragraphs
in academic writing. It could just as well be titled "Organization" because whether
or not readers perceive a paper to be well organized depends largely on effective
paragraphing.

   Many novice writers tend to make a sharp distinction between content and style,
thinking that a paper can be strong in one and weak in the other, but focusing
on organization shows how content and style converge in deliberative academic
writing. A poorly organized paper may contain insightful kernels, but a thoughtful,
satisfying argument can't take shape without paragraphs that are crafted, ordered,
and connected effectively. On the other side, one can imagine a string of slick,
error-free sentences that are somehow lacking in interesting ideas. However, your
professors will view even the most elegant prose as rambling and tedious if there
isn't a careful, coherent argument to give the text meaning. Paragraphs are the
"stuff" of academic writing and, thus, worth our attention here.

  2013), 70.

 Key sentences (a.k.a. topic sentences)

  In academic writing, readers expect each paragraph to have a sentence or two that
  captures its main point. They're often called "topic sentences," though many writing
  instructors prefer to call them "key sentences." There are at least two downsides
  of the phrase "topic sentence." First, it makes it seem like the paramount job of
  that sentence is simply to announce the topic of the paragraph. Second, it makes it
  seem like the topic sentence must always be a single grammatical sentence. Calling
  it a "key sentence" reminds us that it expresses the central idea of the paragraph.
  And sometimes a question or a two-sentence construction functions as the key.

  The key to staying on topic within a paragraph is starting with a topic sentence.
  It doesn't even have to be perfect to work from it! Just figure out what you really
  want to say in that one specific paragraph and go. Then, you ... EDIT (haha, made
  you flinch!) All joking aside, editing really is a very important step in this process.
  By going back over what you wrote, you can check to see if what you wrote in
  that paragraph fits with what you actually intend to say as well as to make sure
  everything is cohesive and coherent!

     Kaethe Leonard

  Key sentences in academic writing do two things. First, they establish the main
  point that the rest of the paragraph supports. Second, they situate each paragraph
  within the sequence of the argument, a task that requires transitioning from the
  prior paragraph. Consider these two examples:2

  Version A:

        Now we turn to the epidemiological evidence.

  Version B:

        The epidemiological evidence provides compelling support for the hypothesis
        emerging from etiological studies.

2. Etiology is the cause of a disease--what's actually happening in cells and tissues--while epidemiology is the
   incidence of a disease in a population.
                                                                                                    BACK TO BASICS: THE PERFECT PARAGRAPH | 221

  Both versions convey a topic; it's pretty easy to predict that the paragraph will
  be about epidemiological evidence, but only the second version establishes an
  argumentative point and puts it in context. The paragraph doesn't just describe the
  epidemiological evidence; it shows how epidemiology is telling the same story as
  etiology. Similarly, while Version A doesn't relate to anything in particular, Version
  B immediately suggests that the prior paragraph addresses the biological pathway
  (i.e. etiology) of a disease and that the new paragraph will bolster the emerging
  hypothesis with a different kind of evidence. As a reader, it's easy to keep track of
  how the paragraph about cells and chemicals and such relates to the paragraph
  about populations in different places.

     By clearly establishing an essential point within its analytic context, a well written
  key sentence gives both you and your reader a firm grasp of how each point
  relates. For example, compare these two sets of key sentences, each introducing a
  sequential paragraph:3

  Version A:

        At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, the cause of the disease was unclear. ...

        The cause of AIDS is HIV. ...

        There are skeptics who question whether HIV is the cause. ...

  Version B:

        At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, the cause of the disease was unclear, leading
        to a broad range of scientific speculation. ...

        By 1986 HIV had been isolated and found to correlate almost exactly with the
        incidence of AIDS. ...

        HIV skeptics, on the other hand, sought to discredit claims based on epidemiology
        by emphasizing that the pathogenesis of HIV was still unknown. ...

  Version A isn't wrong per se; it just illustrates a lost opportunity to show the
  important connections among points. Both versions portray a process unfolding
  over time: initial uncertainty followed by a breakthrough discovery and then

3. This example is drawn from key points from Steven Epstein's Impure Science: AIDS, Activism, and the Politics
   of Knowledge (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1996). An excellent read.
   222 | BACK TO BASICS: THE PERFECT PARAGRAPH

  controversy. Even with the same substantive points, a person reading Version A
  would have to work harder to see how the material in the paragraphs connects.
  Readers experience Version B as clearer and more engaging.

     Thinking of key sentences as sequential points in an argument reminds one that
  a key sentence doesn't have to always be a single declarative one. Sometimes you
  need two sentences together to achieve the work of a key sentence, and sometimes
  a question or quotation does a better job than a declarative sentence in clarifying a
  logical sequence:

  Version C:

        At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic the cause was unclear. Virologists,
        bacteriologists, immunologists, and epidemiologists all pursued different leads,
        reflecting their particular areas of expertise...

        If drug use, lifestyle, and "immune overload" didn't cause AIDS, what did?...

        "I've asked questions they apparently can't answer," claimed retrovirologist Peter
        Duesberg4 who became an oft-quoted skeptical voice in media accounts of AIDS
        research in the mid-1980s. ...

  Version C is based on the same three sequential points as Versions A and B: (1)
  the cause of AIDS was initially unclear (2) HIV was accepted as the cause (3) lone
  dissenters questioned the claims. However, versions B and C have much more
  meaning and momentum, and version C, depending on the nature of the
  argument, features more precise and lively stylistic choices. Opening the second
  paragraph with a question (that then gets answered) carries forth the sense of
  befuddlement that researchers initially experienced and helps to convey why the
  discovery of HIV was a hugely important turning point. Using the self-glorifying
  Duesberg quote to launch the third paragraph makes the point about lingering
  skepticism while also introducing a portrait of a leading figure among the skeptics.
  While Version B is effective as well, Version C illustrates some of the more lively
  choices available to academic writers.

     A last thing to note about key sentences is that academic readers expect them
  to be at the beginning of the paragraph.5 That helps readers comprehend your

4. This Duesberg quote is from Epstein, Impure Science, 112.

5. This sentence right here is an example!
                                                                                                    BACK TO BASICS: THE PERFECT PARAGRAPH | 223

  argument. To see how, try this: find an academic piece (such as a textbook or
  scholarly article) that strikes you as well written and go through part of it reading
  just the first sentence of each paragraph. You should be able to easily follow the
  sequence of logic. When you're writing for professors, it is especially effective to put
  your key sentences first because they usually convey your own original thinking,
  which, as you've read here, is exactly what your instructors are looking for in your
  work. It's a very good sign when your paragraphs are typically composed of a telling
  key sentence followed by evidence and explanation.

     Knowing this convention of academic writing can help you both read and write
  more effectively. When you're reading a complicated academic piece for the first
  time, you might want to go through reading only the first sentence or two of
  each paragraph to get the overall outline of the argument. Then you can go back
  and read all of it with a clearer picture of how each of the details fit in.6 And
  when you're writing, you may also find it useful to write the first sentence of each
  paragraph (instead of a topic-based outline) to map out a thorough argument
  before getting immersed in sentence-level wordsmithing. For example, compare
  these two scaffolds. Which one would launch you into a smoother drafting
  process?:7

  Version A (Outline Of Topics):

        I. Granovetter's "Strength of weak ties"
                  a. Definition
                  b. Example--getting jobs

           II. Creativity in social networks
                  a. Explanation
                  b. Richard Florida's argument

           III. Implications
                  a. For urban planners
                  b. For institutions of higher education

6. I hesitate to add that this first-sentence trick is also a good one for when you haven't completed an assigned
   reading and only have 10 minutes before class. Reading just the first sentence of each paragraph will quickly tell
   you a lot about the assigned text.

7. This example is from Katherine Giuffre, Communities and Networks: Using Social Network Analysis to Rethink
   Urban and Community Studies (Malden, MA: Polity, 2013).
   224 | BACK TO BASICS: THE PERFECT PARAGRAPH

  Version B (Key-Sentence Sketch):

        The importance of networking for both career development and social change is
        well known. Granovetter (1973) explains that weak ties--that is, ties among
        acquaintances--are often more useful in job hunting because they connect job-
        seekers to a broader range of people and workplaces. ...

        Subsequent research in network analysis has shown that weak ties can promote
        creativity by bringing ideas together from different social realms. ...

        Richard Florida (2002) argues that cities would do well to facilitate weak ties in order
        to recruit members of the "creative class" and spur economic development. ...

        Florida's argument can inspire a powerful new approach to strategic planning within
        colleges and universities as well. ...

  As you can see, emphasizing key sentences in both the process and product of
  academic writing is one way to ensure that your efforts stay focused on developing
  your argument and communicating your own original thinking in a clear, logical
  way.

  A good paper has cohesion. I love outlines, so I really like the idea of writing my first
  sentence of each paragraph as my plan. This way, you know what to write about
  and you know that your paper will flow easily. As a reader, this is an important
  characteristic to me. If the paragraphs are just jumping around in all different
  directions, I quickly lose interest in trying to follow along. The reader should not
  have to struggle to follow your paper. Flow can make the difference between an
  okay paper and a scholarly product.

     Aly Button

 Cohesion and coherence

  With a key sentence established, the next task is to shape the body of your
  paragraph to be both cohesive and coherent. As Williams and Bizup8 explain,
  cohesion is about the "sense of flow" (how each sentence fits with the next), while

8. Joseph M. Williams.and Joseph Bizup. Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace 12th edition (New York: Longman,
   2016), 68.
                                                                                                     BACK TO BASICS: THE PERFECT PARAGRAPH | 225

   coherence is about the "sense of the whole".9 Some students worry too much about
   "flow" and spend a lot of time on sentence-level issues to promote it. I encourage
   you to focus on underlying structure. For the most part, a text reads smoothly when
   it conveys a thoughtful and well organized argument or analysis. Focus first and
   most on your ideas, on crafting an ambitious analysis. The most useful guides advise
   you to first focus on getting your ideas on paper and then revising for organization
   and wordsmithing later, refining the analysis as you go. Thus, I discuss creating
   cohesion and coherent paragraphs here as if you already have some rough text
   written and are in the process of smoothing out your prose to clarify your argument
   for both your reader and yourself.

      Cohesion refers to the flow from sentence to sentence. For example, compare
   these passages:

  Version A (That I Rewrote):

         Granovetter begins by looking at balance theory. If an actor, A, is strongly tied to
         both B and C, it is extremely likely that B and C are, sooner or later, going to be tied
         to each other, according to balance theory (1973:1363).10 Bridge ties between cliques
         are always weak ties, Granovetter argues (1973:1364). Weak ties may not necessarily
         be bridges, but Granovetter argues that bridges will be weak. If two actors share a
         strong tie, they will draw in their other strong relations and will eventually form a
         clique. Only weak ties that do not have the strength to draw together all the "friends
         of friends" can connect people in different cliques.

  Version B (The Original By Giuffre):

         Granovetter begins by looking at balance theory. In brief, balance theory tells us that
         if an actor, A, is strongly tied to both B and C, it is extremely likely that B and C
         are, sooner or later, going to be tied to each other (1973:1363). Granovetter argues
         that because of this, bridge ties between cliques are always weak ties (1973:1364).
         Weak ties may not necessarily be bridges, but Granovetter argues that bridges will
         be weak. This is because if two actors share a strong tie, they will draw in their other
         strong relations and will eventually form a clique. The only way, therefore, that people
         in different cliques can be connected is through weak ties that do not have the
         strength to draw together all the "friends of friends." 11

10. The quote uses a version of an ASA-style in-text citation for Mark S. Granovetter, "The Strength of Weak Ties,"
    American Journal of Sociology 78 (1973): 1360-80.
   226 | BACK TO BASICS: THE PERFECT PARAGRAPH

  Version A has the exact same information as version B, but it is harder to read
  because it is less cohesive. Each sentence in version B begins with old information
  and bridges to new information. Here's Version B again with the relevant parts
  emboldened:

         Granovetter begins by looking at balance theory. In brief, balance theory tells us that
         if an actor, A, is strongly tied to both B and C, it is extremely likely that B and C
         are, sooner or later, going to be tied to each other (1973:1363). Granovetter argues
         that because of this, bridge ties between cliques are always weak ties (1973:1364).
         Weak ties may not necessarily be bridges, but Granovetter argues that bridges will
         be weak. This is because if two actors share a strong tie, they will draw in their other
         strong relations and will eventually form a clique. The only way, therefore, that people
         in different cliques can be connected is through weak ties that do not have the
         strength to draw together all the "friends of friends."

  The first sentence establishes the key idea of balance theory. The next sentence
  begins with balance theory and ends with social ties, which is the focus of the third
  sentence. The concept of weak ties connects the third and fourth sentences and
  concept of cliques the fifth and sixth sentences. In Version A, in contrast, the first
  sentence focuses on balance theory, but then the second sentence makes a new
  point about social ties before telling the reader that the point comes from balance
  theory. The reader has to take in a lot of unfamiliar information before learning how
  it fits in with familiar concepts. Version A is coherent, but the lack of cohesion makes
  it tedious to read.

     The lesson is this: if you or others perceive a passage you've written to be awkward
  or choppy, even though the topic is consistent, try rewriting it to ensure that each
  sentence begins with a familiar term or concept. If your points don't naturally
  daisy-chain together like the examples given here, consider numbering them. For
  example, you may choose to write, "Proponents of the legislation point to four major
  benefits." Then you could discuss four loosely related ideas without leaving your
  reader wondering how they relate.

     While cohesion is about the sense of flow; coherence is about the sense of the
  whole. For example, here's a passage that is cohesive (from sentence to sentence)
  but lacks coherence:

         Your social networks and your location within them shape the kinds and amount

11. Guiffre. Communities and Networks, 98.
                                                                                                     BACK TO BASICS: THE PERFECT PARAGRAPH | 227

         of information that you have access to. Information is distinct from data, in that
         makes some kind of generalization about a person, thing, or population. Defensible
         generalizations about society can be either probabilities (i.e., statistics) or patterns
         (often from qualitative analysis). Such probabilities and patterns can be temporal,
         spatial, or simultaneous.

   Each sentence in the above passage starts with a familiar idea and progresses to
   a new one, but it lacks coherence--a sense of being about one thing. Good writers
   often write passages like that when they're free-writing or using the drafting stage
   to cast a wide net for ideas. A writer weighing the power and limits of social network
   analysis may free-write something like that example and, from there, develop a
   more specific plan for summarizing key insights about social networks and then
   discussing them with reference to the core tenets of social science. As a draft, an
   incoherent paragraph often points to a productive line of reasoning; one just has
   to continue thinking it through in order to identify a clear argumentative purpose
   for each paragraph. With its purpose defined, each paragraph, then, becomes a
   lot easier to write. Coherent paragraphs aren't just about style; they are a sign of a
   thoughtful, well developed analysis.

 The wind-up

   Some guides advise you to end each paragraph with a specific concluding
   sentence, in a sense, to treat each paragraph as a kind of mini-essay. But that's
   not a widely held convention. Most well written academic pieces don't adhere to
   that structure. The last sentence of the paragraph should certainly be in your own
   words (as in, not a quote), but as long as the paragraph succeeds in carrying out the
   task that it has been assigned by its key sentence, you don't need to worry about
   whether that last sentence has an air of conclusiveness. For example, consider these
   paragraphs about the cold fusion controversy of the 1980s that appeared in a best-
   selling textbook:12

         The experiment seemed straightforward and there were plenty of scientists willing
         to try it. Many did. It was wonderful to have a simple laboratory experiment on fusion
         to try after the decades of embarrassing attempts to control hot fusion. This effort

    1998), 58.
    228 | BACK TO BASICS: THE PERFECT PARAGRAPH

         required multi-billion dollar machines whose every success seemed to be capped
         with an unanticipated failure. `Cold fusion' seemed to provide, as Martin Fleischmann
         said during the course of that famous Utah press conference, `another route'--the
         route of little science.

   In that example, the first and last sentences in the paragraph are somewhat
   symmetrical: the authors introduce the idea of accessible science, contrast it with
   big science, and bring it back to the phrase "little science." Here's an example from
   the same chapter of the same book that does not have any particular symmetry:13

         The struggle between proponents and critics in a scientific controversy is always a
         struggle for credibility. When scientists make claims which are literally `incredible',
         as in the cold fusion case, they face an uphill struggle. The problem Pons and
         Fleischmann had to overcome was that they had credibility as electrochemists but
         not as nuclear physicists. And it was nuclear physics where their work was likely to
         have its main impact.

   The last sentence of the paragraph doesn't mirror the first, but the paragraph
   still works just fine. In general, every sentence of academic writing should add
   some unique content. Don't trouble yourself with having the last sentence in every
   paragraph serve as a mini-conclusion. Instead, worry about developing each point
   sufficiently and making your logical sequence clear.

 Conclusion: paragraphs as punctuation

   To reiterate the initial point, it is useful to think of paragraphs as punctuation that
   organize your ideas in a readable way. Each paragraph should be an irreplaceable
   node within a coherent sequence of logic. Thinking of paragraphs as "building
   blocks" evokes the "five-paragraph theme" structure explained in Chapter 2: if you
   have identical stone blocks, it hardly matters what order they're in. In the successful
   organically structured college paper, the structure and tone of each paragraph
   reflects its indispensable role within the overall piece. These goals--making every
   bit count and having each part situated within the whole--also anchor the
   discussion in the next chapter: how to write introductions and conclusions that
   frame--rather than simply book-end--your analysis.

Exercises

   1. Find a piece of academic writing you admire and copy down the first sentence of each
        paragraph. How well do those sentences reflect the flow of the argument? Show those
        sentences to other people; how clearly can they envision the flow of the piece?

   2. For each of the following short passages, decide whether they lack cohesion or
        coherence.

           A. The Roman siege of Masada in the first century CE, ending as it did with the suicide
                of 960 Jewish rebels, has been interpreted in various ways in Jewish history.
                History is best understood as a product of the present: the stories we tell ourselves
                to make sense of our complicated world. History lessons in elementary school
                curricula, however, rarely move beyond facts and timelines.

           B. Polar explorer Earnest Shackleton is often considered a model of effective
                leadership. The Endurance was frozen into the Antarctic ice where it was
                subsequently crushed, abandoning Shackleton and his 22-person crew on unstable
                ice floes, hundreds of miles from any human outpost. Two harrowing journeys by
                lifeboat and several long marches over the ice over the course of two Antarctic
                winters eventually resulted in their rescue. Amazingly, no one died during the ordeal.
230 | BACK TO BASICS: THE PERFECT PARAGRAPH

                 C. A recent analysis of a 1.8 million year-old hominid skull suggests that human
                      evolutionary lineage is simpler than we thought. Homo erectus, a species that
                      persisted almost 2 million years, lived in most parts of Africa as well as Western
                      and Eastern Asia. Some scientists are now arguing that Homo erectus individuals
                      varied widely in their body size and skull shape, a claim strongly supported by the
                      recently analyzed skull. Thus, some other named species, such as Homo habilis and
                      Homo rudolfensis are not separate species but instead regional variations of Homo
                      erectus.

CITATIONS AND ATTRIBUTIONS

Dahliani Reynolds

We often think about writing as a solitary act, of putting one's thoughts into words,
and then inscribing our words on the page. And it is. But not really. Whether we
write alone or collaboratively, our thoughts are never just our own. We are always
responding to something or someone else, especially when writing to explore and
solve problems. In How Writing Works, we often talk about academic writing as
"joining a conversation." When you sit down to write, you are not writing out of
nowhere. You are writing in response to something that happened and to what
others have already said about what happened. In other words, you write to join an
already existing conversation--which means you have to familiarize yourself with
that conversation. If you want others to listen to your contributions to the
conversation, you have to demonstrate your awareness of what others have already
said. This means that most of the time, your writing is rarely a record of only your
own words; it is almost always going to include other voices.

   As you know, if you use someone else's words, you have to cite them, or give
them credit. Failing to do so constitutes plagiarism, which is a kind of intellectual
theft or academic dishonesty. You also need to give credit when you draw on
other's ideas, even if you are putting them into your own words. You are probably
already familiar with these ideas about citing your sources, and likely have at least
some practice using at least one of the most common citation systems.

   Academics use various citation systems to cite their sources. Modern Language
Association (MLA) and American Psychological Association (APA) are two of the
most common systems, but there are others. It's important to understand that
these citation systems are disciplinary in nature. They have been developed by the
discourse communities that use them to provide consistent practices for citing
sources and conveying the most important information about those sources to
readers.

   Keep in mind that what constitutes the most important information differs
across discourse communities, and citation systems reflect this difference. For
example, in the social sciences, cutting edge research is valued, which means that
232 | CITATIONS AND ATTRIBUTIONS

sources need to be as current as possible. As a result of this priority, APA places the
date of publication immediately after the author's name--so it is one of the first
pieces of information readers get about the source. In the humanities, however,
date of publication is not as important, and so the date is listed later in the citation.
Similarly, the conventions in all citation systems change over time, as the kinds of
sources available (or valued) in different disciplines have changed. For example,
both MLA and APA now have a preferred format for citing a website--a format
(and a kind of source) that didn't exist not so long ago. As a writer joining these
various discourse communities, you probably need not master the nuances of
multiple citation systems, but it is important that you understand the disciplinary
nature of these systems, and learn how to find information about the correct
format for each system.

   As a writer who has probably had years of education devoted to learning about
academic writing, you might be surprised to know that citation systems like APA
and MLA are rarely used in writing for professional or public audiences. Though
you will likely not need to use the same kind of citation practices when writing for
professional or public audiences, the same ideas about giving credit to others still
apply. The methods for doing so are less formalized and rely more on attribution
than citation. Attribution and citation are both about giving the writer/artist credit
for their work, or "attributing" the words or artistic creation to their composer.
Citation is simply a formal, stylized version of attribution, used by specific (often
academic) discourse communities. This distinction is particularly important in
writing for professional and public audiences, because you are likely to draw on a
greater range--and certainly different--kinds of sources than you might when
writing for an academic audience. Instead of relying almost solely on academic
scholarship, writing for professional or public audiences might also include sources
drawn from popular literature, digital content, multimodal resources, etc. It is thus
very important to pay attention to the kinds of copyright governing the sources
you use in your writing.

   Copyright
   Copyright is a legal method for protecting one's intellectual property, whether it
be a written text, a photograph, a music composition, etc. If you write a short story,
it is your intellectual property--which means no one else can use or reproduce or
sell it without your permission. The protections afforded by our legal copyright
system are automatically granted to your story, even if you don't register it for a
formal copyright license. Obviously, copyright is an important legal protection to
                                                                                                                   CITATIONS AND ATTRIBUTIONS | 233

keep others from "stealing" your work. On the other hand, as a system that evolved
decades before the proliferation of digital and self-publishing opportunities, it is
not always efficient for current writing situations. If you are creating a video and
want to use a song by Lizzo for the soundtrack, you are legally required to request
permission to do so. Failure to secure written permission would result in copyright
infringement, punishable by law.

   In the absence of written permission to use Lizzo's song, you have two ethically
and legally permissible options. The first option is to apply "fair use" principles. Fair
use allows you to use copyrighted material--without written permission--under
certain conditions:

  1. Your purpose for using the copyrighted material
 2. The nature of the copyrighted material
 3. The amount of the copyrighted material you use
 4. The effect of your use on the market value of the copyrighted material

All four conditions impact fair use decisions, but they are also all subject to the
court's opinion. For example, if your purpose in using Lizzo's song is to serve as the
soundtrack to a video you are making for educational purposes, or if you are using
it for a transformative purpose such as a parody, then it would lean in the favor of
fair use. However, if you are creating a video to sell your line of skin care products, it
might not, because of the commercial motive. If you plan to use just a single verse
instead of the whole song, that too leans in favor of fair use; but if you want to use
the chorus--the most recognizable part of the song--that can be problematic.
Likewise, if your use of the copyrighted material will impact Lizzo's future revenue
from the song, that brings up significant questions as to the "fairness" of your use.

   The second ethically and legally permissible option is to find out if Lizzo's song is
licensed through a creative commons license. Many digital sources (images, music,
video, websites) are copyrighted through a creative commons license, which
means while they remain copyrighted, the writer or artist has already granted
permission for others to use their work without asking for permission. Creative
Commons licenses carry certain restrictions about usage:

  1. If you need to attribute the work to the original author/artist
 2. If you are allowed to adapt the work (change or excerpt or remix it)
 3. If you are allowed to sell it
 4. If you are required to use the same creative commons license in your work
234 | CITATIONS AND ATTRIBUTIONS

As illustrated below, the six different licenses utilize different combinations of these
restrictions, with a seventh option offering free access through public domain.

     The Creative Commons License Options Listed from Most to Least Permissive:
CITATIONS AND ATTRIBUTIONS | 235
236 | CITATIONS AND ATTRIBUTIONS

When you use something licensed with a creative commons license, your
attribution for those sources must note those restrictions, as well as provide the
author's name and title of source.

   When you integrate multimodal sources, best practice is to place your
attribution on the page next to the source (typically, just below the picture, sound
clip, video player, etc.), or in a list at the end of the text (as is the case in this book).
Your attribution would not be formatted using APA or MLA citation systems, but
would include information about the author and creative commons license.
Typically, an attribution would include:

  1. title
 2. author/artist's name
 3. source
 4. license
Additional information about best practices for attribution can be found on the
Creative Commons website. Additional information about current guidelines for
MLA and APA citation systems can be found on the Purdue OWL website.

CLARITY AND CONCISION

   Amy Guptill

Writing like you drive

This and the following chapter discuss sentence-level composition, the kinds of
things that many people associate with "writing." Writing guides, especially those
targeted at college students, offer excellent advice on sentence construction and
word choice. However, many student writers get hung up on sentence-level
expression, thinking that only elegant, erudite sentences will earn top grades. Or
worse, some students assume that they'll never produce strong papers if they
do not already have some kind of inborn gift for wordsmithing. While it is true
that some people can produce extraordinarily elegant and graceful prose, it is
also true that anyone can learn to write effectively in ways that will persuade and
satisfy readers. Producing and reading elegant writing is a pleasure, but what really
matters in academic writing is precision.

   Focusing first or only on sentence-level issues is a troublesome approach. Doing
so is like driving while looking only at the few feet of the road right in front of the
bumper. Experienced drivers instead take in the larger scene and more effectively
identify and avoid potential hazards with ongoing course corrections. Writing well
is like that. When you've put in the time and effort to take in the bigger picture of
your analysis, most of the micro-scale moves happen automatically. That is, if you
have a well-developed thesis and a carefully sequenced argument organized into
cohesive and coherent paragraphs, many of the sentence-level issues take care of
themselves. It's easier to write effective sentences when their purpose is clear. You'll
still have to edit for clarity, concision, and mechanics, but if the thinking process
behind the writing is well developed, editing shouldn't be a huge chore. It can
actually be a satisfying part of the process. One common metaphor notes that a
good edit is like the last twist of a camera lens that brings the whole picture into
focus.

   One approach that often leads to a difficult writing process and a clunky result
is the pursuit of "academese": an effort to write in an ornamented and "scholarly"
   238 | CLARITY AND CONCISION

  way. As Michael Harvey explains,1 the desire to sound more academic might prompt
  a student to write "To satisfy her hunger for nutrition, she ate the bread" rather
  than simply "She was hungry, so she ate the bread." It is true that a lot of academic
  writing is laden with unnecessary jargon, but the culture is shifting among scholars
  to favor plainer language and insist on clarity. Your professors are much more likely
  to find a self-consciously highbrow writing style tedious than impressive. As the
  saying goes,2 any fool can make simple things complicated; it takes a genius to
  make complicated things simple.

     My hope with this chapter is to help you see those habits for yourself and, most
  importantly, how your readers experience them. If you've fallen prey to habits of
  academese, I hope this chapter helps you develop a more straightforward writing
  style, one well-suited to nuanced thinking and effective communication. And while
  I don't want you to think of sentence-level wordsmithing as some kind of abstract,
  enchanted virtue, I do want you to understand that clarity and concision are more
  than aesthetics. Convoluted or wordy prose may contain some insightful or
  intriguing ideas, but if you can render those ideas in clear and concise prose, then
  you will inevitably develop those ideas even further in the course of writing. Unclear
  and bloated prose isn't just tedious to your reader; it's a needless obstacle to your
  own thinking.

  One of our professors' primary reasons for assigning writing assignments is to
  evaluate how thoroughly we have digested the assigned reading material and
  lectures. They are not as interested in our ability to write Shakespearean prose
  as they are in our ability to absorb information, wrestle with it until we can
  comprehend it, and then convey that understanding logically in writing. This is why
  writing assignments often start something like, "Drawing on Locke's narrative ..." or
  "Given what you've read about Darth Vader's aversion to democratic governance ...
  ."

     It is important to note that this process presupposes that we actually read the
  assigned readings and take notes during class lectures and discussions.
  Unsurprisingly, the hardest writing assignments I have had in college were the ones
  for which I was least prepared. I can try my darnedest to write beautifully, but if
  I have not put in the necessary time to actually read (and reread) the assigned

  material, I will have nothing meaningful to say and my professors will see straight
  through my bloviating.

     That being said, the writing process is actually a highly effective exercise for
  digesting material and developing a cohesive argument. Often it is not until I start
  writing that I realize the holes in my thinking and the areas that I need to go back
  and study more thoroughly. This chapter provides many great practical pointers
  for editing our papers in order to produce clear, refined arguments and should be
  returned to frequently.

     Peter Farrell

  The best way to achieve clarity and concision in writing is to separate the drafting
  process from the revision process. Highly effective writers routinely produce vague,
  tortuous, and bloated drafts, and are happy to do so. It usually means that they're
  onto an interesting idea. Similarly, writers often write the same idea three or four
  different ways as they're getting their thoughts down on paper. That's fine. In
  fact, that's better than fine because each repetition helps to develop key ideas
  and alternative approaches to the argument. A snarly first draft is often a great
  achievement. One just needs to take the time to develop relevant ideas and make
  them clear to the reader. For that reason, I write this section of the chapter
  envisioning someone who has already cranked out a very rough draft and is now in
  the process of revising for clarity and concision.

 Revising for clarity: who did what to whom?

  What makes a complex line of thinking easy to follow? The tricks of cohesion
  and coherence, discussed in Chapter 6, are a big help. Williams and Bizup offer
  another key point. They explain that readers experience writing as clear when the
  "character" of a sentence is also its grammatical subject and the key "action" a
  grammatical verb. They provide this fanciful example:3

        Once upon a time, as a walk through the woods was taking place on the part of Little
        Red Riding Hood, the Wolf's jump out from behind a tree caused her fright.

  Grammatically, the subject of the first part is "a walk through the woods," and the

3. Williams and Bizup, Style, 29.
   240 | CLARITY AND CONCISION

  verb is "taking place". The character, though, is obviously Little Red Riding Hood and
  the action is walking. A much more straightforward version--"As Little Red Riding
  Hood walked through the woods"--makes the character the subject and the action
  the key verb. That example goes out of its way to be silly, but consider this example
  from a website offering free college papers:4

        Another event that connects the colonist and the English together is the event of a
        hated King in England trying to take away freedom and go back to the old ways. The
        idea of how much power the King had struck Parliament. After that, the Parliament
        and the people made the King sign the Magna Carta, which limits the amount
        of power the King has. The Magna Carta also affected the rights of the American
        colonies. It practically took away all relationships between the King and the colonies.
        After the relationship was broken, America broke off from England.

  Apparently, the author is claiming that the colonists (in the 1700s?) pushed back
  against the power of the English crown in a manner similar to the Parliamentarians
  in 1215 (after having apparently been "struck" by an "idea" of "how much power the
  King had"). Grammatically, the subjects are an "event" and an "idea" rather than the
  characters, colonists, the king, and Parliament. The third sentence is refreshingly
  straightforward in structure (though vague on details). The fifth and sixth sentences
  are fairly straightforward, but also incredibly vague: the Magna Carta predated the
  American colonies by at least 400 years;5 how does that document relate to the
  American Revolution? The last sentence essentially says that after the relationship
  was broken, the relationship was broken. If the author were to rewrite the passage
  to make the grammatical subjects match the characters, he or she would be
  prompted to clarify what exactly the king, the Parliament, the English populace,
  and the American colonists did (and to who), something which the author of the
  above passage may not actually understand. This example illustrates how clarifying
  "who did what to whom" for the reader also makes writers clarify it for themselves.
  Writing clearly involves thinking clearly, and clear rigorous thinking is why your
  professors assign you writing in the first place.

     While the Magna Carta example is comically bad, here's one that is more or less
  logical but would still benefit from greater clarity:

   demonstrate why you should never, ever even look at these websites.

        IgE-dependent allergic hypersensitivity reactions such as allergic asthma and food
        allergy involve mast cells which are typically regarded as troublesome cells as a
        result. Further, the allergic sensitization-processes also involves a role for mast cells.
        Recent findings show that their functionality is not only pro-inflammatory, but can
        on the contrary have suppressive or immunomodulatory effects in allergic
        inflammation.

  The above passage isn't a terrible slog, and it's fairly clear that the whole passage
  is about mast cells. But here's a version of the same passage--the real version as it
  were--which demonstrates that the passage feels a lot clearer when mast cells, the
  "characters" driving the narrative, are also the grammatical subject of the sentence
  and the referent for the key verbs:6

        Mast cells are typically regarded as troublesome cells due to their prominent role in
        IgE-dependent allergic hypersensitivity reactions such as allergic asthma and food
        allergy. Further, it seems that mast cells are also able to play an additional role in
        the allergic sensitization-processes. Recent findings show that mast cell functionality
        is not only pro-inflammatory, but can on the contrary have suppressive or
        immunomodulatory effects in allergic inflammation.

  Both versions of the passage are consistently about mast cells, but the second
  version makes that consistency much more obvious to readers as mast cells are
  the main character of every sentence. That clear consistency allows us to devote
  more of our brain power to recalling technical terms (like immunomodulatory) and
  comprehending the key ideas. That makes it both easier and more interesting to
  read.

     To further illustrate the principle, let's take a nicely straightforward passage and
  rewrite it so that the characters are objects (rather than subjects) and the actions
  are nouns7 (rather than verbs). Here's the nicely clear original:8

        What most people really feel nostalgic about has little to do with the internal
        structure of 1950s families. It is the belief that the 1950s provided a more family-

   concept of Yin Yang," Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1822 (2012): 96.

7. When you turn a verb into a noun it's called a nominalization. For example, act  action, write  writings, or think
    thought.

   Basic Books, 1997), 34.
   242 | CLARITY AND CONCISION

        friendly economic and social environment, an easier climate in which to keep kids on
        the straight and narrow, and above all, a greater feeling of hope for a family's long-
        term future, especially for its young.

  In these two sentences, the character is a belief rather than a person or thing.
  However, the passage is still clear to the reader because it keeps the character
  consistent and explains what that character does (creates nostalgia) to who (people
  at large). Imagine if the author wrote this instead:

        People feel nostalgic not about the internal structure of 1950s families. Rather, the
        beliefs about how the 1950s provided a more family-friendly economic and social
        environment, an easier climate in which to keep kids on the straight and narrow, and
        above all, a greater feeling of hope for a family's long-term future (especially for its
        young) are what lead to those nostalgic feelings.

  This second version says substantially the same thing, but it's tedious to read
  because the character changes abruptly from "people" to "beliefs" (which works
  against cohesion) and one has to get to the end of the sentence to learn how these
  beliefs fit in. The key point is this: one of the best things you can do to revise for
  greater clarity is to recast a passage so that the characters are the grammatical
  subjects and the key actions are the verbs.

 Concision and grace

  Chapter 7 on introductions and conclusions notes the importance of concision,
  as those framing parts of the paper are often the most egregiously bloated. The
  general rule introduced there holds for any writing: every word and sentence should
  be doing some significant work for the paper as a whole. Sometimes that work
  is more to provide pleasure than meaning--you needn't ruthlessly eliminate every
  rhetorical flourish--but everything in the final version should add something
  unique to the paper. As with clarity, the benefits of concision are intellectual as well
  as stylistic: revising for concision forces writers to make deliberate decisions about
  the claims they want to make and their reasons for making them.

     Michael Harvey9 notes that fluffy, wordy prose does not necessarily result from

9. Harvey, Nuts and Bolts, 1.
                                                                                                                                CLARITY AND CONCISION | 243

   an underdeveloped writing process. Sometimes it reflects the context of academic
   writing:

         [M]any of us are afraid of writing concisely because doing so can make us feel
         exposed. Concision leaves us fewer words to hide behind. Our insights and ideas
         might appear puny stripped of those inessential words, phrases, and sentences in
         which we rough them out. We might even wonder, were we to cut out the fat, would
         anything be left? It's no wonder, then, that many students make little attempt to be
         concise--[and] may, in fact, go out of their way not to be ... .

   As noted in the opening example of Chapter 4, effortful thinking is something
   most people naturally try to avoid most of the time. It's both arduous and anxiety
   provoking to go beyond existing knowledge and assumptions to venture into
   unknown territory. In some ways, too, the general structure of education conditions
   students to approach papers as blanks to be filled rather than open-ended
   problems to explore. When students actively avoid concision, it's often because they
   want to avoid the hard thinking concision requires, they assume that writing is
   all about expressing opinions rather than undertaking a rigorous thought process,
   or they fear that they can't adequately perform and communicate an ambitious
   analysis.

   One of the first things you will learn about writing in college is that you have to be
   concise. It doesn't matter whether the paper is two pages or ten; concision is key. If
   you start to lose your reader, expect a bad grade. Professors want to see how well
   you can argue a point and this includes how gracefully the paper flows as well as
   how long the reader's attention is kept. If you can incorporate concision, cohesion
   and grace into each paper you write, then good grades are sure to follow.

      Kaethe Leonard

   Many writing guides describe editing strategies that produce a vivid, satisfying
   concision.10 Most of the advice boils down to three key moves:

     1. Look for words and phrases that you can cut entirely. Look for bits that are
         redundant: ("each and every," "unexpected surprise," "predictions about the
         future"), meaningless ("very unique," "certain factors," "slightly terrifying"), or
         clichéd ("as far as the eye can see," or "long march of time").

10. Especially, Williams, Harvey, and Lanham; see "other resources" for full references.
    244 | CLARITY AND CONCISION

    2. Look for opportunities to replace longer phrases with shorter phrases or words.
         For example, "the way in which" can often be replaced by "how" and "despite
         the fact that" can usually be replaced by "although." Strong, precise verbs can
         often replace bloated phrases. Consider this example: "The goal of Alexander
         the Great was to create a united empire across a vast distance." And compare it
         to this: "Alexander the Great sought to unite a vast empire."

    3. Try to rearrange sentences or passages to make them shorter and livelier.
         Williams and Bizup11 recommend changing negatives to affirmatives. Consider
         the negatives in this sentence: "School nurses often do not notice if a young
         schoolchild does not have adequate food at home." You could more concisely
         and clearly write, "School nurses rarely notice if a young schoolchild lacks
         adequate food at home." It says the same thing, but is much easier to read
         which makes for a happier and more engaged reader.

   Good parallelism can also help you write shorter text that better conveys your
   thinking. For example, Stacy Schiff writes this in her best-selling biography of
   Cleopatra:12

         A goddess as a child, a queen at eighteen, a celebrity soon thereafter, she was an
         object of speculation and veneration, gossip and legend, even in her own time.

   Imagine if, instead, Schiff wrote this:

         Cleopatra was seen as divine when she was a child. She became the sovereign ruler
         at eighteen, and she became well known throughout the ancient world early in her
         reign. People speculated about her, worshipped her, gossiped about her, and told
         legends about her, even in her own time.

   The second version says the same thing, but the extra words tend to obscure
   Schiff's point. The original ("goddess as a child, queen at eighteen, celebrity soon
   thereafter") effectively uses parallelism to vividly convey the dramatic shifts in
   Cleopatra's roles and her prominence in the ancient world.

 Reading with concision and grace in mind

   There is less tolerance for academese than there used to be in scholarly
   communities; however, a lot of landmark texts were written in a time when there
   wasn't such a high value placed on clarity and concision. In your studies, then, you
   will probably have to engage with important texts that violate almost all the advice
   given here.

      Consider the following example from Talcott Parsons, a sociological theorist
   noted for both his intellectual force and utterly impenetrable writing style. In
   reading this passage,13 imagine "ego" and "alter" as two people interacting:

         Communication through a common system of symbols is the precondition of this
         reciprocity or complementarity of expectations. The alternatives which are open
         to alter must have some measure of stability in two respects: first, as realistic
         possibilities for alter, and second, in their meaning to ego. This stability presupposes
         generalization from the particularity of the given situations of ego and alter, both
         of which are continually changing and are never concretely identical over any two
         moments in time. When such generalization occurs, and actions, gestures, or
         symbols have more or less the same meaning for both ego and alter, we may speak
         of a common culture existing between them, through which their interaction is
         mediated.

   Here's a version after I edited for concision using the three moves described above:

         Reciprocity, or complementary expectations, depends on a common system of
         symbols. The symbolic alternatives for alter must be stable, in that they are both
         realistic for alter and meaningful to ego. That is, actions, gestures, or symbols must
         have a shared and persistent meaning for ego and alter even though ego and alter
         are in different situations and are constantly changing. When meanings are shared
         and persistent, we may say that the interaction between alter and ego is mediated
         by a common culture.

   The revised version is about 30 percent shorter, and it demonstrates how concision
   makes one's points come through more clearly. You will almost certainly have to
   read works of authors who did not prioritize clarity and concision (or even cohesion
   and coherence), and that's a drag. But knowing how wordiness interferes with

13. Talcott Parsons and Edward Shills eds., Toward a General Theory of Action. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University
    Press, 1967), 105.
    246 | CLARITY AND CONCISION

   clarity can help you distill essential meanings from challenging texts. In many ways,
   writing well and reading incisively are two facets of the same cognitive skill set.

  Grace

   Academic writing is not wholly utilitarian. An elegant and apt turn of phrase is
   satisfying both to write and to read. While you can't often summon elegance out
   of nowhere, you can learn a few structures that are often pleasing to the reader's
   ear because they harmonize what you're saying with how you're saying it.14 Here are
   two rhetorical tricks that you can use to reinforce your points.

     1. Balance. Readers often find balanced sentences and phrases pleasing. The
         Cleopatra example above ("goddess as a child, queen at eighteen, celebrity
         soon thereafter") illustrates parallelism, which is one kind of balance: using
         parallel structures to convey a parallel idea. This parallelism not only helps
         Schiff be powerfully concise, it quickly and vividly conveys the idea that
         Cleopatra led a remarkable life. Williams and Bizup15 offer another example of
         an elegant sentence in which the two parts are balanced in their structure:

                A government that is unwilling to listen to the moderate hopes of its citizenry
                must eventually answer to the harsh justice of its revolutionaries.

         The same sentence with the parallel parts marked:

                A government that is unwilling to listen to the moderate hopes of its citizenry
                must eventually answer to the harsh justice of its revolutionaries.

         The balanced structure and contrasting language reinforces the author's
         either-or point: "listen" or "answer"; "moderate hopes" or "harsh justice",
         "citizenry" or "revolutionaries." The balanced structure adds rhetorical force to
         the argument.
     2. Emphasis. Read these sentences out loud, or imagine yourself doing so:

14. "Rhetoric" refers to how meaning is overtly or subtly built into the structure of language. In everyday language
    we often use the word rhetoric to describe speech or writing devoid of substance, but that's not what the word
    means. This section describes often used structures identified and explained by rhetoricians.

15. Williams and Bizup, Style, 171.
                 CLARITY AND CONCISION | 247

Version 1:

But far and away, the largest weight-inducing food, out-stripping all others, was
the potato chip.16

Version 2:

      But far and away, the potato chip was the largest weight-inducing food, out-
      stripping all others.

The first version places a particular rhetorical emphasis on "the potato chip"
because it comes last in the sentence after a three-part build-up. The second
version says the exact same thing, and it isn't hard to see that "potato chip" is the
key part of the sentence. However, the rhetorical emphasis on "the potato chip"
is somewhat weaker. This common rhetorical trick is to put the part you want to
emphasize at the very end of the sentence.

   These are just two rhetorical structures that scholars have identified. You can find
others (Google "rhetorical device") that you can bring into your repertoire. Most
people can't set out to write elegantly per se, and you certainly shouldn't spend your
writing time crafting elegantly balanced sentences that have little to do with your
argument or analysis. But the more familiar you are with these rhetorical structures,
the more often you can recognize and use them.

                 "actions" the verbs. That is, make them clearer.A. The scarcity of research funds for
                 nutritional scientists means that offers by food companies to fund such research may be
                 especially attractive. The implicit pressure to shape the language of the findings to avoid
                 alienation between scholars and companies is worrisome to consider.B. While
                 educational experiences are an obvious benefit of tribal colleges, the needs tribal

                 addressed by educational institutions.

            2. Take these straightforward passages and make them less clear without changing the
                 meaning. Turn verbs into nouns and make subjects into objects.A. "Statisticians prepared
                 to use spatial models need to keep the role of the models in perspective. When scientific
                 interest centers on the large-scale effects, the idea is to use a few extra small-scale
                 parameters so that the large-scale parameters are estimated more efficiently."17 B. "Social
                 scientists will be led astray if they accept the lies organizations tell about themselves. If,
                 instead, they look for places where the stories told don't hold up, for the events and
                 activities those speaking for the organization ignore, cover up, or explain away, they will
                 find a wealth of things to include in the body of material from which they construct their
                 definitions."18

            3. Edit these passages for concision, using the three moves described above. Be sure to
                 preserve all of the meaning contained in the original.A. Each and every student enrolled in
                 our educational institutions deserves and is entitled to competent instruction in all of the
                 key academic areas of study. No student should be without ample time and help in
                 mastering such basic skills.B. If you really have no choice in regards to avoiding a long
                 and extended bureaucratic process in making your complaint, it is very important that you

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

        1. Identify drafting strategies that improve writing.
        2. Use drafting strategies to prepare the first draft of an essay.

Drafting is the stage of the writing process in which you develop a complete first
version of a piece of writing.

   Even professional writers admit that an empty page scares them because they
feel they need to come up with something fresh and original every time they
open a blank document on their computers. Because you have completed the first
two steps in the writing process, you have already recovered from empty page
syndrome. You have hours of prewriting and planning already done. You know what
will go on that blank page: what you wrote in your outline.

Getting Started: Strategies For Drafting

Your objective for this portion of the chapter is to draft the body paragraphs of
a standard five-paragraph essay. A five-paragraph essay contains an introduction,
three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. If you are more comfortable starting
on paper than on the computer, you can start on paper and then type it before
you revise. You can also use a voice recorder to get yourself started, dictating a
paragraph or two to get you thinking. In this lesson, Mariah does all her work on the
computer, but you may use pen and paper or the computer to write a rough draft.
250 | DRAFTING

Making the Writing Process Work for You

What makes the writing process so beneficial to writers is that it encourages
alternatives to standard practices while motivating you to develop your best ideas.
For instance, the following approaches, done alone or in combination with others,
may improve your writing and help you move forward in the writing process:

   · Begin writing with the part you know the most about. You can start with the
      third paragraph in your outline if ideas come easily to mind. You can start with
      the second paragraph or the first paragraph, too. Although paragraphs may
      vary in length, keep in mind that short paragraphs may contain insufficient
      support. Readers may also think the writing is abrupt. Long paragraphs may
      be wordy and may lose your reader's interest. As a guideline, try to write
      paragraphs longer than one sentence but shorter than the length of an entire
      double-spaced page.

   · Write one paragraph at a time and then stop. As long as you complete the
      assignment on time, you may choose how many paragraphs you complete in
      one sitting. Pace yourself. On the other hand, try not to procrastinate. Writers
      should always meet their deadlines.

   · Take short breaks to refresh your mind. This tip might be most useful if you
      are writing a multipage report or essay. Still, if you are antsy or cannot
      concentrate, take a break to let your mind rest. But do not let breaks extend
      too long. If you spend too much time away from your essay, you may have
      trouble starting again. You may forget key points or lose momentum. Try
      setting an alarm to limit your break, and when the time is up, return to your
      desk to write.

   · Be reasonable with your goals. If you decide to take ten-minute breaks, try to
      stick to that goal. If you told yourself that you need more facts, then commit to
      finding them. Holding yourself to your own goals will create successful writing
      assignments.

   · Keep your audience and purpose in mind as you write. These aspects of
      writing are just as important when you are writing a single paragraph for your
      essay as when you are considering the direction of the entire essay.

Of all of these considerations, keeping your purpose and your audience at the front
of your mind is the most important key to writing success. If your purpose is to
                                                                                                                                                DRAFTING | 251

persuade, for example, you will present your facts and details in the most logical
and convincing way you can.

   Your purpose will guide your mind as you compose your sentences. Your audience
will guide word choice. Are you writing for experts, for a general audience, for other
college students, or for people who know very little about your topic? Keep asking
yourself what your readers, with their background and experience, need to be told
in order to understand your ideas. How can you best express your ideas so they are
totally clear and your communication is effective?

  TIP

     You may want to identify your purpose and audience on an index card that
     you clip to your paper (or keep next to your computer). On that card, you
     may want to write notes to yourself--perhaps about what that audience
     might not know or what it needs to know--so that you will be sure to
     address those issues when you write. It may be a good idea to also state
     exactly what you want to explain to that audience, or to inform them of, or
     to persuade them about.

               CONNECTING THE PIECES: WRITING
  AT WORK

     Many of the documents you produce at work target a particular audience for a particular
     purpose. You may find that it is highly advantageous to know as much as you can about your
     target audience and to prepare your message to reach that audience, even if the audience is a
     coworker or your boss. Menu language is a common example. Descriptions like "organic
     romaine" and "free-range chicken" are intended to appeal to a certain type of customer though
     perhaps not to the same customer who craves a thick steak. Similarly, mail-order companies
     research the demographics of the people who buy their merchandise. Successful vendors
     customize product descriptions in catalogs to appeal to their buyers' tastes. For example, the
     product descriptions in a skateboarder catalog will differ from the descriptions in a clothing
     catalog for mature adults.

    EXERCISE 1

     Using the topic for the essay that you outlined in previous exercises, describe your purpose and
     your audience as specifically as you can. Use your own sheet of paper to record your responses.
     Then keep these responses near you during future stages of the writing process.

Setting Goals for Your First Draft

A draft is a complete version of a piece of writing, but it is not the final version. The
step in the writing process after drafting, as you may remember, is revising. During
revising, you will have the opportunity to make changes to your first draft before
you put the finishing touches on it during the editing and proofreading stage. A
first draft gives you a working version that you can later improve.

            CONNECTING THE PIECES: WRITING
AT WORK

Workplace writing in certain environments is done by teams of writers who collaborate on the
planning, writing, and revising of documents, such as long reports, technical manuals, and the
results of scientific research. Collaborators do not need to be in the same room, the same
building, or even the same city. Many collaborations are conducted over the Internet.

In a perfect collaboration, each contributor has the right to add, edit, and delete text. Strong
communication skills, in addition to strong writing skills, are important in this kind of writing
254 | DRAFTING

     situation because disagreements over style, content, process, emphasis, and other issues may
     arise.
     The collaborative software, or document management systems, that groups use to work on
     common projects is sometimes called groupware or workgroup support systems.
     The reviewing tool on some word-processing programs also gives you access to a collaborative
     tool that many smaller workgroups use when they exchange documents. You can also use it to
     leave comments to yourself.

               TIP

     If you invest some time now to investigate how the reviewing tool in your word processor works,
     you will be able to use it with confidence during the revision stage of the writing process. Then,
     when you start to revise, set your reviewing tool to track any changes you make, so you will be
     able to tinker with text and commit only those final changes you want to keep.

Discovering the Basic Elements of a First Draft

If you have been using the information in this chapter step by step to help you
develop an assignment, you already have both a formal topic outline and a formal
sentence outline to direct your writing. Knowing what a first draft looks like will help
you make the creative leap from the outline to the first draft. A first draft should
include the following elements:
                                                                                                                                                DRAFTING | 255

   · An introduction that piques the audience's interest, tells what the essay is
      about, and motivates readers to keep reading.

   · A thesis statement that presents the main point, or controlling idea, of the
      entire piece of writing.

   · A topic sentence in each paragraph that states the main idea of the paragraph
      and implies how that main idea connects to the thesis statement.

   · Supporting sentences in each paragraph that develop or explain the topic
      sentence. These can be specific facts, examples, anecdotes, or other details
      that elaborate on the topic sentence.

   · A conclusion that reinforces the thesis statement and leaves the audience
      with a feeling of completion.

These elements follow the standard five-paragraph essay format, which you
probably first encountered in high school. This basic format is valid for most essays
you will write in college, even much longer ones. For now, however, Mariah focuses
on writing the three body paragraphs from her outline.

The Role of Topic Sentences

Topic sentences make the structure of a text and the writer's basic arguments
easy to locate and comprehend. In college writing, using a topic sentence in each
paragraph of the essay is the standard rule. However, the topic sentence does not
always have to be the first sentence in your paragraph even if it the first item in your
formal outline.
256 | DRAFTING

               TIP

     When you begin to draft your paragraphs, you should follow your outline fairly closely. After all,
     you spent valuable time developing those ideas. However, as you begin to express your ideas in
     complete sentences, it might strike you that the topic sentence might work better at the end of
     the paragraph or in the middle. Try it. Writing a draft, by its nature, is a good time for
     experimentation.

The topic sentence can be the first, middle, or final sentence in a paragraph. The
assignment's audience and purpose will often determine where a topic sentence
belongs. When the purpose of the assignment is to persuade, for example, the
topic sentence should be the first sentence in a paragraph. In a persuasive essay,
the writer's point of view should be clearly expressed at the beginning of each
paragraph.

   Choosing where to position the topic sentence depends not only on your
audience and purpose but also on the essay's arrangement, or order. When you
organize information according to order of importance, the topic sentence may be
the final sentence in a paragraph. All the supporting sentences build up to the topic
sentence. Chronological order may also position the topic sentence as the final
sentence because the controlling idea of the paragraph may make the most sense
at the end of a sequence.

   When you organize information according to spatial order, a topic sentence may
appear as the middle sentence in a paragraph. An essay arranged by spatial order
often contains paragraphs that begin with descriptions. A reader may first need a
visual in his or her mind before understanding the development of the paragraph.
                                                                                                                                                DRAFTING | 257

When the topic sentence is in the middle, it unites the details that come before it
with the ones that come after it.

               TIP

     As you read critically throughout the writing process, keep topic sentences in mind. You may
     discover topic sentences that are not always located at the beginning of a paragraph. For
     example, fiction writers customarily use topic ideas, either expressed or implied, to move
     readers through their texts. In nonfiction writing, such as popular magazines, topic sentences
     are often used when the author thinks it is appropriate (based on the audience and the purpose,
     of course). A single topic sentence might even control the development of a number of
     paragraphs.

Developing topic sentences and thinking about their placement in a paragraph will
prepare you to write the rest of the paragraph.

Paragraphs

The paragraph is the main structural component of an essay as well as other forms
of writing. Each paragraph of an essay adds another related main idea to support
the writer's thesis, or controlling idea. Each related main idea is supported and
developed with facts, examples, and other details that explain it. By exploring and
refining one main idea at a time, writers build a strong case for their thesis.

   Paragraph Length
   How long should a paragraph be?
   One answer to this important question may be "long enough"--long enough for
258 | DRAFTING

you to address your points and explain your main idea. To grab attention or to
present succinct supporting ideas, a paragraph can be fairly short and consist of
two to three sentences. A paragraph in a complex essay about some abstract point
in philosophy or archaeology can be three-quarters of a page or more in length.
As long as the writer maintains close focus on the topic and does not ramble, a
long paragraph is acceptable in college-level writing. In general, try to keep the
paragraphs longer than one sentence but shorter than one full page of double-
spaced text.

  TIP

     Journalistic style often calls for brief two- or three-sentence paragraphs because of how people
     read the news, both online and in print. Blogs and other online information sources often adopt
     this paragraphing style, too. Readers often skim the first paragraphs of a great many articles
     before settling on the handful of stories they want to read in detail.

You may find that a particular paragraph you write may be longer than one that
will hold your audience's interest. In such cases, you should divide the paragraph
into two or more shorter paragraphs, adding a topic statement or some kind of
                                                                                                                                                DRAFTING | 259

transitional word or phrase at the start of the new paragraph. Transition words or
phrases show the connection between the two ideas.

   In all cases, however, be guided by what you instructor wants and expects to find
in your draft. Many instructors will expect you to develop a mature college-level style
as you progress through the semester's assignments.

    EXERCISE 2

     To build your sense of appropriate paragraph length, use the Internet to find examples of the
     following items. Copy them into a file, identify your sources, and present them to your instructor
     with your annotations, or notes.

          · A news article written in short paragraphs. Take notes on, or annotate, your selection with
             your observations about the effect of combining paragraphs that develop the same topic
             idea. Explain how effective those paragraphs would be.

          · A long paragraph from a scholarly work that you identify through an academic search
             engine. Annotate it with your observations about the author's paragraphing style.

Starting Your First Draft

Now we are finally ready to look over Mariah's shoulder as she begins to write her
essay about digital technology and the confusing choices that consumers face. As
she does, you should have in front of you your outline, with its thesis statement and
topic sentences, and the notes you wrote earlier in this lesson on your purpose and
audience. Reviewing these will put both you and Mariah in the proper mind-set to
start.

   The following is Mariah's thesis statement.
260 | DRAFTING

Here are the notes that Mariah wrote to herself to characterize her purpose and
audience.

Mariah chose to begin by writing a quick introduction based on her thesis
statement. She knew that she would want to improve her introduction significantly
when she revised. Right now, she just wanted to give herself a starting point.
                                                                                                                                                DRAFTING | 261

  TIP

     Remember Mariah's other options. She could have started directly with any of the body
     paragraphs.

With her thesis statement and her purpose and audience notes in front of her,
Mariah then looked at her sentence outline. She chose to use that outline because
it includes the topic sentences. The following is the portion of her for the first body
paragraph. The roman numeral II identifies the topic sentence for the paragraph,
capital letters indicate supporting details, and arabic numerals label subpoints.
262 | DRAFTING

Mariah then began to expand the ideas in her outline into a paragraph. Notice
how the outline helped her guarantee that all her sentences in the body of the
paragraph develop the topic sentence.
DRAFTING | 263
264 | DRAFTING

  TIP

     If you write your first draft on the computer, consider creating a new file folder for each course
     with a set of subfolders inside the course folders for each assignment you are given. Label the
     folders clearly with the course names, and label each assignment folder and word processing
     document with a title that you will easily recognize. The assignment name is a good choice for
     the document. Then use that subfolder to store all the drafts you create. When you start each
     new draft, do not just write over the last one. Instead, save the draft with a new tag after the
     title--draft 1, draft 2, and so on--so that you will have a complete history of drafts in case your
     instructor wishes you to submit them.
     In your documents, observe any formatting requirements--for margins, headers, placement of
     page numbers, and other layout matters--that your instructor requires.

    EXERCISE 3
     Study how Mariah made the transition from her sentence outline to her first draft. First, copy her
     outline onto your own sheet of paper. Leave a few spaces between each part of the outline.
                                                                                                                                                DRAFTING | 265

     Then copy sentences from Mariah's paragraph to align each sentence with its corresponding
     entry in her outline.

Continuing the First Draft

Mariah continued writing her essay, moving to the second and third body
paragraphs. She had supporting details but no numbered subpoints in her outline,
so she had to consult her prewriting notes for specific information to include.

  TIP

     If you decide to take a break between finishing your first body paragraph and starting the next
     one, do not start writing immediately when you return to your work. Put yourself back in context
     and in the mood by rereading what you have already written. This is what Mariah did. If she had
     stopped writing in the middle of writing the paragraph, she could have jotted down some quick
     notes to herself about what she would write next.
266 | DRAFTING

Preceding each body paragraph that Mariah wrote is the appropriate section of her
sentence outline. Notice how she expanded roman numeral III from her outline into
a first draft of the second body paragraph. As you read, ask yourself how closely she
stayed on purpose and how well she paid attention to the needs of her audience.
                                                                                                                                                DRAFTING | 267

   Mariah then began her third and final body paragraph using roman numeral IV
from her outline.
268 | DRAFTING

    EXERCISE 4

     Reread body paragraphs two and three of the essay that Mariah is writing. Then answer the
     questions on your own sheet of paper.

        1. In body paragraph two, Mariah decided to develop her paragraph as a nonfiction narrative.
             Do you agree with her decision? Explain. How else could she have chosen to develop the
             paragraph? Why is that better?

        2. Compare the writing styles of paragraphs two and three. What evidence do you have that
             Mariah was getting tired or running out of steam? What advice would you give her? Why?

        3. Choose one of these two body paragraphs. Write a version of your own that you think
             better fits Mariah's audience and purpose.

Writing a Title

A writer's best choice for a title is one that alludes to the main point of the entire
essay. Like the headline in a newspaper or the big, bold title in a magazine, an
essay's title gives the audience a first peek at the content. If readers like the title,
they are likely to keep reading.

   Following her outline carefully, Mariah crafted each paragraph of her essay.
Moving step by step in the writing process, Mariah finished the draft and even
included a brief concluding paragraph. She then decided, as the final touch for her
writing session, to add an engaging title.

Writing Your Own First Draft

Now you may begin your own first draft, if you have not already done so. Follow the
suggestions and the guidelines presented in this section.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

· Make the writing process work for you. Use any and all of the strategies that help you
   move forward in the writing process.

· Always be aware of your purpose for writing and the needs of your audience. Cater to
   those needs in every sensible way.

· Remember to include all the key structural parts of an essay: a thesis statement that is
   part of your introductory paragraph, three or more body paragraphs as described in your
   outline, and a concluding paragraph. Then add an engaging title to draw in readers.

· Write paragraphs of an appropriate length for your writing assignment. Paragraphs in
   college-level writing can be a page long, as long as they cover the main topics in your
   outline.

· Use your topic outline or your sentence outline to guide the development of your
   paragraphs and the elaboration of your ideas. Each main idea, indicated by a roman
   numeral in your outline, becomes the topic of a new paragraph. Develop it with the
   supporting details and the subpoints of those details that you included in your outline.

· Generally speaking, write your introduction and conclusion last, after you have fleshed out
   the body paragraphs.
270 | EFFECTIVE THESIS STATEMENTS

EFFECTIVE THESIS STATEMENTS

   Kirk Fontenot; Shelly Rodrigue; Wanda M. Waller; and Will Rogers

What Is a Thesis Statement?

   · A thesis statement tells a reader how you will interpret the significance of the
      subject matter under discussion. Such a statement is also called an
      "argument," a "main idea," or a "controlling idea."

   · A good thesis has two parts. It should tell what you plan to argue, and it should
      "telegraph" how you plan to argue--that is, what particular support for your
      claim is going where in your essay.

   · A standard place for your thesis is at the end of the introductory paragraph.
   · A thesis is an interpretation of a subject, not the subject itself. The subject, or

      topic, of an essay might be World War II or Moby Dick; a thesis must then offer
      a way to understand the war or the novel that others might dispute.
   · A strong thesis not only grabs the interest of your reader, who now wants to
      see you support your unique interpretation; it also provides a focus for your
      argument, one to which every part of your paper refers in the development of
      your position.
   · A thesis keeps the writer centered on the matter at hand and reduces the risk
      of intellectual wandering. Likewise, a thesis provides the reader with a "road
      map," clearly laying out the intellectual route ahead.
   · A thesis statement avoids the first person ("I believe," "In my opinion").

A simple equation for a thesis might look like this:
   What you plan to argue + How you plan to argue it = Thesis

Specific topic + Attitude/angle/argument = Thesis

Steps to Write an Effective Thesis Statement

   · Choose a prompt or, if appropriate, select a topic: television violence and
                                                                                                                 EFFECTIVE THESIS STATEMENTS | 271

      children.
   · Read the prompt carefully or, if appropriate, ask an interesting question:

          What are the effects of television violence on children?
   · Revise the prompt or question into a preliminary or "working" thesis:

          Violence on television increases aggressive behavior in children.
   · Avoid general phrasing and/or sweeping words such as "all" or "none" or

      "every."
   · Lead the reader toward the topic sentences (the subtopics needed to prove

      the thesis).
   · Anticipate the counterarguments. Once you have a working thesis, you should

      think about what might be said against it. This will help you to refine your
      thesis, and it will also make you think of the arguments that you'll need to
      refute later on in your essay. (Every argument has a counterargument. If yours
      doesn't, then it's not an argument--it may be a fact or an opinion, but it is not
      an argument.)

          Violence on television increases aggressive behavior in children.
   · This statement is on its way to being a thesis. However, it is too easy to

      imagine possible counterarguments. For example, an observer of societal
      trends may believe that parenting or easy access to weapons are important
      factors in youth violence. If you complicate your thesis by anticipating the
      counterargument, you'll strengthen your argument, as shown in the sentence
      below.

          While poor parenting and easy access to weapons may act as
            contributory factors, in fact, when children are exposed to television
            violence, they become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others,
            are more fearful of the world around them, and are more likely to behave
            in aggressive or harmful ways toward others.

The Components of an Effective Thesis Statement

   · You can't just pluck a thesis out of thin air. Even if you have a terrific insight
      concerning a topic, it won't be worth much unless you can logically and
      persuasively support it in the body of your essay. A thesis is the evolutionary
      result of a thinking process, not a miraculous creation. Formulating a thesis is
      not the first thing you do after reading an essay assignment.

   · An effective thesis statement fulfills the following criteria:
          Substantial - Your thesis should be a claim for which it is easy to answer
272 | EFFECTIVE THESIS STATEMENTS

            every reader's question: "So what?"
          Supportable - A thesis must be a claim that you can prove with the

            evidence at hand (e.g., evidence from your texts or from your research).
            Your claim should not be outlandish, nor should it be mere personal
            opinion or preference (e.g., "Frederick Douglass is my favorite historical
            figure"). It tackles a subject that could be adequately covered in the format
            of the project assigned.
          Precise - It is focused and specific. A strong thesis proves a point without
            discussing everything. It clearly asserts your own conclusion based on
            evidence. Note: Be flexible. It is perfectly okay to change your thesis!
          Arguable - It should be contestable, proposing an arguable point with
            which people could reasonably disagree.
          Relevant - If you are responding to an assignment, the thesis should
            answer the question your teacher has posed. In order to stay focused, pay
            attention to the task words in the assignment: summarize, argue,
            compare/contrast, etc.
          Aware of Counters - It anticipates and refutes the counterarguments.

The best thesis statement is a balance of specific details and concise language. Your
goal is to articulate an argument in detail without burdening the reader with too
much information.

Questions to Review Your Thesis

   · "Do I answer the question?" This might seem obvious, but it's worth asking. No
      matter how intriguing or dazzling, a thesis that doesn't answer the question is
      not a good thesis!

   · "Have I taken a position that others might challenge or oppose?" If not, then
      you probably do not have a strong argument. Theses that are too vague often
      have this problem. If your thesis contains vague words like "good" or
      "successful," see if you could be more specific: why is something "good"; what
      makes something "successful"?

   · Would anyone possibly care about this thesis? So what? Does your thesis
      present a position or an interpretation worth pursuing? If a reader's first
      response is, "So what?" then you need to clarify, to forge a relationship, or to
      connect to a larger issue.

   · "Does my essay support my thesis specifically and without wandering?" Just
                                                                                                                 EFFECTIVE THESIS STATEMENTS | 273

      as a thesis that doesn't answer the question ultimately fails, so does a thesis
      that isn't properly supported with evidence and reasoning.
   · Does my thesis statement adequately address the direction words of the
      prompt: summarize, argue, compare/contrast, analyze, discuss, etc.?

Myths about Thesis Statements

   · Every paper requires one. Assignments that ask you to write personal
      responses or to explore a subject don't want you to seem to pre-judge the
      issues. Essays of literary interpretation often want you to be aware of many
      effects rather than seeming to box yourself into one view of the text.

   · A thesis statement must come at the end of the first paragraph. This is a
      natural position for a statement of focus, but it's not the only one. Some theses
      can be stated in the opening sentences of an essay; others need a paragraph
      or two of introduction; others can't be fully formulated until the end.

   · A thesis statement must be one sentence in length, no matter how many
      clauses it contains. Clear writing is more important than rules like these. Use
      two or three sentences if you need them. A complex argument may require a
      whole tightly-knit paragraph to make its initial statement of position.

   · You can't start writing an essay until you have a perfect thesis statement. It
      may be advisable to draft a hypothesis or tentative thesis statement near the
      start of a big project, but changing and refining a thesis is a main task of
      thinking your way through your ideas as you write a paper. And some essay
      projects need to explore the question in depth without being locked in before
      they can provide even a tentative answer.

   · A thesis statement must give three points of support. It should indicate that
      the essay will explain and give evidence for its assertion, but points don't need
      to come in any specific number.
274 | EFFECTIVE THESIS STATEMENTS

     Progressively Complex Thesis Statements

       Thesis Statement #1: The North and South fought the Civil War for many reasons, some of
       which were the same and some different.
       Evaluation: The worst thesis imaginable (other than non-existent). You've said nothing of
       value.
       Thesis Statement #2: While both sides fought the Civil War over the issue of slavery, the
       North fought for moral reasons while the South fought to preserve its own institutions.
       Evaluation: A good pre-draft thesis. Not a bad start at all. Here's the catch and the time-
       consuming part of the process. As you write, your argument may become more refined or
       changed. When it does, so should the thesis.
       Thesis Statement #3: While there were many underlying causes of the Civil War, three
       factors converged to make conflict inevitable: the issue of slavery, the idea of states' rights,
       and the fight to control the future of the West.
       Evaluation: A solid preview of your argument and the main points you intend to make. This
       would be a strong approach for a persuasive or exemplification essay.
       Thesis Statement #4: While both Northerners and Southerners believed they fought against
       tyranny and oppression, Northerners focused on the oppression of slaves while Southerners
       defended their own rights to property and self-government.
       Evaluation: Good! The thesis statement is nuanced, recognizing the existence of an
       opposing point of view while strongly defending your point. It is relatively specific yet
       concise--and doesn't make the reader want to stop reading.

INTROS AND OUTROS

   Amy Guptill

In today's world ...

Those opening words--so common in student papers--represent the most
prevalent misconception about introductions: that they shouldn't really say
anything substantive. As noted in Chapter 2, the five-paragraph format that most
students mastered before coming to college suggests that introductory paragraphs
should start very general and gradually narrow down to the thesis. As a result,
students frequently write introductions for college papers in which the first two or
three (or more) sentences are patently obvious or overly broad. Charitable and well
rested instructors just skim over that text and start reading closely when they arrive
at something substantive. Frustrated and overtired instructors emit a dramatic self-
pitying sigh, assuming that the whole paper will be as lifeless and gassy as those
first few sentences. If you've gotten into the habit of beginning opening sentences
with the following phrases, firmly resolve to strike them from your repertoire right
now:

      In today's world ...

      Throughout human history ...

      Since the dawn of time ...

      Webster's Dictionary defines [CONCEPT] as ...

For one thing, sentences that begin with the first three stems are often wrong.
For example, someone may write, "Since the dawn of time, people have tried to
increase crop yields." In reality, people have not been trying to increase crop yields
throughout human history--agriculture is only about 23,000 years old, after
all--and certainly not since the dawn of time (whenever that was). For another,
sentences that start so broadly, even when factually correct, could not possibly end
with anything interesting.
  276 | INTROS AND OUTROS

 I started laughing when I first read this chapter because my go-to introduction
 for every paper was always "Throughout history..." In high school it was true--my
 first few sentences did not have any meaning. Now I understand it should be
 the exact opposite. Introductions should scream to your readers, HEY GUYS, READ
 THIS! I don't want my readers' eyes to glaze over before they even finish the first
 paragraph, do you? And how annoying is it to read a bunch of useless sentences
 anyways, right? Every sentence should be necessary and you should set your papers
 with a good start.

    Aly Button

 So what should you do? Well, start at the beginning. By that I mean, start explaining
 what the reader needs to know to comprehend your thesis and its importance. For
 example, compare the following two paragraphs:

 Five-Paragraph Theme Version:

        Throughout time, human societies have had religion. Major world religions since
        the dawn of civilization include Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Animism, Judaism,
        Christianity, and Islam. These and all other religions provide a set of moral principles,
        a leadership structure, and an explanation for unknown questions such as what
        happens after people die. Since the dawn of religion, it has always been opposed
        to science because one is based on faith and the other on reason. However, the
        notion of embodied cognition is a place where physical phenomena connect with
        religious ones. Paradoxically, religion can emphasize a deep involvement in reality,
        an embodied cognition that empowers followers to escape from physical constraints
        and reach a new spirituality. Religion carefully constructs a physical environment to
        synthesize an individual's memories, emotions, and physical actions, in a manner
        that channels the individual's cognitive state towards spiritual transcendence.

 Organically Structured Version:1

        Religion is an endeavor to cultivate freedom from bodily constraints to reach a
        higher state of being beyond the physical constraints of reality. But how is it possible
        to employ a system, the human body, to transcend its own limitations? Religion
        and science have always had an uneasy relationship as empiricism is stretched to
        explain religious phenomena, but psychology has recently added a new perspective

1. This example is slightly adapted from a student-authored essay: Victor Seet, "Embodiment in Religion,"
  Discoveries, 11 (2012). Discoveries is an annual publication of the Knight Institute for Writing in the Disciplines of
  Cornell University which publishes excellent papers written by Cornell undergraduates.
                                                                                                                                 INTROS AND OUTROS | 277

      to the discussion. Embodiment describes the interaction between humans and the
      environment that lays a foundation for cognition and can help explain the
      mechanisms that underlie religion's influence on believers. This is a rare moment
      where science and religion are able to coexist without the familiar controversy.
      Paradoxically, religion can emphasize a deep involvement in reality, an embodied
      cognition that empowers followers to escape from physical constraints and reach a
      new spirituality. Religion carefully constructs a physical environment to synthesize an
      individual's memories, emotions, and physical actions, in a manner that channels the
      individual's cognitive state towards spiritual transcendence.

In the first version, the first three sentences state well known facts that do not
directly relate to the thesis. The fourth sentence is where the action starts, though
that sentence ("Since the dawn of religion, it has always been opposed to science
because one is based on faith and the other on reason") is still overstated: when
was this dawn of religion? And was there "science," as we now understand it, at that
time? The reader has to slog through to the fifth sentence before the intro starts to
develop some momentum.

   Training in the five-paragraph theme format seems to have convinced some
student writers that beginning with substantive material will be too abrupt for
the reader. But the second example shows that a meatier beginning isn't jarring;
it is actually much more engaging. The first sentence of the organic example is
somewhat general, but it specifies the particular aspect of religion (transcending
physical experience) that is germane to the thesis. The next six sentences lay out
the ideas and concepts that explain the thesis, which is provided in the last two
sentences. Overall, every sentence is needed to thoroughly frame the thesis. It is a
lively paragraph in itself, and it piques the reader's interest in the author's original
thinking about religion.

   Sometimes a vague introductory paragraph reflects a simple, obvious thesis (see
Chapter 3) and a poorly thought-out paper. More often, though, a shallow
introduction represents a missed opportunity to convey the writer's depth of
thought from the get-go. Students adhering to the five-paragraph theme format
sometime assume that such vagueness is needed to book-end an otherwise pithy
paper. As you can see from these examples, that is simply untrue. I've seen some
student writers begin with a vague, high-school style intro (thinking it obligatory)
and then write a wonderfully vivid and engaging introduction as their second
paragraph. Other papers I've seen have an interesting, original thesis embedded in
late body paragraphs that should be articulated up front and used to shape the
whole body. If you must write a vague "since the dawn of time" intro to get the
writing process going, then go ahead. Just budget the time to rewrite the intro
   278 | INTROS AND OUTROS

  around your well developed, arguable thesis and ensure that the body paragraphs
  are organized explicitly by your analytical thread.

     Here are two more examples of excellent introductory paragraphs written by
  undergraduate students in different fields. Note how, in both cases, (1) the first
  sentence has real substance, (2) every sentence is indispensable to setting up the
  thesis, and (3) the thesis is complex and somewhat surprising. Both of these
  introductory paragraphs set an ambitious agenda for the paper. As a reader, it's
  pretty easy to imagine how the body paragraphs that follow will progress through
  the nuanced analysis needed to carry out the thesis:

     From Davis O'Connell's "Abelard":2

        He rebelled against his teacher, formed his own rival school, engaged in a passionate
        affair with a teenager, was castrated, and became a monk. All in a day's work.
        Perhaps it's no surprise that Peter Abelard gained the title of "heretic" along the
        way. A 12th-century philosopher and theologian, Abelard tended to alienate nearly
        everyone he met with his extremely arrogant and egotistical personality. This very
        flaw is what led him to start preaching to students that he had stolen from his former
        master, which further deteriorated his reputation. Yet despite all of the senseless
        things that he did, his teachings did not differ much from Christian doctrine.
        Although the church claimed to have branded Abelard a heretic purely because of
        his religious views, the other underlying reasons for these accusations involve his
        conceited personality, his relationship with the 14-year-old Heloise, and the political
        forces of the 12th century.

  From Logan Skelly's "Staphylococcus aureus:3

        Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is causing a crisis in modern healthcare. The
        evolution of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus is of particular concern
        because of the morbidity and mortality it causes, the limited treatment options it
        poses, and the difficulty in implementing containment measures for its control. In
        order to appreciate the virulence of S. aureus and to help alleviate the problems its
        resistance is causing, it is important to study the evolution of antibiotic resistance
        in this pathogen, the mechanisms of its resistance, and the factors that may limit
        or counteract its evolution. It is especially important to examine how human actions
        are causing evolutionary changes in this bacterial species. This review will examine
        the historical sequence of causation that has led to antibiotic resistance in this
        microorganism and why natural selection favors the resistant trait. It is the goal of

        pathogen from evolving further pathogenicity and virulence.

  If vague introductory paragraphs are bad, why were you taught them? In essence
  you were taught the form so that you could later use it to deepen your thinking. By
  producing the five-paragraph theme over and over, it has probably become second
  nature for you to find a clear thesis and shape the intro paragraph around it, tasks
  you absolutely must accomplish in academic writing. However, you've probably
  been taught to proceed from "general" to "specific" in your intro and encouraged
  to think of "general" as "vague". At the college level, think of "general" as context:
  begin by explaining the conceptual, historical, or factual context that the reader
  needs in order to grasp the significance of the argument to come. It's not so much
  a structure of general-to-specific; instead it's context-to-argument.

  My average for writing an intro is three times. As in, it takes me three tries at
  writing one to get it to say exactly what I want it to. The intro, I feel, is the most
  important part of an essay. This is kind of like a road map for the rest of the paper.
  My suggestion is to do the intro first. This way, the paper can be done over a period
  of time rather than running the risk of forgetting what you wanted to say if you stop.

 In conclusion ...

  I confess that I still find conclusions hard to write. By the time I'm finalizing a
  conclusion, I'm often fatigued with the project and struggling to find something
  new to say that isn't a departure into a whole different realm. I also find that I have
  become so immersed in the subject that it seems like anything I have to say is
  absurdly obvious.4 A good conclusion is a real challenge, one that takes persistent
  work and some finesse.

     Strong conclusions do two things: they bring the argument to a satisfying close
  and they explain some of the most important implications. You've probably been
  taught to re-state your thesis using different words, and it is true that your reader

4. A lot of people have that hang-up: "If I thought of it, it can't be much of an insight." It's another good reason to
   get others to read your work. They'll remind you that your points are both original and interesting.
280 | INTROS AND OUTROS

will likely appreciate a brief summary of your overall argument: say, two or three
sentences for papers less than 20 pages. It's perfectly fine to use what they call
"metadiscourse" in this summary; metadiscourse is text like, "I have argued that ..."
or "This analysis reveals that ... ." Go ahead and use language like that if it seems
useful to signal that you're restating the main points of your argument. In shorter
papers you can usually simply reiterate the main point without that metadiscourse:
for example, "What began as a protest about pollution turned into a movement for
civil rights." If that's the crux of the argument, your reader will recognize a summary
like that. Most of the student papers I see close the argument effectively in the
concluding paragraph.

   The second task of a conclusion--situating the argument within broader
implications--is a lot trickier. A lot of instructors describe it as the "So what?"
challenge. You've proven your point about the role of agriculture in deepening the
Great Depression; so what? I don't like the "so what" phrasing because putting
writers on the defensive seems more likely to inhibit the flow of ideas than to draw
them out. Instead, I suggest you imagine a friendly reader thinking, "OK, you've
convinced me of your argument. I'm interested to know what you make of this
conclusion. What is or should be different now that your thesis is proven?" In that
sense, your reader is asking you to take your analysis one step further. That's why a
good conclusion is challenging to write. You're not just coasting over the finish line.

   So, how do you do that? Recall from Chapter 3 that the third story of a three-
story thesis situates an arguable claim within broader implications. If you've already
articulated a thesis statement that does that, then you've already mapped the
terrain of the conclusion. Your task then is to explain the implications you
mentioned: if environmental justice really is the new civil rights movement, then
how should scholars and/or activists approach it? If agricultural trends really did
worsen the Great Depression, what does that mean for agricultural policy today?
If your thesis, as written, is a two-story one, then you may want to revisit it after
you've developed a conclusion you're satisfied with and consider including the
key implication in that thesis statement. Doing so will give your paper even more
momentum.

   Let's look at the concluding counterparts to the excellent introductions that we've
read to illustrate some of the different ways writers can accomplish the two goals of
a conclusion:

Victor Seet on religious embodiment:5

Embodiment is fundamental to bridging reality and spirituality. The concept
demonstrates how religious practice synthesizes human experience in reality--mind,
body, and environment--to embed a cohesive religious experience that can recreate
itself. Although religion is ostensibly focused on an intangible spiritual world, its
traditions that eventually achieve spiritual advancement are grounded in reality.
The texts, symbols, and rituals integral to religious practice go beyond merely
distinguishing one faith from another; they serve to fully absorb individuals in a
culture that sustains common experiential knowledge shared by millions. It is
important to remember that human senses do not merely act as sponges absorbing
external information; our mental models of the world are being constantly refined
with new experiences. This fluid process allows individuals to gradually accumulate
a wealth of religious multimodal information, making the mental representation
hyper-sensitive, which in turn contributes to religious experiences. However, there
is an important caveat. Many features of religious visions that are attributed to
embodiment can also be explained through less complex cognitive mechanisms.
The repetition from religious traditions exercised both physically and mentally,
naturally inculcates a greater religious awareness simply through familiarity.
Religious experiences are therefore not necessarily caused by embedded cues within
the environment but arise from an imbued fluency with religious themes.
Embodiment proposes a connection between body, mind, and the environment that
attempts to explain how spiritual transcendence is achieved through physical reality.
Although embodied cognition assuages the conflict between science and religion,
it remains to be seen if this intricate scientific theory is able to endure throughout
millennia just as religious beliefs have.

The paragraph first re-caps the argument, then explains how embodiment relates
to other aspects of religious experience, and finally situates the analysis within the
broader relationship between religion and science.

   From Davis O'Connell:6

      Looking at Abelard through the modern historical lens, it appears to many historians
      that he did not fit the 12th-century definition of a heretic in the sense that his
      teachings did not differ much from that of the church. Mews observes that Abelard's
      conception of the Trinity was a continuation of what earlier Christian leaders had
      already begun to ponder. He writes: "In identifying the Son and Holy Spirit with
      the wisdom and benignity of God, Abelard was simply extending an idea (based on

5. Seet, "Embodiment in Religion."
6. O'Connell, "Abelard," 40.
   282 | INTROS AND OUTROS

        Augustine) that had previously been raised by William of Champeaux." St. Augustine
        was seen as one of the main Christian authorities during the Middle Ages and
        for Abelard to derive his teachings from that source enhances his credibility. This
        would indicate that although Abelard was not necessarily a heretic by the church's
        official definition, he was branded as one through all of the nontheological social and
        political connotations that "heresy" had come to encompass.

  O'Connell, interestingly, chooses a scholarly tone for the conclusion, in contrast to
  the more jocular tone we saw in the introduction. He doesn't specifically re-cap
  the argument about Abelard's deviance from social norms and political pressures,
  but rather he explains his summative point about what it means to be a heretic.
  In this case, the implications of the argument are all about Abelard. There aren't
  any grand statements about religion and society, the craft of historiography, or the
  politics of language. Still, the reader is not left hanging. One doesn't need to make
  far-reaching statements to successfully conclude a paper.

     From Logan Skelly:7

        Considering the hundreds of millions of years that S. aureus has been evolving and
        adapting to hostile environments, it is likely that the past seventy years of human
        antibiotic usage represents little more than a minor nuisance to these bacteria.
        Antibiotic resistance for humans, however, contributes to worldwide health,
        economic, and environmental problems. Multi-drug resistant S. aureus has proven
        itself to be a versatile and persistent pathogen that will likely continue to evolve as
        long as selective pressures, such as antibiotics, are introduced into the environment.
        While the problems associated with S. aureus have received ample attention in the
        scientific literature, there has been little resolution of the problems this pathogen
        poses. If these problems are to be resolved, it is essential that infection control
        measures and effective treatment strategies be developed, adopted, and
        implemented in the future on a worldwide scale--so that the evolution of this
        pathogen's virulence can be curtailed and its pathogenicity can be controlled.

  Skelly's thesis is about the need to regulate antibiotic usage to mitigate antibiotic
  resistance. The concluding paragraph characterizes the pathogens evolutionary
  history (without re-capping the specifics) and then calls for an informed, well
  planned, and comprehensive response.

     All three conclusions above achieve both tasks--closing the argument and
  addressing the implications--but the authors have placed a different emphasis on
  the two tasks and framed the broader implications in different ways. Writing, like

any craft, challenges the creator to make these kinds of independent choices. There
isn't a standard recipe for a good conclusion.

Form and function

As I've explained, some students mistakenly believe that they should avoid detail
and substance in the introductions and conclusions of academic papers. Having
practiced the five-paragraph form repeatedly, that belief sometimes gets built into
the writing process; students sometimes just throw together those paragraphs
thinking that they don't really count as part of the analysis. Sometimes though,
student writers know that more precise and vivid intros and outros are ideal but still
settle on the vague language that seems familiar, safe, and do-able. Knowing the
general form of academic writing (simplified in the five-paragraph theme) helps
writers organize their thoughts; however, it leads some student writers to approach
papers as mere fill-in-the-blank exercises.

   I hope you will instead envision paper-writing as a task of working through an
unscripted and nuanced thought process and then sharing your work with readers.
When you're engaged with the writing process, you'll find yourself deciding which
substantive points belong in those introductory and concluding paragraphs rather
than simply filling those paragraphs out with fluff. They should be sort of hard
to write; they're the parts of the paper that express your most important ideas in
the most precise ways. If you're struggling with intros and conclusions, it might
be because you're approaching them in exactly the right way. Having a clear,
communicative purpose will help you figure out what your reader needs to know to
really understand your thinking.

SOURCES

Theses and sources

Everyone knows that a thorough analysis and persuasive argument needs strong
evidence. The credibility of sources, addressed in Chapter 4, is one key element
of strong evidence, but it also matters how sources are used in the text of the
paper. Many students are accustomed to thinking of sources simply as expert
corroboration for their own points. As a result, they tend to comb texts to find
statements that closely parallel what they want to say and then incorporate quotes
as evidence that a published author agrees with them. That's one way to use
sources, but there is a lot more to it.

   Recall from prior chapters that writing academic papers is about joining a
conversation. You're contributing your own original thinking to some complex
problem, be it interpretive, theoretical, or practical. Citing sources helps situate your
ideas within that ongoing conversation. Sometimes you're citing a research finding
that provides strong evidence for your point; at other times you're summarizing
someone else's ideas in order to explain how your own opinion differs or to note how
someone else's concept applies to a new situation. Graff and Birkenstein1 encourage
you to think about writing with sources is a "They Say/I Say" process. You first report
what "they" say; "they" being published authors, prevalent ideas in society at large,
or maybe participants in some kind of political or social debate. Then you respond
by explaining what you think: Do you agree? Disagree? A little of both?

   This "They Say/I Say" approach can help student writers find balance in their
use of sources. On one extreme, some students think that they aren't allowed to

1. Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein, They Say/I Say: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing, (New York:
  W.W. Norton & Co, 2009).
   286 | LISTENING TO SOURCES, TALKING TO SOURCES

  make any claims without citing one or more expert authors saying the same thing.
  When their instructors encourage them to bring more original thinking into their
  writing, they're confused about how to do it. On the other extreme, some students
  tend to describe, more or less accurately, what sources say about a topic but then
  go on to state opinions that seem unrelated to the claims they just summarized.
  For example, a student writer may draw on expert sources to explain how the
  prevention and early detection of cancer has saved lives2 but then argue for more
  funding for curing advanced cancer without making any explicit link to the points
  about prevention and screening. On one extreme, the sources are allowed to crowd
  out original thinking; on the other, they have seemingly no impact on the author's
  conclusions.

     How can you know when you're avoiding both of these extremes? In other words,
  what kinds of theses ("I Say") can count as an original claim and still be grounded in
  the sources ("They Say")? Here are five common strategies:

    1. Combine research findings from multiple sources to make a larger summary
        argument. You might find that none of the sources you're working with
        specifically claim that early 20th century British literature was preoccupied
        with changing gender roles but that, together, their findings all point to that
        broader conclusion.

    2. Combine research findings from multiple sources to make a claim about their
        implications. You might review papers that explore various factors shaping
        voting behavior to argue that a particular voting-reform proposal will likely
        have positive impacts.

    3. Identify underlying areas of agreement. You may argue that the literature on
        cancer and the literature on violence both describe the unrecognized
        importance of prevention and early intervention in order to claim that insights
        about one set of problems may be useful for the other.

   4. Identify underlying areas of disagreement. You may find that the
        controversies surrounding educational reform--and its debates about
        accountability, curricula, school funding--ultimately stem from different
        assumptions about the role of schools in society.

    5. Identify unanswered questions. Perhaps you review studies of the genetic and

        behavioral contributors to diabetes in order to highlight unknown factors and
        argue for more in-depth research on the role of the environment.

  There are certainly other ways authors use sources to build theses, but these
  examples illustrate how original thinking in academic writing involves making
  connections with and between a strategically chosen set of sources.

 Incorporating sources

  Here's a passage of academic writing (an excerpt, not a complete paper) that
  illustrates several ways that sources can figure into a "They Say/I Say" approach:3

        Willingham (2011) draws on cognitive science to explain that students must be able
        to regulate their emotions in order to learn. Emotional self-regulation enables
        students to ignore distractions and channel their attention and behaviors in
        appropriate ways. Other research findings confirm that anxiety interferes with
        learning and academic performance because it makes distractions harder to resist
        (Perkins and Graham-Bermann, 2012; Putwain and Best, 2011).
        Other cognitive scientists point out that deep learning is itself stressful because it
        requires people to think hard about complex, unfamiliar material instead of relying
        on cognitive short-cuts.

           Kahneman (2011) describes this difference in terms of two systems for thinking: one
        fast and one slow. Fast thinking is based on assumptions and habits and doesn't
        require a lot of effort. For example, driving a familiar route or a routine grocery-
        shopping trip are not usually intellectually taxing activities. Slow thinking, on the
        other hand, is what we do when we encounter novel problems and situations. It's
        effortful, and it usually feels tedious and confusing. It is emotionally challenging as
        well because we are, by definition, incompetent while we're doing it, which provokes
        some anxiety. Solving a tough problem is rewarding, but the path itself is often
        unpleasant.
        These insights from cognitive science enable us to critically assess the claims made
        on both sides of the education reform debate. On one hand, they cast doubt on the
        claims of education reformers that measuring teachers' performance by student test

   and Natalie Best, "Fear appeals in the primary classroom: Effects on test anxiety and test grade," Learning and

        scores is the best way to improve education. For example, the Center for Education
        Reform promotes "the implementation of strong, data-driven, performance-based
        accountability systems that ensure teachers are rewarded, retained and advanced
        based on how they perform in adding value to the students who they teach,
        measured predominantly by student achievement" (http://www.edreform.com/
        issues/teacher-quality/#what-we-believe). The research that Willingham (2011) and
        Kahneman (2011) describe suggests that frequent high-stakes testing may actually
        work against learning by introducing greater anxiety into the school environment.
        At the same time, opponents of education reform should acknowledge that these
        research findings should prompt us to take a fresh look at how we educate our
        children. While Stan Karp of Rethinking Schools is correct when he argues that
        "data-driven formulas [based on standardized testing] lack both statistical credibility
        and a basic understanding of the human motivations and relationships that make
        good schooling possible" (http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/26_03/
        26_03_karp.shtm), it doesn't necessarily follow that all education reform proposals
        lack merit. Challenging standards, together with specific training in emotional self-
        regulation, will likely enable more students to succeed.4

  In that example, the ideas of Willingham and Kahneman are summarized
  approvingly, bolstered with additional research findings, and then applied to a new
  realm: the current debate surrounding education reform. Voices in that debate
  were portrayed as accurately as possible, sometimes with representative quotes.
  Most importantly, all references were tied directly to the author's own interpretative
  point, which relies on the quoted claims.

  I think the most important lesson for me to learn about sources was that the best
  way to use them is to create a new point. What I mean by this is instead of using
  them only to back up your points, create your own conclusion from what your
  sources say. As a psychology major, I look at a lot of data from researchers who
  have created a conclusion from a meta-analysis (a combination of many studies
  about the same thing). So that's how I like to think of using sources, I will look at
  many articles about the same subject and then come up with my own opinion.
  After using your sources, it is very important to cite them correctly. Personally, I
  want to be a respected and trustworthy scholar. However, if any of my papers were

4. A side note: You may have noticed that the verbs used in referencing tend to be in present tense: so-and-so
   "writes" or "claims" or "argues". That's what academic writers do, even if the piece and author are from far in the
   past. It's called "the historical present" and it's just one convention of academic writing.
                                                                                             LISTENING TO SOURCES, TALKING TO SOURCES | 289

to be found without proper citations, all of my hard work would be for nothing and
people would be wary about the rest of my work.

   Aly Button

As you can see, there are times when you should quote or paraphrase sources that
you don't agree with or do not find particularly compelling. They may convey ideas
and opinions that help explain and justify your own argument. Similarly, when you
cite sources that you agree with, you should choose quotes or paraphrases that
serve as building blocks within your own argument. Regardless of the role each
source plays in your writing, you certainly don't need to find whole sentences or
passages that express your thinking. Rather, focus on what each of those sources is
claiming, why, and how exactly their claims relate to your own points.

   The remainder of this chapter explains some key principles for incorporating
sources, principles which follow from the general point that academic writing is
about entering an ongoing conversation.

Principle 1: Listen to your sources

Have you ever had the maddening experience of arguing with someone who
twisted your words to make it seem like you were saying something you weren't?
Novice writers sometimes inadvertently misrepresent their sources when they
quote very minor points from an article or even positions that the authors of an
article disagree with. It often happens when students approach their sources with
the goal of finding snippets that align with their own opinion. For example, the
passage above contains the phrase "measuring teachers' performance by student
test scores is the best way to improve education." An inexperienced writer might
include that quote in a paper without making it clear that the author(s) of the
source actually dispute that very claim. Doing so is not intentionally fraudulent, but
it reveals that the paper-writer isn't really thinking about and responding to claims
and arguments made by others. In that way, it harms his or her credibility.

   Academic journal articles are especially likely to be misrepresented by student
writers because their literature review sections often summarize a number of
contrasting viewpoints. For example, sociologists Jennifer C. Lee and Jeremy Staff
wrote a paper in which they note that high-schoolers who spend more hours at a
   290 | LISTENING TO SOURCES, TALKING TO SOURCES

  job are more likely to drop out of school.5 However, Lee and Staff's analysis finds
  that working more hours doesn't actually make a student more likely to drop out.
  Instead, the students who express less interest in school are both more likely to
  work a lot of hours and more likely to drop out. In short, Lee and Staff argue
  that disaffection with school causes students to drop-out, not working at a job. In
  reviewing prior research about the impact of work on dropping out, Lee and Staff
  write "Paid work, especially when it is considered intensive, reduces grade point
  averages, time spent on homework, educational aspirations, and the likelihood of
  completing high school."6 If you included that quote without explaining how it fits
  into Lee and Staff's actual argument, you would be misrepresenting that source.

 Principle 2: Provide context

  Another error beginners often make is to drop in a quote without any context. If you
  simply quote, "Students begin preschool with a set of self-regulation skills that are
  a product of their genetic inheritance and their family environment" (Willingham,
  2011, p.24), your reader is left wondering who Willingham is, why he or she is
  included here, and where this statement fits into his or her larger work. The whole
  point of incorporating sources is to situate your own insights in the conversation.
  As part of that, you should provide some kind of context the first time you use that
  source. Some examples:

        Willingham, a cognitive scientist, claims that ...

        Research in cognitive science has found that ... (Willingham, 2011).

        Willingham argues that "Students begin preschool with a set of self-regulation skills
        that are a product of their genetic inheritance and their family environment"
        (Willingham, 2011, p.24). Drawing on findings in cognitive science, he explains "..."

  As the second example above shows, providing a context doesn't mean writing a
  brief biography of every author in your bibliography--it just means including some
  signal about why that source is included in your text.

   Drop Out," Sociology of Education 80, no. 2 (2007): 158-178.

   Even more baffling to your reader is when quoted material does not fit into the
flow of the text. For example, a novice student might write,

      Schools and parents shouldn't set limits on how much teenagers are allowed to work
      at jobs. "We conclude that intensive work does not affect the likelihood of high school
      dropout among youths who have a high propensity to spend long hours on the job"
      (Lee and Staff, 2007, p. 171). Teens should be trusted to learn how to manage their
      time.

The reader is thinking, who is this sudden, ghostly "we"? Why should this source be
believed? If you find that passages with quotes in your draft are awkward to read
out loud, that's a sign that you need to contextualize the quote more effectively.
Here's a version that puts the quote in context:

      Schools and parents shouldn't set limits on how much teenagers are allowed to work
      at jobs. Lee and Staff's carefully designed study found that "intensive work does
      not affect the likelihood of high school dropout among youths who have a high
      propensity to spend long hours on the job" (2007, p. 171). Teens should be trusted to
      learn how to manage their time.

In this latter example, it's now clear that Lee and Staff are scholars and that their
empirical study is being used as evidence for this argumentative point. Using a
source in this way invites the reader to check out Lee and Staff's work for
themselves if they doubt this claim.

   Many writing instructors encourage their students to contextualize their use of
sources by making a "quotation sandwich"; that is, introduce the quote in some way
and then follow it up with your own words. If you've made a bad habit of dropping
in unintroduced quotes, the quotation sandwich idea may help you improve your
skills, but in general you don't need to approach every quote or paraphrase as a
three-part structure to have well integrated sources. You should, however, avoid
ending a paragraph with a quotation. If you're struggling to figure out what to write
after a quote or close paraphrase, it may be that you haven't yet figured out what
role the quote is playing in your own analysis. If that happens to you a lot, try writing
the whole first draft in your own words and then incorporate material from sources
as you revise with "They Say/I Say" in mind.

Principle 3: Use sources efficiently

Some student writers are in a rut of only quoting whole sentences. Some others,
like myself as a student, get overly enamored of extended block quotes and the
   292 | LISTENING TO SOURCES, TALKING TO SOURCES

  scholarly look they give to the page.7 These aren't the worst sins of academic
  writing, but they get in the way of one of the key principles of writing with sources:
  shaping quotes and paraphrases efficiently. Efficiency follows from the second
  principle, because when you fully incorporate sources into your own explicit
  argument, you zero in on the phrases, passages, and ideas that are relevant to
  your points. It's a very good sign for your paper when most quotes are short (key
  terms, phrases, or parts of sentences) and the longer quotes (whole sentences and
  passages) are clearly justified by the discussion in which they're embedded. Every
  bit of every quote should feel indispensable to the paper. An overabundance of
  long quotes usually means that your own argument is undeveloped. The most
  incandescent quotes will not hide that fact from your professor.

     Also, some student writers forget that quoting is not the only way to incorporate
  sources. Paraphasing and summarizing are sophisticated skills that are often more
  appropriate to use than direct quoting. The first two paragraphs of the example
  passage above do not include any quotations, even though they are both clearly
  focused on presenting the work of others. Student writers may avoid paraphrasing
  out of fear of plagiarizing, and it's true that a poorly executed paraphrase will make
  it seem like the student writer is fraudulently claiming the wordsmithing work of
  others as his or her own. Sticking to direct quotes seems safer. However, it is worth
  your time to master paraphasing because it often helps you be more clear and
  concise, drawing out only those elements that are relevant to the thread of your
  analysis.

     For example, here's a passage from a hypothetical paper with a block quote that
  is fully relevant to the argument but, nevertheless, inefficient:

        Drawing on a lifetime of research, Kahneman concludes our brains are prone to
        error:8

  System 1 registers the cognitive ease with which it processes information, but it
  does not generate a warning signal when it becomes unreliable. Intuitive answers
  come to mind quickly and confidently, whether they originate from skills or from
  heuristics. There is no simple way for System 2 to distinguish between a skilled and

7. It took me a long time to stop abusing block quotes. They made me feel like my paper was an unassailable
   fortress of citation! With the friendly but pointed feedback of my professors, I gradually came to see how they
   took too much space away from my own argument.

8. Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow, 416-7.
                                                                                                LISTENING TO SOURCES, TALKING TO SOURCES | 293

  a heuristic response. Its only recourse is to slow down and attempt to construct
  an answer on its own, which it is reluctant to do because it is indolent. Many
  suggestions of System 1 are casually endorsed with minimal checking, as in the bat-
  and-ball problem.

        While people can get better at recognizing and avoiding these errors, Kahneman
        suggests, the more robust solutions involve developing procedures within
        organizations to promote careful, effortful thinking in making important decisions
        and judgments.

  Even a passage that is important to reference and is well contextualized in the
  flow of the paper will be inefficient if it introduces terms and ideas that aren't
  central to the analysis within the paper. Imagine, for example, that other parts of
  this hypothetical paper use Kahneman's other terms for System 1 (fast thinking) and
  System 2 (slow thinking); the sudden encounter of "System 1" and "System 2" would
  be confusing and tedious for your reader. Similarly, the terms "heuristics" and "bat-
  and-ball problem" might be unfamiliar to your reader. Their presence in the block
  quote just muddies the waters. In this case, a paraphrase is a much better choice.
  Here's an example passage that uses a paraphrase to establish the same points
  more clearly and efficiently:

        Drawing on a lifetime of research, Kahneman summarizes that our brains are prone
        to error because they necessarily rely on cognitive shortcuts that may or may not
        yield valid judgments.9 We have the capacity to stop and examine our assumptions,
        Kahneman points out, but we often want to avoid that hard work. As a result, we tend
        to accept our quick, intuitive responses. While people can get better at recognizing
        and avoiding these errors, Kahneman suggests that the more robust solutions
        involve developing procedures within organizations to promote careful, effortful
        thinking in making important decisions and judgments.

  Not only is the paraphrased version shorter (97 words versus 151), it is clearer and
  more efficient because it highlights the key ideas, avoiding specific terms and
  examples that aren't used in the rest of the paper. If other parts of your paper did
  refer to Kahneman's System 1 and System 2, then you might choose to include
  some quoted phrases to make use of some of Kahneman's great language. Perhaps
  something like this:

9. Ibid.
    294 | LISTENING TO SOURCES, TALKING TO SOURCES

         Drawing on a lifetime of research, Kahneman summarizes that our brains are prone
         to error because they necessarily rely on cognitive shortcuts that may or may not
         yield valid judgments.10 System 1, Kahneman explains, "does not generate a warning
         signal when it becomes unreliable."11 System 2 can stop and examine these
         assumptions, but it usually wants to avoid that hard work. As a result, our quick,
         intuitive responses are "casually endorsed with minimal checking."12 While people
         can get better at recognizing and avoiding these errors, Kahneman suggests, the
         more robust solutions involve developing procedures within organizations to
         promote careful, effortful thinking in making important decisions and judgments.

   Whether you choose a long quote, short quote, paraphrase or summary depends
   on the role that the source in playing in your analysis. The trick is to make deliberate,
   thoughtful decisions about how to incorporate ideas and words from others.

      Paraphrasing, summarizing, and the mechanical conventions of quoting take a
   lot of practice to master. Numerous other resources (like those listed at the end of
   this chapter) explain these practices clearly and succinctly. Bookmark some good
   sources and refer to them as needed. If you suspect that you're in a quoting rut, try
   out some new ways of incorporating sources.

  Principle 4: Choose precise verbs of attribution

   It's time to get beyond the all-purpose "says." And please don't look up "says" in
   the thesaurus and substitute verbs like "proclaim" (unless there was actually a
   proclamation) or "pronounce" (unless there was actually a pronouncement). Here's
   a list of 15 useful alternatives:13

      · Claims
      · Asserts
      · Relates
      · Recounts
      · Complains

10. Ibid.

11. Ibid, 416.

12. Ibid, 417.

13. Google "verbs of attribution" to find other suggestions.
                                                                                             LISTENING TO SOURCES, TALKING TO SOURCES | 295

   · Reasons
   · Proposes
   · Suggests (if the author is speculating or hypothesizing)
   · Contests (disagrees)
   · Concludes
   · Shows
   · Argues
   · Explains
   · Indicates
   · Points out
   · Offers

More precise choices like these carry a lot more information than "says", enabling
you to relate more with fewer words. For one thing, they can quickly convey what
kind of idea you're citing: a speculative one ("postulates")? A conclusive one
("determines")? A controversial one ("counters")? You can further show how you're
incorporating these sources into your own narrative. For example, if you write that
an author "claims" something, you're presenting yourself as fairly neutral about that
claim. If you instead write that the author "shows" something, then you signal to
your reader that you find that evidence more convincing. "Suggests" on the other
hand is a much weaker endorsement. As I'll discuss in Chapter 8, saying more with
less makes your writing much more engaging.

Sources are your best friend. They either help you reaffirm your thesis or offer
a differing opinion that you can challenge in your paper. The biggest thing to
worry about, when it comes to sources, is citing. However, there are a multitude of
resources to help you cite properly. My personal favorite is called Knightcite.com.
You just pick the type of resource, fill in the information on it and voila, you have a
perfectly cited resource!

Conclusion

Like so many things in adult life, writing in college is often both more liberating
and burdensome than writing in high school and before. On the one hand, I've
had students tell me that their high-school experiences made it seem that their
own opinions didn't matter in academic writing, and that they can't make any
296 | LISTENING TO SOURCES, TALKING TO SOURCES

claims that aren't exactly paralleled by a pedigreed quotation. Writing papers based
on their own insights and opinions can seem freeing in contrast. At the same
time, a college student attending full time may be expected to have original and
well considered ideas about pre-Columbian Latin American history, congressional
redistricting, sports in society, post-colonial literatures, and nano-technology, all in
about two weeks. Under these conditions, it's easy to see why some would long for
the days when simple, competent reporting did the job. You probably won't have
an authentic intellectual engagement with every college writing assignment, but
approaching your written work as an opportunity to dialogue with the material can
help you find the momentum you need to succeed with this work.

        1. Graff and Birkenstein's little book, They Say/I Say: The Moves that Matter in Academic
             Writing 2nd ed. (New York: Norton, 2009) is a gem and well worth reading. They offer a
             series of templates that can help you visualize new ways of relating to sources and
             constructing arguments.

        2. Another excellent resource is Gordon Harvey's Writing with Sources: A Guide for Students
             2nd ed. (Indianapolis: Hackett, 2008), In it, he discusses the key principles for
             incorporating sources, the stylistic conventions for quoting and paraphrasing, and the
             basics of common citation styles. That's all information you want to have at the ready.

        3. Many university writing centers have nicely concise on-line guides to summarizing,
             paraphrasing, and quoting. I found some especially good ones at the University of
             Wisconsin, the University of Washington, and, as always, the Purdue Online Writing
             Laboratory.

Exercises

1. Here is a passage from a world history textbook:14

      Like so many things desired by Europeans and supplied by Asians--at first luxury
      items for the elite such as silk or porcelain, but increasingly products like tea from
      China for the mass market--cotton textiles were produced well and cheaply in India.
      The British textile manufacturers focused on the "cheap" part and complained that
      with relatively higher wages, British manufacturers could not compete. India had a
      competitive advantage in the eighteenth century, being able to undersell in the world
      market virtually any other producer of textiles. Some thought the reason for cheap
      Indian textiles was because of a low living standard, or a large population earning
      depressed wages, but all of those have been shown to not be true: Indian textile
      workers in the eighteenth century had just as high a standard of living as British
      workers. So, if it was not a low standard of living that gave India its competitive advance,
      what did?
      In a word: agriculture. Indian agriculture was so productive that the amount of food
      produced, and hence its cost, was significantly lower than in Europe. In the
      preindustrial age, when working families spent 60-80 percent of their earnings on food,
      the cost of food was the primary determinant of their real wages (i.e. how much a
      pound, dollar, a real, or a pagoda could buy). In India (and China and Japan as well),
      the amount of grain harvested from a given amount of seed was in the ration of 20:1
      (e.g., twenty bushels of rice harvested for every one planted), whereas in England it
      was at best 8:1. Asian agriculture thus was more than twice as efficient as British (and
      by extension European) agriculture, and food--the major component in the cost of
      living--cost less in Asia.

Drawing on this passage, try out different quoting, paraphrasing and summarizing options:

a. Quote a key phrase or part of a sentence, naming the source and incorporating the quote
within your own logic.

b. Quote an entire sentence or two, providing context and incorporating the quote within your
own logic.

c. Construct an unacceptable paraphrase of part of the passage; copying a couple sentences
and change just a few of the key words.

d. Construct a successful paraphrase of part of the passage; describing it in your own words.

NARRATIVE ESSAY EXAMPLES

Andrew Stracuzzi and André Cormier

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
   1. Read an example of the narrative rhetorical mode.

My College Education

The first class I went to in college was philosophy, and it changed my life forever. Our first
assignment was to write a short response paper to the Albert Camus essay "The Myth of
Sisyphus." I was extremely nervous about the assignment as well as college. However, through
all the confusion in philosophy class, many of my questions about life were answered.

I entered college intending to earn a degree in engineering. I always liked the way mathematics
had right and wrong answers. I understood the logic and was very good at it. So when I received
my first philosophy assignment that asked me to write my interpretation of the Camus essay, I
was instantly confused. What is the right way to do this assignment, I wondered? I was nervous
about writing an incorrect interpretation and did not want to get my first assignment wrong.
Even more troubling was that the professor refused to give us any guidelines on what he was
looking for; he gave us total freedom. He simply said, "I want to see what you come up with."

Full of anxiety, I first set out to read Camus's essay several times to make sure I really knew what
was it was about. I did my best to take careful notes. Yet even after I took all these notes and
knew the essay inside and out, I still did not know the right answer. What was my interpretation?
I could think of a million different ways to interpret the essay, but which one was my professor
looking for? In math class, I was used to examples and explanations of solutions. This
assignment gave me nothing; I was completely on my own to come up with my individual
interpretation.
300 | NARRATIVE ESSAY EXAMPLES

     Next, when I sat down to write, the words just did not come to me. My notes and ideas were all
     present, but the words were lost. I decided to try every prewriting strategy I could find. I
     brainstormed, made idea maps, and even wrote an outline. Eventually, after a lot of stress, my
     ideas became more organized and the words fell on the page. I had my interpretation of "The
     Myth of Sisyphus," and I had my main reasons for interpreting the essay. I remember being
     unsure of myself, wondering if what I was saying made sense, or if I was even on the right track.
     Through all the uncertainty, I continued writing the best I could. I finished the conclusion
     paragraph, had my spouse proofread it for errors, and turned it in the next day simply hoping for
     the best.
     Then, a week or two later, came judgment day. The professor gave our papers back to us with
     grades and comments. I remember feeling simultaneously afraid and eager to get the paper
     back in my hands. It turned out, however, that I had nothing to worry about. The professor gave
     me an A on the paper, and his notes suggested that I wrote an effective essay overall. He wrote
     that my reading of the essay was very original and that my thoughts were well organized. My
     relief and newfound confidence upon reading his comments could not be overstated.
     What I learned through this process extended well beyond how to write a college paper. I learned
     to be open to new challenges. I never expected to enjoy a philosophy class and always expected
     to be a math and science person. This class and assignment, however, gave me the self-
     confidence, critical-thinking skills, and courage to try a new career path. I left engineering and
     went on to study law and eventually became a lawyer. More important, that class and paper
     helped me understand education differently. Instead of seeing college as a direct stepping stone
     to a career, I learned to see college as a place to first learn and then seek a career or enhance an
     existing career. By giving me the space to express my own interpretation and to argue for my
     own values, my philosophy class taught me the importance of education for education's sake.
     That realization continues to pay dividends every day.

OUTLINING

   Andrew Stracuzzi and André Cormier

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
        1. Identify the steps in constructing an outline.
        2. Construct a topic outline and a sentence outline.

Your prewriting activities and readings have helped you gather information for your
assignment. The more you sort through the pieces of information you found, the
more you will begin to see the connections between them. Patterns and gaps may
begin to stand out. But only when you start to organize your ideas will you be able
to translate your raw insights into a form that will communicate meaning to your
audience.

               TIP

     Longer papers require more reading and planning than shorter papers do. Most writers discover
                                                                                                                                               OUTLINING | 303

     that the more they know about a topic, the more they can write about it with intelligence and
     interest.

Organizing Ideas

When you write, you need to organize your ideas in an order that makes sense.
The writing you complete in all your courses exposes how analytically and critically
your mind works. In some courses, the only direct contact you may have with your
instructor is through the assignments you write for the course. You can make a
good impression by spending time ordering your ideas.

   Order refers to your choice of what to present first, second, third, and so on in
your writing. The order you pick closely relates to your purpose for writing that
particular assignment. For example, when telling a story, it may be important to
first describe the background for the action. Or you may need to first describe a 3-D
movie projector or a television studio to help readers visualize the setting and scene.
You may want to group your support effectively to convince readers that your point
of view on an issue is well reasoned and worthy of belief.

   In longer pieces of writing, you may organize different parts in different ways so
that your purpose stands out clearly and all parts of the paper work together to
consistently develop your main point.

Methods of Organizing Writing

The three common methods of organizing writing are chronological order, spatial
order, and order of importance. An outline is a written plan that serves as a skeleton
for the paragraphs you write. Later, when you draft paragraphs in the next stage
of the writing process, you will add support to create "flesh" and "muscle" for your
assignment.

   When you write, your goal is not only to complete an assignment but also to
write for a specific purpose--perhaps to inform, to explain, to persuade, or for a
combination of these purposes. Your purpose for writing should always be in the
back of your mind, because it will help you decide which pieces of information
belong together and how you will order them. In other words, choose the order that
will most effectively fit your purpose and support your main point.
304 | OUTLINING

   The table below shows the connection between order and purpose.

ORDER VERSUS PURPOSE

Order          Purpose
               To explain the history of an event or a topic
Chronological  To tell a story or relate an experience
Order          To explain how to do or make something
               To explain the steps in a process
Spatial Order  To help readers visualize something as you want them to see it
               To create a main impression using the senses (sight, touch, taste, smell,
Order of       and sound)
Importance     To persuade or convince
               To rank items by their importance, benefit, or significance

Writing a Thesis Statement

One legitimate question readers always ask about a piece of writing is "What is
the big idea?" (You may even ask this question when you are the reader, critically
reading an assignment or another document.) Every nonfiction writing task--from
the short essay to the ten-page term paper to the lengthy senior thesis--needs a
big idea, or a controlling idea, as the spine for the work. The controlling idea is the
main idea that you want to present and develop.
                                                                                                                                               OUTLINING | 305

  TIP

     For a longer piece of writing, the main idea should be broader than the main idea for a shorter
     piece of writing. Be sure to frame a main idea that is appropriate for the length of the
     assignment. Ask yourself, "How many pages will it take for me to explain and explore this main
     idea in detail?" Be reasonable with your estimate. Then expand or trim it to fit the required
     length.

The big idea, or controlling idea, you want to present in an essay is expressed in a
thesis statement. A thesis statement is often one sentence long, and it states your
point of view. The thesis statement is not the topic of the piece of writing but rather
what you have to say about that topic and what is important to tell readers.

The first thesis statement you write will be a preliminary thesis statement, or a
working thesis statement. You will need it when you begin to outline your
assignment as a way to organize it. As you continue to develop the arrangement,
you can limit your working thesis statement if it is too broad or expand it if it proves
too narrow for what you want to say.

EXERCISE 1

Using a topic you have used for previous exercises, develop a working thesis statement that
states your controlling idea for the piece of writing you are doing. On a sheet of paper, write your
working thesis statement.
                                                                                                                                               OUTLINING | 307

  TIP

     You will make several attempts before you devise a working thesis statement that you think is
     effective. Each draft of the thesis statement will bring you closer to the wording that expresses
     your meaning exactly.

Writing an Outline

For an essay question on a test or a brief oral presentation in class, all you may need
to prepare is a short, informal outline in which you jot down key ideas in the order
you will present them. This kind of outline reminds you to stay focused in a stressful
situation and to include all the good ideas that help you explain or prove your point.

   For a longer assignment, like an essay or a research paper, many college
instructors require students to submit a formal outline before writing a major
paper as a way to be sure you are on the right track and are working in an organized
manner. A formal outline is a detailed guide that shows how all your supporting
ideas relate to each other. It helps you distinguish between ideas that are of equal
importance and ones that are of lesser importance. You build your paper based on
the framework created by the outline.
308 | OUTLINING

  TIP

     Instructors may also require you to submit an outline with your final draft to check the direction
     of the assignment and the logic of your final draft. If you are required to submit an outline with
     the final draft of a paper, remember to revise the outline to reflect any changes you made while
     writing the paper.

There are two types of formal outlines: the topic outline and the sentence outline.
You format both types of formal outlines in the same way.

   · Place your introduction and thesis statement at the beginning, under roman
      numeral I.

   · Use roman numerals (II, III, IV, V, etc.) to identify main points that develop the
      thesis statement.

   · Use capital letters (A, B, C, D, etc.) to divide your main points into parts.
   · Use arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) if you need to subdivide any As, Bs, or Cs

      into smaller parts.
   · End with the final roman numeral expressing your idea for your conclusion.
                                                                                                                                               OUTLINING | 309

Here is what the skeleton of a traditional formal outline looks like. The indention
helps clarify how the ideas are related.

           1. Introduction
                   1. Thesis statement

           2. Main point 1  becomes the topic sentence of body paragraph 1
                   1. Supporting detail  becomes a support sentence of body paragraph 1
                   2. Supporting detail
                   3. Supporting detail

           3. Main point 2  becomes the topic sentence of body paragraph 2
                   1. Supporting detail
                   2. Supporting detail
                   3. Supporting detail

           4. Main point 3  becomes the topic sentence of body paragraph 3
                   1. Supporting detail
                   2. Supporting detail
                   3. Supporting detail

           5. Conclusion
310 | OUTLINING

  TIP

     In an outline, any supporting detail can be developed with subpoints. For simplicity, the model
     shows them only under the first main point.
                                                                                                                                               OUTLINING | 311

  TIP

     Formal outlines are often quite rigid in their organization. As many instructors will specify, you
     cannot subdivide one point if it is only one part. For example, for every roman numeral I, there
     must be a For every A, there must be a B. For every arabic numeral 1, there must be a 2. See for
     yourself on the sample outlines that follow.

Constructing Topic Outlines

A topic outline is the same as a sentence outline except you use words or phrases
instead of complete sentences. Words and phrases keep the outline short and
easier to comprehend. All the headings, however, must be written in parallel
structure.

   Here is the topic outline that Mariah constructed for the essay she is developing.
Her purpose is to inform, and her audience is a general audience of her fellow
college students. Notice how Mariah begins with her thesis statement. She then
arranges her main points and supporting details in outline form using short phrases
in parallel grammatical structure.

  CHECKLIST

     Writing an Effective Topic Outline
     This checklist can help you write an effective topic outline for your assignment. It will also help
     you discover where you may need to do additional reading or prewriting.

          · Do I have a controlling idea that guides the development of the entire piece of writing?
                                                                                                                                         OUTLINING | 313

     · Do I have three or more main points that I want to make in this piece of writing? Does
        each main point connect to my controlling idea?

     · Is my outline in the best order--chronological order, spatial order, or order of
        importance--for me to present my main points? Will this order help me get my main point
        across?

     · Do I have supporting details that will help me inform, explain, or prove my main points?
     · Do I need to add more support? If so, where?
     · Do I need to make any adjustments in my working thesis statement before I consider it

        the final version?

Word processing programs generally have an automatic numbering feature that can be used to
prepare outlines. This feature automatically sets indents and lets you use the tab key to arrange
information just as you would in an outline. Although in business this style might be acceptable,
in college your instructor might have different requirements. Teach yourself how to customize
the levels of outline numbering in your word-processing program to fit your instructor's
preferences.
314 | OUTLINING

    EXERCISE 2

     Using the working thesis statement you wrote and the reading you did in the previous exercises,
     construct a topic outline for your essay. Be sure to observe the correct outline form, including
     correct indentions and the use of Roman and arabic numerals and capital letters.
     Collaboration
     Please share with a classmate and compare your outline. Point out areas of interest from their
     outline and what you would like to learn more about.

Constructing Sentence Outlines

A sentence outline is the same as a topic outline except you use complete
sentences instead of words or phrases. Complete sentences create clarity and can
advance you one step closer to a draft in the writing process.

   Here is the sentence outline that Mariah constructed for the essay she is
developing.
OUTLINING | 315
316 | OUTLINING

  TIP

     The information compiled under each roman numeral will become a paragraph in your final
     paper. In the previous example, the outline follows the standard five-paragraph essay
     arrangement, but longer essays will require more paragraphs and thus more roman numerals. If
     you think that a paragraph might become too long or stringy, add an additional paragraph to your
     outline, renumbering the main points appropriately.
                                                                                                                                         OUTLINING | 317

PowerPoint presentations, used both in schools and in the workplace, are organized in a way
very similar to formal outlines. PowerPoint presentations often contain information in the form
of talking points that the presenter develops with more details and examples than are contained
on the PowerPoint slide.

EXERCISE 3
Expand the topic outline you prepared in the previous exercise to make it a sentence outline. In
this outline, be sure to include multiple supporting points for your main topic even if your topic
outline does not contain them. Be sure to observe the correct outline form, including correct
indentions and the use of Roman and arabic numerals and capital letters.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
     · Writers must put their ideas in order so the assignment makes sense. The most common
        orders are chronological order, spatial order, and order of importance.
318 | OUTLINING

          · After gathering and evaluating the information you found for your essay, the next step is
             to write a working, or preliminary, thesis statement.

          · The working thesis statement expresses the main idea that you want to develop in the
             entire piece of writing. It can be modified as you continue the writing process.

          · Effective writers prepare a formal outline to organize their main ideas and supporting
             details in the order they will be presented.

          · A topic outline uses words and phrases to express the ideas.
          · A sentence outline uses complete sentences to express the ideas.
          · The writer's thesis statement begins the outline, and the outline ends with suggestions for

             the concluding paragraph.

PERSUASIVE ESSAY EXAMPLES

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
   1. Read an example of the persuasive rhetorical mode.

Universal Health Care Coverage for the United States

The United States is the only modernized Western nation that does not offer publicly funded
health care to all its citizens; the costs of health care for the uninsured in the United States are
prohibitive, and the practices of insurance companies are often more interested in profit margins
than providing health care. These conditions are incompatible with US ideals and standards, and
it is time for the US government to provide universal health care coverage for all its citizens. Like
education, health care should be considered a fundamental right of all US citizens, not simply a
privilege for the upper and middle classes.

One of the most common arguments against providing universal health care coverage (UHC) is
that it will cost too much money. In other words, UHC would raise taxes too much. While
providing health care for all US citizens would cost a lot of money for every tax-paying citizen,
citizens need to examine exactly how much money it would cost, and more important, how
much money is "too much" when it comes to opening up health care for all. Those who have
health insurance already pay too much money, and those without coverage are charged
unfathomable amounts. The cost of publicly funded health care versus the cost of current
insurance premiums is unclear. In fact, some Americans, especially those in lower income
brackets, could stand to pay less than their current premiums.

However, even if UHC would cost Americans a bit more money each year, we ought to reflect on
what type of country we would like to live in, and what types of morals we represent if we are
320 | PERSUASIVE ESSAY EXAMPLES

     more willing to deny health care to others on the basis of saving a couple hundred dollars per
     year. In a system that privileges capitalism and rugged individualism, little room remains for
     compassion and love. It is time that Americans realize the amorality of US hospitals forced to
     turn away the sick and poor. UHC is a health care system that aligns more closely with the core
     values that so many Americans espouse and respect, and it is time to realize its potential.

     Another common argument against UHC in the United States is that other comparable national
     health care systems, like that of England, France, or Canada, are bankrupt or rife with problems.
     UHC opponents claim that sick patients in these countries often wait in long lines or long wait
     lists for basic health care. Opponents also commonly accuse these systems of being unable to
     pay for themselves, racking up huge deficits year after year. A fair amount of truth lies in these
     claims, but Americans must remember to put those problems in context with the problems of
     the current US system as well. It is true that people often wait to see a doctor in countries with
     UHC, but we in the United States wait as well, and we often schedule appointments weeks in
     advance, only to have onerous waits in the doctor's "waiting rooms."

     Critical and urgent care abroad is always treated urgently, much the same as it is treated in the
     United States. The main difference there, however, is cost. Even health insurance policy holders
     are not safe from the costs of health care in the United States. Each day an American acquires a
     form of cancer, and the only effective treatment might be considered "experimental" by an
     insurance company and thus is not covered. Without medical coverage, the patient must pay for
     the treatment out of pocket. But these costs may be so prohibitive that the patient will either opt
     for a less effective, but covered, treatment; opt for no treatment at all; or attempt to pay the
     costs of treatment and experience unimaginable financial consequences. Medical bills in these
     cases can easily rise into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is enough to force even
     wealthy families out of their homes and into perpetual debt. Even though each American could
     someday face this unfortunate situation, many still choose to take the financial risk. Instead of
     gambling with health and financial welfare, US citizens should press their representatives to set
     up UHC, where their coverage will be guaranteed and affordable.

     Despite the opponents' claims against UHC, a universal system will save lives and encourage
     the health of all Americans. Why has public education been so easily accepted, but not public
     health care? It is time for Americans to start thinking socially about health in the same ways
     they think about education and police services: as rights of US citizens.

PREWRITING MODELS

   Andrew Stracuzzi and André Cormier

    LEARNING OBJECTIVE

        1. Use prewriting strategies to choose a topic and narrow the focus.

If you think that a blank sheet of paper or a blinking cursor on the computer screen
is a scary sight, you are not alone. Many writers, students, and employees find that
beginning to write can be intimidating. When faced with a blank page, however,
experienced writers remind themselves that writing, like other everyday activities, is
a process. Every process, from writing to cooking, bike riding, and learning to use a
new cell phone, will get significantly easier with practice.

   Just as you need a recipe, ingredients, and proper tools to cook a delicious meal,
you also need a plan, resources, and adequate time to create a good written
composition. In other words, writing is a process that requires following steps and
using strategies to accomplish your goals.

     These are the five steps in the writing process:
        1. Prewriting
        2. Outlining the structure of ideas
        3. Writing a rough draft
        4. Revising
        5. Editing

Effective writing can be simply described as good ideas that are expressed well
                                                                                                                                PREWRITING MODELS | 323

and arranged in the proper order. This chapter will give you the chance to work on
all these important aspects of writing. Although many more prewriting strategies
exist, this chapter covers six: using experience and observations, freewriting, asking
questions, brainstorming, mapping, and searching the Internet. Using the
strategies in this chapter can help you overcome the fear of the blank page and
confidently begin the writing process.

Prewriting

Prewriting is the stage of the writing process during which you transfer your
abstract thoughts into more concrete ideas in ink on paper (or in type on a
computer screen). Although prewriting techniques can be helpful in all stages
of the writing process, the following four strategies are best used when initially
deciding on a topic:

  1. Using experience and observations
 2. Reading
 3. Freewriting
 4. Asking questions

At this stage in the writing process, it is OK if you choose a general topic. Later you
will learn more prewriting strategies that will narrow the focus of the topic.

Choosing a Topic

In addition to understanding that writing is a process, writers also understand that
choosing a good general topic for an assignment is an essential step. Sometimes
your instructor will give you an idea to begin an assignment, and other times
your instructor will ask you to come up with a topic on your own. A good topic
not only covers what an assignment will be about but also fits the
assignment's purpose and its audience.

   In this chapter, you will follow a writer named Mariah as she prepares a piece of
writing. You will also be planning one of your own. The first important step is for you
to tell yourself why you are writing (to inform, to explain, or some other purpose)
and for whom you are writing. Write your purpose and your audience on your own
324 | PREWRITING MODELS

sheet of paper, and keep the paper close by as you read and complete exercises in
this chapter.

   My purpose: ____________________________________________
   My audience: ___________________________________________

Using Experience and Observations

When selecting a topic, you may also want to consider something that interests
you or something based on your own life and personal experiences. Even everyday
observations can lead to interesting topics. After writers think about their
experiences and observations, they often take notes on paper to better develop
their thoughts. These notes help writers discover what they have to say about their
topic.

  TIP

     Have you seen an attention-grabbing story on your local news channel? Many current issues
     appear on television, in magazines, and on the Internet. These can all provide inspiration for your
     writing.
         PREWRITING MODELS | 325

Reading

Reading plays a vital role in all the stages of the writing process, but it first figures
in the development of ideas and topics. Different kinds of documents can help you
choose a topic and also develop that topic. For example, a magazine advertising
the latest research on the threat of global warming may catch your eye in the
supermarket. This cover may interest you, and you may consider global warming as
a topic. Or maybe a novel's courtroom drama sparks your curiosity of a particular
lawsuit or legal controversy.

   After you choose a topic, critical reading is essential to the development of a
topic. While reading almost any document, you evaluate the author's point of view
by thinking about his main idea and his support. When you judge the author's
argument, you discover more about not only the author's opinion but also your own.
If this step already seems daunting, remember that even the best writers need to
use prewriting strategies to generate ideas.

  TIP

     The steps in the writing process may seem time consuming at first, but following these steps
     will save you time in the future. The more you plan in the beginning by reading and using
     prewriting strategies, the less time you may spend writing and editing later because your ideas
     will develop more swiftly.

Prewriting strategies depend on your critical reading skills. Reading prewriting
exercises (and outlines and drafts later in the writing process) will further develop
your topic and ideas. As you continue to follow the writing process, you will see how
Mariah uses critical reading skills to assess her own prewriting exercises.
326 | PREWRITING MODELS

Freewriting

Freewriting is an exercise in which you write freely about any topic for a set amount
of time (usually three to five minutes). During the time limit, you may jot down
any thoughts that come to your mind. Try not to worry about grammar, spelling, or
punctuation. Instead, write as quickly as you can without stopping. If you get stuck,
just copy the same word or phrase over and over until you come up with a new
thought.

   Writing often comes easier when you have a personal connection with the topic
you have chosen. Remember, to generate ideas in your freewriting, you may also
think about readings that you have enjoyed or that have challenged your thinking.
Doing this may lead your thoughts in interesting directions.

   Quickly recording your thoughts on paper will help you discover what you have
to say about a topic. When writing quickly, try not to doubt or question your ideas.
Allow yourself to write freely and unselfconsciously. Once you start writing with few
limitations, you may find you have more to say than you first realized. Your flow of
thoughts can lead you to discover even more ideas about the topic. Freewriting may
even lead you to discover another topic that excites you even more.

   Look at Mariah's example. The instructor allowed the members of the class to
choose their own topics, and Mariah thought about her experiences as a
communications major. She used this freewriting exercise to help her generate
more concrete ideas from her own experience.
                                                                                                                          PREWRITING MODELS | 327

TIP

Some prewriting strategies can be used together. For example, you could use experience and
observations to come up with a topic related to your course studies. Then you could use
freewriting to describe your topic in more detail and figure out what you have to say about it.
328 | PREWRITING MODELS

    EXERCISE 1
     Freewrite about one event you have recently experienced. With this event in mind, write without
     stopping for five minutes. After you finish, read over what you wrote. Does anything stand out to
     you as a good general topic to write about?

Asking Questions

Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? In everyday situations, you pose these
kinds of questions to get more information. Who will be my partner for the project?
                                                                                                                                PREWRITING MODELS | 329

When is the next meeting? Why is my car making that odd noise? Even the title of
this chapter begins with the question "How do I begin?"

   You seek the answers to these questions to gain knowledge, to better understand
your daily experiences, and to plan for the future. Asking these types of questions
will also help you with the writing process. As you choose your topic, answering
these questions can help you revisit the ideas you already have and generate new
ways to think about your topic. You may also discover aspects of the topic that
are unfamiliar to you and that you would like to learn more about. All these idea-
gathering techniques will help you plan for future work on your assignment.

   When Mariah reread her freewriting notes, she found she had rambled and her
thoughts were disjointed. She realized that the topic that interested her most was
the one she started with, the media. She then decided to explore that topic by
asking herself questions about it. Her purpose was to refine media into a topic
she felt comfortable writing about. To see how asking questions can help you
choose a topic, take a look at the following chart that Mariah completed to record
her questions and answers. She asked herself the questions that reporters and
journalists use to gather information for their stories. The questions are often called
the 5WH questions, after their initial letters.

   Figure 3.1 Asking Questions

Questions Answers

Who?   I use media. Students, teachers, parents, employers and employees-almost everyone uses media.

What?  The media can be a lot of things. Television, radio, e-mail (I think), newspapers, magazines, books.

Where? The media is almost everywhere now. It's in homes, at work, in cars, even on cell phones!

When?  Media has been around for a long time, but seems a lot more important now.

When?  Hmm. This is a good question. I don't know why there is mass media. Maybe we have it because we
       have the technology now. Or people live far away from their families and they have to stay in touch.

How?   Well, media is possible because of the technology inventions, but I don't know how they all work!
330 | PREWRITING MODELS

  TIP

     Prewriting is very purpose driven; it does not follow a set of hard-and-fast rules. The purpose of
     prewriting is to find and explore ideas so that you will be prepared to write. A prewriting
     technique like asking questions can help you both find a topic and explore it. The key to effective
     prewriting is to use the techniques that work best for your thinking process. Freewriting may not
     seem to fit your thinking process, but keep an open mind. It may work better than you think.
     Perhaps brainstorming a list of topics might better fit your personal style. Mariah found
     freewriting and asking questions to be fruitful strategies to use. In your own prewriting, use the
     5WH questions in any way that benefits your planning.

    EXERCISE 2
     Choose a general topic idea from the prewriting you completed in 3.1 "Exercise 1". Then read
     each question and use your own paper to answer the 5WH questions. As with Mariah when she
     explored her writing topic for more detail, it is OK if you do not know all the answers. If you do
     not know an answer, use your own opinion to speculate, or guess. You may also use factual
                                                                                                                                PREWRITING MODELS | 331

     information from books or articles you previously read on your topic. Later in the chapter, you
     will read about additional ways (like searching the Internet) to answer your questions and
     explore your guesses.
     5WH Questions

        1. Who?
             _____________________________________________________

        2. What?
             _____________________________________________________

        3. Where?
             _____________________________________________________

        4. When?
             _____________________________________________________

        5. Why?
             _____________________________________________________

        6. How?
             _____________________________________________________

Now that you have completed some of the prewriting exercises, you may feel less
anxious about starting a paper from scratch. With some ideas down on paper (or
saved on a computer), writers are often more comfortable continuing the writing
process. After identifying a good general topic, you, too, are ready to continue the
process.

    EXERCISE 3

     Write your general topic on your own sheet of paper, under where you recorded your purpose
     and audience. Choose it from among the topics you listed or explored during the prewriting you
332 | PREWRITING MODELS

     have done so far. Make sure it is one you feel comfortable with and feel capable of writing
     about.
     My general topic: ____________________________________________

  TIP

     You may find that you need to adjust your topic as you move through the writing stages (and as
     you complete the exercises in this chapter). If the topic you have chosen is not working, you can
     repeat the prewriting activities until you find a better one.

More Prewriting Techniques

The prewriting techniques of freewriting and asking questions helped Mariah think
more about her topic, but the following prewriting strategies can help her (and you)
narrow the focus of the topic:

   · Brainstorming
                          PREWRITING MODELS | 333

· Idea mapping
· Searching the Internet

Narrowing the Focus

Narrowing the focus means breaking up the topic into subtopics, or more specific
points. Generating lots of subtopics will help you eventually select the ones that fit
the assignment and appeal to you and your audience.

   After rereading her syllabus, Mariah realized her general topic, mass media, is too
broad for her class's short paper requirement. Three pages are not enough to cover
all the concerns in mass media today. Mariah also realized that although her readers
are other communications majors who are interested in the topic, they may want to
read a paper about a particular issue in mass media.

Brainstorming

Brainstorming is similar to list making. You can make a list on your own or in a
group with your classmates. Start with a blank sheet of paper (or a blank computer
document) and write your general topic across the top. Underneath your topic,
make a list of more specific ideas. Think of your general topic as a broad category
and the list items as things that fit in that category. Often you will find that one item
can lead to the next, creating a flow of ideas that can help you narrow your focus to
a more specific paper topic.

   The following is Mariah's brainstorming list:
334 | PREWRITING MODELS
                                                                                                                                PREWRITING MODELS | 335

From this list, Mariah could narrow her focus to a particular technology under the
broad category of mass media.

      Imagine you have to write an e-mail to your current boss explaining your prior work experience, but you do not know where to start. Before you begin the
      e-mail, you can use the brainstorming technique to generate a list of employers, duties, and responsibilities that fall under the general topic "work
      experience."

Idea Mapping

Idea mapping allows you to visualize your ideas on paper using circles, lines, and
arrows. This technique is also known as clustering because ideas are broken down
and clustered, or grouped together. Many writers like this method because the
shapes show how the ideas relate or connect, and writers can find a focused topic
from the connections mapped. Using idea mapping, you might discover interesting
connections between topics that you had not thought of before.

   To create an idea map, start with your general topic in a circle in the center of a
blank sheet of paper. Then write specific ideas around it and use lines or arrows to
connect them together. Add and cluster as many ideas as you can think of.

   In addition to brainstorming, Mariah tried idea mapping. Review the following
idea map that Mariah created:

   Figure 3.2 Idea Map
                                                                                                                                PREWRITING MODELS | 339

Notice Mariah's largest circle contains her general topic, mass media. Then, the
general topic branches into two subtopics written in two smaller circles: television
and radio. The subtopic television branches into even more specific topics: cable
and DVDs. From there, Mariah drew more circles and wrote more specific ideas:
high definition and digital recording from cable and Blu-ray from DVDs. The radio
topic led Mariah to draw connections between music, downloads versus CDs, and,
finally, piracy.

   From this idea map, Mariah saw she could consider narrowing the focus of her
mass media topic to the more specific topic of music piracy.

Searching the Internet

Using search engines on the Internet is a good way to see what kinds of websites
are available on your topic. Writers use search engines not only to understand
more about the topic's specific issues but also to get better acquainted with their
audience.
340 | PREWRITING MODELS

  TIP

     Look back at the chart you completed in 3.1 "Exercise 2". Did you guess at any of the answers?
     Searching the Internet may help you find answers to your questions and confirm your guesses.
     Be choosy about the websites you use. Make sure they are reliable sources for the kind of
     information you seek.

When you search the Internet, type some key words from your broad topic or words
from your narrowed focus into your browser's search engine (many good general
and specialized search engines are available for you to try). Then look over the
results for relevant and interesting articles.

     Results from an Internet search show writers the following information:
          · Who is talking about the topic
          · How the topic is being discussed
          · What specific points are currently being discussed about the topic
                                                                                                                                PREWRITING MODELS | 341

  TIP

     If the search engine results are not what you are looking for, revise your key words and search
     again. Some search engines also offer suggestions for related searches that may give you
     better results.

Mariah typed the words music piracy from her idea map into the search engine
Google.

   Figure 3.3 Useful Search Engine Results
342 | PREWRITING MODELS

   Not all the results online search engines return will be useful or reliable. Give
careful consideration to the reliability of an online source before selecting a topic
based on it. Remember that factual information can be verified in other sources,
both online and in print. If you have doubts about any information you find, either
do not use it or identify it as potentially unreliable.

   The results from Mariah's search included websites from university publications,
personal blogs, online news sources, and lots of legal cases sponsored by the
recording industry. Reading legal jargon made Mariah uncomfortable with the
results, so she decided to look further. Reviewing her map, she realized that she was
more interested in consumer aspects of mass media, so she refocused her search to
media technology and the sometimes confusing array of expensive products that
fill electronics stores. Now, Mariah considers a paper topic on the products that have
fed the mass media boom in everyday lives.

EXERCISE 4

In 3.1 "Exercise 2" you chose a possible topic and explored it by answering questions about it
using the 5WH questions. However, this topic may still be too broad. Here, in "Exercise 4",
choose and complete one of the prewriting strategies to narrow the focus. Use either
brainstorming, idea mapping, or searching the Internet.

Collaboration

Please share with a classmate and compare your answers. Share what you found and what
interests you about the possible topic(s).

Prewriting strategies are a vital first step in the writing process. First, they help you
first choose a broad topic and then they help you narrow the focus of the topic to a
more specific idea. An effective topic ensures that you are ready for the next step.

TOPIC CHECKLIST

Developing a Good Topic
The following checklist can help you decide if your narrowed topic is a good topic for your
assignment.

     · Am I interested in this topic?
     · Would my audience be interested?
     · Do I have prior knowledge or experience with this topic? If so, would I be comfortable

        exploring this topic and sharing my experiences?
     · Do I want to learn more about this topic?
     · Is this topic specific?
     · Does it fit the length of the assignment?
344 | PREWRITING MODELS

With your narrowed focus in mind, answer the bulleted questions in the checklist
for developing a good topic. If you can answer "yes" to all the questions, write your
topic on the line. If you answer "no" to any of the questions, think about another
topic or adjust the one you have and try the prewriting strategies again.

   My narrowed topic: ____________________________________________

RESEARCH AND FINDING CREDIBLE
SOURCES

Christian J. Pulver

Everyday Research
   We rarely call what we do every day "research," but when we go online to search

for news and information, we are engaging in everyday research. Everyday
research has become a basic skill as the internet has expanded in scale and speed.
In many cases, when we search for information, we want to understand a
"problem" we've encountered--to search for medical advice about a sore throat we
have, or to learn more about a product we want to buy. We'll read articles, reviews,
and watch videos; we'll compare brands and prices. Indeed, whether we're trying
to diagnose why we're feeling sick or trying to understand why our phone's battery
won't hold a charge, the first place we usually turn to is the internet to help solve
the problem. Of course, this kind of everyday research is just one kind of
information seeking, but it's a good place to begin when starting a larger research
endeavor to write about a problem that matters to academic, professional, and
public audiences. In this course you'll build on these everyday research skills to
develop more formal academic research strategies for collecting your own data
and finding, evaluating, and selecting sources.

   To be sure, problems come in all shapes and sizes, from minor to major,
including what we called "wicked problems" in the book's introduction. Wicked
problems are problems that may have "innumerable causes, [are] tough to
describe, and [don't] have a right answer..." (Camillus 100), and they often emerge
from rapid social and technological changes. Such problems, due to their far-
reaching effects and the tensions they can cause among people and groups,
require a more intentional and formal approach to their study. And as your own
inquiry into a problem takes a more formal shape, the standards and ethical
expectations grow for how the research is conducted, how data is collected, and
the credibility of the sources you draw on.
346 | RESEARCH AND FINDING CREDIBLE SOURCES

   Identifying and Exploring a Wicked Problem
   When first inquiring about a problem you're interested in, a general internet
search is a good start. Visiting Wikipedia, reading popular articles, and watching
media related to the problem will help build your understanding of the discourse
that surrounds the problem--how others are talking about it, different sides of the
issue, and its history and context. Since these early stages are exploratory, you'll
want to keep an open mind and slow down as you research. As you dig deeper into
a problem, the more complicated and nuanced it will become.
   Google, Bing, and other commercial search engines are useful tools for everyday
research and you'll use these throughout the research process. Keep in mind
though, they have their limitations and generally they are not enough for
researching a wicked problem. In fact, when we use Google or any other
commercial search engine, we really only have access to about 4% of the
information that circulates on the internet (Devine and Egger-Siger; "Ultimate
Guide").

Image 1

As you can see from Image 1, when studying a difficult problem, curious
researchers have to go beyond the surface web and commercial search engines to
build a deeper understanding of the problem they're researching. Understanding
                                                                                                RESEARCH AND FINDING CREDIBLE SOURCES | 347

a problem at a deeper level means accessing sources that are often password
protected or require subscriptions to enter--academic databases, government
archives, scientific reports, legal documents, and other sources that commercial
search engines may not have access to. While commercial search engines are
always improving and finding more resources on the deep web (Google Scholar,
for example), they usually just point to where a resource is located rather than
providing access to the resource. From a researchers perspective, the main thing
to keep in mind about the deep web is that commercial search engines are limited
in their scope. Not only are they unable to find and index the majority of the
information that exists on the global internet, the way they filter and personalize
searching based on our previous searches, and the way they rank search results, all
narrow what we see and limit our access to a wider variety of information.
Researching a wicked problem will require a dive into the deep web and the use of
more sophisticated research strategies that include using more precise search
terms and using specialized databases for scholarly research, government archives,
and industry/trade publications.

   These kinds of sources, whether on the surface or deep web, are secondary data
or secondary research. Secondary data are texts and research that has been
created by others who are also interested in some facet of the problem you are
looking into. Articles, essays, research reports, documentaries--any source you use
that has been composed by someone else is a secondary source of data.

   Where to Find Credible Secondary Sources on the Deep Web

  1. Google Scholar
 2. Government databases
 3. Non-profit research organizations (e.g. Pew Research Center or the American

      Cancer Society)
 4. Library catalogues and research databases

   Primary Research
   Depending on the context of the problem they are writing about, many
researchers will conduct their own research, what is known as primary data or
primary research. Primary research comes in the forms of conducting interviews,
taking observation notes, running surveys, focus groups, and experiments where
data is collected and analyzed. Researchers often mix both primary and secondary
research, depending on the kind of the problem they are investigating. If you are
348 | RESEARCH AND FINDING CREDIBLE SOURCES

researching a more local context like a group or organization trying to solve a
particular problem, you might conduct your own interviews and surveys of the
participants to understand the perspective of the group better. Your instructor can
help you figure out what kind of primary research may be suitable for the problem
you are looking at, as well as some of the ethical concerns you'll need to keep in
mind when doing primary research.

   Common Ways to Conduct Primary Research

   · Archives and historical documentation
   · Surveys
   · Interviews
   · Focus groups
   · Observation notes
   · Experiments

   Ethics of Primary and Secondary Researching
   Equally important when discerning the quality of your sources and managing
your research is to consider ethical questions that may arise in doing both primary
and secondary research. In primary research and data collection, researchers must
be completely transparent about their intentions to those who might participate
in a study, and should obtain written consent from all participants when necessary.
Universities that support research have an Institutional Review Board (IRB) that
reviews all research projects to ensure they are safe and will not unintentionally
hurt people, animals, or the environment. Your instructor can help you think
through these ethical questions if you decide to undertake primary research that
includes human participants.
   In secondary research, ethical questions are ones a researcher must ask
themselves, both in how they choose their sources and in the way they quote and
reference the sources they draw on. This raises the important question of
plagiarism and working with sources in ways that inform your research without
overly relying on any one source or using the source's words as if they were your
own. Remember, when you're researching and writing about a problem, your final
goal is to add something new to the larger conversation already going on. Your
contribution doesn't have to be groundbreaking, but it should offer productive
discussion and emerge from your critical and ethical synthesis of the sources you
have selected.
                                                                                                RESEARCH AND FINDING CREDIBLE SOURCES | 349

   Assessing Information and Evaluating Sources
   In your secondary research, it's important to bring a critical lens to your sources.
Being critical, in this sense, doesn't mean "negative"--it means studied
discernment of the sources. Studied discernment means that you know a source
well enough to understand whether or not it's credible and how it fits into the
larger discourse about the problem. To gain this depth of understanding requires
active reading practices and intentional assessment (including fact-checking) of
the source.
   In today's world of information abundance, such discernment is needed more
than ever. With the rise of twitter bots, filter bubbles, personalized search, and the
polarizing effects of social media, the spread of disinformation and misinformation
has become its own wicked problem. Both disinformation and misinformation are
having profound effects on our political, social, and economic lives, and they only
increase the need for researchers to be critically minded and sharper discerners of
the quality and veracity of the information they encounter. Thus, the very first
thing you'll want to know before you begin your research is whether or not the
problem you are concerned about is really a problem at all and not another
misleading headline, conspiracy theory, or junk science.
   The following table is a brief list of questions you can refer to as you assess your
secondary sources for their credibility, their stance and bias, and how they fit into
the larger discourse of the problem you are exploring:

     Evaluating the Veracity and Credibility of your Sources
350 | RESEARCH AND FINDING CREDIBLE SOURCES

       When you come across a source that may be relevant to the problem you are studying,
       assess how credible and trustworthy it is. The following steps are a useful guide to figure out
       the type and quality of a source, and to judge whether you should use it in your research.
       These aren't necessarily linear steps, and the questions are ones you should ask as you read
       and re-read your sources.

       Step 1: Scan the source for your initial impressions.

            · Does the information seem far-fetched?
            · Does the source distinguish between opinions and facts?
            · Does it use charged language and take an extreme viewpoint?

       If a source makes claims that seem questionable or extreme, or makes claims that aren't
       supported by independent research, that is a red flag. If this is the case, it doesn't mean you
       need to dismiss the source altogether, but you won't want to use it to support your own
       claims and research. If your initial impression of the source feels trustworthy, then move to
       the questions in Step 2.
       Step 2: Ask basic questions about the source.

            · Who is the writer/publisher? Why are they qualified to write about this subject matter?
            · When was the source published?
            · Who is the intended audience? What stance does the source take? Do you notice a

               bias?
            · What is your bias and how is it impacting your reading/assessment of the evidence?
            · Does the author clearly explain the methods by which they arrived at any statistical

               data used in the source?

       Step 3: Read laterally.
       Understanding these questions may take some time, and as you work through them, you'll
       want to start reading more laterally (Caulfield). Reading laterally is the process of reading
       across a wide range of sources to look for patterns of argument and evidence present across
       that group of resources. Once you have a good sense of the basic markers of a credible
       source, you're ready to read more laterally and begin locating the source in the larger
       discourse and textual circulation that surrounds it.

            · What types of sources (primary and secondary) are referenced and cited in the source
               and how are they used?

            · Can you trace and verify these sources? Try pulling them up in different tabs so you can
               bounce between them.

            · When looking at arguments, claims, and the evidence used to support claims in the
               source, are you able to cross-reference these claims with other sources and research? If
               not, the claims may not be trustworthy.

            · What other sources do these secondary sources cite? This will give you a broader sense
               of the network of texts and research circulating about the problem and give you ideas
               on where to go next in your research.

   Managing and Organizing Research Through Writing Tools
   In addition to sharpening your critical abilities to discern credible information,
another important skill you'll be building on in this and other writing courses is
                                                                                                RESEARCH AND FINDING CREDIBLE SOURCES | 351

your ability to manage and organize your sources and research data. One of the
great challenges of information abundance is managing the amount of available
information. From bookmarking relevant websites, to keeping a running
bibliography, to writing a literature review, and organizing your research notes,
there are a range of digital tools that you can use to help manage a research
project like the one you're exploring in this course. We can't cover all the tools
available here, but we'll introduce a few that you may find useful in your own
research endeavor.

   It probably goes without saying that the activity of writing itself is central to the
process of managing and organizing your research and sources. We tend to think
of writing as simply the stuff we do when we draft a text. But experienced
researchers use writing throughout the entire research process, from beginning to
end, moving back and forth through the stages of the writing
process--brainstorming, drafting, revising, editing, and repeating this process until
the research is finished (or a deadline arrives). A common genre that you may want
to try out as you research your problem is the research memo. Research memos
are notes researchers make as they go through the process of researching, taking
notes on both primary and secondary research. Writing like this throughout your
research process will help you explore your thinking and articulate your ideas more
clearly. Research memos can be done in a conventional notebook, or they can be
done using a Google Doc or blog tool that could be shared with classmates and
collaborators.

   Other key skills and genres for doing research that you may already be familiar
with are bibliographies and literature reviews. Bibliographies are lists of sources
you are using in your research, usually in a particular style such as MLA or APA.
Annotated bibliographies include short descriptions of a source and its relevance
to your research. A literature review is a thorough summary of all the sources and
research you've read about the problem you are exploring. Literature reviews are
useful in helping readers see how your research fits in with the larger context and
conversation going on around it.

   Here are a few guidelines to help your research stay on track and organized as
you dig deeper into a wicked problem:

   · Timeline: Keep the calendar and due dates in mind and develop a research
      schedule that will allow you to easily meet those deadlines.

   · Managing your sources: There are several online tools you can use to manage
      your bibliography (Easy Bib, RefWorks). Other tools like Evernote and MS
352 | RESEARCH AND FINDING CREDIBLE SOURCES

      OneNote can help you organize your research in folders, take notes on sources,
      draft sections, and collaborate with others. Bookmarking tools like Diigo and
      Pocket can be useful also in managing sources you find online, annotating,
      grouping them through tagging.
   · Planning and "slow" research: Because the problem you are studying will take
      time to understand, be patient with the process. You'll want to stay flexible and
      open to the research process, continually reflecting on your own biases and
      stance as you learn the nuances of the problem you are studying. Over time, as
      you expand your understanding of the problem and the discourse that
      surrounds it, you'll be able to write about it with more authority and insight.
      That kind of engaged writing can only come through intentional and
      prolonged thinking, researching, and writing about the problem.

REVISING AND EDITING

   Andrew Stracuzzi and André Cormier

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

        1. Identify major areas of concern in the draft essay during revising and editing.
        2. Use peer reviews and editing checklists to assist revising and editing.
        3. Revise and edit the first draft of your essay and produce a final draft.

Revising and editing are the two tasks you undertake to significantly improve your
essay. Both are very important elements of the writing process. You may think
that a completed first draft means little improvement is needed. However, even
experienced writers need to improve their drafts and rely on peers during revising
and editing. You may know that athletes miss catches, fumble balls, or overshoot
goals. Dancers forget steps, turn too slowly, or miss beats. For both athletes and
dancers, the more they practice, the stronger their performance will become. Web
designers seek better images, a more clever design, or a more appealing
background for their web pages. Writing has the same capacity to profit from
improvement and revision.

Understanding the Purpose of Revising and Editing

Revising and editing allow you to examine two important aspects of your writing
separately, so that you can give each task your undivided attention.

   · When you revise, you take a second look at your ideas. You might add, cut,
      move, or change information in order to make your ideas clearer, more
      accurate, more interesting, or more convincing.

   · When you edit, you take a second look at how you expressed your ideas. You
354 | REVISING AND EDITING

      add or change words. You fix any problems in grammar, punctuation, and
      sentence structure. You improve your writing style. You make your essay into a
      polished, mature piece of writing, the end product of your best efforts.

               TIP

     How do you get the best out of your revisions and editing? Here are some strategies that writers
     have developed to look at their first drafts from a fresh perspective. Try them over the course of
     this semester; then keep using the ones that bring results.

          · Take a break. You are proud of what you wrote, but you might be too close to it to make
             changes. Set aside your writing for a few hours or even a day until you can look at it
             objectively.

          · Ask someone you trust for feedback and constructive criticism.
          · Pretend you are one of your readers. Are you satisfied or dissatisfied? Why?
          · Use the resources that your college provides. Find out where your school's writing lab is

             located and ask about the assistance they provide online and in person.

Many people hear the words critic, critical, and criticism and pick up only negative
vibes that provoke feelings that make them blush, grumble, or shout. However, as a
writer and a thinker, you need to learn to be critical of yourself in a positive way and
have high expectations for your work. You also need to train your eye and trust your
ability to fix what needs fixing. For this, you need to teach yourself where to look.

Creating Unity and Coherence

Following your outline closely offers you a reasonable guarantee that your writing
will stay on purpose and not drift away from the controlling idea. However, when
writers are rushed, are tired, or cannot find the right words, their writing may
become less than they want it to be. Their writing may no longer be clear and
concise, and they may be adding information that is not needed to develop the
main idea.

   When a piece of writing has unity, all the ideas in each paragraph and in the
entire essay clearly belong and are arranged in an order that makes logical sense.
When the writing has coherence, the ideas flow smoothly. The wording clearly
indicates how one idea leads to another within a paragraph and from paragraph to
paragraph.

TIP

Reading your writing aloud will often help you find problems with unity and coherence. Listen for
the clarity and flow of your ideas. Identify places where you find yourself confused, and write a
note to yourself about possible fixes.
356 | REVISING AND EDITING

Creating Unity

Sometimes writers get caught up in the moment and cannot resist a good
digression. Even though you might enjoy such detours when you chat with friends,
unplanned digressions usually harm a piece of writing.

   Mariah stayed close to her outline when she drafted the three body paragraphs
of her essay she tentatively titled "Digital Technology: The Newest and the Best
at What Price?" But a recent shopping trip for an HDTV upset her enough that
she digressed from the main topic of her third paragraph and included comments
about the sales staff at the electronics store she visited. When she revised her essay,
she deleted the off-topic sentences that affected the unity of the paragraph.

   Read the following paragraph twice, the first time without Mariah's changes, and
the second time with them.

     Nothing is more confusing to me than choosing among televisions. It confuses lots of people
     who want a new high-definition digital television (HDTV) with a large screen to watch sports and
     DVDs on. You could listen to the guys in the electronics store, but word has it they know little
     more than you do. They want to sell what they have in stock, not what best fits your needs. You
     face decisions you never had to make with the old, bulky picture-tube televisions. Screen
     resolution means the number of horizontal scan lines the screen can show. This resolution is
     often 1080p, or full HD, or 768p. The trouble is that if you have a smaller screen, 32 inches or 37
     inches diagonal, you won't be able to tell the difference with the naked eye. The 1080p
     televisions cost more, though, so those are what the salespeople want you to buy. They get
     bigger commissions. The other important decision you face as you walk around the sales floor
     is whether to get a plasma screen or an LCD screen. Now here the salespeople may finally give
     you decent info. Plasma flat-panel television screens can be much larger in diameter than their
     LCD rivals. Plasma screens show truer blacks and can be viewed at a wider angle than current
     LCD screens. But be careful and tell the salesperson you have budget constraints. Large flat-
     panel plasma screens are much more expensive than flat-screen LCD models. Don't let
     someone make you by more television than you need!
            REVISING AND EDITING | 357

EXERCISE 1

Answer the following two questions about Mariah's paragraph:

   1. Do you agree with Mariah's decision to make the deletions she made? Did she cut too
        much, too little, or just enough? Explain.

   2. Is the explanation of what screen resolution means a digression? Or is it audience-friendly
        and essential to understanding the paragraph? Explain.

Collaboration: Please share with a classmate and compare your answers.

     · Now start to revise the first draft of an essay for this course. Reread it to find any
        statements that affect the unity of your writing. Decide how best to revise.

TIP

When you reread your writing to find revisions to make, look for each type of problem in a
separate sweep. Read it straight through once to locate any problems with unity. Read it straight
358 | REVISING AND EDITING

     through a second time to find problems with coherence. You may follow this same practice
     during many stages of the writing process.

               CONNECTING THE PIECES: WRITING
  AT WORK

     Many companies hire copyeditors and proofreaders to help them produce the cleanest possible
     final drafts of large writing projects. Copyeditors are responsible for suggesting revisions and
     style changes; proofreaders check documents for any errors in capitalization, spelling, and
     punctuation that have crept in. Many times, these tasks are done on a freelance basis, with one
     freelancer working for a variety of clients.

Creating Coherence

Careful writers use transitions to clarify how the ideas in their sentences and
paragraphs are related. These words and phrases help the writing flow smoothly.
Adding transitions is not the only way to improve coherence, but they are often
useful and give a mature feel to your essays.

After Maria revised for unity, she next examined her paragraph about televisions to
check for coherence. She looked for places where she needed to add a transition or
perhaps reword the text to make the flow of ideas clear. In the version that follows,
she has already deleted the sentences that were off topic.
362 | REVISING AND EDITING

  TIP

     Many writers make their revisions on a printed copy and then transfer them to the version on-
     screen. They conventionally use a small arrow called a caret (^) to show where to insert an
     addition or correction.
                                                                                                                        REVISING AND EDITING | 363

EXERCISE 2
   1. Answer the following questions about Mariah's revised paragraph.
              Do you agree with the transitions and other changes that Mariah made to her
                paragraph? Which would you keep and which were unnecessary? Explain.
              What transition words or phrases did Mariah add to her paragraph? Why did she
                choose each one?
              What effect does adding additional sentences have on the coherence of the
                paragraph? Explain. When you read both versions aloud, which version has a more
                logical flow of ideas? Explain.
   2. Now return to the same first draft and revise it for coherence. Add transition words and
        phrases where they are needed, and make any other changes that are needed to improve
        the flow and connection between ideas.
364 | REVISING AND EDITING

Being Clear and Concise

Some writers are very methodical and painstaking when they write a first draft.
Other writers unleash a lot of words in order to get out all that they feel they need
to say. Do either of these composing styles match your style? Or is your composing
style somewhere in between? No matter which description best fits you, the first
draft of almost every piece of writing, no matter its author, can be made clearer and
more concise.

   If you have a tendency to write too much, you will need to look for unnecessary
words. If you have a tendency to be vague or imprecise in your wording, you will
need to find specific words to replace any overly general language.

Identifying Wordiness

Sometimes writers use too many words when fewer words will appeal more to
their audience and better fit their purpose. Here are some common examples of
wordiness to look for in your draft. Eliminating wordiness helps all readers, because
it makes your ideas clear, direct, and straightforward.

   Sentences that begin with There is or There are.

       Wordy: There are two major experiments that the Biology Department sponsors.
       Revised: The Biology Department sponsors two major experiments.

Sentences with unnecessary modifiers.

       Wordy: Two extremely famous and well-known consumer advocates spoke eloquently in
       favor of the proposed important legislation.
       Revised: Two well-known consumer advocates spoke in favor of the proposed legislation.

Sentences with deadwood phrases that add little to the meaning. Be judicious
                                                                                                                              REVISING AND EDITING | 365

when you use phrases such as in terms of, with a mind to, on the subject of, as to
whether or not, more or less, as far as...is concerned, and similar expressions. You
can usually find a more straightforward way to state your point.

       Wordy: As a world leader in the field of green technology, the company plans to focus its
       efforts in the area of geothermal energy.
       A report as to whether or not to use geysers as an energy source is in the process of
       preparation.
       Revised: As a world leader in green technology, the company plans to focus on geothermal
       energy.
       A report about using geysers as an energy source is in preparation.

Sentences with constructions that can be shortened.

       Wordy: The e-book reader, which is a recent invention, may become as commonplace as the
       cell phone.
       My over-sixty uncle bought an e-book reader, and his wife bought an e-book reader, too.
       Revised: The e-book reader, a recent invention, may become as commonplace as the cell
       phone.
       My over-sixty uncle and his wife both bought e-book readers.

Sentences in the passive voice or with forms of the verb to be. Sentences with
passive-voice verbs often create confusion, because the subject of the sentence
does not perform an action. Sentences are clearer when the subject of the sentence
performs the action and is followed by a strong verb. Use strong active-voice verbs
in place of forms of to be, which can lead to wordiness. Avoid passive voice when
you can.
366 | REVISING AND EDITING

       Wordy: It might perhaps be said that using a GPS device is something that is a benefit to
       drivers who have a poor sense of direction.
       Revised: Using a GPS device benefits drivers who have a poor sense of direction.

    EXERCISE 3

     Now return once more to the first draft of the essay you have been revising. Check it for
     unnecessary words. Try making your sentences as concise as they can be.

Choosing Specific, Appropriate Words

Most college essays should be written in formal English suitable for an academic
situation. Follow these principles to be sure that your word choice is appropriate.

   · Avoid slang. Find alternatives to bummer, kewl, and rad.
   · Avoid language that is overly casual. Write about "men and women" rather

      than "girls and guys" unless you are trying to create a specific effect. A formal
      tone calls for formal language.
   · Avoid contractions. Use do not in place of don't, I am in place of I'm, have not
      in place of haven't, and so on. Contractions are considered casual speech.
   · Avoid clichés. Overused expressions such as green with envy, face the music,
      better late than never, and similar expressions are empty of meaning and may
      not appeal to your audience.
   · Be careful when you use words that sound alike but have different
      meanings. Some examples are allusion/illusion, complement/compliment,
      council/counsel, concurrent/consecutive, founder/flounder, and historic/
      historical. When in doubt, check a dictionary.
   · Choose words with the connotations you want. Choosing a word for its
      connotations is as important in formal essay writing as it is in all kinds of
      writing. Compare the positive connotations of the word proud and the
                                                                                                                              REVISING AND EDITING | 367

      negative connotations of arrogant and conceited.
   · Use specific words rather than overly general words. Find synonyms for

      thing, people, nice, good, bad, interesting, and other vague words. Or use
      specific details to make your exact meaning clear.

Now read the revisions Mariah made to make her third paragraph clearer and more
concise. She has already incorporated the changes she made to improve unity and
coherence.
368 | REVISING AND EDITING

    EXERCISE 4

        1. Answer the following questions about Mariah's revised paragraph:

                   Read the unrevised and the revised paragraphs aloud. Explain in your own words
                      how changes in word choice have affected Mariah's writing.

                   Do you agree with the changes that Mariah made to her paragraph? Which changes
                      would you keep and which were unnecessary? Explain. What other changes would
                      you have made?

                   What effect does removing contractions and the pronoun "you" have on the tone of
                      the paragraph? How would you characterize the tone now? Why?

                   Now return once more to your essay in progress. Read carefully for problems with
                      word choice. Be sure that your draft is written in formal language and that your
                      word choice is specific and appropriate.

Completing a Peer Review

After working so closely with a piece of writing, writers often need to step back and
ask for a more objective reader. What writers most need is feedback from readers
who can respond only to the words on the page. When they are ready, writers show
their drafts to someone they respect and who can give an honest response about
its strengths and weaknesses.

   You, too, can ask a peer to read your draft when it is ready. After evaluating the
feedback and assessing what is most helpful, the reader's feedback will help you
when you revise your draft. This process is called peer review.

   You can work with a partner in your class and identify specific ways to strengthen
each other's essays. Although you may be uncomfortable sharing your writing at
first, remember that each writer is working toward the same goal: a final draft that
fits the audience and the purpose. Maintaining a positive attitude when providing
feedback will put you and your partner at ease. The box that follows provides a
useful framework for the peer review session.
                                                                                                                        REVISING AND EDITING | 369

               CONNECTING THE PIECES: WRITING
  AT WORK

     One of the reasons why word-processing programs build in a reviewing feature is that
     workgroups have become a common feature in many businesses. Writing is often collaborative,
     and the members of a workgroup and their supervisors often critique group members' work and
     offer feedback that will lead to a better final product.

    EXERCISE 5
     Exchange essays with a classmate and complete a peer review of each other's draft in progress.
     Remember to give positive feedback and to be courteous and polite in your responses. Focus on
     providing one positive comment and one question for more information to the author.

Using Feedback Objectively

The purpose of peer feedback is to receive constructive criticism of your essay. Your
peer reviewer is your first real audience, and you have the opportunity to learn what
confuses and delights a reader so that you can improve your work before sharing
the final draft with a wider audience (or your intended audience).

   It may not be necessary to incorporate every recommendation your peer reviewer
makes. However, if you start to observe a pattern in the responses you receive
from peer reviewers, you might want to take that feedback into consideration in
future assignments. For example, if you read consistent comments about a need for
more research, then you may want to consider including more research in future
assignments.

Using Feedback from Multiple Sources

You might get feedback from more than one reader as you share different stages of
your revised draft. In this situation, you may receive feedback from readers who do
not understand the assignment or who lack your involvement with and enthusiasm
for it.

   You need to evaluate the responses you receive according to two important
criteria:

1. Determine if the feedback supports the purpose of the assignment.
2. Determine if the suggested revisions are appropriate to the audience.

Then, using these standards, accept or reject revision feedback.

EXERCISE 6

Work with two partners. Go back to Exercise 4 in this lesson and compare your responses to
Activity A, about Mariah's paragraph, with your partners'. Recall Mariah's purpose for writing and
her audience. Then, working individually, list where you agree and where you disagree about
revision needs.
372 | REVISING AND EDITING

Editing Your Draft

If you have been incorporating each set of revisions as Mariah has, you have
produced multiple drafts of your writing. So far, all your changes have been content
changes. Perhaps with the help of peer feedback, you have made sure that you
sufficiently supported your ideas. You have checked for problems with unity and
coherence. You have examined your essay for word choice, revising to cut
unnecessary words and to replace weak wording with specific and appropriate
wording.

   The next step after revising the content is editing. When you edit, you examine
the surface features of your text. You examine your spelling, grammar, usage, and
punctuation. You also make sure you use the proper format when creating your
finished assignment.

  TIP

     Editing often takes time. Budgeting time into the writing process allows you to complete
     additional edits after revising. Editing and proofreading your writing helps you create a finished
     work that represents your best efforts. Here are a few more tips to remember about your
     readers:

          · Readers do not notice correct spelling, but they do notice misspellings.
          · Readers look past your sentences to get to your ideas--unless the sentences are

             awkward, poorly constructed, and frustrating to read.
          · Readers notice when every sentence has the same rhythm as every other sentence, with

             no variety.
          · Readers do not cheer when you use there, their, and they're correctly, but they notice when

             you do not.
          · Readers will notice the care with which you handled your assignment and your attention

             to detail in the delivery of an error-free document..

The first section of this book offers a useful review of grammar, mechanics, and
usage. Use it to help you eliminate major errors in your writing and refine your
understanding of the conventions of language. Do not hesitate to ask for help, too,
from peer tutors in your academic department or in the college's writing lab. In the
meantime, use the checklist to help you edit your writing.

  CHECKLIST

     Editing Your Writing
     Grammar

          · Are some sentences actually sentence fragments?
          · Are some sentences run-on sentences? How can I correct them?
          · Do some sentences need conjunctions between independent clauses?
          · Does every verb agree with its subject?
          · Is every verb in the correct tense?
          · Are tense forms, especially for irregular verbs, written correctly?
          · Have I used subject, object, and possessive personal pronouns correctly?
374 | REVISING AND EDITING

          · Have I used who and whom correctly?
          · Is the antecedent of every pronoun clear?
          · Do all personal pronouns agree with their antecedents?
          · Have I used the correct comparative and superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs?
          · Is it clear which word a participial phrase modifies, or is it a dangling modifier?

     Sentence Structure

          · Are all my sentences simple sentences, or do I vary my sentence structure?
          · Have I chosen the best coordinating or subordinating conjunctions to join clauses?
          · Have I created long, over-packed sentences that should be shortened for clarity?
          · Do I see any mistakes in parallel structure?

     Punctuation

          · Does every sentence end with the correct end punctuation?
          · Can I justify the use of every exclamation point?
          · Have I used apostrophes correctly to write all singular and plural possessive forms?
          · Have I used quotation marks correctly?

     Mechanics and Usage

          · Can I find any spelling errors? How can I correct them?
          · Have I used capital letters where they are needed?
          · Have I written abbreviations, where allowed, correctly?
          · Can I find any errors in the use of commonly confused words, such as to/too/two?
                                                                                                                        REVISING AND EDITING | 375

TIP

Be careful about relying too much on spelling checkers and grammar checkers. A spelling
checker cannot recognize that you meant to write principle but wrote principal instead. A
grammar checker often queries constructions that are perfectly correct. The program does not
understand your meaning; it makes its check against a general set of formulas that might not
apply in each instance. If you use a grammar checker, accept the suggestions that make sense,
but consider why the suggestions came up.
376 | REVISING AND EDITING

  TIP

     Proofreading requires patience; it is very easy to read past a mistake. Set your paper aside for at
     least a few hours, if not a day or more, so your mind will rest. Some professional proofreaders
     read a text backward so they can concentrate on spelling and punctuation. Another helpful
     technique is to slowly read a paper aloud, paying attention to every word, letter, and punctuation
     mark.
     If you need additional proofreading help, ask a reliable friend, a classmate, or a peer tutor to
     make a final pass on your paper to look for anything you missed.

Formatting

Remember to use proper format when creating your finished assignment.
Sometimes an instructor, a department, or a college will require students to follow
specific instructions on titles, margins, page numbers, or the location of the writer's
name. These requirements may be more detailed and rigid for research projects
and term papers, which often observe the American Psychological Association
(APA) or Modern Language Association (MLA) style guides, especially when
citations of sources are included.
                                                                                                                              REVISING AND EDITING | 377

   To ensure the format is correct and follows any specific instructions, make a final
check before you submit an assignment.

    EXERCISE 7

     With the help of the checklist, edit and proofread your essay.

    KEY TAKEAWAYS

          · Revising and editing are the stages of the writing process in which you improve your work
             before producing a final draft.

          · During revising, you add, cut, move, or change information in order to improve content.
          · During editing, you take a second look at the words and sentences you used to express

             your ideas and fix any problems in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.
          · Unity in writing means that all the ideas in each paragraph and in the entire essay clearly

             belong together and are arranged in an order that makes logical sense.
          · Coherence in writing means that the writer's wording clearly indicates how one idea leads

             to another within a paragraph and between paragraphs.
          · Transitional words and phrases effectively make writing more coherent.
          · Writing should be clear and concise, with no unnecessary words.
          · Effective formal writing uses specific, appropriate words and avoids slang, contractions,

             clichés, and overly general words.
          · Peer reviews, done properly, can give writers objective feedback about their writing. It is

             the writer's responsibility to evaluate the results of peer reviews and incorporate only
             useful feedback.
          · Remember to budget time for careful editing and proofreading. Use all available
             resources, including editing checklists, peer editing, and your institution's writing lab, to
             improve your editing skills.

RHETORIC

   Mel A. Topf

We commonly hear the word "rhetoric" used in a negative way, to indicate the
empty, inflated or misleading language of someone who has an untrustworthy
agenda. ("The governor's speech was just a lot of rhetoric.") But in your study of
how writing works, you've learned rhetoric has a more significant meaning--the
techniques we use to communicate effectively and persuasively. Even though
many of us have developed our rhetorical knowledge, we still often make the
mistake of thinking we are simply transferring information when we write or speak
and, in essence, forget to consider those techniques that make our
communication persuasive. In fact, whether we are thinking about it or not, we
are always using rhetoric because, as Aristotle wrote, "we cannot do without it."
Our communicating is rarely effective, he said, "with no help beyond the bare
facts," because "the way in which a thing is said does affect its intelligibility."

   Consider a corporate project manager, wanting to be sure a project stays on
schedule, who says to the employees responsible for the project: "Completing this
project by June 15 is important." But she could also say, "It's really, really important
for all of us that we complete the project by June 15 at the very latest." The
substance of both statements is the same, but the second version adds several
distinct and common rhetorical devices to emphasize what is important. One, it
adds "really," a word often used as an intensifier (without adding additional
information). Two, it repeats the word. Redundancy is a common means of
emphasis. Three, it adds "for all of us" to focus on those responsible. Fourth, it
moves the point about importance from the end of the sentence to the beginning,
that is, alters the "arrangement" of the sentence. Note that none of these
rhetorical differences adds any substantive information. That's rhetoric at work.

   Some Concepts in Rhetoric
   In English literature classes you probably encountered some rhetorical concepts
that apply to specific language usage. For example, metonymy is the name of one
thing applied to another (like the crown standing for the Queen), or oxymoron (like
                                                                                                                                                RHETORIC | 379

"darkness visible"). Even metaphor, which we tend to think of as literary, comes out
of the rhetorical tradition. But when we think about how writing works, we need
to consider an equally important set of rhetorical concepts that apply to the
context or circumstances within which we communicate. Here are several
important ones which inform the kinds of decisions we make as writers.

   Rhetorical Situation. The rhetorical situation involves the interplay among the
speaker's or writer's purposes, text, audience, and academic, public, or professional
context within which the communication occurs.

   Framing. A frame is a way of shaping or packaging a distinct perspective on a
subject that leads the audience to accept the message. Sustainability, for example,
could be framed as a moral crisis or an economic opportunity. Our evidence,
reasoning, tone, and style all contribute to how we frame our text so that the
audience gets the message: for instance, as crisis or as opportunity.

   Exigence. Exigence, or exigency, is the set of circumstances that create the
demand or felt pressure for writing or speaking. (It's from the Latin word for
"demand.") The circumstances create a need to fill a gap or overcome an obstacle,
to meet a request, to resolve a dispute, to solve a problem, and so on. In the
example given above, let's say the manager's concern about deadlines arose from
some employees having missed a recent deadline, or from the contract they are
working under imposing harsh financial penalties for missing a deadline. Both
circumstances create an exigence that "demands" that the manager not simple
notify employees of the deadline, but also emphasize how important it is.

   Kairos. Closely related to exigence is Kairos--good timing. In school writing you
may have little opportunity or need to make judgments about the timing of your
writing or speaking, or have reason to mention it directly, since deadlines and
syllabi often make the decision for you. In many real-world contexts, however,
judgements about timing are crucial. Kairos is the rhetorical term for the right or
opportune moment when something is best stated or done. It also refers to the
expressly stated recognition of the appropriate moment to drive home an
argument. As Martin Luther King asserted in his "I have a Dream Speech" of 1963,
"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy."

   Audience. Audience is the recipient of a communication. There may be several
audiences for a single communication, with varying or even conflicting interests.
As writers, we must make clear judgments about how to address varying
audiences, guided by the need to achieve the writer's purpose. The project
manager's audience, for example, is a group whose members should have in
common an interest in successful completion of the project.
380 | RHETORIC

   Discourse community. This is a group with interests in common, always
involving shared language practices that help achieve shared goals. It is within a
discourse community that we write and speak. Students, professors, and staff at a
university is one. Red Sox fans, an introductory biology course, members of a
corporation, and constitutional lawyers are others. You may of course be members
of many discourse communities, each using in different ways language, writing,
and writing genres to achieve the community's goals.

   Rhetoric and Problems That Matter
   Whether we are interrogating a problem from an academic perspective, posing
a solution to a problem in a professional setting, or identifying a problem that
needs attention in the public sphere--whenever we write to an audience--we are
using rhetoric. The more we are aware of what these concepts are and how they
function, the greater facility we gain with communicating persuasively--and the
more likely we are to move people toward a new way of thinking and/or acting
about problems that matter.

RHETORICAL SITUATION, EXIGENCE, AND
KAIROS

Kate Mele

Often when we are given an assignment, we are asked to assess our rhetorical
situation: What is my purpose? Who is my audience? What type of text will
achieve my purpose for my audience? What is the social context within which my
text will circulate? But, according to rhetorical theorist Lloyd F. Bitzer, there is no
rhetorical situation without exigence as its source.

   Exigence, simply defined, means that we are pressed to speak or write. There's a
sense of urgency that comes when we experience exigence. For instance, you get
a high grade on an exam you thought you blew, and you want to tell someone.
Your exuberance over the grade becomes a driving force--an exigence--for
contacting your best friend. And thus, your rhetorical situation emerges: your
purpose (to share good news); your audience (your best friend); your document (a
text that conforms to the conventions of text-messaging, including an emoji); the
social context (you and your best friend always share good news with each other
before anyone else). The text message--something we do every day without
thinking--has a source, like a river has a source. The river has to start somewhere
just as the text message had to spring from somewhere. As in the case with this
example of sharing good news with your friend, exigence is at the source of any
rhetorical situation.

   The concept of exigence gets a little more complicated when applied to
professional and public writing. In these settings, we typically feel it is necessary to
speak or write in light of a pressing business or social problem. For example, the
coronavirus pandemic: a problem of public health, economics, policy and politics.
Many people have had their say about these problems. Politicians have weighed in
on policy; scientists and healthcare workers on the medical side; economists and
CEOs on the financial ramifications; food activists on the precarity of our
agriculture and meat industries; religious leaders on freedom to worship; and
citizens on civic rights, social inequalities, and changes to our daily lives. All these
382 | RHETORICAL SITUATION, EXIGENCE, AND KAIROS

various responses are both powerful and difficult to evaluate because of the
emotions impacting so many of us during the crisis. But our varied emotional
reactions to the pandemic do not qualify as exigence. While exigence is
emotionally and intellectually visceral, it arises from discourse, in other words, from
a conversation about a specific aspect of a problem. So what's the difference
between having a reaction to a circumstance and experiencing the exigence to
speak or write? How do we find our exigence?

   Discovering exigence is similar to narrowing a subject to a topic. Management
may be your subject, but if your professor assigned you a paper in a Management
course and said write about anything, your paper wouldn't be about
management. You would to narrow the subject, say, to arts management or sports
management--but even that would be too broad because many people have
already written on these areas of your major. Once you start reading what they've
said about the type of management you're interested in, your ideas begin to click.
That clicking is your exigence bubbling up. Writer A has said this, and Writer B has
said that, but neither of them has addressed the ideas clicking in your
imagination. You see a gap in the discussion that you can fill. The recognition of
this gap is your exigence. Your topic, by necessity, fills the gap: it satisfies your
exigence. From that point on, you can assess your rhetorical situation.

   It may be hard to imagine having our own exigence because typically our
instructors have already set some parameters--a topic, a purpose, an audience.
But, as I've just explained, our inquiry will lead us to find what we can contribute to
the problem at hand. By reading what others have said, we might see there is
something missing in the way they have described the problem, or we see a
misstep in their reasoning, or their evidence doesn't hold up that well. It's likely we
will see a gap we feel the need to fill. Maybe we have an alternative solution.
Maybe we think the problem should be reframed. Maybe the record needs to be
set straight. These types of speculations can help us pin down our exigence.

   When discovering our exigence, we also have to consider the element of
timeliness, or kairos. In addition to paying attention to a gap that urgently needs
to be filled in the discourse surrounding a problem, we must ask ourselves about
the window of opportunity to write or speak now. Let's go back to the coronavirus
pandemic to see how exigence and kairos work together to bring forth a rhetorical
situation.

   At the beginning of the pandemic, many companies immediately reshaped their
messaging: as a result of an urgency (exigence) and timeliness (kairos), they
assured us that doing business with them was safe. Amazon, for example, didn't
                                                                                           RHETORICAL SITUATION, EXIGENCE, AND KAIROS | 383

have to think about their customers' health before, but now they do. In effect,
there was a gap in their messaging (their discourse) that needed to be filled. It's
evident that someone in the organization asked how the public could be sure all
those packages arriving on doorsteps would not spread the virus. Someone
evidently replied, "A television ad." And we've seen it: A well-timed campaign that
shows workers in masks preparing orders at safe, social distances and a Prime
airline pilot standing near her plane as boxes of masks designated for the workers
are being loaded. Those in the Amazon organization responsible for that
messaging performed a quintessential rhetorical act. They recognized that the
company's exigence was compounded by the need for right timing, and from
there made choices based on the emergent rhetorical situation: purpose (to assure
customers that the warehouses are virus-free); audience (an anxious public under
stay-at-home orders); text (a television ad including assuring visuals); social context
(televisions kept on 24/7 as the public waits out the pandemic). Amazon could
have created a different ad, but this one addressed both a business and social
problem that mattered--keeping the company productive, keeping people in their
jobs, keeping the public as safe as possible.

   These are the very steps you are likely to take as writers in your professional lives
and serving the needs of the public. To reiterate, when you locate what you believe
to be urgent for the given time, you have a rhetorical situation: you can refine your
purpose, figure out who your argument impacts the most, and decide on the best
type of text to reach readers who have the power to make the change you seek
and under what conditions. Think of it this way: exigence and kairos are the fuel
that drives our rhetorical choices forward.

WRITING FROM START TO FINISH

   Robin Jeffrey

Types of Writing

There are four main types of writing: expository, descriptive, persuasive, and
narrative. Each of these writing styles is used for a specific purpose. A single text
may include more than one writing style.

Expository

Expository writing is one of the most common types of writing. When an author
writes in an expository style, all they are trying to do is explain a concept, imparting
information from themselves to a wider audience. Expository writing does not
include the author's opinions, but focuses on accepted facts about a topic,
including statistics or other evidence.

Examples of Expository Writing

   · Textbooks
   · How-to articles
   · Recipes
   · News stories (not editorials or Op-Eds)
   · Business, technical, or scientific writing

Descriptive

Descriptive writing is often found in fiction, though it can make an appearance in
nonfiction as well (for example, memoirs, first-hand accounts of events, or travel
guides). When an author writes in a descriptive style, they are painting a picture
in words of a person, place, or thing for their audience. The author might employ
                                                                                                                 WRITING FROM START TO FINISH | 385

metaphor or other literary devices in order to describe the author's impressions via
their five senses (what they hear, see, smell, taste, or touch). But the author is not
trying to convince the audience of anything or explain the scene - merely describe
things as they are.

Examples of Descriptive Writing

   · Poetry
   · Journal/diary writing
   · Descriptions of Nature
   · Fictional novels or plays

Persuasive

Persuasive writing is the main style of writing you will use in academic papers.
When an author writes in a persuasive style, they are trying to convince the
audience of a position or belief. Persuasive writing contains the author's opinions
and biases, as well as justifications and reasons given by the author as evidence
of the correctness of their position. Any "argumentative" essay you write in school
should be in the persuasive style of writing.

Examples of Persuasive Writing

   · Cover letters
   · Op-Eds and Editorial newspaper articles
   · Reviews of items
   · Letters of complaint
   · Advertisements
   · Letters of recommendation

Narrative

Narrative writing is used in almost every longer piece of writing, whether fiction
or nonfiction. When an author writes in a narrative style, they are not just trying
to impart information, they are trying to construct and communicate a story,
complete with characters, conflict, and settings.
386 | WRITING FROM START TO FINISH

Examples of Narrative Writing

   · Oral histories
   · Novels/Novellas
   · Poetry (especially epic sagas or poems)
   · Short Stories
   · Anecdotes

Understanding the Assignment

There are four kinds of analysis you need to do in order to fully understand an
assignment: determining the purpose of the assignment, understanding how to
answer an assignment's questions, recognizing implied questions in the
assignment, and recognizing the disciplinary expectations of the assignment.

   Always make sure you fully understand an assignment before you start writing!

Determining the Purpose

The wording of an assignment should suggest its purpose. Any of the following
might be expected of you in a college writing assignment:

   · Summarizing information
   · Analyzing ideas and concepts
   · Taking a position and defending it
   · Combining ideas from several sources and creating your own original

      argument.

Understanding How to Answer the Assignment

College writing assignments will ask you to answer a how or why question -
questions that can't be answered with just facts. For example, the question "What
are the names of the presidents of the US in the last twenty years?" needs only a
list of facts to be answered. The question "Who was the best president of the last
twenty years and why?" requires you to take a position and support that position
with evidence.

   Sometimes, a list of prompts may appear with an assignment. Remember, your
                                                                                                                 WRITING FROM START TO FINISH | 387

instructor will not expect you to answer all of the questions listed. They are simply
offering you some ideas so that you can think of your own questions to ask.

Recognizing Implied Questions

A prompt may not include a clear `how' or `why' question, though one is always
implied by the language of the prompt. For example:

   "Discuss the effects of the No Child Left Behind Act on special education
programs" is asking you to write how the act has affected special education
programs.

   "Consider the recent rise of autism diagnoses" is asking you to write why the
diagnoses of autism are on the rise.

Recognizing Disciplinary Expectations

Depending on the discipline in which you are writing, different features and formats
of your writing may be expected. Always look closely at key terms and vocabulary
in the writing assignment, and be sure to note what type of evidence and citations
style your instructor expects.

Test Your Thesis

You've come up with what you hope will be a great thesis for your paper. Want to
make sure before you get started with it? Ask yourself the following questions:

  1. Does your thesis take a position, propose a solution, or answer a question?
 2. Does your thesis give you enough material to write a full-length paper?
 3. Can you come up with interpretations of your thesis that don't match your

      own?
 4. Is there evidence to support your thesis?
 5. Will readers want to read an essay with this thesis?

If the answer to any of these questions is `no,' you need to revise your thesis.
388 | WRITING FROM START TO FINISH

Assessing the Writing Situation

Before beginning the writing process, always establish the following:

   · Is there an assigned topic or are you free to choose your own?
   · What about your subject interests you?
   · Why is your subject worth reading about?
   · Double check that your subject is not too broad - narrow it down if necessary.
   · Determine the purpose of the work.
   · Determine the readers of the work and their level of knowledge about the

      topic.
   · Determine where your evidence will come from.
   · Decide what kind of evidence would best serve your argument.
   · Identify the required style (MLA, APA, etc.) of the paper.
   · Be aware of length specifications.
   · Consider if visuals might be helpful in your paper.
   · Will someone be reviewing drafts of your paper? Who?
   · Note your deadline and how much time you have for each stage of the writing

      process.

Checklist: Planning a Document

Determine your document's purpose.

   · Plan your document's design to support this purpose.
   · Identify your document's audience.
   · Identify your audience's expectations.
   · Decide what format your document will require (include layout, margins, line

      spacing, font styles, etc.).
   · Decide whether or not visuals will be helpful to include in your document. If

      you decide to use visuals, determine what kind of visual would be most useful.

Constructing an Outline

  1. Put the thesis at the top.
        1. Make items at the same level have the same grammar/tenses.
       2. Use full sentences when possible.
              1. Use the conventional system of numbering (such as the one being
390 | WRITING FROM START TO FINISH

                  demonstrated now).
             2. Always include at least two items per level.

                    1. Use as few major sections (I., II., III., etc.) as possible.
                   2. If the list gets too long, try clustering the items into broader

                        categories with more subcategories.

UNIT 1: ON STUDENTS CHOOSING
DISCOURSE COMMUNITIES

   Collette Bliss

Most of Unit 1 is pretty straightforward. If you're unfamiliar with the concept of
discourse communities, reading the chapters should help you out, but you may
want to do your own research since it is a core concept for this course.

   That being said, you have a few choices with regard to what if any rules you want
to create around which communities students can choose.

   · Can students choose to analyze a discourse community that they themselves
      are a part of?
          Pro: it allows them to think about their communities in a new way, and will
            likely make it easier for them to be invested in the project.
          Con: they will likely struggle with unconscious bias, and students in
            vulnerable communities may be uncomfortable with personal inquiry.

   · Can students choose to analyze a discourse community that is marginalized?
          Pro: it will help them to understand these communities better and learn to
            advocate for them
          Con: it will likely lead to some polarizing class discussions, which can be
            useful and informative, but also have the potential to be harmful.

The Advanced Composition Curriculum does not have a policy one way or the other,
so you should decide your policy at the beginning of the semester and stick to it.

UNIT 2: ON CHAPTER LENGTHS AND
MULTIMODAL EXPECTATIONS

Collette Bliss

The chapters in Unit 2 are substantially longer, more conceptual, and more complex
than the ones utilized in Unit 1. We highly recommend that you look through these
chapters ahead of time and decide which portions to prioritize and which to leave
out based on what you will focus on during class time. If there is a subject you don't
intend to discuss in class or use in the assignments, you may choose not to make
your students read that portion of the chapter. Just be intentional and consistent.

   We have it set that your students will be required to make an infographic in Unit
2. We believe this is a pretty straightforward and relatively accessible multimodal
project, and works for most students across the board. That being said, you may
want to give your students a bit more freedom as to what type of digital media they
create. Or you may have a particular software you find useful that you want to share.
You are welcome to expand the options beyond infographic as long as you:

   · Require digital, visual, and multimodal projects. So they can't write a speech or
      something like that. You should create strict boundaries around this.

   · Remain consistent with your expectations across all student projects. The
      more choice you give them regarding design, the more difficult it will be to
      assess quality comparatively.

   · Are prepared to assist students in working with whatever multimodal formats
      you give them permission to design. If you are not comfortable with design
      technology, we recommend sticking to infographics and the like.

As with any of these choices, setting standards at the beginning and being
consistent with them is the priority.

UNIT 3: ON CREATIVE EXERCISES IN
STORYTELLING

   Ashleigh Severson

The chapters in Unit 3 are focused on narrative writing and how to tell a compelling
story. While the chapters contain a variety of suggested exercises, we encourage
you to tailor these activities to the unique needs and interests of your students.
Your understanding of their strengths, challenges, and diverse backgrounds will be
invaluable in selecting and designing exercises that will most effectively support
their learning and engagement with material.

   Since this unit emphasizes storytelling, it opens the door to exploring a wide
range of genres and activities. This flexibility allows you to create a dynamic and
inclusive learning environment that caters to different tastes and preferences. Here
are some strategies and activities you might consider:

          Reading and Analyzing Personal Essays: Select a variety of personal essays
            and creative nonfiction pieces for your students to read. This will help
            them understand different narrative techniques and styles. Discuss how
            these writers use voice, perspective, and detail to bring their stories to life.

          Creative Nonfiction: Assign readings from various creative nonfiction
            genres, such as travel writing and personal essay. Ask students to write
            their own pieces in these styles, blending factual information with creative
            storytelling techniques.

          Digital Narratives: Integrate technology by having students create digital
            stories using tools like blogs and social media posts. This can be
            particularly engaging for students interested in multimedia production
            and can add a modern twist to traditional narrative assignments.

          Visual Storytelling: Incorporate visual elements by having students create
            storyboards, graphic narratives, or photo essays. This activity can appeal to
            visual learners and those interested in design and visual arts.

By diversifying activities and genres explored in this unit, you can cater to a wide
rage of interests and skill levels, making narrative writing a more inclusive and
engaging experience for all students. Remember, the goal is to give students the
                                                                                        UNIT 3: ON CREATIVE EXERCISES IN STORYTELLING | 395

tools and confidence to tell their stories in their own voice. We encourage you to
support students through experimental writing as they take risks and begin to find
joy in the creative process.
396 | UNIT 4: ON PRESENTING ARGUMENTS

UNIT 4: ON PRESENTING ARGUMENTS

   Ashleigh Severson

The chapters in Unit 4 are filled with information on argumentation and writing
persuasive essays, that can get somewhat dry for students to engage with long
term, especially those who have strong interests in creative writing and viual arts.

   For the second part of the coordinating assignment in Unit 4, students must
create a brief PowerPoint presentation about their argument in the essay from
Part I. This is where students will apply both creativity and speaking skills to this
assignment.

   Suggestions to enhance student presentations:

   · Designing Effective Slides: Teach students the basics of creating clear and
      engaging PowerPoint slides. Emphasize the importance of visual aids, concise
      text (slide word count), and speaker's notes. Provide examples of successful
      and ineffective slides to illustrate key points.

   · Oral Presentation Techniques: Conduct a mini-workshop on public speaking
      and presentation skills. Topics can include maintaining eye contact, using body
      language, managing speaking anxiety, and how to effectively use speaker's
      notes.

   · Integrating Visual and Oral Components: There are many resources online to
      aid in the creativity and impressiveness of student PowerPoint presentations,
      don't be afraid to share these resources with students and instruct on how to
      use them, if interested. Then, guide students in translating their written
      arguments into a visual format. This involves selecting key points to highlight
      in their slides and practicing how to verbally elaborate on these points while
      presenting.

By integrating these strategies and activities, you can create a comprehensive
and engaging unit that helps students master the art of argumentation. The
combination of writing and presenting their arguments will not only enhance their
persuasive writing skills but also prepare them for effective communication in
various contexts. Encourage students to be critical thinkers, confident speakers,
                                                                                                          UNIT 4: ON PRESENTING ARGUMENTS | 397

and persuasive writers, ready to tackle argumentative writing with clarity and
conviction.
