Introduction

Welcome to the second edition of Oral Communication for Non-native Speakers of English!
This book is an essential instructional tool for developing oral communication skills in academic
settings, specifically designed for international graduate students, teaching assistants, postdoctoral
researchers, and those preparing to enter academia. The second edition introduces dedicated
chapters on developing listening, speaking, and pronunciation.
The book has been constructed to be either a self-paced instructional tool for learners or classroom
material for speaking or pronunciation courses.
The practice activities reinforce chapter content through real-world application and relatable
situations. Each skill's description is complemented with relatable scenarios, discussion prompts,
and interactive online activities. Through this approach, learners can actively develop the skills
needed for success in English-speaking academic environments.
As classroom material, we have two additional sections per skill: Teacher's Corner and Additional
Practice. The Teacher's Corner provides important considerations for skill development, helpful tips,
resources, and additional ideas for activities for teachers. The Additional Practice provides extended
activities (e.g., homework, additional in-class activities) meant to be paired with classroom practice.

                    PART I.
      FUNDAMENTALS

                 OF ORAL
     COMMUNICATION

Effective communication begins with developing both listening and speaking skills. When we
communicate, our ability to understand others and express ourselves clearly determines how
successfully we connect with those around us and get our message across.
Part I of this book focuses on oral communication fundamentals, covering two essential chapters:
listening and speaking. These interconnected skills have been organized to help ESL/EFL learners
develop their ability to comprehend spoken English and communicate their thoughts with
confidence and clarity.

Chapter 1. Listening
Listening: Overview

In this chapter, we will explore the world of listening skills for ESL/EFL learners. This chapter starts
with a scenario describing a listening issue to encourage you to think and discuss before diving into
the topic. We will explore strategies to become active listeners, learn how to receive and interpret
the information we need, respond and take turns in conversations, and boost your overall English
comprehension.

Scenario A: Lost in Conversation

      Scenario Spotlight

     Moises is often accused of not listening. He disagrees. When others speak to him, he always
     makes a point of letting them talk and doesn't speak himself. Still, he admits there was a
     time recently when he went to meet his friends for coffee and discovered everyone else had
     gone to a different coffee house. He realizes his romantic partner gets annoyed with him
     because he doesn't remember things she has told him that she says are important. Despite
     these experiences, Moises feels he is a good listener and thinks the mix-ups and the
     misunderstandings lie with others.

      1-1 Discussion

Instructions: Read Scenario A, think, and discuss with your classmates.
  · What issues has Moises had?

3 | LISTENING: OVERVIEW
  · Why do you think this is happening?

  · What are some possible explanations about his behavior?

  · Moises believes he's a good listener because he lets others talk without interruption. Do you
      think simply staying silent equates to good listening? Why or why not?

  · What strategies could Moises implement to become a more effective listener?

Listening as Communication

Listening is a complex, active process of hearing, attending (paying attention), receiving, interpreting,
and responding. Communication is a two-way street where two people are engaged in conversation;
one person is speaking, and the other one is listening. This collaborative process is essential
for successful communication in any situation. In Scenario A, was Moises hearing but not really
listening? Let's take a closer look at each of the components of effective listening:

  · Hearing is a physical process that requires the parts of the ear to function correctly for an
      individual to receive auditory stimulation.

  · Focusing or Paying Attention is the decision to focus on one source of sound, for example:
         focusing on the person you are with and tuning out all the chatter of people around you.
         paying attention to the background music rather than the person sitting next to you;
         eavesdropping on the couple at the next restaurant table rather than the group you are
            seated with;

  · Receiving is the process of acquiring information the speaker is disclosing to you. Receiving
      includes not only the speaker's words, but also nonverbal actions:
         the sound of the person's voice,
         their facial expressions,
         whether the individual is making eye contact.

  · Interpreting is the crucial task of decoding the message. It requires the listener to give
      meaning to the verbal and nonverbal symbols used by the speaker. This involves paying close
      attention to all the information received and piecing it together to grasp the intended message.
      Sometimes, additional information might be necessary to crack the code. This is where asking
      clarifying questions or paraphrasing what you heard in your own words comes in handy. These
      strategies ensure you have accurately interpreted the speaker's message.

  · Responding is the listener's reaction to the speaker's message. The response is important for
      two reasons:

                                                                                                                              LISTENING: OVERVIEW | 4
         it allows the listener to check the accuracy of their interpretation of the speaker's
            message (verbal and nonverbal);

         it allows the speaker to clarify or expand upon the message if there's been a
            misunderstanding.

    Scenario Resolution

      In Scenario A, it seems that Moises was hearing other people's speech as he stated that he
      kept quiet, and he was "letting them talk". But have you ever zoned out when someone was
      talking? Or felt that you could hear them, but could not understand a word they were
      saying? This is likely due to Moises not being focused on the speaker's message, for
      example, when he went to meet his friends in a different coffee house, he might not have
      paid close attention to the specific information that he needed (i.e., name of the coffee
      house) and he just focused, perhaps, on the meeting time. As English learners, we need to
      focus on listening to the main message or specific information that we want to understand
      from the speaker. For example, if you are an International Teaching Assistant (ITA), and you
      are talking to your student who needs your help with solving a certain issue, you need to
      focus on understanding what specifically they need your help with.
      Moises also stated that his romantic partner gets annoyed with him because he does not
      remember things she said were important. Besides focusing on the message, you also
      need to receive the message and interpret the speaker's nonverbal signals. Notice, is the
      speaker trying to emphasize something by using different intonation or body language?
      Does their voice sound excited when they are sharing something? All of this plays an
      important role in the process of listening. As an English learner, for example, when talking
      to your supervisor, you need to make sure you are paying attention to the parts they are
      trying to emphasize. It is also advisable to use clarifying questions or paraphrasing to
      ensure you understood the message correctly. The next section will provide activities to
      help you improve your listening comprehension by working on each of the above-described
      areas.

Glossary

     · Active listeners: learners who go beyond simply hearing the speaker. They focus,
        engage, and try to understand the meaning by asking questions and showing they
        are following along.

Effective Listening
Strategies

 Chapter Outline

          · Listening to Pay Attention: Focusing on the Speaker
          · Listening to Receive: Receiving as a Nonverbal Process
          · Listening to Interpret: Checking Understanding
          · Listening to Respond: Being Engaged

Listening is an integral part of developing oral communication skills. To be able to communicate
successfully, we first need to learn how to understand the other speakers. Developing strong
listening strategies allows us to accurately understand the speaker's message, respond thoughtfully,
and build stronger relationships. Using these strategies can help us actively participate in
conversations, avoid misunderstandings, and learn from others (e.g., understand important lectures
or conference presentations).
In this section, we will help you develop effective listening strategies through various group and
individual activities. The group activities can be used with a large or small group of learners while
the individual activities can be used for individual, self-directed learning or as homework activities.

Strategy     Description

Takes Notes  Marks down notes while listening

     1-5 Discussion

Instructions: Read the prompts and discuss them with your classmates. If working alone, answer the
questions in the form of an audio/video journal.

  · Discuss how some nonverbal cues might be considered universal (e.g., a smile expressing
      happiness), while others can vary greatly depending on culture (e.g., eye contact, personal
      space).

  · Explore how some nonverbal cues are intentional and used strategically (e.g., a handshake),
      while others are unconscious and can reveal hidden emotions (e.g., fidgeting).

  · Discuss situations where nonverbal communication might contradict verbal messages. How
      do we determine the true meaning in such cases?

  · Discuss the importance of effective nonverbal communication in professional settings (e.g.,
      job interviews, presentations, meetings).

  · Explore how nonverbal cues can enhance or hinder communication in personal relationships.
  · Analyze the challenges and opportunities of nonverbal communication when interacting with

      people from different cultures

Listening to Interpret: Checking Understanding

     1-6 Summarize the language

Instructions: Listen to a video twice. For the first round, listen actively and try to internalize as much
as you can. Feel free to stop it and replay certain parts if you had trouble hearing what was said. On
the second round, do your best to take notes on key themes and ideas.

                                                                                                          EFFECTIVE LISTENING STRATEGIES | 10

      oralcommunication2e/?p=332#oembed-3

      1-7 Paraphrasing & asking questions in active listening

Instructions: Listen to the video about using Artificial Intelligence in teaching and research or listen
to an academic talk relevant to your research. After each slide or paragraph, imagine yourself in a
conversation with the speaker by pausing to summarize (i.e., paraphrase) what the speaker has said
as well as to ask clarification questions on anything you don't (yet) understand.
Here are some helpful phrases to include:

  · You mean that... You're saying that ...What you're saying is ....
  · If I understand correctly... If I'm understanding you correctly...
  · If I'm hearing you correctly...
Do this activity for 10-15 minutes every day until you can also paraphrase well in live conversation.
(You will probably be surprised at how quickly this happens!)

         1-8 Paraphrasing Practice

Instructions: Looking at your notes from activity 1-7, summarize the key themes and ideas from
the video lecture. Record your answer, then listen to your speech, and reflect on your response by
responding to the questions below:

  · Did I capture the main points of the video lecture in my summary?

11 | EFFECTIVE LISTENING STRATEGIES
  · Would my summary be helpful to someone who hadn't watched the video?
  · Did I use clear and concise language in my summary?
  · What are my strengths in paraphrasing and summarizing information?
  · What areas can I improve on when actively listening and summarizing lectures?

Once done with the bullet points above, swap recordings with a partner and listen to each other's
summaries. Compare what your partner included/excluded with what you did in your own summary.
Give feedback to your partner.

Scenario B: International Teaching Assistant

      Scenario Spotlight

     This is Ester's first year in the USA. She is a PhD student in the Agronomy department, and as
     part of her assistantship, she is teaching an undergraduate course in her department. While
     her TOEFL scores were high, and she was confident about her English language skills while
     she was in her country, she sometimes struggles to understand her students when they are
     asking questions. She asks them to repeat, and when the students pronounce the words
     more slowly, she sometimes manages to understand them. She feels like they talk too fast
     and that's the only issue that is causing the miscommunication.

      1-13 Discussion

Instructions: Read Scenario B carefully. Think about the situation and discuss it with your
classmates following the discussion prompts. If working alone, answer the questions in the form of
an audio/video journal.

  · What issues has Ester had?
  · Why do you think this is happening?
  · What are some possible explanations about her students' behavior?
  · Ester believes that the issue lies with her students' fast speech. Do you think this is the main

      issue? Why or why not?
  · What strategies could Ester implement to become a more effective listener?

Using AI Tools for Listening Activities

How can AI help you create or adapt listening materials for your students? More specifically, in this
section we will talk about the free version of Google's Gemini which has access to the internet.
When you open Gemini, you can enter a prompt to explain how the AI can help you. Here are some
suggestions:

Finding Listening Materials

To ask Gemini to help you find listening materials, you need to provide a detailed prompt that will
help the AI locate these types of materials on the web. The section below provides suggestions for
successful AI prompting.

17 | TEACHER'S CORNER
      AI Prompting

     When drafting your prompt, think about including the following:

          · Target Level: What is the proficiency level of your students (beginner, intermediate,
             advanced)?

          · Topic: Is there a specific topic or theme you'd like the listening material to focus on?
             (e.g., science, current events, daily life conversations)

          · Listening Activity Type: Do you have a preferred type of listening activity in mind
             (e.g., gap-filling exercise, true/false questions, summarizing, finding specific
             information)?

          · Format: Would you prefer audio or video materials?
          · Desired Length: Is there a preferred length for the listening material (short clip, full

             lecture, etc.)?
          · Goal: What is the goal of your lecture (e.g., to improve active listening strategies, to

             improve summarizing skills)?
          · Accent/dialect: Do you want to focus on American, British, Canadian English, or

             another accent?

     Example prompt:
     "Help me find intermediate ESL listening materials about environmental issues. I need 3-5
     minute audio clips with American English speakers [that include comprehension questions].
     The materials should help students practice identifying main ideas and supporting details.
     Include sources that are freely accessible online."

Brainstorming and Creating Listening Activities

Gemini can help you brainstorm ways to include different listening formats to keep your exercises
engaging. This could include short audio clips, YouTube videos, longer lectures, interviews,
dialogues, or even songs. Simply describe your context to Gemini following the prompt suggestion
above and ask for help with brainstorming creative ideas.

Example prompt:

"I need creative listening activities for my intermediate English class of graduate students focusing on
negotiation skills. Students struggle with understanding different accents and processing information
quickly. Please suggest 5 diverse listening formats (audio clips, videos, etc.) and accompanying
activities that practice note-taking, identifying key points, and recognizing tone."

Chapter 2. Speaking
Speaking: Overview

In this chapter, we will explore the development of speaking skills for ESL/EFL learners. This chapter
starts with a scenario illustrating common struggles that language learners face when acquiring
speaking proficiency to help you think and reflect on your own experiences. We will examine the
building blocks that make up strong speaking skills and learn how to speak effortlessly and correctly,
organize your ideas, expand your vocabulary and sentence structure, and adjust the language
according to the listeners.

Scenario C: Finding the Words

      Scenario Spotlight

     Isabella frequently has issues communicating her ideas to her friends and colleagues. A
     recent example of this is when she had to give a presentation at work, and her colleagues
     seemed confused by what she was saying. When she speaks, Isabella always makes a point
     of using a lot of details and explaining her thoughts thoroughly. She realizes that this causes
     her to often pause as she searches for the right words and complex phrases that she uses in
     her writing. However, Isabella believes the extra details and thoroughness should make her
     message clearer for people to understand despite the pauses, and she struggles to
     understand what the issues are.

      2-1 Discussion

Instructions: Read Scenario C, think, and discuss with your classmates.

21 | SPEAKING: OVERVIEW
  · What issues has Isabella had?

  · Why do you think this is happening?

  · What are some possible explanations for her confusion?

  · Isabella believes that using complex academic phrases will improve her speech and she will
      sound more professional. Do you agree or disagree? Why?

  · What strategies could Isabella use to become a better speaker?

Understanding Speaking Proficiency

Speaking proficiency in a second language involves the ability to communicate effectively and
effortlessly in various situations. This proficiency can be analyzed through different aspects. One of
the most comprehensive models is Skehan's CAF model, which breaks down language proficiency
into three key components: Fluency, Accuracy, and Complexity.

Fluency is the ability to speak smoothly for a period of time, without excessive pauses, hesitations,
or repetitions. However, it is important to note that being fluent is not the same as being fast, nor
does it involve the elimination of all pauses. In fact, well-placed pauses are essential for clarity. One
key aspect of fluency is the use of thought groups, units of meaning separated by natural pauses.
For example, "I like to eat apples / but not bananas / because they are too sweet." The appropriate
insertion of these pauses helps listeners follow the grammatical structure of what is being said, thus
contributing to the natural flow and enhancing comprehension. Finally, fluency also depends on the
ability to organize thoughts effectively and easily express ideas, allowing for smooth and coherent
communication.

Accuracy is the ability to use correct and appropriate components of language, such as grammar
and pronunciation, to convey meaning. In terms of grammar, accuracy involves using proper
sentence structures, verb tenses, and word choices to avoid confusion or misinterpretation.
Pronunciation encompasses both segmentals (individual speech sounds) and suprasegmentals
(stress, prominence, intonation), which are crucial for clear and effective communication. Using
accurate language allows the listeners to correctly receive, interpret, and understand the message.

Complexity refers to the use of diverse vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structures appropriately
for different contexts. In professional and academic settings, using a variety of sentence structures,
transitions, and precise vocabulary enhances clarity and sophistication. However, learners who are
primarily exposed to complex academic language may struggle to adapt their speech for casual
conversations with friends and colleagues. Effective communication requires adjusting language
complexity based on the listener and the context, ensuring both clarity and engagement.

                                                                                                                             SPEAKING: OVERVIEW | 22
      Scenario Resolution
      In Scenario C, Isabella seems to be struggling with fluency and complexity. She says that
      she pauses often, searching for the right words and complex phrases that she uses in her
      writing. This results in slow and interrupted speech, making it difficult for listeners to follow
      her ideas. One contributing factor is her struggle with complexity. Isabella might be
      unaware or struggling to accept that academic writing and academic speech are different
      English registers with their own unique forms of complexity. Furthermore, Isabella might
      also have accepted the myth that equates sounding sophisticated and erudite with using
      unnecessarily complicated speech and superfluous details when instead it is often done by
      speaking simply and succinctly. To improve, her language should be adapted to the
      audience, organized logically, and flow naturally with effective transitions.

 Chapter Outline

          · Developing Fluency
          · Improving Accuracy
          · Language Complexity

Speaking is the essence of the language. This skill must be well developed to have a successful
conversation and communicate the message to the listeners. There are various strategies that can
be used to improve a person's fluency, accuracy, and complexity.
In this section, we will explore these strategies through various group and individual activities.
We will work on fluency building, improving accuracy, organizing your thoughts, developing varied
language structures, shaping your language according to the listeners, and expanding your
vocabulary. The group activities can be used with a large or small group of learners while the
individual activities can be used for individual, self-directed learning or as homework activities.

Developing Fluency

Building Natural Fluency

Fluency develops through consistent practice and refinement. This section focuses on structured
activities that help speakers refine their message, practice speaking in engaging contexts, and
analyze effective speech patterns to build natural fluency in communication.

Answer key and transcript:
The human voice: // It's the instrument we all play. // It's the most powerful sound in the
world, / probably.// It's the only one that can start a war / or say / "I love you." // And yet /
many people have the experience that when they speak, / people don't listen to them. //
And why is that? / How can we speak powerfully / to make change / in the world? //
00:24
What I'd like to suggest, / there are a number of habits that we need to move away from.//
I've assembled for your / pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. / I'm not pretending
this is an exhaustive list, / but / these seven, I think, are pretty large / habits that we can all
fall into. /
00:40
First, // gossip. // Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. // Not a nice habit, / and we
know perfectly well the person gossiping, / five minutes later, / will be gossiping / about us.
//
00:53
Second, / judging. // We know people who / are like this in conversation, / and it's very hard
to listen to somebody / if / you know that you're being judged / and found wanting / at the
same time. //
01:03
Third, negativity. // You can fall into this. / My mother, / in the last years of her life, /
became very very negative, / and it's hard to listen. // I remember one day, / I said to her, //
"It's October 1 today," and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?" //
01:16

         (Laughter)
01:18
It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. //
01:21

         (Laughter)
It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. //
01:22
And another form of negativity, / complaining. // Well, this is the national / art of the U.K. //
It's our national sport. / We complain about the weather, / about sport, / about politics, /

                                                                                                    EFFECTIVE SPEAKING STRATEGIES | 28
      about everything, / but actually, / complaining is viral misery. // It's not spreading sunshine
      and lightness in the world. //
      01:39
      Excuses. //
      01:41
      We've all / met this guy. Maybe / we've all been this guy. / Some people / have a
      blamethrower. // They just / pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for
      their actions, /and again, / hard to listen to somebody who is being like that. //
      01:54
      Penultimate, / the sixth of the seven, // embroidery, // exaggeration. // It demeans our
      language, actually, sometimes. / For example, if I see something that really is awesome, /
      what do I call it? //
      02:06
      (Laughter)
      02:09
      And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying, / out and out lying, / and we don't
      want to listen to people we know are lying to us. //
      02:15
      And finally, // dogmatism. // The confusion of facts / with opinions. / When those two
      things get conflated, / you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding
      you with their opinions as if they were true. / It's difficult to listen / to that. //
      02:32
      So here they are, // seven // deadly sins of speaking. / These are things / I think / we need
      to avoid. // But is there a positive / way to think about this? // Yes, there is. // I'd like to
      suggest that there are four really powerful / cornerstones, foundations, / that we can stand
      on / if we want our speech / to be powerful / and to make change in the world. //
      Fortunately, these things spell a word. // The word is "hail," / and it has a great definition /
      as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. //
      I'm talking about this definition, to / greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think
      our words will be received // if we stand on these four things.
      03:10 (There is not a pause here.)
      So what do they stand for? // See if you can guess. // The H, // honesty, / of course, / being
      true in what you say, being straight and clear. / The A is authenticity, / just / being yourself.

29 | EFFECTIVE SPEAKING STRATEGIES
/ A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, / which I think is a lovely way
to put it. / The I is integrity, / being your word, actually doing what you say, / and being
somebody people can trust. // And the L // is love. // I don't mean romantic love, // but I do
mean wishing people well, // for two reasons. First of all, I think / absolute honesty may not
be what we want. I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. // Hmm. Perhaps //
that's not necessary. // Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. / But also, /
if you're really wishing somebody well, / it's very hard to judge them at the same time. // I'm
not even sure you can do those two things / simultaneously. // So hail. //

04:08

Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song, it is what you say, it's also / the way
that you say it. // You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, / and yet this
is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. / I'd like to have a little rummage in
there / with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play
with, / which will increase the power of your speaking. //

04:29

Register, for example. / Now, falsetto register may not be very useful / most of the time, /
but / there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of
you who are voice coaches. / You can locate your voice, however. / So if I talk up here in my
nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where / most of
us speak from most of the time. // But / if you want weight, / you need to go down here to
the chest. / You hear the difference? // We vote for politicians // with lower voices, // it's
true, // because we associate depth // with power // and with authority. // That's register. //

05:07

Then we have timbre. // It's the / the way your voice feels. / Again, the research shows that
we prefer voices which are rich, / smooth, / warm, / like hot chocolate. // Well if that's not
you, // that's not the end of the world, / because you can train. // Go get a voice coach. //
And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, / and with exercises
/ to improve the timbre of your voice. //

05:30

Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language / that we use in
order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning / in conversation. / People who speak all
on one / note are really quite hard to listen to / if they don't have any prosody at all. / That's
where the word / "monotonic" / comes from, or monotonous, monotone. // Also, we have /

Organizing Your Thoughts

One key to fluency is the ability to think and organize speech in real time, whether responding
spontaneously or delivering a structured message. Even when the speaker is using their native
language, in order to sound fluent and easy to understand, it's important for the speaker to be able
to structure their ideas quickly and logically. This section focuses on developing fluency through
the ability to organize ideas quickly, practice through engaging conversation topics, and structure
concise yet impactful speech.

      Thinking on Your Feet: Impromptu Speaking

     Impromptu speaking involves delivering a speech without prior preparation. The MEET
     Acronym is an effective approach that allows the speaker to organize and present their
     ideas in a manner that is easy to follow.

          · Main Idea
          · Example/Explanation
          · Example/Explanation
          · Takeaway
     This method helps structure thoughts quickly, ensuring clear and engaging communication.

           2-6 Impromptu Speaking Activity

Instructions: Read the questions and discuss them with your classmates. If working alone, answer
the questions in the form of an audio/video journal.
The table below provides several ideas for prompts on general topics that you can use to practice
impromptu speaking focused on developing certain language functions. Language functions are
the purposes for using language, such as describing, comparing, or hypothesizing, each requiring
different language skills and structures.

Being Concise and Impactful

In academic and professional settings, delivering a clear and compelling message in a short amount
of time is a valuable skill. Whether introducing yourself, summarizing research, or making a strong
first impression, brevity and precision matter. This section explores how to further improve your
fluency by communicating key ideas effectively with limited time, focusing on techniques for crafting
concise and impactful elevator pitches.

                                                                                                           EFFECTIVE SPEAKING STRATEGIES | 36
       Elevator Pitches

       An elevator pitch is a concise introduction, ideally under a minute, that explains who you
       are, your expertise, and what you're working on. It should be clear, engaging, and tailored to
       your listeners. Practicing your elevator pitch can help you become a more concise, clear,
       fluent, and confident communicator. Ideally, your elevator pitch answers the following
       questions:2

            · Who are you? Make it personal--tell a story.
            · Why is this research/project important? What problem are you trying to solve?

               Providing this insight at the beginning of an elevator pitch is often referred to as a
               "hook." Think about connecting your message to what they care about. Often you can
               do this by posing a question or stating a problem.
            · What makes your research/project/approach unique? Avoid acronyms or jargon your
               listener may not know or understand. Keep it high-level.
            · What are the short-term or long-term benefits of this research? What happens if you
               succeed? Think of the "so what?" rather than focusing exclusively on the "what" of
               your research."
       If you are struggling to present your speech in 1 minute, using the 2-3 Successive Speaking
       (4/3/2) activity approach can help you become more fluent and concise.

Improving Accuracy

Practicing Pronunciation

Speaking accurately involves using correct pronunciation, grammar, and phrasing to ensure clear
communication. For learners who struggle with pronunciation, focusing on sound clarity, thought
groups, stress, prominence, and intonation can make a significant difference. If pronunciation is
a key challenge, refer to the Pronunciation chapter of this book for detailed explanations of each
concept and practice exercises to improve accuracy and clarity in spoken English. Below, we provide
one example of a general pronunciation-focused activity that can be adapted to focus on different
areas of pronunciation.

      2-9 Pronunciation feedback circles

Instructions: In this activity, you will practice speaking in small groups and receive targeted feedback
on different aspects of pronunciation, as directed by your instructor. The steps for this activity are
outlined below:

 1. Form Small Groups - Work in groups of 3-4.
 2. Choose a Focus - Each round, focus on one aspect of pronunciation (e.g., sounds, word

      stress, prominence, intonation), as explained by your instructor.
 3. Take Turns Speaking - Read a short passage or say a prepared sentence.
 4. Give and Receive Feedback - Group members provide one piece of constructive feedback

      based on the chosen focus.
 5. Try Again - Apply the feedback and repeat the sentence.
 6. Rotate - Rotate roles so each person gets a chance to focus on different aspects of

      pronunciation.

                                                                                                           EFFECTIVE SPEAKING STRATEGIES | 38
      Additional Pronunciation Activities

          · For additional ideas, games, and discussions on the topic of pronunciation, check
             out Marsha Chan's Professional Development blog, which covers tons of speaking &
             pronunciation activities.

Improving Grammar/Phrasing

In terms of grammar and phrasing, learners should focus on structuring sentences correctly, using
appropriate verb tenses, and avoiding common errors like subject-verb agreement mistakes,
expressing plural, omitting, or overusing articles. Students are often unaware of some mistakes
that are impacting their accuracy. Practicing self-monitoring, analyzing your own speech to notice
errors, and engaging in activities that reinforce accurate language use can help. The activity below
describes an activity for awareness raising that can help with this issue.

     2-10 Analyze2Imitate - Grammar

Instructions: The first step in improving your spoken English grammar is to increase your ability to
hear errors as errors. One way you can develop this ability is the following:

 1. Select a short TED talk or podcast from Scientific American's "Science, Quickly" that you find
      interesting.

 2. Under the TED talk video, click the "Read Transcript" button, then copy and paste into a
      Microsoft Word the part of the transcript text you find interesting.

 3. Record yourself reading the transcript aloud (perhaps using your phone, or a tool like the
      Online Voice Recorder from VirtualSpeech) as naturally as possible, pretending you really are
      giving the talk.

 4. Highlight in different colors all potential locations of the grammar error types you find difficult.
      (e.g., Highlight all verbs in your transcript in green if you know you have trouble with verb
      tenses and/or subject/verb agreement. Highlight all plural nouns in your transcript in yellow if
      you tend to say things like "two factor_." Highlight all articles--"a" and "an" and "the"--in orange
      if you know you tend to make article mistakes.)
      Example:
      "Unless we do something to prevent it, over the next 40 years we're facing an epidemic of
      neurologic diseases on a global scale. A cheery thought. On this map, every country that's
      colored blue has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65. This is the world we
      live in." (Gregory Petsko: "The coming neurological epidemic," TED)

 5. For each highlighter color you used, listen carefully to your recording one time, paying close

39 | EFFECTIVE SPEAKING STRATEGIES
      attention to what you actually said for the words highlighted in that color vs. what the
      transcript indicates you ought to have said. Mark in bold any highlighted words on your
      transcript for which you made an error.
 6. Rerecord yourself giving the talk one more time, paying particular attention to any words
      marked in bold on your transcript (but don't worry about listening to/checking this second
      recording again unless you want to).

     2-11 Analyze2Imitate - Phrasing

Instructions: Similar to the grammar activity above, this activity will help you improve your spoken
English phrasing (a.k.a. collocation). The first step to improving is to increase your ability to hear
errors as errors. One way you can develop this ability is the following:

       1. Select a short TED talk or podcast from Scientific American's "Science, Quickly" that you
            find interesting.

       2. Under the TED talk video, click the "Read Transcript" button, then copy and paste into a
            Microsoft Word the part of the transcript text you find interesting.

       3. Record yourself reading the transcript aloud (perhaps using your phone, or a tool like the
            Online Voice Recorder from VirtualSpeech) as naturally as possible, pretending you really
            are giving the talk.

       4. Highlight in different colors all potential locations of the types of phrasing/
            collocations you find difficult. (e.g., Highlight all verb + noun objects in your transcript
            in green if you often don't know what verb to use with particular nouns. On a second copy
            of your transcript, highlight all noun-preposition-noun or just preposition-noun
            combinations in your transcript in yellow if you often don't know what preposition to use
            with particular nouns.)
            Examples:

                verb + noun collocations: "Unless we do something to prevent it, over the next
                40 years we're facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale. A cheery
                thought. On this map, every country that's colored blue has more than 20 percent of its
                population over the age of 65. This is the world we live in."

                (noun-)preposition-noun collocations: "Unless we do something to prevent it, over the
                next 40 years we're facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global
                scale. A cheery thought. On this map, every country that's colored blue has more than
                20 percent of its population over the age of 65. This is the world we live in."

       5. For each highlighter color you used, listen carefully to your recording one time, paying
            close attention to what you actually said for the phrases highlighted in that color vs. what

                                                                                                           EFFECTIVE SPEAKING STRATEGIES | 40
    the transcript indicates you ought to have said. Mark in bold any highlighted words on
    your transcript for which you made an error.
6. Rerecord yourself giving the talk one more time, paying particular attention to any phrases
    marked in bold on your transcript (but don't worry about listening to/checking this second
    recording again unless you want to).

Language Complexity

Developing Varied Language Structures

This section explores how to progressively develop language functions, from describing and
comparing to hypothesizing and analyzing, with a focus on structuring information effectively for
academic and professional contexts.

      Language Functions

     It is important to recognize the language functions and how each of those functions differs.
     For example, describing requires a detailed response and the ability to use words that paint
     a picture, and elaborations that give a comprehensive overview of the topic. On the other
     hand, to compare and contrast requires a response that shows understanding of both sides
     while a hypothesis requires some imagination.

      For more details about language functions, we recommend the following articles:

         for testing international teaching assistants. Journal of English for Academic Purposes,

         certification purposes. ETS Research Report Series, (1), 1-24. doi:10.1002/ets2.12233

      Signal Words & Vocabulary

     With each function, there are words that you would use, e.g. signal words or specific types
     of vocabulary. For example, compare and contrast would need words like: On one hand, on
     the other hand, a list or sequence would require: First, Next, Then, and a hypothesis would
     include: If I were, could... You can go back to the prompt example above and illustrate by
     building up the level of difficulty in questions: same topic, different language functions,
     different approaches to response.

  Presentation Sequence for Charts and Graphs

When presenting information in the form of charts and graphs, generally a specific
sequence should be followed to facilitate understanding. This sequence is as follows:

     · introduction,
     · orientation,
     · details to notice, and
     · interpretation.

The table below provides a closer description of these sequences, as well as, phrases that
can be used at each presentation stage.

Sequence Definition

Introduction  At the beginning of each slide, the presenter introduces what is
              about to be presented.

  · Details to notice: "It should be noted that laptop sales generated the most revenue. However,
      while monitors generated the least overall revenue, they generated the most profit due to their
      low production costs."

  · Interpretation: "If we can find a way to decrease the cost of producing laptops or increase
      monitor sales, we stand to reap even higher profits."

Tailoring Your Language to Different Listeners

The language we use in everyday life changes based on our relationship with the people we
communicate with, the context (formal/informal), cultural backgrounds, and familiarity with the
topic. In this section, we will understand and practice how our language changes based on our
listeners.

      Strategies to understand & connect with your listeners

     To ensure that people can understand your message effectively, you can use the following
     strategies:
     Listener (Audience) analysis:

          · Understand your speaking goal and consider your listeners' general background
             characteristics, such as age, educational background, work experience, and
             nationality.

          · Assess their motivational background and assess their knowledge and interest levels
             in the topic.

          · Consider their attitudes, beliefs, and values to make sure you are using cultural-
             appropriate language.

     Make it engaging and relatable:

          · Tell a story that would matter to your target listeners, capture interest, and clarify the
             purpose of your speech.

          · Use a problem-solution-importance structure to highlight why the topic matters and
             why people should care.

     The exercises below will help you understand and practice adjusting language complexity
     appropriately to different listeners.

      2-16 Discussion

Instructions: Read the questions and discuss them with your classmates. If working alone, answer
the questions in the form of an audio/video journal.

 1. How much do you consider your listeners during different contexts, such as teaching your
      classes, giving presentations in your graduate classes, presenting at a professional
      conference, or having an everyday conversation with a colleague?

                                                                                                           EFFECTIVE SPEAKING STRATEGIES | 50
2. How do you help your listeners:
      a. Want to listen
      b. Feel personally involved
      c. Process content
      d. View your speech as relevant?

3. How does your language change when talking to different listeners/audiences?

      2-17 One concept in 5 levels of difficulty

Instructions: In pairs or small groups, listen to one of the videos from the website below, where the
speakers explain the same concept in 5 different levels of difficulty.

 1. Listen: Take notes regarding the various ways in which the language is different at each level.
 2. Discuss: Discuss your observations with your partner/group members.
 3. Practice: Choose 2-3 different audience "levels" you might share your content with and then

      practice presenting one concept from your field.

2-18 Recognizing your listeners

Instructions: Choose two of the listeners below and your scenario. In pairs, talk about your scenario,
tailoring your language to the first group of listeners, for example, children, and then talk about the
same topic with the second group of listeners in mind, for example, parents.

Listeners:                          Scenarios:

· Children (age 6-10)               · Talking about healthy food
· Teenagers (age 13-18)             · Giving a motivational speech
· College students                  · Explaining what you do
· Seniors (age 65+)                 · Explaining your research
· Scientists or researchers         · Convincing them to join a fitness class
· Parents                           · Presenting a book review
· Farmers                           · Explaining what you do
· Postdocs                          · Explaining your research

Scenario D: Li's challenge

      Scenario Spotlight

     This is Li's second month in an English-speaking country. He is a master's student in the
     Computer Science department, and while he is enjoying his academic conversations, he
     struggles to have a casual conversation with his colleagues. He feels like his English is not
     good enough, although his participation in the classroom is remarkable.

           2-18 Discussion

Instructions: Read Scenario D carefully. Think about the situation and discuss it with your
classmates following the discussion prompts. If working alone, answer the questions in the form of
an audio/video journal.

  · What issues has Li had?
  · Why do you think this is happening?
  · What are some possible explanations about their behavior?

                                                                                                                          ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES | 52
      (Hint) Think about:
           · Informal speech
           · Phrasal verbs
           · Slang
           · Cultural references
           · Using effective speaking strategies

      Scenario Resolution
      In Scenario D, Li seems to be struggling with the differences found in academic and casual
      speech registers. This is likely due to Li's primary use of English being in academic settings
      up to this point. To improve, Li should increase his exposure to conversational English. This
      could be done by first observing casual conversations whether in person or through media
      and noting how it differs from academic discussions. Li could then start attending events
      where casual conversation is likely to occur and participate in said conversations. If
      available, Li could also participate in speaking groups and/or schedule speaking
      consultations through his university to practice conversation in a supportive, low-stakes
      environment.

Developing Small Talk Skills

Small talk is a casual conversation that helps make connections when meeting new people and
fills awkward silences with friends, acquaintances, and colleagues, often involving light, non-
controversial topics.

Small Talk Scenario Examples

      Scenario Spotlight: The coworkers

Greg and Hoon are coworkers in a business office. It is Monday morning, and Greg has come to Hoon's
cubicle to initiate small talk.

Conversation 1 (What NOT to do!):

  · Greg: How are you?
  · Hoon: Fine, thanks.
  · Greg: What did you do over the weekend?
  · Hoon: Not much.
  · Greg: What are your plans for this week?
  · Hoon: Just work.

                                                                                                                          ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES | 54
  · Greg: Oh, okay. Well, talk to you later.
  · Hoon: Yep. Bye!

      Why is this a problem?
      Hoon may not realize it, but his short answers are signaling to Greg that he does not want
      to talk. Furthermore, his answers give nothing for Greg to use to further the conversation.
      But what if Hoon wants to talk but just doesn't have much to say? Let's look at the next
      conversation to see what could be done instead.

Conversation 2 (Do THIS instead!):

  · Greg: How are you?
  · Hoon: I've been busy with work, but it's going well. How are you?
  · Greg: I'm doing great! I had a nice Sunday at the park with my family. What did you do over the

      weekend?
  · Hoon: I didn't do much, just watched TV.
  · Greg: Oh? What shows did you watch?
  · Hoon: It's called Midnight Mystery. Are you familiar with it?
  · Greg: I can't say that I am. What's it about?
  · Hoon: Well, it's about...

      Why is this better?
      While not giving substantially more detail than the previous conversation, Hoon is giving
      enough to avoid signaling that he does not want to talk and to enable Greg to further the
      conversation with follow-up questions. Naturally, giving more details would be even better.

      Scenario Spotlight: Student-Teacher Interaction

Professor O'brien is Yisheng's major professor, and the two are having one of their regular meetings.
Yisheng has noticed that other students seem to have a closer relationship with Professor O'brien, and
he would like to develop such a relationship too.

55 | ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES
Conversation 1 (Less effective):

  · Professor O'brien: How are you?
  · Yisheng: Fine, thanks.
  · Professor O'brien: Did you have a good break?
  · Yisheng: Yeah, I did some traveling with friends.
  · Professor O'brien: Oh? Where did you go?
  · Yisheng: We went to Chicago.
  · Professor O'brien: I happen to be from Chicago. Did you have fun?
  · Yisheng: Yeah. It was a good trip.
  · Professor O'brien: Sounds good. Well, let's get to our agenda for today's meeting.
  · Yisheng: Okay.

      Why is this less effective?
      While Yisheng is giving some information, it is just enough to keep the conversation going
      but not enough to make a connection with his major professor. But what if Yisheng is
      worried about asking something too personal? Well, let's look at the next conversation for
      some ideas.

Conversation 2 (Do THIS instead!):

  · Professor O'brien: How are you?
  · Yisheng: I'm doing well. How are you?
  · Professor O'brien: Still recovering from the holidays! Did you have a good break?
  · Yisheng: Yeah! I went to Chicago with some friends. What do you think of Chicago-style pizza?
  · Professor O'brien: I love it! I'm originally from Chicago and periodically find myself missing it.
  · Yisheng: Oh, I didn't know that. My friends and I went to Mario's for pizza. Are you familiar with

      it?
  · Professor O'brien: Ah, good choice! I would also recommend Luigi's. Did you happen to notice

      if it's still around?
  · Yisheng: Yeah! That was one of the other pizzerias my friends and I considered. If we go to

      Chicago again, we'll be sure to go there. What would you recommend we order?
  · Professor O'brien: Well, Luigi's signature pizza is the Mushroom Supreme, so I always

      recommend that for first-time patrons.
  · Yisheng: Thank you. I will keep that in mind!
  · Professor O'brien: Excellent. Well, let's get to our agenda for today's meeting.

                                                                                                                          ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES | 56
      Why is this better?
      The added detail and especially the several questions directed to Professor O'brien allow
      Yisheng a window into Professor O'brien's personality and background. This is important
      for building a closer relationship. Additionally, the topics of travel and restaurants are safe
      ones to explore.

Important Considerations for Skill Development

Language Functions

If you are preparing students for an ESL/EFL exam, it's important to remember that we don't want to
just "teach to the test". Instead, it is important to help the students recognize the language functions
and how each of those functions differ. For example, describing requires a detailed response and
the ability to use words that paint a picture, and elaborations that give a comprehensive overview of
the topic. On the other hand, to compare and contrast requires a response that shows understanding
of both sides while a hypothesis requires some imagination. The table below shows the sample
prompts using the same topic with different language functions.

Functions    Sample prompt

      List   · Tell me three qualities you would look for in a roommate.

Narrate      · Do you have a roommate? What has been your experience living in the US with
                a roommate?

Describe     · What are three qualities that you would look for in a roommate, and why are
                they important?

Compare and  · How do people find roommates in your country? How is it similar or different
   contrast     from finding roommates in the US?

                                                                          TEACHER'S CORNER | 58
Functions        Sample prompt

    Explain      · Which would you prefer? A roommate with the same culture or a roommate
                    with a different culture? Why?

Hypothesize · If you could find a perfect roommate, what would that person be like?

English for Teaching Purposes

If you are preparing International Teaching Assistants (ITAs) for an ESL exam focusing on the test
takers' ability to use English for Teaching Purposes, it's important to show them how these functions
connect to their teaching strategies.

One possible way to structure a lesson plan or one-on-one session (if you are a speaking consultant)
is to focus on one type of language function. Using the same language function, work on the
different components and move from general conversation topics to teaching skills to illustrate how
those functions need to be the underlying principles.

The table below shows an example of how to move from general to specific for the "compare and
contrast" function.

Steps        Steps and sample activities to move from general to specific contexts

                        Sample Activities

Define concepts        · Explain the difference between compare and contrast and what it
                          means. For example, compare the similarities and contrast the
                          differences.

                       · Illustrate: Similarities between cats and dogs vs differences between
                          cats and dogs

Focus on language      · Compare and contrast is a higher-level skill, so it will require a
functions                 combination of different language functions, e.g. define, classify,
                          explain, illustrate.

                       · Illustrate by showing sample steps:
                       · Similarity statement: There are similarities between cats and dogs.
                       · Explain: They are both mammals and have four paws. Also, they are

                          commonly domesticated as pets.
                       · Differences statement: However, there are differences as well.

Steps                 Sample Activities

                        · Classify: Cats are considered to be part of the felidae family while
                           dogs are from the canidae family.

Identify grammar and  · Draw attention to the use of signal words commonly used in compare
signal words             and contrast, e.g. Also vs However, On one hand & on the other hand,
                         etc.

Practice in general   · Use one sample prompt from the figure above to practice a
context                  conversation topic that requires a compare and contrast. For example:

                      · How is studying in the USA similar or different from studying in your
                         country?

Connect to teaching   · Ask students to think about how compare and contrast is used in their

sure to review them)
                      · For example, teaching a concept about Chemical Reaction may
                         include the following language functions:

                      · Describe or Define followed by an Explain and/or Illustrate - What is a
                         Chemical Reaction? Example: Cake-batter rising

                      · Classify: What are the types of chemical reactions?
                      · Compare and Contrast illustration about the characteristic changes,

                         e.g. Endothermic and Exothermic reaction.
                      · More Explain: why there are endo and exothermic reactions.

Practice in specific  · Ask students to practice with a teaching topic from their discipline
context                  using an outline that fits the "compare and contrast" function.

                      · During the initial role-play, practice the types of language functions.
                         During the second role-play, put attention on signal words and
                         expressions surrounding the topic and language functions.

Homework              · Assign homework:
                      · Use the https://www.esl-lab.com/ or https://www.procon.org/ and

                         identify one or two topics for self-practice. (See the two options in the
                         next section.)
                      · Ask students to prepare a TEACH outline from their recitation or
                         undergraduate textbooks and practice the presentation.

      Key Points

          · Speaking proficiency encompasses fluency, accuracy, and complexity. Fluency is
             about smooth delivery, accuracy is about correct language use, and complexity
             involves using varied language.

          · Effective speaking requires adapting language to the audience. Strategies include
             analyzing the audience and using storytelling techniques.

                   PART II.
      PRONUNCIATION

            ESSENTIALS

Clear pronunciation is fundamental to effective communication. When we speak, the way
we produce the speech can be just as important as the words we choose.
Part II of this book focuses on pronunciation, covering several chapters exploring key
elements of pronunciation, including segmentals (individual speech sounds), thought
groups, word stress, prominence, and intonation. These essential components have been
organized to help you understand how each contributes to natural, comprehensible speech.

              Segmentals
Segmentals: Overview

In this part, we will explore the learning process of English sounds for ESL/EFL learners. This chapter
starts with a scenario illustrating common struggles that learners face to help you think and reflect
on your own experiences. We will examine the importance of sounds - consonants and vowels -
and explore activities to help you improve your perception and production of English sounds.

Scenario E: It Doesn't Sound "Light"

      Scenario Spotlight

     Mau Na has issues communicating with her colleagues. They often ask her to repeat and
     struggle to understand her speech. Her colleagues often misunderstand her when she uses
     words like "light" and "right," "lice" and "rice," or "late" and "rate." She's tried to be more
     conscious of these sounds, but the sound very similar to her and she is mixing them up. Mau
     Na is frustrated by her pronunciation difficulties, and she's unsure how to improve.

      3-1 Discussion

Instructions: Read Scenario E think, and discuss with your classmates.
  · What issues have Mau Na had?
  · Why do you think this is happening?
  · What are some strategies for overcoming these pronunciation challenges?

The Importance of Speech Sounds

Undoubtedly, vowels and consonants (collectively known as segmentals) are at the heart of
pronunciation teaching - they are the unavoidable building blocks of oral communication. In an
intelligibility-based approach to pronunciation, this truth does not change. Being able to accurately
pronounce the sounds of a language largely determines the degree of clarity a person will be able to
communicate. However, this does not entail 100% accuracy. In fact, native listeners are quite adept
at being able to piece together the meaning of words, phrases, and even sentences which contain a
mispronunciation. In other words, the more a speaker's pronunciation parallels that of the listener's,
the more the listener's mind is able to process these features automatically, instead of consciously.
As a listener devotes more effort towards deciphering the form (in this case, the individual sounds),
the less brainpower they have to invest in understanding the speaker's content, which is what we
want to avoid!

The most important thing to remember when teaching or learning segmental features - in fact, with
all pronunciation features - is that a great deal of it has to do with habit-building. It is quite easy to
produce a segmental sound in isolation when it's the primary focus; it's another story to produce it
consistently while devoting mental power towards developing content.

Thankfully, problems in mispronunciations are not random or chaotic. In fact, they can be highly
predicted depending on the learner's L1. There are three common, over-arching problems that
language learners can run into when learning the sounds (or phones) of a second language:

 1. Learners frequently hear L2 phonemes as allophonic

         Japanese speakers can have difficulties hearing the difference between // and /l/ and
            Korean speakers can have difficulties with /f/ and /p/ because these languages
            categorize the sounds as allophones

 2. L2 learners struggle to identify phonetically different L2 allophones as belonging to the same
      phoneme

         Many L2 English learners struggle to identify the General American flap [] found in words
            like "water" as an allophone of /t/ because its voicing renders it much more like /d/

 3. Learners' pronunciation is strongly impact by repeated listening to a word's phonemic
      structure

65 | SEGMENTALS: OVERVIEW
Scenario Resolution
Mau Lin's difficulty with the "l" and "r" sounds is likely due to a lack of exposure to these
sounds in her native language. Many languages do not distinguish between these sounds,
or they pronounce them differently. As a result, English language learners may find it
challenging to produce these sounds accurately. To improve, Mau Lin needs to work on her
perception of these sounds, that is, hearing the difference between "l" and "r". She needs to
understand how the sounds are pronounced, where the tongue is positioned in the mouth,
and what distinguishes these sounds from the sounds in her native language.

                                                                                                                SEGMENTALS: OVERVIEW | 66
Consonants

When learning the distinct consonant phonemes of North American English (NAE), there are three
main dimensions for which they can be distinguished: Voicing, Place of Articulation, and Manner of
Articulation.

    Places and Manners of Articulation

      Place of Articulation refers to where the sound is made in the mouth. In NAE, there are
      seven places of articulation:

           · Bilabial
           · Labiodental
           · Dental
           · Alveolar
           · Palatal
           · Velar
           · Glottal
      Manner of Articulation refers to how the sound is made. In NAE, there are six manners of
      articulation:
           · Stop, or plosive
           · Fricative
           · Affricate
           · Nasal
           · Approximants (glide/liquid)

Consonant Clusters

This next group of sounds can be quite challenging for certain L1 backgrounds. The simple
explanation is that not every language "allows" consonant clusters like English does. Take, for
example, the word strengths. The syllable structure for this word looks like CCCVCCCC
(/strks/). Now take a Japanese learner of English, who comes from a language that only allows
syllables to be either V or CV. You can immediately notice the trouble this learner is going to have.
The learner, unaccustomed to producing such syllables, is undoubtedly going to either add or delete
certain sounds from the word strengths so that it fits with the rules of their L1.

    Four Types of Segmental Pronunciation Errors

           · Addition or Epenthesis
           · Deletion
           · Distortion
           · Substitution

There are some who have tried to pin which of these errors causes the most problems to
intelligibility, though it is highly understudied and the results are inconclusive. Preliminary findings
suggest that segmental errors in stressed syllables cause more damage to intelligibility than those
in unstressed, and that word-initial errors can also cause more damage, as it leads the listener on a
wild goose chase for a word that was not intended.
Don't fret! There are plenty of common rules to these consonant clusters.

71 | CONSONANT CLUSTERS
Rules for Consonant Clusters

   Syllable-initial clusters can come in clusters of two or three, and there are certain
   conditions that must be met for them to occur.

   Clusters of Two

   One of two conditions must be met:

        · Either the first sound is /s/, or,
        · The second sound is an approximant (/l, r, w, y/)
   Sometimes, however, both conditions can hold true, like in the word "swift" /swft/.

   Clusters of Three

   While more challenging than its counterpart, the conditions are much more strict:

        · The first sound must be /s/
        · The second sound must be a voiceless stop (/p, t, k/)
        · The third sound must be an approximant (/l, r, w, y/)
   Syllable-final clusters are a bit tougher to categorize. However, many clusters of two or
   three, and pretty much all clusters of four, are formed by adding a plural (/s, z/) or past
   tense (/t, d/) inflection to a word.

Vowels

It can be argued that, while consonants can provide difficulties, it is the vowels that can be the
most damaging to a person's intelligibility. It is important to note, however, that there are a few
English monophthong (single vowel) distinctions which should not be a major concern, namely
//-//-//. While some North American and British dialects still distinguish the // in "cot" from
// in "caught," other North American and British dialects use only one low-back vowel whose
phonetic quality can vary widely, with some regions and individuals pronouncing it more like //and
some more like //.

Besides monophthongs, all L1 English dialects also include diphthongs (two adjacent vowels within
a single syllable that are processed by listeners as a single vowel). However, only a few of these
diphthongs are present across dialects, namely /a/ in words like "tide," /a/ in words like "doubt"
and // in words like "toy." Therefore L2 English speakers must acquire only these phonemic
diphthongs to avoid compromised intelligibility.

Additional English diphthongs mark regional accent but are not phonemic, that is, reduced
intelligibility is not likely to result if speakers use the pure vowel /o/ instead of the diphthong /o/
when pronouncing words such as "toe" or the pure vowel /e/ instead of the diphthong /e/ when
pronouncing words like "day" (or vice versa). However, L2 speakers of English, particularly if their L1
includes only monophthongs, a.k.a. pure vowels (e.g., Spanish), frequently struggle to glide from the
initial to final vowel of even the phonemic diphthongs of English.

      Perception Training

     Perception training is essential for effective pronunciation teaching. By developing the
     ability to distinguish sounds, learners can improve their production of words, too. In other
     words, "if you can't hear it, you cannot produce it."
     An interactive online game developed by Dr. Ron Thomson titled "English Accent Coach"
     can help you improve the sounds perception. The game can be found on the following
     website: www.englishaccentcoach.com

Concentrated Practice Activity

Do you find it hard to learn the pronunciation of academic vocabulary you encounter in reading, but
basically never hear pronounced?
This is because your mind naturally discards (forgets) the pronunciation of words you almost never
hear, assuming this information is not important.
How can you avoid this?
The secret is to artificially increase how often you hear these [problem] rarely pronounced words,
so your mind realizes "This word is important - I need to remember it!"

Step 1

Read aloud to your instructor/partner the glossary of an introductory undergraduate textbook in your
field (or from Michigan State University's technical term lists).

For each technical term:

 1. Pronounce it
 2. Use it in a sentence you think you might actually need someday to say
 3. Pronounce it again

Your instructor/partner will take notes on any terms you struggle to pronounce or pronounce
incorrectly.

OR

Read aloud by yourself through the glossary of an introductory undergraduate textbook in your
field (or from Michigan State University's technical term lists), making a list of all technical terms
you do not know how to pronounce or struggle to pronounce fluently.

Alternatively, identify both general/technical vocabulary you struggle to pronounce confidently by
reading aloud through conference or seminar presentation slides/posters (your own or someone
else's).

Step 2

Search in YouGlish and/or Forvo for all terms you don't know how to pronounce.

Step 3 (Optional)

For any term that is three syllables or longer, do a Google search for "most common words ending
with _____" and choose the result from "More Words" (e.g., Words ending in "ogical").

Read aloud through the resulting word list and notice how this word you didn't know how to
pronounce is pronounced following the same word stress pattern as several other words you may
know how to pronounce.

Step 4

Repeat the most common pronunciation in YouGlish and/or Forvo for each of your problem terms 5
times, carefully following the speaker's word stress, individual sound pronunciation, etc.

If you make a mistake, listen to the speaker's pronunciation again and then start over at 1 to count

with 5 different videos repeating the entire thought group that includes the problem term, i.e., from
pause to pause.

Practice Activity 5

Practice fluently giving a talk that logically includes as many of your problem terms as possible.

      Backwards Building Activity

     In situations in which a student struggles with multisyllable words, it can often be helpful to
     break the word into its constituent parts and have the student work backwards. Initially, this
     can be a bit counter-intuitive for the student, so it works best if the teacher builds each part
     for the student as a model. For example:
     Word: Enthusiastic
     Parts: En - thu - si - as - tic
     Building backwards:

          · Teacher: Say "tic" Student: "tic"
          · Teacher: Say, "astic" Student: "astic"
          · Teacher: Say, "siastic" Student: "siastic"
          · Teacher: Say, "thusiastic" Student: "thusiastic"
          · Teacher: Say, "enthusiastic" Student: "enthusiastic"
     If a student struggles with pronunciation at any point during the chain, the teacher can
     pause and focus on that portion. For example, if a student is fine up until "siastic" the
     teacher can focus on that section. It can even be broken down further if necessary, so if the
     student is struggling with "siastic" and the "sia" combination seems to be causing an issue,
     the teacher could have the student say, "iastic" and then move to "siastic". This can be
     especially helpful for consonant clusters such as "str" "spl" etc.

Teacher's Corner

A useful website for letting students hear the glide required for intelligible diphthong pronunciation
is Eric Armstrong's voice & speech source. A useful tool for letting students see the glide required
for diphthongs is the University of Iowa's "American English Sounds."

Students may nevertheless get stuck on one or more minimal pairs they cannot seem to make
any progress in perceiving. It can be helpful at this point to train them in physically articulating
the difference between the two problem sounds - e.g., via Nilsen & Nilsen's (2010) Pronunciation
Contrasts for monophthongs and the University of Iowa's "American English Sources" tool for
diphthongs - so they get a sense of what exactly the difference is that they are listening for (e.g.,
When I pronounce /æ/, does my mouth look more open in a mirror as well as sound more open to
my ears than my pronunciation of //?)

Encouraging students to pronounce the problem vowel for as long a time as they need in order to
             check that they really have produced its distinguishing features can be useful.

It can also be beneficial to encourage students to temporarily exaggerate other articulatory
differences between problem phonemes. For example, making tense vowels as tense as physically
possible to most clearly distinguish them from lax vowels or opening the mouth as widely as
possible for low vowels to most clearly distinguish them from mid vowels, etc., since their
necessarily unstable pronunciation of new phonemes will naturally gravitate back toward standard
norms over time.

Finally, for long-term change in students' L2 pronunciation to occur, teachers must follow segmental
training giving students conscious awareness of how a particular clear vowel is physically
articulated with homework activities aimed at developing students' new L2 pronunciation habits, as
described in the subsection above on "Understanding segmental pronunciation as a habit." After all,
it is unreasonable to expect students to have the mental resources necessary to be able both to
consciously apply their new knowledge of how the various clear vowels of English are pronounced
while simultaneously needing to engage in the higher-level cognitive processes of:

Thought Groups: Overview

Scenario F: Too Fluent

      Scenario Spotlight

     Rami is a PhD student in Computer Science. His English is pretty good and he is proud of his
     language ability. While his grammar and vocabulary are advanced, he talks so fast that
     sometimes it is difficult to understand his speech. Most people try to become more fluent, so
     Rami is confused while this may be an issue.

      4-1 Discussion

Instructions: Read Scenario F, think, and discuss with your classmates.
  · What issues have Rami had?
  · Why do you think this is happening?
  · What are some strategies for overcoming these pronunciation challenges?

85 | THOUGHT GROUPS: OVERVIEW
      Scenario Resolution
      Rami, the ambitious PhD student, was aware of his fast-paced speech, but he had always
      assumed it was a sign of fluency. However, he began to realize that his rapid delivery was
      hindering his communication. To address this issue, Rami decided to slow down his
      speech and focus on clarity. He started by recording himself speaking and listening
      carefully to identify where he was speaking too quickly. He learned about the meaning of
      thought groups and the importance of pauses in speech. These were the first steps
      towards his improvement.

Regardless of topic, one of the pronunciation features most influential for enabling an audience
to understand what one says is the suprasegmental feature of thought grouping. Thought groups
are so vital because they are the foundation upon which so many other suprasegmental features
are built. Thought groups, in general, refer to any discrete stretch of speech that forms a coherent
message, and typically...
 1. are grammatically and semantically sound;
 2. are set off by pauses before and after;
 3. include one prominent element (prominence, see Part 4); and
 4. have an intonation contour built around that focused element.
It's important to note, though, that there is no one rule-governed method for dividing an utterance
into thought groups. A fast speaker may only pause once during an utterance, while a slow speaker
could pause up to four times in the same utterance. Listen to the following examples:

Notice the difference? Both recordings have two thought groups, but they are not the same. In
fact, the meaning of the sentence will probably be interpreted differently by listeners. The first
sentence suggests that the boy, using a telescope, saw a man; the second suggests that the boy
saw a man who was carrying a telescope. As noted, thought groups affect the positioning of other
suprasegmental features, such as prominence, intonation, and rhythm. Notice which words are
prominent in both examples, and how the intonation curve shifts as the prominence shifts.
However, when learning thought groups, there are a handful of grammatical structures which are
typically used to express a single thought group:

      Common Grammatical Structures Expressed in Thought
Groups (Smith, Meyers, & Burkhalter, 1992, p. 62)

        1. Article + adjective + noun (...the large molecule...)
        2. Subordinating conjunction + noun + verb (...because the experiment failed...)
        3. Preposition + article + noun (...in the graph...)
        4. Verb + object (...use a dictionary...)
        5. Relative pronoun + noun + verb (...which she solved...)
        6. Verb + adverb (...rotated quickly...)
        7. Article + noun + verb (...the student agreed...)
        8. Verb + direct object + preposition + indirect object (...hand it to him...)

If you consider the role thought groups play on the positioning and use of other suprasegmentals,
you can see how vitally important they are for producing intelligible speech. Using logical thought
groups can help a speaker sound more fluent, and it reduces the cognitive load of the listener, which
will allow them to better understand your intended message.

Find a TED Talk that interests you.
Shadow the speaker in terms of one or two of the following that are hardest for you (only one or two
because you can't focus on everything at one time!)
Pausing (a.k.a., "thought grouping")
The specific words the speaker stresses via pronouncing their stressed vowel longer than the
average stressed vowel (FYI: By default, English speakers add focus to the last content word of
a phrase, i.e., the part of the phrase where new information is usually located. However, this can
change if speakers add emphasis focus somewhere else in the phrase.)
Words the speaker connect together (e.g., "want to"  "wanna")

                                                                                                                THOUGHT GROUPS: OVERVIEW | 90
Additional Activities

     4-5 Analyze to Immitate

Step 1

Find a TED Talk you find interesting.

Step 2

Copy and paste the transcript text into a text editor (e.g., Microsoft Word).

Step 3

Watch the TED talk at least twice, inserting a single slash "/" where the speaker makes a short pause
and inserting a double slash "//" where the speaker makes a long pause.

Step 4

Highlight the last "important word" of each pause unit (usually a noun, verb, adjective, or
adverb), since this is the default position for focus in English.

Step 5

Listen to the talk one more time to check whether the speaker actually stresses in each thought
group the word(s) you highlighted. Change your highlighting as necessary to match the
speaker's actual focus.

91 | ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES
Step 6

If the speaker puts focus on a word in order to contrast it with another word, highlight in a different
color the specific syllable he/she actually stresses.It's important to highlight the exact syllable the
speaker puts focus on and not just the word since contrast focus can not only change which
word the speaker puts focus on, but also which syllable in that word gets focus. For example,
Eric Berlow in his TED talk, "Simplifying Complexity," consistently shifts his focus in the word
"complicated," altering its word stress, in order to contrast it with the word "complex":

"So / I hope to convince you that complex / doesn't always equal complicated. // So for me / a well-
   crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven / is complex / but a / curry / onion / green olive / poppy
                cheese bread is complicated" (Eric Berlow: "Simplifying Complexity," TED).

Step 7

Read the transcript again, underlining each pause unit you think the speaker will mark with a rising
tone, the default falling tone, or other tones sometimes used in English.

Step 8

Listen to the talk again to check and correct your predictions.

Step 9

Read the transcript again, marking in bold any words you think the speaker will connect together
rather than pronouncing separately, e.g., "want to"  "wanna." Listen again to the talk to check/
correct your predictions.

Step 10

Record yourself giving the talk (use a free tool like online-voice-recorder.com. Pay attention to
pausing only where you marked either "/" or "//", to lengthening the stressed vowels in each of your
highlighted words, and to using rising intonation with every thought group you underlined.

Step 11

Check your recording. Did you pause only where you marked "/" or "//"? Did you lengthen the stressed
vowels of all your highlighted words? Did you use rising intonation for all of your underlined thought
groups? Mark in bold any thought groups in which you made a pausing, focus, or intonation mistake.

                                                                                                                          ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES | 92

Rerecord the talk, paying particular attention to the stress and intonation of the words and phrases
you marked in bold.

     Common Problems with Thought Groups

      Students commonly have two problems with thought grouping when speaking an L2:
         1. Pausing too often or at inappropriate times, or,
         2. Not pausing often enough.

When students pause too often, it's usually a result of needing extra time to think of how to say
whatever it is they want to say next. Unfortunately, overly-frequent pausing can quickly become a
serious problem because it breaks apart speech into illogical groups. This will increase the cognitive
load of the listener, which will distract them from understanding the content of the speaker's
message. Even though listeners can adjust to these disfluencies rather well, it can become a tiring
process after a while. More troubling is that the extra burden placed on the listener can be re-
focused back to the speaker in the form of negative assessments of their politeness or intelligence.
Therefore, lack of fluency due to poor pausing is a pronunciation issue important to address as soon
as possible.
When student do not pause often enough, it's typically a response to the first trouble. That is,
students know that pausing too often can break apart their speech in unwanted ways, and so will
only pause when absolutely necessary to take a breath. What students needed to understand is that
pausing is also a powerful tool for helping listeners distinguish ideas. When speakers rarely pause,
listeners must figure out for themselves which ideas connect. This can result not only in listeners
struggling to understand what a speaker is trying to say, but also in integrating new information with
existing knowledge.
To help, teachers can use written punctuation as a reflection of intonational patterns, which often
make finding thoughts groups easier. For example, the period found at the end of a sentence

typically signals a falling intonation. While there are certainly exceptions to the rule, it is far more
useful to follow the 90/10 rule.

                                                                                                                               TEACHER'S CORNER | 96

        Chapter 5. Word
                     Stress
Word Stress: Overview

Word stress, also called lexical stress, is an important suprasegmental feature in English because it
determines so many other aspects of pronunciation.

      Word Stress

          · First, word stress determines which vowels in a word will be pronounced with a clear
             vowel vs. schwa.

          · Second, word stress impacts the pronunciation of consonants: the unvoiced stop
             consonants /t/, /p/ and /k/ are pronounced in English with aspiration either initially
             or in stressed syllables, but without aspiration in non-initial unstressed syllables.

          · Third, word stress determines which vowel(s) in a word will be pronounced longer vs.
             shorter, including which vowel gets the primary stress and can therefore be marked
             with even greater length via focus.

          · Fourth, word stress determines which syllable is marked with the highest pitch,
             lowest pitch or some other distinct pitch change.

          · Finally, word stress also determines which syllable, if any, will be marked via
             increased volume.

                                                                                                                       WORD STRESS: OVERVIEW | 98
                                                How word stress controls a word's
                                                intonation contour. Note: Primary
                                                stress is marked via the big bubble,
                                                secondary stress via the medium
                                                bubble, and unstressed via the small
                                                bubble.

Word stress errors which do not change vowel quality are only minimally damaging - i.e., when a
word's primary stressed vowel is instead pronounced with secondary stress and vice versa. However,
English strongly prefers alternating stressed vs. unstressed syllables. That is, it's very rare for
English words to contain two stressed syllables in a row, though exceptions include compound
words such as "housekeeper" and certain prefixed words like "triangle" and "nonlinear".
As a result, word stress errors that reduce a word's ordinarily stressed clear vowels to schwa almost
always exchange the quality of a word's ordinarily unstressed vowel(s) from schwa to clear. In other
words, a word stress error can easily alter the pronunciation of every vowel in a word, a major
problem since listeners rely heavily on a word's vowel template.

99 | WORD STRESS: OVERVIEW
    Common Word Stress Errors

           · Most word stress errors are made because of modeling a word's pronunciation on
              one of its more frequent cognates.

           · Some students' word stress errors are due to modeling their pronunciation on
              similarly spelled words that are pronounced differently.

                    Students' basic strategy of using the known to figure out the unknown is not
                      the problem. English word stress is highly patterned, as can be seen by
                      searching all words whose spelling matches a student's problem word from its
                      stressed vowel to the end of the word

           · For examples, see:

                    Most Common Words Ending with -alysis
                    Most Common Words Ending with -entally

Additionally, where ordinarily stressed syllables beginning with /t/, /p/, or /k/ are instead pronounced
unstressed, L1 English listeners are likely to hear the those sounds as /d/, /b/, or /g/, respectively.
This would negatively impact the listener's ability to find the spoken word in their mental dictionary,
which relies heavily on the sounds of consonants, particularly for high functional load consonants.

As a result, word stress errors can easily cause listeners to be unable to identify the word the
speaker is saying and therefore perhaps unable to identify the boundary between words.
Additionally, when speakers put prominence, or focus, on a nonstandard vowel within a word
because of failing to follow the word's standard word stress pattern, listeners' attention will still be
drawn to that word - but what listeners are likely to notice is the word's nonstandard pronunciation,
not the idea to which the speaker aimed to draw listeners' attention. For example, when a student
puts prominence on the word "economics" but pronounces it following the word stress pattern for
"economy".

In sum, word stress errors in English are frequently very damaging because of the disastrous
domino effect they put into motion.

Where to Place Stress

Unfortunately, there is no simple rule for determining where the stress falls in a word. However,
there are some common features which affect the stress in a word, such as words with prefixes or

                                                                                                                     WORD STRESS: OVERVIEW | 100
suffixes, the origin of a word, or the grammatical function. Below is a short list of more common
stress patterns found in English.
Words with an affix-a prefix or a suffix-will typically alter the stress pattern of a word. With prefixes,
this is a bit easier to determine. If a word contains a prefix, such as pre-, dis-, ex-, re-, over-, under-,
etc., a good rule to follow is that the stress will fall on the first syllable of the root word.
For example:

  · undo  un-DO
  · overcome  over-COME
  · extend  ex-TEND
  · understand  un-der-STAND

One exception to this pattern, as we've mentioned before, are compound words. That is, when a
prefix is attached to a noun in such a way that the resulting word is a noun compound. Notice the
above examples-they are all verbs with prefixes attached. When the resulting word is a noun, the
stress will be placed on the prefix.
For example:

  · overcoat  O-ver-coat
  · underwear  UN-der-wear
  · output  OUT-put

Understanding the grammatical function of a word is very important when trying to figure out where
the stress falls in a word, especially those that have a prefix.
Suffixes are not quite as nice and neat as prefixes. Suffixes often results in one of three stress
patterns:

 1. They are stress-neutral -- that is, they do not affect the placement of stress
 2. They cause stress to move to the penult -- that is, the stress moves to the second-to-last

      syllable
 3. They cause stress to move to the antepenult -- that is, the stress moves to the third-to-last

      syllable

The above table is not a complete list, but should provide a good starting place.

There are also borrowed suffixes from French which demand stress in a word, but these are a bit
more rare. One common suffixes borrowed from French which demands stress in a word is NEER,
like eng-i-NEER.

Other common suffixes borrowed from French that "steal" the stress from a word include:

  · -ee (trust-EE)
  · -esque (pic-tur-ESQUE)
  · -ese (di-o-CESE)
  · -ette (kitch-e-NETTE)
  · -ique (cri-TIQUE)

Teacher's Corner

One good way to identify word stress patterns students have not yet mastered is to take notes
on any nonstandard pronunciations while students talk through a 10-20 minute presentation or
read through several pages from a textbook in their field. Where students' mispronunciations are
nonstandard because of word stress, students can be prompted to figure out the word stress error
themselves by Googling "most common words ending with [stressed vowel to the end of their
problem word]" and then reading aloud the More Words word list that results, e.g., Most Common
Words Ending with -anism.
Although students generally mis-stress only some words following a given word stress pattern, this
technique helps identify other common words following the same word stress pattern to which the
student is not applying the pattern. This technique allows students' problem with a specific word
stress pattern to be addressed all at once, rather than just in terms of a single word in isolation.

  · Additionally, for any problem words identified following a particular word stress pattern,
      exposing students to a sample of 10-15 YouGlish examples of the word being pronounced in
      context (e.g., Youglish Search) can be very helpful for demonstrative purposes.

  · Once students know the relevant word stress pattern, it is important to automate their
      production of it by building their habit of pronouncing the word in accord with the standard
      pattern. Three homework assignments are helpful for accomplishing this task (see Additional
      Activities).

                                                                                                                             TEACHER'S CORNER | 110
      Using Rubber Bands to Teach Vowel Length

     Teachers can use ordinary rubber bands as a creative tool to show students how stress
     patterns work in words. They can be used to visualize stress patterns, following these
     steps:

          · Stretch and Release: As you pronounce a word, stretch the rubber band for stressed
             syllables and release it for unstressed ones. This visually represents the difference in
             length and prominence of syllables.

          · Exaggerate the Movement: For clearer demonstration, initially exaggerate the
             stretching and releasing actions to emphasize the contrast between stressed and
             unstressed syllables.

  Chapter 6.
Prominence
Prominence: Overview

Prominence, also referred to as "focus," "phrase stress," and "primary phrase stress", describes
the pronunciation adjustments English speakers make to focus listeners' attention on whichever
word(s) most contributes to communicating what they are trying to say. For example, when a parent
asks a teenager "You did WHAT???"
Prominence refers to how English speakers:

 1. Lengthen the primary stressed vowel in the key words of their message, and,
 2. Pronounce these key words at a higher or lower pitch than other less meaningful words.

In spoken English, prominence has the same function as a highlighter does in written English. You
would not highlight an entire page of information, but rather key terms or ideas. Prominence plays
this same role, but is done so a bit more often. Typically, prominence will find its way into almost
every spoken thought group -- which word is the most important or adds new information?

      Three Key Roles Prominence Play in Spoken English

        1. Highlight new or important information
        2. To show special or extreme emphasis
        3. Contrastive stress

The first category is perhaps the most common use of prominence. This prominence is always used
on a content word, and it's used to highlight the most important word(s) in your utterance.
Our earlier example, "You did WHAT???", falls under the second category. It is not necessarily that
the listener did not hear what the speaker said, but rather they could not believe what they heard.

113 | PROMINENCE: OVERVIEW
The final category is perhaps the trickiest. Depending on the word which receives prominence in an
utterance, the meaning of the utterance can change quite drastically. Take the following for example:

 1. I am watching.
 2. I am watching.
 3. I am watching.

Can you think of when you might use each of these prominence locations?

Number 1 might be used if someone wants to know what you're doing. For example, if the question
is Who's watching?, you may respond with the prominence of Number 1.

Number 2 might be used to correct someone. If someone asked you Why aren't you watching?,
you may respond with Number 2 to correct the speaker. Contrary to the speaker's opinion, you are
watching.

Number 3 is perhaps the most common of the three, in that it is simply informing someone of what
you are doing. For the question What are you doing?, you may respond with Number 3.

Typical Prominence

Prominence typically falls on the last word of a sentence or phrase if it is a noun, adjective,
or verb (except "BE").

Nouns:

· Where are you from?       · Is she the teacher?
· I'm from Spain.           · No, she's a student.

Adjectives:

     · He is nice.
     · She is very pretty.

Verbs:

· Where is he going?        · What are you doing?
· I don't know.             · I'm swimming.

Step 3

Shadow the speaker in terms of one or two of the following that are hardest for you (only one or two
because you can't focus on everything at one time!):

  · Pausing (a.k.a., "thought grouping")
  · The specific words the speaker stresses via pronouncing their stressed vowel longer than the

                                                                                                                        ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES | 118
      average stressed vowel (FYI: By default, English speakers add focus to the last content word of
      a phrase, i.e., the part of the phrase where new information is usually located. However, this can
      change if speakers add emphasis focus somewhere else in the phrase.)
  · Intonation (rising, falling or fall-rise)
  · Words the speaker connects together (e.g., "want to"  "wanna")

      6-5 Delayed Shadowing

Step 1

Find a TED Talk or Newsy report you find interesting.

Step 2

Listen again to how the speaker says a phrase or two and then pause the video.

Step 3

Say the first phrase 5 times, without any pauses and following the speaker's phrase stress,
intonation, etc. If you do make a mistake when saying the phrase, start over at 1 again when counting
your 5 times, for example:

  · What you say: "When. . . .you see. . . ."
  · What you think: `Oh, no! I paused. I need to start over. . .'
  · What you say: "When you see. . . , When you see. . ., When you see. . ., When you see. . ., When

      you see. . . ."
  · What you think: `Okay, I can go to the next phrase. . . .'

Step 4

Do the same thing with the second phrase 5 times.

Step 5

Now say the first and second phrase together 3 times, pausing only between the phrases:
What you say: "When you see / a diagram like this,. . . .When you see / a diagram like this,. . . . When
you see / a diagram like this,. . . ." - Eric Berlow: "Simplifying Complexity" (TED)

Teacher's Corner

By default, English puts focus on the last word of a phrase. If focus is placed anywhere else,
listeners will understand it as expressing emphasis. Therefore, when speakers put non-default
emphasis on words they do not mean to emphasize, listeners may not successfully identify the
speaker's key points.

Particularly if speakers are giving an extended presentation of complex content that is unfamiliar
to their audience, this can lead to listeners lacking the processing time necessary for storing
these key points. Without standard prominence, listeners quickly tire trying to identify the speaker's
main points. If they are unable to process a speaker's message at the speed they hear it, they
understandably complain the speaker is "talking too fast."

     Prominence is impacted by several things, including:

         1. in the case of emphasis/contrast focus, the specific words a speaker particularly
              wants listeners to notice,

         2. thought grouping (in that thought groups usually contain one focus element) and
         3. word stress (as determinant of which syllable in a focused word will be most

              strongly marked with additional vowel length; with the thought group's highest pitch,
              lowest pitch or point of pitch change; and possibly with an increase in volume.

There are a number of methods for indicting prominence in a sentence or phrase. For example, the
question How do you do?:

· HOW do you DO?
· How do you do?

                  TEACHER'S CORNER | 122
  · Hòw do you dó?
All of these different methods are showing the same thing -- How receives secondary prominence,
the first do and you receive weak prominence, and the second do receives the primary prominence.
Some teachers find it beneficial to use the same method they employ in teaching word stress, so
that there's an element of consistency in their teaching. Others like to employ two separate methods
to highlight the differences between the two suprasegmentals. This is a conversation that you need
to have with your learners.

Chapter 7.
Intonation
Intonation: Overview

Intonation is used by L1 English speakers to produce meaning at the phrasal level. While
consonants, vowels, and word stress errors can cause a loss of intelligibility at the word level, errors
in intonation rarely cause a loss of intelligibility at this level -- that is, listeners can understand
the words being spoken, but the meaning of the words can be mistaken depending on intonation
(especially if there is no intonation pattern at all). When we talk about intonation, we are talking
about communicated meaning, which can be either categorical or gradient.

Speakers of many languages around the world do not indicate grammatical meaning or attitude
through intonation, but rather some other language feature (e.g., the grammatical and attitude-
marking "suffixes" of Mandarin Chinese).

Therefore, many L2 English speakers may have a perception about how much emotion they can
appropriately express. Furthermore, since many L2 English speakers' pitch range is narrower than
what L1 American English listeners may expect, these listeners could potentially interpret students'
relatively monotone L2 English as expressing boredom, coldness or even hostility. L1 listeners
may also become irritated with certain L2 speakers' "sing-song" intonation, which would fail to
communicate meaning to an L1 listener.

On the other hand, students might interpret the broader pitch range of L1 English speakers as
excessively emotional or melodramatic when compared with their L1. This leads to some students
being delighted with how changes in their intonational patterns can lead them to sound more like a
native speaker, while others find it difficult to break past the norms of their L1.

Pitch  Range   Usage

4      extra   used to express emphasis/contrast focus and strong emotions, e.g., surprise or
3      high    enthusiasm
2      high    used to express default focus and/or the end of a thought group
       middle  used as the baseline or "neutral" pitch from which the intonation contour rises

125 | INTONATION: OVERVIEW
Pitch    Range  Usage

1        low    and falls
                used by default to express the end of a thought group

Note: It can be helpful pedagogically to present the intonation range of English as characterized by
4 levels of pitch - though musical pitch differs from phonetic pitch in that 1) speakers each have
their own baseline or "neutral" phonetic pitch, 2) a certain degree of variation is acceptable in how
wide or narrow one's intonation range is, and 3) speakers glide from one phonetic pitch to another
instead of jumping from one distinct note to the next, as in music.

When we think about intonation, there are three aspects which are important for intelligibility: range,
tune, and relative prominence. Range refers to the musical chart above, which has four different
levels ranging from 1 (low) to 4 (very high). Tune refers to the direction of the intonation pattern,
and is typically said as falling, level, rising, or fall-rise. Finally, relative prominence refers to the word
which is receiving the focus, and is typically either weak-strong or strong-weak.

      The Importance of Intonation

     Intonation plays a crucial role in conveying meaning and attitude in spoken English. Short
     dialogues provide a clear context for practicing and understanding different intonation
     patterns.

           7-2 Short Sentence Dialogue

Instructions: In pairs, read one of the dialogues. Decide how the intonation should rise or fall in each
line to convey the intended meaning and attitude. Practice reading the dialogue with appropriate
intonation. Then, perform the dialogue for the class.

Additional Activities

      7-3 Using Kazoos to Teach Pronunciation Intronation

     Kazoos can be a fun and engaging tool to help students understand and practice
     intonation. Here are some ways to incorporate them into your lessons:

        1. Intonation Mimicry:
             Model different intonation patterns on the kazoo, such as rising, falling, and
             sustained tones.
             Have students imitate the sounds you produce, focusing on matching the pitch and
             contour.

        2. Sentence Intonation Practice:
             Provide students with sentences and ask them to hum the intonation pattern on the
             kazoo without speaking.
             Focus on different sentence types (declarative, interrogative, imperative,
             exclamatory) and how intonation changes.

For more ideas on how to use kazoos, explore Marcha Chen's YouTube videos:

Teacher's Corner

It is important to first address students' nonstandard intonation in terms of how the student vs.
the student's target audience is likely to interpret that intonation. For example, for an L1 English
listener, a consistently rising intonation could easily lead them to question a speaker's competence.

  · First discuss the students' nonstandard intonation in terms of who their 1) immediate, 2)
      primary, and 3) long-term target audience(s) are and how those target audience(s) are likely to
      interpret students' current intonational norms.

  · When students plan to work long-term in ELF contexts where calibration toward L1 English
      intonational norms appears more likely to hurt than to help communication, student resistance
      to activities targeted at fostering more standard intonation should certainly be respected.

  · Also ensure students clearly understand the potential ramifications their L2 English
      intonational preferences are likely to have on their success in L1-English-context job
      interviews, professional relationships, etc., which they may decide to pursue in the future.

On the other hand, students may find help via an introduction to how one successfully navigates
being able to "flip the switch" from their "native language self" to a slightly different "English self."
Students may also break free of L1-induced interpretations of English intonation as excessively
melodramatic and emotional by imagining they are acting in a movie, where a broader intonation
range is expected.

                                                                                                                             TEACHER'S CORNER | 130
     Common Intonational Patterns Based on Written Punctuation

         1. Period at the end of a sentence = falling intonation
         2. Comma at the end of a clause or phrase = steady intonation (or slight rise)

                  a. This indicates the speaker is not finished speaking
         3. Exclamation points often signal strong emotion = extreme pitch changes
Teaching intonation can make use of lines, as seen in the Overview section, or sometimes it can help
students to see the difference in syllable form. For example, if we use the line "The union's indivisible,
not divisible," it may look like this:

                                           The union's INdivisible / not diVIsible
This method allows the students to see which sounds are involved in particular falls or rises.

Key Terms

90/10 rule

      When teaching pronunciation, it is often more beneficial to teach a rule which 90% of spoken
      language follows, then to focus on a rule that only governs 10% of spoken language use.

Accommodating

      Giving in to the demands of the other party; not standing up for one's own interests

Accuracy

      The ability to use correct and appropriate language, such as grammar, vocabulary,
      pronunciation, and discourse, to convey meaning.

Active listeners

      learners who go beyond simply hearing the speaker. They focus, engage, and try to understand
      the meaning by asking questions and showing they are following along.

Addition

      The addition of extra sounds; likely results from an L1-L2 conflict.

Affix

      The overarching group which contains prefixes, suffixes, interfixes, and circumfixes. English
      only has prefixes and suffixes, however.

Affricate

      These sounds are made through the combination of a stop and a fricative. First, air pressure is

                                                                                                                                         KEY TERMS | 136
      built up, like in a stop, but rather than exploding out, the air flows through a narrow passage, like
      a fricative.

Alveolar

      With the tongue tip on or near the top teeth, in sounds like /t/ (Top) or /z/ (Zap)

Approximant

Approximants

      The airflow moves relatively freely around the tongue

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools

      Aspiration, or an aspirated consonant, is the strong burst of breath that accompanies the
      release of some consonant sounds, such as /p/, /t/, and /k/.

Avoidance

      Avoiding the conflict at all costs; pretending it isn't there.

Bilabial

      Between the lips, in sounds like /m/ (Mom) or /p/ (Pop)

Categorical (meaning)

      Native speakers largely agree upon the meaning of the intonation pattern, such as a question or
      a statement.

Clearinghouse Questions

      Used to conclude a discussion of a topic, these questions often allow a party to emphasize a
      point already made or to provide any additional information that was not covered already.

137 | KEY TERMS
Cognates

      Words having the same linguistic derivation as another word. That is, sharing the same original
      word or root. For example, the English word "cold" is a cognate of the German word "kalt."
      An example of how cognates can change word stress would be the English word orGAnism and
      the Spanish word orgaNIsmo.

Collaborating

      Using problem solving skills to provide positive outcome for both parties.

Competing

      Prioritize one's own goals at the expense of the other party's goals.

      The ability to use sophisticated and varied language structures, including advanced grammar,
      diverse vocabulary, and intricate sentence constructions, to convey nuanced and detailed
      meaning.

Compound words

      Compound words are formed when two or more words are joined together to create a new word
      that has an entirely new meaning.

Compromising

      Both parties give up and get a part of their goal.

Consonants

      There are approximately 25 distinct consonant phonemes in NAE, and they can be distinguished
      along three dimensions: voicing, place of articulation, and manner of articulation.

Dental

      Between the teeth, in sounds like // (Thick) or /ð/ (Then)

                                                                                                                                         KEY TERMS | 138

      unknown to the listener, though this type of error is understudied.

Domino effect

      A domino effect (idiom) is when you make a change to one behavior and it activates a chain
      reaction, causing a shift in related behaviors as well.

Fruitful

      Producing good or helpful results; productive.

Functional load

      Functional load is a measure of the number of minimal pairs which can be found for a given
      opposition. For example, /f/-/p/ and /l/-/r/ are very common minimal pairs with high functional
      loads in English. Sounds with high functional load, if pronounced incorrectly, are more likely to
      be confused with a different word, complicating a listener's comprehension or understanding.

139 | KEY TERMS
Glide

      consonant sound.

                                                                                                                                         KEY TERMS | 142
Vowel quality

      Vowel quality is the property that makes one vowel sound different from another. The vowel
