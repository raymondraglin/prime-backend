national movement to create free, openly licensed educational
materials--better known as Open Educational Resources
(OER). As the College Board reports, many students forgo
textbooks simply because they can't afford them. While I can't
lower tuition, I can help reduce costs by offering this free
digital text. The book is housed in the Open Textbook Library
at the University of Minnesota.

   This project began with the backing of former School of
Communication Dean Jeffrey Rutenbeck, who approved a
semester leave and provided financial support. Rose Ann
Robertson, retired senior associate dean and former
Associated Press editor, strengthened the manuscript with
expert edits. Kim Pulford Westemeier of the Center for
Teaching, Research, and Learning turned drafts into a
polished online resource, with assistance from MA Film &
Media student Bria Granville.

   Annual updates have been supported by SOC Dean
Marnel Niles Goins, AU Head LibrarianJeehyun Davis,
who funded the Pressbooks platform; Scholarly
Communications Librarian Rachel Borchardt; and student
Qudsia Saeed. Teaching assistant Ethan Smith contributed
audio practice examples and smart editorial feedback. My
School of Communication colleagues--especially Terry
Bryant, Rob Roberts, and Jeremiah Patterson--offered
guidance, review, and design help. Former Journalism
Directors Amy Eisman and Dr. John Watson provided key
support, including legal insight. Rosemary Reed of Double

R Productions generously supplied space and staff for filming
vocal demonstrations.

   On a personal level, it's a joy to use the talents of some
young professionals for this free online resource. Chicago-
based graphic designer David Olmsted designed the book
cover and Boston-based actress Annie Olmsted demonstrated
vocal warm-ups and exercises in a video in Chapter 7. In full
disclosure, I'm proud to welcome these contributions by my
nephew and niece.

   This latest edition adds Chapter 12, on podcasting's path
into mainstream media; the role of education in its growth.
Chapter 1 addresses the rapid rise in the use of artificial
intelligence, and AI tools were used in producing this edition
to demonstrate how they are reshaping journalism, audio
production, and the creative process.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

        Jill Olmsted, American University

Jill Olmsted is a full-time associate professor of Journalism at
the American University School of Communication in
Washington, D.C. She has taught communication courses for
35+ years, specializing in audio and video storytelling and
public affairs reporting.

   She also writes and comments on media issues, does
freelance voice-over work, and has conducted media training
                                                        ABOUT THE AUTHOR | XV

for law enforcement and government agencies. Over her
career, she has worked as an on-air television and radio news
anchor, reporter, editorialist, producer, editor, photographer,
and news manager. As a former Washington, D.C.,
correspondent for nationally syndicated programs, she covered
federal agencies and the White House.

   Olmsted has been a member of professional organizations
including the Online News Association (ONA), Radio-
Television Digital News Association (RTDNA), National
Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ), and Association
for Educators in Journalism and Mass Communication
(AEJMC).

   A pioneer in podcast education, Olmsted recognized early
that podcasting was more than a media trend -- it was a
literacy, a skill set, and a democratized form of expression that
required structured, accessible guidance. She authored Tools
for Podcasting, the first comprehensive podcasting e-book in
the Open Textbook Library. At a time when high-quality,
affordable training materials were scarce, her book provided
practical, pedagogically sound guidance that educators could
adapt freely.

   Olmsted's approach bridges industry know-how with
educational clarity. She distills the technical, editorial, and
creative dimensions of podcasting into a format that new
learners can use effectively, covering recording techniques,
story structure, interviewing fundamentals, audio ethics, and
the broader media landscape.

    Chapter 1: Podcast Growth, Landscape &
    Trends
        CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 5

Today, more than one billion people watch podcast content
on YouTube. Artificial intelligence is reshaping how
podcasts are created, produced, and distributed, and podcasts
have become a key tool in political campaign strategy.
Together, these trends highlight the maturation of the podcast
medium.

   This chapter examines how podcasting has become a truly
mainstream form of communication--democratizing
content, opening doors for underserved audiences, and
earning recognition as a respected medium for news,
entertainment, and cultural expression.

Listening Growth: Podcasting in
2025-2026

Podcast consumption continues to rise, even as video-based
viewing expands the audience. Despite video growth, audio
remains the dominant format, with exclusive "watchers"
accounting for under 10% of weekly users since 2022,
according to Cumulus Media and Signal Hill Insights.

   In 2025, 73% of Americans--about 210 million
people--have listened to a podcast. U.S. audiences now spend
773 million hours per week with podcasts, up from 170
million hours in 2015, according to Edison Research's Infinite
Dial 2025.
6 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

The data, collected via a nationwide survey in English and
Spanish, includes landlines and cell phone respondents.

How Many Podcasts Exist?

Estimates vary, depending upon the directory:
   Apple Podcasts: nearly 3 million shows,
   Spotify: more than 7 million
   Podcast Index: over 4 million (from open RSS feeds)
   However, many pandemic-era podcasts are dormant. As of

fall 2025, only 13.4% had released a new episode in the past 90
days (PodMatch).

Record-High Consumption

More than half of Americans now listen monthly, with nearly
        CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 7

three-quarters familiar with the term "podcasting." Actual
listening may be even higher due to co-listening--families or
groups listening together on smart speakers and in cars
(Cumulus Media, Signal Hill Insights).

Published by permission of Edison Research
Video podcasts have grown significantly, particularly on
YouTube and Spotify, but audio continues to dominate. Over
half of YouTube podcast viewers also listen on other
platforms, suggesting that video adds new consumers rather
than replacing audio.
8 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

Published by permission of Edison Research

Megan Lazovick, VP of Edison Research, explains: "As more
people discover podcasts via video, it's smart to think about
consumption--not just listening." While audio-only retains its
appeal, "there's room for both."

Who's Listening? Key Demographic
Shifts

Younger Audiences Move to Podcasts

For listeners ages 12-34, "podcast watching" is now as
widespread as television--though many minimize the video
and use it as background audio. Research from KS&R shows
that podcasts are replacing traditional media time, reducing
both TV viewing and time spent on social platforms and video
games.
        CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 9

Older Audience Nearly Double

Listeners 55+ have nearly doubled in two years, reaching 27%
of that population. Growth is fueled by aging Boomers
bringing long-standing radio habits into digital audio and by
increasing content targeted to older listeners.
Published by permission of Edison Research
Yet, 61% of people who have never consumed podcasts are 55+,
highlighting major growth potential (Sounds Profitable).

Podcast Politics: New Republican Surge

Political content fueled significant listener growth during the
recent election year. While Democrats dominated in 2022,
Republican listenership has surged, driven by conservative talk
programming.
       CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 11

Published by permission of Edison Research

Geography also matters: urban listeners spend over twice as
much daily audio time with podcasts compared with rural
listeners, according to Edison's Share of Ear study.

Gen Z: The Most Engaged Podcast
Generation

Gen Z (ages 15-29) is the largest listener group, with 63%
consuming podcasts monthly. (2025 Gen Z Audio Report).

   Many began listening as children or teens, and early
exposure predicts higher ongoing consumption. This cohort
is also more racially diverse than the general population and
tends to binge-listen several episodes at a time.
12 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

Favorite Gen Z Topics

Podcasts are used for connection and entertainment by these
digital natives. Their top genres are comedy and music,
followed by entertainment, true crime, and sports. More than
six in ten say audio helps their mental health, improves mood,
and helps them express their identity.

Gen Z's Top 10 Podcasts

According to Edison Podcast Metrics (which measures
listening, not downloads), three SiriusXM shows rank in the
top 10-- Rotten Mango, Crime Junkie, and Call her Daddy.
Rotten Mango host Stephanie Soo gained attention for
extensive coverage of the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial.
       CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 13

Mental Health Matters

Gen Z prioritizes emotional well-being and self-care. The The
Mel Robbins Podcast--with more than 37M monthly
downloads--is especially popular among high-achieving
young women. Robbins won Best Host at the 2025 iHeart
Podcast Awards and also the received a Webby Award.

Social Media As Discovery Engine

Gen Z discovers podcasts primarily through YouTube
search and social media clips, often recommended
by influencers--whereas older listeners rely more on
podcast apps like Apple Podcasts.
14 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

Published by permission of Edison Research

Creators also skew young: the largest group is age 25-44; while
creators 55+ are extremely underrepresented, signaling
opportunity.

Minorities Want To Hear and See Their
Communities

The diversity of podcast audiences remains one of the
medium's greatest strengths. Podcasts have become an
accessible space for communities to share culture, politics,
lived experiences, and identity--driving especially strong
engagement among listeners who want to see and hear
themselves represented in the stories they consume.

   Edison Research and SiriusXM Media have documented
these patterns in a series of studies examining Black, Latino,
female, and, most recently, Gen Z podcast audiences.
       CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 15

Black Podcast Listeners

According to The Black Podcast Listener Report (Edison
Research 2023), 43% of Black Americans had listened to a
podcast in the previous month--five points higher than the
U.S. average. Black women are more likely to consume
monthly; Black men are more likely to listen weekly.

   The 2025 Share of Ear study shows that while Black
listeners are more likely to listen monthly, they hold a smaller
share of total listening time due to slightly lower frequency.

   Across studies, representation is a key driver: listeners
intentionally seek shows that reflect Black culture and
experiences. The Black-owned Hayti app features more than
2,000 Black podcast hosts and has become a major discovery
tool. Video is especially appealing to Black listeners, with 80%
preferring video formats.

16 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

Latino/Hispanic Podcast Listening Hits
New High

Latino monthly listening is rising at nearly three times the
rate of the overall population. Latino audiences now represent
20% of the U.S. population, and listening has grown 72% over
five years.

   For the first time in Edison's tracking, Latina women match
Latino men in monthly listening. Latino listeners also show
higher employment, income, and entrepreneurial activity than
national averages.

   Edison's Latino Podcast Listener Report shows that
YouTube is the most-used platform, and Latino preference for
video continues to climb.

Published by permission of Edison Research

"If the young Latino demographic is any indication,
       CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 17

podcasters will have another reason to consider video," says
Gabriel Soto, Senior Director of Edison Research.

Industry Growth and Investment

Major audio companies are increasing Latino-focused content.
  · SiriusXM Media partners with reVolver, Pitaya, and
      Sonoro.
  · iHeartMedia has grown its Hispanic offerings through
      the Latino Oyénos network and continues expanding its
      My Cultura Podcast Network, including new shows via a
      partnership with Hyphenate Media Group, founded by
      Eva Longoria.

Network'
18 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

Longoria has an equity stake in My Cultura and will executive-
produce a slate of new podcasts. "Storytelling shapes how we
see ourselves and how the world sees us, and podcasting is one
of the most intimate, accessible, and powerful ways to connect
" she said. Longoria has long championed Latino visibility
both in front of and behind the camera.

   Latino audiences often consume content in both English
and Spanish, and many prefer co-listening with family. Over
one-quarter seek content rooted in Latino culture, identity,
politics, and lived experiences. They also spend 12% more time
with digital audio than the general population and show
strong trust in podcast hosts.

Published by permission of Edison Research

Latino creator growth is outpacing other groups, reflecting
greater access to tools and rising audience demand.

Youth Engagement: The KIDS Podcast
Listening Report

Podcasts already have considerable reach among kids 6-12 in
the U.S., according to the Kids Podcast Listening Report by
Edison Research.

   · 46% have ever listened
· 29% listened in the last month
· That number jumps to 42% if their parents also listened
recently
20 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

Published by permission of Edison Research
Kids gravitate toward podcasts primarily for entertainment
and to relieve boredom. Favorite genres include games, music,
adventure, comedy, short stories, and bedtime stories like Sleep
Tight Stories. Parents report that podcasts also encourage
conversation and family engagement.

   The 2025 Webby Award Winner for Kids Podcast of the
       CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 21

Year went to Grimm, Grimmer, Grimmest, known for spooky,
humorous fairy tales.

   KidsPod is a podcast app designed for children ages 3-13,
offering both free and paid subscription options. The app was
developed in collaboration with a children's technology
expert. Co-founder Rachel Lacy notes that kids, like adults,
enjoy multitasking while listening, adding that "making
podcasts more interactive helps audio compete with streaming
and gaming when kids do have a device in hand."

Teens & Tweens Podcasters

With 66% of podcast listeners between the ages of 12 and
34, teens and tweens are not just listeners--they're creators.
Maryland middle schoolers behind MD Foodie Boyz have built
large followings across YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok,
drawing attention from major creators and securing brand
partnerships with companies such as CAVA.
22 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

        Screen capture, Md Foodie Boyz podcast
Gen Alpha (born between 2010 and 2020) has grown up
immersed in interactive media, and podcast
creators--especially teen girls with shows like Girl Talk and
RockPod--are helping drive a new wave of youth-led, creator-
driven audio content.

How Audiences Find, Choose, and
Engage

As podcast listening expands across age groups--from
children and teens to adults--the question becomes not just
who is listening, but how listeners discover new shows.
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 23

Whether introduced by parents, social media, YouTube, or
podcast apps, early exposure often leads to habitual listening
and strong audience loyalty over time.

   The smartphone dominates as the primary listening device,
with Spotify leading globally and Apple strongest in the U.S.
(OP3/Podnews). The United Kingdom uses more
independent podcast apps than any other large country. Apps
categorize shows by genre and platform, making discovery
easier.

Published by permission of Edison Research

Most people get podcast recommendations from their friends,
family, and colleagues, as well as from social media, online
communities, top podcast charts, and "best of" lists.

   There are also free podcast recommendation newsletters
that you can sign up for to be sent directly to your inbox
weekly, see the list below.

More Time Spent Listening & Favorites

Once listeners discover podcasts--often through family
habits, social platforms, or video--the medium tends to
become deeply embedded in their daily routines.

   Overall podcast consumption has slowed over the past year,
but weekly listeners now spend an average of 6.3 hours with
podcasts up from six hours a year ago. More than one in five
now consume over 10 hours weekly, or an extra 20 minutes.

   This means engagement is growing according to a study
of the podcast landscape by Sounds Profitable. Partner Tom
Webster attributes the increase to video podcasts.

Published by permission of Sounds Profitable

Most people consume about three podcast titles regularly,
reflecting a maturing medium where audiences lock into their
favorites and it's harder for newcomers to break through.
30 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

Published by permission of Sounds Profitable
In a separate study by Edison Research, heavy podcast listeners
- so-called `Super Listeners' consume an average of 11.2 hours
of podcasts per week, with over half of them listening to
podcasts through YouTube.

What Are The Most Popular GENRES?

In the U.S. the most popular genres are Comedy, Society &
Culture, News, and True Crime, followed by Sports and
Education.

32 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

True Crime & Investigative Podcasts

Among the overall podcast audience, listening to the true
crime genre remains immensely popular, with shows regularly
topping podcast charts--a trend spurred by the phenomenal
success of Serial. Some programs focus on cold cases and long-
buried family secrets, while others bring attention to
underrepresented communities, in the pursuit of justice.

   Criminologists say interest in true crime is driven by the
basic human emotion of fear, allowing listeners to experience
dangers and suspense without the consequences of actual
trauma. Reflecting the genre's cultural impact, Rolling Stone
published a list of "The best 25 True-Crime Podcasts of All-
Time."
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 33

   In a similar vein, investigative podcasts often intersect with
true crime but extend far beyond it, spanning topics such
34 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

terrorism, corporate and political scandals, health care failures,
and inequality in education.
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 35

   Both genres are expensive and time-consuming to produce,
as this form of watchdog journalism can take weeks, months
and even years to come to fruition. "I believe investigative
journalism is really like you are solving a mystery," says Los
Angeles Times reporter Joanne Faryon.

Podcast News Consumption Continues to
Rise

Much of the recent growth in news podcast listening is being
driven by new podcast consumers, expanding the overall
audience for audio journalism.

   Mainstream news podcasts continue to benefit from this
momentum. While only about one in five U.S. podcast
listeners tune in to shows produced by news organizations,
legacy media outlets have made substantial investments of
money, time, and staffing in the space. These efforts span
audio-first organizations such as NPR to national publications
like The New York Times, which has steadily built an audio
empire by acquiring audio companies and expanding its
podcast portfolio.

   Nearly a third of U.S. adults (32%) say they sometimes get
news from podcasts, with 10% saying they do so often,
according to an August 2025 survey by the non-partisan Pew
Research Center.

   Growth is evident across all age groups, though younger
Americans are more likely than older adults to get news from
podcasts frequently. Just five years ago, only 22% of adults
36 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

reported getting news from podcasts--underscoring how
quickly the format has gained traction.

   A study by Signal Hill Insights reinforces this popularity.
Since the annual study began in 2021, news has consistently
ranked as the second most-consumed podcast category.

   "News podcasts are not only finding themselves increasingly
at the center of the national conversation, but they are also
appealing to an inquisitive and attractive audience that's
growing even faster than podcast consumption in general,"
said company president Paul Riismandel.

WORLDWIDE News Podcast Audience

Worldwide, about one-third of the global population access a
podcast monthly, according to the 2025 Digital News Report,
attracting a younger and better-educated audience. The survey
spans six continents and 48 markets and was commissioned by
the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.

   This year's study focused exclusively on the news and
38 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

current affairs podcasts in order to better compare podcast
listening with traditional radio, television, print news, and
other digital news sources.

   The findings reveal significant differences across countries.
Weekly use of news podcasts in the United States stands at
approximately 15%, a level comparable to reading a newspaper
or magazine (14%), or listening to news on the radio (13%).

   Nordic countries also have well-developed news podcast
markets, including Denmark (12%), Sweden (11%), and
Norway (11%), though traditional radio remains dominant
across Northern Europe, with reach at about 33%.

TOP-RATED News Podcasts

The massive success of The Daily from The New York Times, is
widely credited with accelerating the growth of news podcasts.
The genre attracts a younger and better-educated audience
than traditional media.

   Since its launch in 2017, the powerhouse explanatory
podcast has been downloaded more than 3 billion times, with
roughly 20 million people listening each month. Its signature
       CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 41

format on a single major story, is explaining the issue in depth
over 20 to 40 minutes.

   The Wall Street Journal reported that the Times would place
older audio episodes behind a paywall, while newly released
episodes would continue to be free.

   In 2023, The Times launched a shorter daily news podcast
that covers three top stories in about 10 minutes. The
Headlines, along with other audio features curated by Times
journalists can be heard on its main news app.
42 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

   Among competitors, The Washington Post offers The 7,
which explores seven or more important or interesting news
stories of the day with reporting and insight in about a
10-minute time span. Reuters World News has a 10+ minute
news briefing and the BBC offers a 15-minute news podcast,
aimed at 16-24-year-olds around the globe.
  CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 43

Also topping the podcast charts are two NPR news
44 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

podcasts. Up First is the daily news podcast discussing the
three biggest stories of the day with reporting and analysis in
10 minutes. NPR News Now has the latest hourly news in five
minutes.
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 45

   In the best news podcast category, Vox'sToday Explained

covers the most important news of the day in about 30
minutes. The award comes from the professional member
association, The Podcast Academy
46 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

   News listeners generally view news podcasts as accurate,
especially compared with news from social media. However,
warning signs are emerging.

   Worldwide, the proportion of news consumers who say
they actively avoid the news has grown sharply, citing its
negative impact on their mood and concerns over false and
misleading information.

Award-Winning Podcasts & Cultural
Impact

Top Journalism Honors

Podcasts are now recognized at the highest levels of excellence
in American journalism, with honors that include the
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 47

Pulitzer, Peabody, du Pont-Columbia Awards, and The
Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA),
among others.

   Investigative podcasts, in particular, have helped right
wrongs--contributing to the release of inmates from prison
and exposing injustices that have resulted in new national laws.

Case Study: In the Dark

In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court felt the impact of a podcast
when In The Dark prompted the Court to review and
overturn the murder conviction of Curtis Flowers, a black
Mississippi death-row inmate who had been tried six times for
the same crime.

   A new trial was ordered after the investigative unit
of American Public Media uncovered evidence of a pattern of
48 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

racist jury selection by the prosecutor. After 23 years, Flowers
became a free man when the Mississippi attorney general
dropped state charges against him. The show also earned top
journalism honors, including the Peabody, George Polk, and
Edward R. Murrow awards.

   The creation of national sex-offender registries also followed
reporting highlighted in the 2016 season of In the Dark,
which documented how police mishandled the child
abduction and murder of a small-town boy in Minnesota.

    Pulitzer Prize for Audio Reporting
    (2020-present)

     The prestigious Pulitzer Prize Board introduced a
     new category for Audio Reporting in 2020, formally
     recognizing podcasting and audio journalism as a
     major force in investigative and narrative reporting.
     2020: The inaugural Pulitzer was awarded to "This
     American Life" for its reporting on the personal
CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 49

impact of the Trump administration's "Remain in
Mexico" policy.

2021: NPR won the second-ever Pulitzer in the
category for an investigative audio report examining
how two Iowa-based gun rights
advocates--brothers who leveraged social
media--worked to weaken gun regulations
nationwide.
50 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

     2022: The Pulitzer went to Suave, a podcast
     produced by the nonprofit organizations Futuro
     Media and PRX. The series explores the life of a man
     sentenced as a juvenile to life in prison without the
     possibility of parole--a practice unique to the United
     States--and traces his path toward redemption.
CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 51

2023: Gimlet Media and journalist Connie Walker
won the Pulitzer for Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's,
an audio series that exposed the abuse of
Indigenous children at a Canadian Indian residential
school.
For a behind-the-scenes look at how such reporting
comes together, the six-episode podcast Pulitzer on
the Road features conversations between Pulitzer
Board members and the 2023 audio reporting
winners..
52 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

     2024: The staffs of The Invisible Institute and USG
     Audio received the Pulitzer for You Didn't See
     Nuthin, a series that revisits a 1990s Chicago hate
     crime through memoir, community history, and
     investigative journalism. The podcast also won a
     Peabody Award, which honors the most compelling
     and empowering stories in broadcasting and
     streaming media.
CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 53

2025: The most recent Pulitzer for Audio Reporting
was awarded to In the Dark, which chronicles a four-
year investigation into the murder of 25 unarmed
Iraqi civilians in Haditha--one of the most notorious
crimes of the Iraq War.
Hosted by Madeleine Baran, this is the sixth Pulitzer
awarded to an investigative journalism podcast
since the category's creation in 2020.

Other Top Podcast Awards:

The 85th Annual Peabody Awards recognized
"stories that matter" across news and entertainment
programming. In the Radio/Podcast category, four
winners were selected, including additional
54 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

     recognition for investigative work by The New
     Yorker.

          · In the Dark: The Killings in Haditha also
             received a Pulitzer.

          · Blindspot: The Plague in the Shadows focused
             on the solidarity and resilience of communities
             affected by the AIDS crisis.

          · Pulse: The Untold Story examined how the
             2016 Pulse nightclub shooting was politicized
             and initially framed solely as a hate crime,
             rather than as an attack motivated by
             opposition to U.S. military actions in Iraq and
             Syria.

          · Yousef, Youmna, Banias, and Majd: Four Lives
             in Gaza, from This American Life, centered on
             the personal struggles of individuals living
             amid the war in Gaza.

     Previous Peabody honors for groundbreaking
     investigative podcasts have gone to shows such as
     Serial, S-Town, and In the Dark.

          · The Golden Globes has introduced a Best
             Podcast category for the first time, aiming to
CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 55

        recognize outstanding podcasts for their
        "quality, creativity, audience engagement, and
        impact." The awards ceremony is scheduled
        for January 11, 2026, and the new category
        has already sparked controversy --nothing
        new for the Foreign Hollywood Press
        Association.

   TREND: AI Reshapes
   Podcasts

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming the way podcasts
are created, produced, and distributed. Podcasters now rely on
AI to streamline nearly every stage of production--generating
story ideas, conducting background research, drafting
interview questions, creating cover art, producing transcripts,
and assisting with editing and social media promotion.

   But along with these efficiencies come escalating ethical
concerns, including transparency about AI use, the
replacement of human voices with synthetic clones, and the
potential spread of misinformation.

   AI tools span both free and paid options. OpenAI's
ChatGPT--introduced in late 2022--became the fastest-
growing app in history, outpacing TikTok's rise. Key
competitors include Anthropic's Claude and Google's
Gemini.

   Wondercraft, an AI-powered audio studio, converts written
text into podcast episodes. A company survey reported that
80% of creators now use some form of AI. Co-founder Oskar
Serrander says AI is "becoming less of a shortcut and more of
a studio partner, helping creators stay prolific without burning
out or compromising quality."

AI-Created Podcasts

What happens when you type "AI-generated podcasts" into a
site like AI Podcast Generator?

   In a matter of minutes, the platform assembles a short
58 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

show--complete with two synthetic voices, a script,
background music, and sound effects. Users can choose
languages and vocal styles, upload samples to clone their own
voice, and export the finished product as an MP3. Several AI
tools now offer similar capabilities; most provide basic features
for free but require a subscription for more sophisticated
production.

   Fully automated podcasts remain rare, but one notable
exception is The Automated Daily, a tech-focused show that
has been generating headline summaries since 2023.

The host is named "Trend Teller" and show length is between
7 and 15 minutes, according to a sampling.
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 59

Audio-Only Podcasts Become Video

A wave of new tools arriving in 2026 is blurring the line
between audio and video. YouTube plans to generate short
video clips from audio podcast transcripts, using Google's
VEO AI system to produce 30- to 60-second visuals for
YouTube Shorts. The feature will debut with a limited group
of U.S. podcasters, according to Business Insider, and is
intended to boost podcast discoverability in a landscape
dominated by TikTok and Instagram.

   Meanwhile, podcast-hosting service Podbean has an AI-
driven tool that converts written blog posts into voices, with
a choice of up to five languages or countries across several
pricing tiers.

Transcripts

AI transcription tools are now widely available, with Apple
and Spotify offering built-in auto-generated
transcripts--though creators still must check for accuracy.
OpenAI's Whisper produces transcripts in multiple languages
and can translate them into English. Competitors such as
Deepgram offer similar paid services.

   See Chapter 9 for free ways to make transcripts.

Podcast Artwork & Music

For visual appeal there is AI-generated art. Platforms such as
60 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

Blubrry allow users to generate cover art, show titles, and host
names. Free and open-source tools like GIMP offer image
creation, while Dream.ai turns text prompts into artwork.
However, several AI art generators face copyright lawsuits over
training on artists' work without consent.

   See Chapter 2 for tips on ways to create your own cover art.
   On the music side, podcast consultant John Wordock tested
ChatGPT by feeding it themes and prompts, producing an
original song about podcasting.

Podcast Editing

AI-powered editing tools can remove filler words ("um,"
"like"), trim long pauses, clean background noise, and
generally speed up post-production.
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 61

   Descript's Overdub can correct mispronunciations using
the host's cloned voice. The platform allows users to edit video
as if it were a text document and generates automatic
transcripts. Features like "Replace Selection" let editors swap
in corrected audio or video without disrupting timing.

AI Tools To Improve Recorded Speech

While proper soundproofing is still essential, AI can help
improve recordings affected by echo, muffling, or persistent
background noise. Adobe's free Enhanced Speech tool
performs well at removing noise--though not perfectly.

   Several emerging tools expand these capabilities:

  · Regenerate smooths abrupt edits or eliminates sudden
      background sounds.

  · Eye Contact adjusts gaze direction, making it appear as
      if a speaker is looking directly into the camera.

  · Revoice can clone a user's voice, though results still
      sound slightly robotic.

  · Voicebox, developed by Meta, generates text-to-speech
      and can remove transient noises like barking dogs or
      ringing doorbells.

  · Wondercraft's "Parrot Mode" lets users fine-tune
      exactly how AI voices deliver scripted lines.

More controversial uses include fully AI-generated shows,
62 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

scripts written entirely by AI, and undisclosed use of voice
clones.

Deepfakes - AI Voice Clones

Trust is a cornerstone of podcasting. According to Audacy's
2024 Innovation Tracker, listeners are more than twice as
likely to trust human-voiced content (55%) than AI-generated
audio (23%). That extends to advertising as well.

   Yet AI voice cloning has already been used to recreate the
voices of both deceased and living individuals. The
documentary Roadrunner used AI to reproduce three lines
in the voice of the late chef-host Anthony Bourdain without
public disclosure--a move that sparked broad debate. Similar
technology could enable a familiar podcast host's voice--or
even their ad endorsements--to be replaced by a clone.

Ethics of Voice Clones

Major platforms including YouTube, Spotify, and Apple have
implemented rules governing AI use. Media company
WaitWhat has proposed a Listener Bill of Rights addressing AI
transparency.

   Advertising firms are also setting standards. ADOPTER
Media argues that using AI to simulate a host reading a
personal endorsement--except for accessibility reasons--is
"disingenuous and unethical," and undermines trust in host-
read ads.
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 63

   Nonconsensual voice cloning raises legal risks as well. One
podcast faced a potential lawsuit after using AI to mimic the
voice and likeness of NFL star Tom Brady for a Dudesy
episode.

Podcast Discovery, Research & Planning

AI gave a boost to podcast discovery from Sounder and
Podroll. By using these tools you can get personalized podcast
recommendations based on listener preferences and behaviors
to your next favorite episode, with preliminary data showing a
30% increase in podcast consumption.

   For creators, AI assistants such as ChatGPT (free), Jasper
AI, and Showplanner (paid) can generate episode topics,
64 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

conduct preliminary research, propose interview questions,
draft outlines, and brainstorm guest ideas.

   See Chapter 2 for DIY tips and Chapter 5 for interviewing
guidance.

Choose Wisely on AI Tools

The rapid adoption of AI raises an important question: just
because you can use AI, should you?

   AI systems are trained on existing data, which may carry
embedded bias; using them uncritically can reinforce those
flaws. Whether AI ultimately helps or harms podcasting
remains an open question--but it's a discussion worth having.

   YouTube now requires disclosure when AI makes a real
person appear to say or do something they did not, alters
footage of real events, or creates realistic fabricated scenes.
Spotify and Apple have also instituted AI-use guidelines.

Regulatory Actions

Federal policy remains in flux. The Trump Administration
recently unveiled its AI policy agenda at an event attended
by lawmakers, tech investors, and All-In Podcast host David
Sacks, now serving as Trump's AI czar. The plan aims to scale
back regulation and spur investment.

   During the Biden Administration, concerns over AI safety
led the federal government to convene meetings with major AI
developers, resulting in voluntary industry commitments to
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 65

mitigate risks and allow security experts to test models before
release. It remains unclear which of those guardrails will
continue.

   TREND: YOUTUBE & TIKTOK
   DISCOVERY

YouTube's Dominance--But Not
Necessarily for Listening

Roughly one billion people a month watch podcast content
on YouTube, making it the most widely used podcast platform
in the United States. It is also the leading entry point for
discovery: 45 percent of weekly podcast listeners who tried
a new show in the past six months say they found it on
YouTube--far ahead of Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

   Yet when it comes to actually listening, most audiences still
turn elsewhere; 61 percent consume podcasts on platforms
other than YouTube.

66 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

YouTube's surge in video podcasts is driven largely by scale.
With more than 2 billion monthly users--five times that of
most podcast platforms--the site gives podcasters an
enormous potential audience. The boom is also fueled by
newcomers who encounter podcasts through YouTube's
algorithm or social features.

Video NOT Replacing Audio

Despite the momentum around video, audio remains the
backbone of podcasting. A 2025 Cumulus Media/Signal Hill
Insights study found that 58 percent of weekly podcast
consumers prefer audio-only. Another 30 percent keep the
video minimized or running in the background, while two in
five say they enjoy actively watching video podcasts.

Courtesy Cumulus Media and Signal Hill Insights

The video push is often framed as essential for visibility.
Entertainment journalist James Hibberd told The Hollywood
Reporter that "it's got to be on video to break through."

   But industry analysts say the real driver is YouTube's
reach--not a fundamental shift away from audio. "The
dominant modality for podcast consumption is still
audio--and not by a little," says Sounds Profitable partner
Tom Webster.
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 67

   A look at the top 50 Libsyn shows underscores the point.
Company vice president Rob Walch found that true, dynamic
video appears mainly among blockbuster titles. Most other
shows rely on a single static image--or no video at all. Creators
who offer both formats can strengthen audience loyalty, he
says, but only if audio is treated as a first-class product.

   Even major streamers are reassessing the space. Netflix,
which continues to reshape television, is reportedly exploring
lower-cost video-chat podcasts for its 300 million global
subscribers. Bloomberg reports the company aims to launch
50 to 75 video podcasts in 2026--setting up a direct challenge
to YouTube.

YouTube's Expanding Partnerships

YouTube has been aggressively courting established podcast
brands. It has inked deals with NPR and Slate to distribute
more than 20 top-performing shows.

   "Following the global success of our Tiny Desk Concerts,
we are excited for our podcasts to reach new audiences on
YouTube," says Anya Grundmann, NPR's SVP of
Programming and Audience Development.

   The CBC has begun migrating a dozen audio shows to
YouTube using static artwork and plans to expand into live-
element video podcasts. ESPN has built dozens of sports-
specific channels on the platform. And when The Ringer
added video to its Talk the Thrones podcast, followers rose by
about 70 percent, according to The Media Leader.
68 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

   Spotify, meanwhile, now hosts more than 100,000 video
podcasts--just 2 percent of its total catalog--but sees the
format as a major growth opportunity. Executive Julie
McNamara told The Verge that video podcasting is "one of the
fastest-growing areas of podcasting," and a potential driver of
new advertising revenue.

Why Creators Turn to Video

Video podcasting tends to emerge in two forms: full video
recordings or audio tracks paired with static images. Both can
help shows get discovered, especially among younger and
minority audiences who want to see as well as hear their
communities represented.

   Google data suggests visibility matters: 80 percent of the
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 69

most successful video podcasts feature the host's face, and they
earn roughly twice as many views as static-image uploads.

Because YouTube is owned by Google--the world's dominant
search engine--many podcasters view video as a path to
additional reach and new revenue. The timing also aligns with
Google's shutdown of its stand-alone podcast app. And with
YouTube Music now supporting podcasts, listeners can switch
seamlessly between audio and video for on-demand, offline,
and background listening.

   Still, for many creators, the craft of audio remains central.
70 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

"Chat podcasts" translate most naturally to video, but plenty
of listeners prefer to unplug from screens.

   See Chapter 6 on scripting for tips on elevating audio
storytelling.

The Costs and Trade-offs

Video can elevate visibility, but it brings added complexity.
Producing both formats requires far more time and resources;
the Podcast Marketing Academy estimates that audio-plus-
video shows face 3.6 times higher production costs. Yet video
can become profitable more quickly because brands and
businesses are eager to sponsor visually driven content.

   For others, though, video isn't worth the effort. Pat Flynn,
host of Smart Passive Income, says video retention is
notoriously short. "If you're holding attention in video for
minutes, you're doing well," he notes. "In audio, you can hold
attention for 20 minutes or more"--a major advantage for
building trust and loyalty.

   A hybrid strategy is gaining favor: record full video episodes
but post only five-minute clips to YouTube to funnel viewers
to the main audio show. Several podcasters who made this
transition told Colin Gray of The Podcast Host that results
vary widely--some saw meaningful growth, others found the
demands unsustainable.

The TikTok Podcast Network

Short-form giant TikTok, which has more than 1 billion
monthly users, is also pushing into podcasting. The platform
now allows creators to link podcast episodes via RSS so viewers
can listen directly from connected videos. Here's some advice
on how to promote your podcast using the app.

   The rollout comes as the app faces ongoing scrutiny and
government restrictions in the U.S. and abroad over data-
security concerns.

   In the midst of that uncertainty, iHeartMedia has launched
the TikTok Podcast Network, featuring up to 25 new creator-
hosted shows, a national broadcast and digital radio channel,
and a slate of live events.
72 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

   State-of-the-art studios are being built in New York, Los
Angeles, and Atlanta. CEO Bob Pittman calls podcasting
"probably the hottest category of media right now," noting it
now accounts for a record 14 percent of company revenue.

   TREND: PODCAST
   CAMPAIGN STRATEGY

Podcast appearances have become a core campaign strategy
for political candidates, who are increasingly turning to shows
far outside traditional political media. With podcasts offering
direct engagement, lengthy conversations, and massive reach,
candidates are devoting significant time to securing guest spots
-- and the tactic appears to matter.

Podcast Campaigns

A recent analysis by Edison Podcast Metrics examined the New
York City mayoral race and the New Jersey governor's race. In
both contests, the candidates who reached the largest numbers
of potential voters through podcast appearances -- Zohran
Mamdani in New York City and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 73

-- went on to win by decisive margins, particularly among
younger voters.

   Researchers noted the sheer volume of podcast interviews
across all candidates, calling podcasting "an increasingly
important and popular megaphone in U.S. elections."

Published by permission of Edison Research

The trend was even more visible in the 2024 presidential race.
Potential voters flocked to major shows like The Joe Rogan
Experience, Call Her Daddy, and Weekend with Theo Von.
Donald Trump logged roughly 20 podcast appearances;
Kamala Harris, who entered the race in July, participated in
eight.

   Trump's so-called "Bro Podcast Tour" -- a swing through
male-leaning shows that generated more than 50 million views,
according to Forbes -- included a three-hour appearance on
Rogan's program in Texas, where he repeated election fraud
claims.

                                                                 interview

His opponent, Kamala Harris could not come to terms for
going on the Rogan podcast but did spend 45 minutes on
Call Her Daddy, another top show, especially among young
women, but not a podcast known for politics.

      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 75

These moves reflect a broader pivot away from legacy media,
which continues to shed audiences. Podcasts, by contrast, are
expanding. They offer uninterrupted conversations, a sense of
one-on-one intimacy, on-demand listening, and niche
communities that can deliver targeted political messaging.

   The strategy now extends beyond campaigning. California
Gov. Gavin Newsom -- widely viewed as a potential 2028
Democratic contender -- launched his own audio and video
podcast with iHeart, available on YouTube, and features
conversations with ideological opponents such as Steve
Bannon and the late Charlie Kirk. Kentucky Gov. Andy
Beshear hosts a SiriusXM podcast aimed at creating "a space to
bring people together."

Kirk on his podcast show
76 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

Other politicians appear regularly as guests on existing shows,
using the format for extended discussions rarely afforded by
traditional media.

Echo Chamber for Falsehoods

Podcasts became a "safe space" for spreading 2024 election
fraud theories, according to Brookings Institution fellow
Valerie Wirtschafter. She told The Washington Post that
podcast hosts now wield mainstream influence: "The
microphone is bigger, the audience is larger and the trust is
even deeper." The intimacy between hosts and listeners, she
noted, creates fertile ground for misinformation.

   Wirtschafter's research suggests the problem is systemic.
Her study found that roughly one in ten popular political
podcasts contain potentially false information. Because
podcasts operate through RSS feeds and require no federal
license, virtually anyone can publish. She described the
medium as "an ideal tool to inject false or misleading
information into the mainstream discourse while going
undetected."

   Ten prominent conservative-leaning podcasts generated
most of the false or misleading claims identified in the study,
collectively reaching more than 28 million followers across
Facebook and X. Steve Bannon's War Room alone accounted
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 77

for nearly 70% of conspiracy claims and one-quarter of
unsubstantiated COVID-related assertions.

A Generational Divide

Generational shifts in media trust further complicate the
landscape. A new Pew Research Center study finds younger
adults far more likely than older ones to consider podcast
hosts, newsletter writers, or social media personalities to be
journalists.

   One Millennial told researchers: "I rely on these podcasters
and influencers... because mainstream media didn't tell me
about it." Gen Z and Millennials are also more accepting of
journalists who openly share their views. At the same time,
overall confidence in the press remains low: just 45% of adults
say journalists act in the public's best interest.

   Still, podcasting retains unusually high credibility with its
audience. An earlier Pew study found that listeners
overwhelmingly trust the news they hear on podcasts -- a
level of confidence that outstrips most other sources of
information.

   TREND: UNEVEN DIVERSITY
78 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

   IN PODCASTING

An industry that thrives on broad audiences still struggles
behind the mic.

   Podcasting has long been celebrated for its reach into
diverse audiences. Yet even as more listeners from
underrepresented communities embrace the medium, the
industry continues to fall short when it comes to who holds
the microphone.

   Surveys consistently show that listeners want podcasts that
reflect their lived experiences. Black, Hispanic, Asian,
LGBTQ+ audiences, people with disabilities, women, and
younger listeners all engage heavily with podcasting--and say
they would listen even more if hosts reflected their identities.
According to Edison Research, the racial breakdown of
monthly podcast listeners now "mirrors the U.S. population,"
underscoring how wide the audience has become.

Growing LGBTQ+ and Disability Voices

Major audio companies are leaning into this demand.
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 79

   iHeartMedia, the largest audio company in the U.S., now
offers a broad slate of LGBTQ+ podcasts spanning history, sex,
80 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

pop culture, transgender experiences, and conversations with
influential LGBTQ+ figures.

Screen capture of disability podcasts

Podcasts focusing on disability are also growing--often
created and hosted by disabled producers themselves. These
shows increasingly offer transcripts for deaf or hard-of-hearing
listeners, a need made easier with the rise of AI transcription
tools.

   For English-language podcasts, Apple's iPhone now
provides live captions, and similar options are available on
some Android devices and through Google Chrome. See
Chapter 10 for transcribing resources.

   Innovations are emerging in public media as well.
FRONTLINE produced a limited-run podcast series
interpreted entirely in American Sign Language following the
deadliest mass shooting of deaf people in U.S. history in
Lewiston, Maine. Creating each ASL-interpreted, 30-40
minute episode required eight hours of production time.

   To help diversify the field, initiatives like the Podcasting,

Explosive Growth Among Women
Listeners; Gaps in Creating

Women are reshaping podcast audiences. In the U.S., the
number of women who listen to podcasts monthly has
tripled over the past decade, now reaching roughly 60 million
listeners. These audiences skew young--39% are ages
18-34--and are more likely to be highly educated and
affluent.

   The Women's Audio Report, from Edison Research and
SiriusXM Media, finds that podcasts now reach 52% of all
women across audio and video formats. As SiriusXM's Melissa
Paris notes, investing in women's voices is simply smart
business: "Women's voices deserve to be heard and supported
as the powerful market force they truly are."
84 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

The Women's Audio Report by Edison Research
Despite this audience growth, a significant gender gap remains
in podcast creation.

   According to The Creators 2025 (Sounds Profitable),
among podcast consumers:

   · 8% of women identify as podcast creators
· 15% of men identify as podcast creators
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 85

The Creators 2025 Study, by Sounds Profitable

Women are nearly half as represented as men in the creator
space--a disparity that has long existed and continues to
underscore the need for more intentional representation and
support across the medium. Encouragingly, the same research
shows that women who do start podcasts are more likely than
men to continue producing them over time.

   This gap is especially striking given audience demand.
Female listeners consistently show strong interest in podcasts
centered on women's stories--particularly those exploring
self-care, mental health, friendships, and lived
experience--highlighting a clear opportunity for growth that
the industry has yet to fully meet.
86 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

Female-Led Networks Push Forward

New networks built by and for women are helping to close the
gap.

   Lemonada Media, founded in 2019 by Stephanie Wittels
Wach and Jess Cordova Kramer after both lost brothers to
opioid overdoses, set out to create content that "makes life
suck less." Now backed by Swedish investor PodX
Group--with leadership unchanged--Lemonada produces a
wide range of shows, from Add to Cart to the acclaimed Wiser
Than Me with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Apple's 2023 Podcast of
the Year.

   Audacy is expanding into women's sports, launching its
first broadcast series dedicated to that audience and releasing it
simultaneously as a podcast. "Women's sports are experiencing
a cultural surge--and fans are demanding more," says Audacy
VP Chris Kinard.

   In fiction, Emerald Audio is carving out a niche for female-
driven storytelling. Co-founder and bestselling author Jane
      CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS | 87

Green says the medium is ripe for growth: "There are so many
opportunities for strong, powerful stories aimed at women."

The Numbers Tell a Different Truth

Despite this progress, podcasting still shows significant
imbalances at the highest levels. A USC Annenberg study led
by Dr. Stacy L. Smith found that in the top 100 podcasts of
2024:

  · 64% of hosts were men
  · 77% were white
  · Women of color were the least likely to host
  · Nearly three-quarters of guests were men

It is the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative's first major
examination of podcasting--and its findings highlight a
medium still grappling with representation even as its audience
becomes more diverse.

   LIVE Events & TALK TV
   Podcasts

Live podcasting has quickly become a major entertainment
draw, with major venues now hosting sold-out shows. Pollstar
reports that Kill Tony became the first podcast to play
Madison Square Garden, earning $3.8 million over two nights
and selling 19,000 tickets. Comedy podcasts, with low
production costs and high demand, are leading the boom.
Ticketing sites now list podcasts alongside concerts and theater
events.

Tours from Last Podcast on the Left, Crime Junkie, and Call

from $50 to several hundred dollars, with some podcasters
earning six figures per night, according to a talent agent quoted
by Bloomberg's Ashley Carman. The true-crime hit Morbid
sold out a Boston show in two minutes. The trend is global:
the UK's The Rest Is Politics recently sold out a London arena.

   Merch sales--hoodies, hats, keychains--add another
lucrative revenue stream.

Are Podcasts Replacing Late-Night TV?

Video podcasts aren't replacing television but are increasingly
functioning like modern talk shows, especially for younger
audiences who prefer on-demand content. The shift is
upending the late-night ecosystem.

   Conan O'Brien made the jump early. His TV show averaged
280,000 viewers when it ended in 2018; his podcast now draws
1.3 million downloads per episode at far lower cost. He later
sold his Team Coco network to SiriusXM for a reported $150
million.

   By contrast, Stephen Colbert's Late Show has seen
viewership drop 30% over five years and will end in May 2026.
The program reportedly costs $100 million a year and employs
200 staffers.
90 | CHAPTER 1: PODCAST GROWTH, LANDSCAPE, & TRENDS

TV Leans into Podcasting

The migration isn't limited to late-night TV. Traditional
broadcasters are increasingly weaving podcasts into their
programming strategies. Disney Entertainment Television has
launched a slate of companion video podcasts tied to its series,
including Only Murders in the Building and Dancing with the
Stars, offering behind-the-scenes access and bonus content for
fans.

   Netflix and iHeart Media have announced a video
partnership for early 2026 to bring 15 of iHeart's biggest
shows to the streamer and removed from YouTube. iHeart
retains audio-only rights and distribution.

   Fox News has struck a licensing deal with the conservative
podcast Ruthless, a top political news source for men ages
15-45. The partnership signals how podcasts are becoming
both a talent pipeline and a content engine for television
networks looking to reach younger, digital-first audiences.

The range of podcasts today is as wide as the people who create
them, and your purpose shapes every decision that follows.

  · Are you hoping to tell an important story?
  · Build a brand for your business?
  · Establish yourself as a thought leader?
  · Or simply have fun with a passion project?
Many podcasters pursue a mix of these goals.

Podcast Tech Requirements

Photo by Jeremy Brooks on Flickr.com
At the technical level doing a podcast requires three basic steps:
96 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

   · Recording. Create an MP3 audio file--even a
smartphone works.
· RSS Feed. Upload your audio file to a hosting service, which
generates an RSS feed. RSS (Really Simple Syndication or
Rich Site Summary) is the code that lists your podcast's
directory information and tells platforms where your audio
files live.
· Podcast Directory. Paste your RSS feed into podcast
directories where listeners can find your show. You'll provide a
title, description, artwork, and other required metadata.

   What is RSS?
   RSS is the 25-year-old technology that makes podcasting
possible. These XML files use "tags" that identify a podcast's
name, author, website, and other information that directories
like Apple Podcasts and Spotify use to deliver episodes to
listeners.
   Your hosting service stores your audio and creates the RSS
feed URL. Two resources that support podcasting standards
include Podcasting2.org and the Podcast Standards Project.
You can usually find the RSS feed URL for most websites.
     CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 97

Understanding Show Formats

A podcast format is how your show content is
organized so the audience knows what to expect
each week. Several different styles are described
below and they often overlap.

     · Interview: The most common type of
        podcast is a talk format with a host
        interviewing a guest or multiple guests.
        Interviews might be done in a studio, on
        location, or over the phone. Examples
        include Death, Sex & Money, The Tim Ferriss
        Show, WTF with Marc Maron.

     · Roundtable: In this format one host talks
        with numerous guests about a single topic,
        such as in The Game Design Roundtable.

     · News Recap: Both traditional radio and
        online news organizations offer brief recaps of
        the news of the day, like NPR's Up First.

     · Co-hosted: There are usually two or more
        co-hosts who can banter with each other and
98 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

             guests. Examples include Yo, Is This
             Racist? Pardon My Take, Political Gabfest.
          · Solo: A solo podcast needs an especially
             compelling or famous host and topic because
             it's just you and the listener. It can work well
             for a niche audience with an expert discussing
             everything from politics to mountain
             climbing. Dan Carlin's Hardcore
             History involves drama, narration and twists
             in an entertaining way.
          · Scripted Nonfiction/Documentary: These
             are story-driven shows with edited interviews
             that are mixed with sounds, and music, and
             feature a host who narrates. These are true
             stories with an emotional or intellectual
             appeal - a hallmark of This American
             Life, Serial, Radio Lab, 99% Invisible
          · Scripted Hybrid or Mixed: This audio
             magazine format is highly produced with
             deep research, archival tape, and
             contemporary interviews. Slate's limited
             series Slow Burn takes the audience through
             what it was like to live through a specific time
             period - whether it be Watergate or Roe v.
             Wade.
CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 99

· Scripted Fiction: These audio dramas are
   highly produced with dialogue, actors, music,
   and sound effects with a complex story
   structure. They are much like the radio audio
   dramas of the 1930s. Welcome to
   Nightvale makes you want to binge-listen, as
   do Homecoming, The Amelia Project, We're
   Alive.

· Docu-Drama: This is a mix of drama and
   documentary that offers information in an
   entertaining way, such as Hostile Worlds.

· Repurposed Content: There are long-time
   radio shows that are being redistributed
   through podcasting, like The Ted Radio

    Narrow Your Focus

     Unless you're already an established podcaster with
     a following, it's best to create a podcast with a
     narrow focus.
     For example, instead of just focusing on farming in
     general put the spotlight on organic farming. Finding
     a niche helps build a truly interested audience.
     The creative folks over at google.prx.org advise
     making a focus statement like this:
           CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 101

     Title

and shapes audience expectations. Before locking one in,
search directories such as Apple Podcasts and Spotify to ensure
the name isn't already in use. Using a similar name may be
acceptable if it's in a different genre and not trademarked.

   Short, clear, descriptive titles often perform well because
they give listeners an immediate sense of the show's focus.
102 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

Make it SEO Friendly

Think about two to six words someone might type into a
search engine to find your show. Be specific.

   A broad title such as "Community Bulletin" lacks clarity,
while "Tenleytown Community News" signals exactly what
listeners can expect. Ask friends or neighbors for feedback.

   Clever names can be memorable but may obscure the topic.
A balance of clever and clear often works best.

Branding Names

In the broader podcast ecosystem, many companies now
produce branded podcasts as a strategic blend of marketing,
storytelling, and audience engagement. Rather than focusing
on direct sales, these shows aim to deepen brand loyalty by
          CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 103

offering listeners useful information, compelling narratives, or
a sense of community.
104 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

   The formats vary widely. Financial services companies such
as Charles Schwab publish shows that provide investment
insights and explain how politics and policy shape financial
decisions. Outdoor retailer REI features stories from
ultrarunners, hikers, and bicycle builders--content that
reinforces the company's identity as a hub for outdoor
enthusiasts. The Sephora Collection uses podcasts to explore
          CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 105

themes around self-image, confidence, and personal growth,
aligning closely with its beauty and wellness mission.

   Longer Tables works for chef and humanitarian Jose
Andres, while comedian Amy Poehler seems like a fun person
you would want to hang out with, and pop-culture and
comedy hosts Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers have fun with
"rules of culture."

   Brand-aligned names work well for established
businesses--or for those hoping to build one.
106 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

Should You Use YOUR FACE?

Celebrities, influencers, and well-known experts often feature
themselves on their cover art because they are the brand.
Public speakers and coaches benefit from this approach, too.
          CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 107

   Even without name recognition, a friendly, approachable
photo can be effective. But for some creators, using personal
imagery risks making the show feel like a vanity project unless
matched by subject-matter authority.
108 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

Help From Name Generators

If you are feeling stuck in coming up with a podcast name
there are online name generators:

  · Buzzsprout (this new free entry in 2025 also checks
      whether the name is already being used)

  · BNG
  · BizNameWiz
  · Podcast Buffs
  · Riverside Podcast Name Generator
  · AI-powered Podcast Name Generator

Before committing, check for trademark conflicts through the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office--though most podcasters
do not pursue formal registration because of the cost.

Writing a Strong DESCRIPTION

A podcast description is a concise pitch explaining what your
show is and why it matters. Think of it as the copy on a
YouTube channel page: short, sharp, and audience-focused.

   As Forbes notes, "a podcast is like a book jacket"--what
people read after your title captures their interest, and before
they decide to listen.

   A strong description also boosts searchability, so choose
keywords that match what listeners might Google about your
topic.

 Good Podcast Descriptions

  One of the best ways to create a strong podcast
  description of your own is to look carefully at the
  descriptions used by other podcasts, especially your
  show favorites or ones that broadly cover your own
  topic and niche.
110 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

     Diversifying: "Does it feel like the financial system is
     stacked against you? For many of us, it is. Especially
     if you're Black or Brown, a woman, or single. In
     Diversifying, we explore why the traditional rules of
     money management no longer apply to new
     generations. Hosted by Delyanne Barros, better
     known as Delyanne The Money Coach, Diversifying
     demystifies and humanizes money by examining the
     culture we make it in and how to make it work for
     you."

     Business Wars: "Netflix vs. HBO. Nike vs. Adidas.
     Business is war. Sometimes the prize is your wallet
     or your attention. Sometimes, it's just the fun of
     beating the other guy. The outcome of these battles
     shapes what we buy and how we live. Business
     Wars gives you the unauthorized, real story of what
     drives these companies and their leaders, inventors,
     investors, and executives to new heights -- or to
     ruin."

     Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris: "Dan Harris is
     a fidgety, skeptical journalist who had a panic attack
     on live national television, which led him to try
     something he otherwise never would have
     considered: meditation. He went on to write the
     bestselling book, 10% Happier. On this show, Dan
           CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 111

     talks with eminent meditation teachers, top
     scientists, and even the odd celebrity. On some
     episodes, Dan ventures into the deep end of the
     pool, covering subjects such as enlightenment and
     psychedelics. On other episodes, it's science-based
     techniques for issues such as anxiety, productivity,
     and relationships. Dan's approach is seemingly
     modest but secretly radical: happiness is a skill you
     can train, just like working your bicep in the gym.
     Your progress may be incremental at first, but like
     any good investment, it compounds over time."
     How I Built This with Guy Raz: "Guy Raz dives into
     the stories behind some of the world's best known
     companies. How I Built This weaves a narrative
     journey about innovators, entrepreneurs and
     idealists--and the movements they built."

EPISODE Description

While a show description attracts subscribers, an episode
description convinces someone to press play. Keep these short
and compelling, with clear titles--and artwork if you have the
resources.

   For example, TIME magazine's Person of the Week changes
episode art to reflect each guest. Smaller teams may stick with
112 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

standard show art, which Apple Podcasts will automatically
display.
           CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 113

How LONG Should A Podcast Be?

Listeners value consistency. They want to know whether your
episodes run 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour so they can
114 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

fit them into routines like commuting or exercising. The show
doesn't need a rigid broadcast-style runtime, but maintaining
a typical range helps both your audience and your production
workflow

        Photo by Swag Photography on Unsplash.com

Research benchmarks:
   · Average time spent listening: 22 minutes

· U.S. average commute: 26 minutes
· Average podcast length: 38 minutes, 42 seconds
(Cloudincome.com)

   Some formats push the limits--The Longest Podcast in the
World ran 36 hours; Hardcore History averages more than
three hours; The Joe Rogan Experience runs about three.

   For most shows, 20-45 minutes is a solid target.
When students create their first podcasts, I recommend
10-15 minutes to keep the storytelling tight.

Video `Supersizes' Podcast Length

Podcast lengths are notably increasing in one particular area,
video podcasts on YouTube. While the Joe Rogan talk fest may
be the best known, several others follow the simple format of
sitting in a chair and talking while on camera.
           CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 117

Shannon Sharpe chats with Michael Irvin on Club Shay Shay

Other `supersized' video podcasts include: This Past Weekend
w/Theo Von, running 2 hours; Club Shay, Shay over 2 hours;
the Shawn Ryan Show runs 3-4 hours; (see a profile of the
conservative podcaster from Mother Jones), and the Lex
Fridman Podcast runs 3-5 hours.

   YouTube says a billion people a month viewed podcasts
on the platform. About 30% of people play video in the
background while doing other things but another half actively
watch videos and may be streaming the content to their living
room TV screen.

   Marshall Lewy from the podcast network, Wondery, told
the New York Times, "I think podcasts could become kind
of the new basic cable television." The podcasts build upon
themselves thanks to YouTube's recommendation algorithm
that suggests other podcasts to viewers.
118 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

Podcast SEASONS

Another strategy to make podcasting a bit easier to do is to
put content into seasons like what is done in entertainment
television. Seasons were used for popular podcasts like Serial
or S-town, which was told in seven episodes.

Producers find it liberating to air several months of shows
instead of having a weekly grind. A break allows them to
refresh their creative juices and helps show consistency,
promotion, and monetization. It can also be another
opportunity to highlight "evergreen" shows that are not dated
by time.

   You decide how often to offer your podcast; just be sure
to let your audience know the schedule. It's better to start
           CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 119

slowly instead of realizing too late that putting out two shows
a week is too much. Once you understand all the moving parts
-- hosting, scripting, recording, editing, distribution and
promotion -- you'll have a more realistic view of how many
shows you can do.

Podcast Cover ARTWORK

Your podcast's visual identity often determines whether
listeners discover your show. Make the artwork clear,
compelling, and visually legible--especially at the tiny size
displayed on mobile apps.

   Tip #1: Study the competition.
Look at similar shows in your genre, Apple Podcasts' New and
Noteworthy, or top charts for inspiration.
120 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

   Tip #2: Tell a story at a glance.
Artwork should immediately communicate your topic--like a
book cover does.
CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 121
122 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

   Tip #3: Use contrast.
Bold colors make artwork stand out on small screens.
Researcher Satyendra Singh notes that color strongly
influences mood and first impressions. Podcast genres often
develop color trends: Pacific Content's Dan Misener found
yellow "pops," blue is common, and black-and-white (with red
           CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 123

accents) conveys mystery or true crime, as seen in Dr. Death
and My Favorite Murder.
124 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

   Established brands such as NPR often don't use much
artwork, just strong colors and readable fonts.
CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC | 125
126 | CHAPTER 2: TITLE, DESCRIPTION, COVER ART, MUSIC

   Tip #4: Test artwork at mobile size.
If it's unreadable as a tiny icon, revise.

   Tip #5: Keep words to a minimum.

Episode Artwork

While Apple requires artwork for all podcast shows, episode
artwork is optional and some podcasts do create artwork for
individual show episodes. Apple Podcasts offers a guide on
using chapter-specific artwork.

Free Photo Art & Illustrations

There are free stock photo sites from which you can get an
image, but it may be used so frequently that it doesn't help
your podcast stand out. Some royalty-free photos are available
from Creative Commons images or ones on Unsplash, Burst,
Pexels.

   Finding free illustrations that work for your podcast is
difficult, but look at drawKit, OUCH and Flaticon for some
free illustrations of humans as well as paid subscriptions.

or end of episodes--but copyright laws are strict. In most
countries, copyright lasts 70 years after the creator's death. Fair
use applies narrowly.

Producing a podcast doesn't require a professional studio. For
most beginners, the essential tools include a microphone,
computer, internet connection, and basic editing software.
Budget, experience, and personal preference will influence
your choices, but this guide emphasizes free or low-cost
options.

   There are three primary microphone styles--handheld,
stand, and lavalier--each with its own advantages. These
should not be confused with a microphone's pickup pattern,
which determines how sound enters the mic and is explained
later.

Recording Basics:

  · Microphone
  · Mic stand
  · Headphones

Advanced Recording:

  · Pop Filter/Windscreen
  · Shock Mount
  · Field Recorders
  · Mixers
146 | CHAPTER 3: MICROPHONES, RECORDERS, FILTERS

Recording can be as simple as using your smartphone or as
advanced as working in a professional studio. Many schools,
universities, and businesses also offer access to professional-
level equipment.
              CHAPTER 3: MICROPHONES, RECORDERS, FILTERS | 147

Smartphone Recording
A smartphone app can function as a basic recording device.
On the iPhone, Voice Memo works well for interviews and
narration; Android phones offer similar built-in or low-cost
apps.

   Audio quality has improved so much that some professional
reporters now rely entirely on smartphones. Neal Augenstein
of WTOP radio in Washington, D.C. famously pioneered the
iPhone-only workflow for newsgathering.

   If you record on your phone, regularly offload files to an
external hard drive so the audio doesn't consume device or
computer storage.
148 | CHAPTER 3: MICROPHONES, RECORDERS, FILTERS

            Photo by Sara Kurfess on Unsplash.com
Smartphones work well for solo narration. However, if you're
recording multiple people or gathering ambient sound, you'll
likely need additional equipment.

Microphones & Sound Quality

While computers include built-in microphones, they often
produce distant, hollow audio that quickly fatigues listeners.
              CHAPTER 3: MICROPHONES, RECORDERS, FILTERS | 149

   Significant improvements come from:

  · Using an external mic (recommendations below)
  · Recording into a digital audio recorder
  · Using your smartphone as a dedicated recorder
  · Using earbuds with mic (quality varies widely)
  · Recording a double-ender (explained in Ch. 4)

Handheld microphones work well in the field or at home when
used with a mic stand or boom arm.

Low-Cost, Good Quality Mics

There are two types of microphone - dynamic and condenser.
Dynamic mics are recommended for most at-home podcasters
because they can produce great sound without extensive
soundproofing. They are more forgiving in rejecting
background noise.

   Budget-friendly dynamic microphones include the Samson
Q2U and the ATR2100 (if available). Both are popular
because they offer USB and XLR connections, allowing
podcasters to grow into more advanced setups without
replacing their microphone. USB plugs directly into your
computer, while XLR is used with audio recorders or mixers
for higher-end setups.
150 | CHAPTER 3: MICROPHONES, RECORDERS, FILTERS

ATR2100 by Jill Olmsted

               CHAPTER 3: MICROPHONES, RECORDERS, FILTERS | 151

     Samson QU2 Mic and Podcasting Kit
The MAONO cardioid dynamic mic (around $60) is another
solid option, focusing on sound in front of the mic while
minimizing background noise.

   For value, consider streaming/podcasting bundles like this
Audio-Technica package, which starts around $70 and
includes a USB/XLR mic, headphones, and an adjustable
boom arm. Many packages also include windscreens or
tripods.

   Condenser mics offer higher sensitivity but typically require
a sound-treated space and tend to cost more.

                      Equipment

     To find the best equipment for your needs, online
     reviews can be helpful but note that reviewers can
     be influenced if they receive a fee from the
     manufacturer.

          · ATR 2100 $80 (Audio Technica); has both USB
             and XLR connections.

          · Samson QU2 $70 has both USB and XLR
             connections.

          · MAONO $60 has both USB and XLR
             connections.

          · RØDE NT-USB Mini $99 has a USB
             connection.

          · Yeti $100; has a USB connection and several
             recording pattern options.

          · FIFINE XLR $80 an XLR & USB connection
             (this model with Boom arm stand); mic stand
             model for $55, even with sales less than $25

          · Foam ball windscreen for microphone $4;

          · Rode Procaster $229, needs an XLR capable.
          · Shure MV7+ $299, USB-C & XLR capable.
     On the Road Mics
     Podnews editor James Cridland does a lot of travel
     and needs to record in noisy coffee shops or a show
     floor and to pack efficiently. He turned to the Shure
     MV88+, ($219) a tiny, hand-held mic that travels
     well. He describes how he records with it.

Microphone Options

In addition to handheld mics like the ATR2100, many
podcasters use variations of the Yeti microphone. After 28
years, Logitech retired the well-known Blue Yeti logo, but the
mic remains widely available. I use it because I can switch
among pickup patterns based on the recording scenario:

   · Cardioid for solo recording
· Bidirectional for in-person interviews
154 | CHAPTER 3: MICROPHONES, RECORDERS, FILTERS

   The Yeti includes its own stand and connects via USB. It can
also be mounted on a boom arm with a shock mount, though
its weight requires a sturdy arm--often costing around $100.

Lavalier Microphones

Lavalier microphones capture direct sound because they clip
onto a speaker's clothing and connect to an audio recorder or
mobile phone. But most lavs use an omnidirectional pickup
pattern, meaning they gather sound from all directions--a
potential distraction for podcast-quality audio.

   Still, lavalier mics are a strong option for video podcasts,
where mobility and unobtrusive placement matter. Budget-
friendly choices include the BOYA Mini, while pricier wireless
158 | CHAPTER 3: MICROPHONES, RECORDERS, FILTERS

systems such as the RODE Wireless Micro and RODE
Wireless PRO offer broader compatibility with smartphones,
computers, recorders, DSLRs, and other gear. As with most
audio tools, it may take testing different models to find the best
fit.

Mic Pickup Patterns

Every microphone has a built-in pickup pattern that
determines how it captures sound--something you can't judge
by simply looking at the mic.

  · Cardioid mics capture sound mainly from the front and
      are ideal for solo podcasting.

  · Bidirectional mics pick up sound from the front and
      back, making them useful for interviews.

  · Omnidirectional mics capture sound from all
      directions and are less suited for controlled podcast
      environments.

  · Broadcast journalists also often rely on shotgun
      microphones, which pick up narrowly from the front
      while rejecting noise from the sides and rear.

Pop Filters

In recording audio a noise protection tool is used to protect
against harsh noises. Pop filters--also called pop shields,
windscreens, or dead cats--reduce plosive sounds created by
letters like p, b, t, d, k, and g.

   Transom provides clear examples showing how dramatically
these filters can improve recordings. They are inexpensive and
worth adding to any setup.
In a pinch, you can make your own filter using a wire hanger
and pantyhose, or even paper or tissue paper.

                                                                 Photo by

Shock Mounts

For handheld microphones, a sturdy mic stand or shock
mount can minimize vibration and handling noise. Shock

mounts aren't essential for beginners, and some are already
included in starter mic packages.

Headphones For Recording & Editing

Headphones are essential for both interview recording and
editing. They allow you to hear audio issues that computer
speakers often miss. Earbuds work, but they are built more for
gaming or casual listening than for podcast production. Over-
ear headphones provide the best monitoring capability.
               CHAPTER 3: MICROPHONES, RECORDERS, FILTERS | 161

           Closed-back Headphones

     If your budget allows, invest in "cans" or closed-back
     headphones that go over your ears for better
     quality.

          · Audio-Technica ATH-M20x $49
          · Samson SR950 $70; Shure SRH440 $99

Digital Audio Recorders

Digital recorders range from budget-friendly models like the
Zoom H1n to more advanced devices from Tascam, Sony, and
Marantz. If you plan long sessions, purchase additional
memory cards--starter cards often fill quickly.

   Keep in mind that you will need to buy multimedia cards if
you plan to record for a longer period of time than the memory
card has which comes with the recorder.

     echo-free remote call-ins and separate headphone
     feeds for all your guests; the next generation.
     Here's a video look at the features.

Recording with 2 or More

Audio production becomes more complex when more than
one or two people are involved. While USB microphones are
popular for their plug-and-play convenience, most computers
struggle to recognize multiple USB mics
              CHAPTER 3: MICROPHONES, RECORDERS, FILTERS | 165

simultaneously--especially if the mics are identical, like two
Yetis.

Audio Mixer

To work around this, many podcasters turn to an audio
interface or mixer, which bridges microphones and
computers and supports multiple XLR inputs. The interface
connects to the computer via USB or Thunderbolt, and
recordings are captured through audio software.

   Interfaces like the Zoom Podtrak, Focusrite Scarlett or
Tascam models are widely used but can be costly for beginners.
Look for online reviews comparing price and functionality
across mixer options.

RØDE Connect for 1 Computer +
Multiple Mics

RØDE Connect is a free software platform that allows up
to four microphones to connect on a single computer. But,
it works best with the company's NT-USB+ mini mic which
costs $100. YouTube videos with explain how to use the
software with other mics, but doing so usually requires
additional apps.

guide to using VoiceMeeter alongside Audacity.

Mini Production Studio

Another option for multi-mic recording is the RODECaster
Pro, a compact production console with four XLR inputs,
a USB computer connection, and onboard sound effects
(around $400). The upgraded RODECaster Pro II runs closer
to $700.

Why Audio Quality Matters

Podcast audiences expect--and deserve--clean, consistent
sound. Creators can deliver professional-sounding audio even
on a budget, but it requires time, attention to basic
soundproofing, the use of an external microphone, and proper
recording technique.

   Research consistently shows listeners tune out when audio
is muddy, uneven, or marred by distractions such as hissing,
popping p's, or room echo. Poor audio doesn't just irritate
listeners; it reflects poorly on the creator and diminishes the
message.

174 | CHAPTER 4: BEST PRACTICES FOR RECORDING

Studies from the Mind & Society Center at USC underscore
how high-quality audio also shapes credibility. "The findings
are significant amid the recent rise of fake news and public
distrust in science," said co-director Norbert Schwarz.

How To Soundproof For Recording

A professional studio is built to deaden noise, but most people
record in homes, offices, or improvised spaces. Assume any
environment will need some acoustic help. A quick test: clap
your hands. If you hear an echo, the space is reverberating and
needs treatment.

   Fortunately, you can create an effective makeshift studio
almost anywhere--and very cheaply. Journalists on the road
have long built mini-studios out of necessity.

                                                                 Photos

When there's no time for that, reporters improvise: draping a
blanket or jacket over their heads or recording inside a parked
car (if traffic noise is minimal). Transom and Soundproof

Create Your Own Home Recording

Choose a small room or closet with soft surfaces--carpet,
drapes, low ceilings. Avoid kitchens, bathrooms, and other
hard-surface areas. To further deaden sound, get creative:
record inside a closet, build a blanket tent, or place a towel over
your head while narrating.

foam, or invest in a sound isolation box like the one used at
Double R Productions in Washington, D.C.

    Steps for Good Sound Quality

          · Deaden Sound: Record in a location where
             the sound can't bounce and there are sound-
             deadening materials such as draperies and
             carpet. You can also buy or make a small box
             with foam covers and put the microphone
             inside it while recording.

          · Mic Placement: Have the recorder or
             microphone a fist away from the speaker's
             mouth and speak across the mic rather than
             directly into it to minimize popping plosives.
             Minimize handling noise by keeping the
             recorder still, using a mic stand, or putting the
             recorder on some books at mouth level.

          · Mic Pickup Pattern: It's helpful to know
             the pickup pattern of a mic (cardioid,
             omnidirectional, front-and-back), so you don't
             talk into the wrong side! On some mics, like
                    CHAPTER 4: BEST PRACTICES FOR RECORDING | 181

             the Yeti, you can flip a switch to select the
             recording pattern you want to use.
          · Use Headphones: Using headphones or
             earbuds when recording helps avoid echo and
             sound bleed.
          · Room Tone: Radio reporters know there's
             ambient sound in the room even though it
             may sound silent to you. To fix this they
             record what is known as "room tone" and use
             that ambiance in multitrack mixing to add
             some polish.

Before choosing equipment or apps, it's important to hear the
difference between good and poor audio.

the second is hollow, as if the speaker isn't addressing the
microphone properly.

Using External Microphones

As noted in Chapter 3, an external microphone almost always
outperforms a computer's built-in mic.

   To ensure your microphone is correctly recognized or `seen'
by your computer, go to audio preferences and select the
proper device input--for example, the ATR2100-USB.

Educating Guests On Audio Quality

Your guests may not be familiar with recording basics. Brief
them on simple steps--finding a quiet space, using
headphones, and positioning their microphone correctly.
184 | CHAPTER 4: BEST PRACTICES FOR RECORDING

Make the process as easy as possible and avoid overwhelming
them with technical details.

    Discuss with Podcast Guest

          · External Mic: Do you have an external USB
             microphone? (The sound is always better than
             using a computer's built-in mic).

          · Airplane Mode: If the guest is using their
             smartphone ask them to put it on airplane
             mode during recording to avoid the
             interruption from an incoming call.

          · Earbuds: Do you have earbuds or
             headphones? (to avoid feedback if you're
             recording yourself in the interview). If you
             don't have a USB external mic, you can use
             the built-in mic on Apple or other earbuds.

          · Recording Space: Do you have a fairly quiet
             space? Suggest a room with carpet, rugs, or
             drapes and away from kitchens with tile,
             concrete and lots of glass. Or inform them
             how to build a pillow fort.

          · Avoid Squeaky Chairs: Swivel chairs are
             notorious for having small squeaks and those
             sounds will be picked up by the recorder so
                   CHAPTER 4: BEST PRACTICES FOR RECORDING | 185

             offer your guest that gentle advice.

using the voice memo app on their phones, while listening to
                   CHAPTER 4: BEST PRACTICES FOR RECORDING | 189

each other on a second device (FaceTime, Skype, Zoom, or
even a landline). Afterward, the guest sends the audio file to
the interviewer, who merges the tracks during editing.

REMOTE RECORDING:
Videoconferencing

Videoconferencing apps like Zoom have long been staples for
podcasters, offering free basic versions and simple guest access.
Zoom emails you an MP4 file for editing after the session.
Skype, while popular, generally doesn't meet audio quality
standards for modern podcasts.
196 | CHAPTER 4: BEST PRACTICES FOR RECORDING

   During the pandemic, Zoom became ubiquitous for
schools, businesses, and podcasters. The free plan has a
40-minute limit, but you can restart as needed. Consider
disabling video to save bandwidth, or keep it on if visual
connection helps the conversation. Always use security
measures--passwords, waiting rooms--to prevent
"Zoombombing."

   Zoom Sound Quality
   Zoom recordings can be quite good when both parties use
external microphones. Even cell-phone guests can sound
decent. Zoom also allows separate audio tracks, making it
easier to edit out coughs and background noises.

How to Use Zoom to Record Remote
Interviews

     · The host goes to Zoom.US to create an
        account and click on Sign Up, It's Free to
        create an account.

     · Download the Zoom software to your
        computer (only the host needs to do this, not
        the guest), and it takes under 30 seconds.

     · Connect any external microphone before
        opening up Zoom (this helps the software
        "see" the mic).

     · Before getting into the call the host should
        adjust settings by going to the Zoom menu in
        the taskbar. Go to Preferences, which brings
        up Settings, scroll to Audio and look
        under Microphone so make sure your
        external microphone is connected.

     · Scroll down to Recording and make sure to
        store your recording on the desktop (or
        wherever you want).

     · Also, click to select Record a Separate file
        for each participant.

     · Under the Video tab, turn off Video to save
        bandwidth if you don't want video.
198 | CHAPTER 4: BEST PRACTICES FOR RECORDING

          · Now you can click on the X in the upper right
             corner to get out of Settings.

          · Now the host can schedule a meeting by just
             clicking on New Meeting and then sending
             the invite to guests; or, you can schedule a
             meeting to come in the future.

          · The guest is sent a Zoom invite and they can
             either click the link to join via computer; or
             can dial in via the phone number and meeting
             ID; they should wear headphones/earbuds.

          · Once the guest joins in, click
             the Record button at the bottom of the Zoom
             window, there are two options: Record on
             this Computer is for the free version; you
             will need to pay to Record to the Cloud.

          · Click Stop button to end the recording, but
             you can still talk with the guest.

          · Once you click End Meeting, Zoom will begin
             to export your recordings to your desktop in a
             file folder. Inside will be subfolders with the
             audio files being .m4a and video would be a
             .mp4.

REMOTE RECORDING: Paid
Web-based Platforms

Some paid platforms offer free tiers worth exploring but some
will expire after 90 days. Many of my students have had
positive experiences with Zencastr's free version; Resonate
Recordings provides a video review and tutorial.

   Other respected options include SquadCast and Riverside.

REMOTE RECORDING: Paid Tape
                   CHAPTER 4: BEST PRACTICES FOR RECORDING | 203

Syncers

Public radio has long relied on freelancers known as tape
syncers--professionals who go to a guest's location with their
own equipment. If a guest is comfortable with an in-person
visit, you can find tape syncers via listservs or organizations like
AIR (Association of Independents in Radio). Costs typically
start around $150.

Best Practices for Multi-Person
Recording

Managing multiple hosts or guests requires both technical
planning and conversational discipline.
204 | CHAPTER 4: BEST PRACTICES FOR RECORDING

   In person: Use nonverbal cues--leaning toward the mic,
raising a finger--to signal you want to speak.

   Remote, without video: Listen closely and avoid talking
over others. Deliberate turn-taking keeps the audio--and the
narrative--clean.

    Chapter 5: The Art of the Interview
                           CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW | 209

A Record-Breaking Conversation

In the summer of 2025, a podcast conversation with Taylor
Swift--the biggest pop star on the planet--flowed freely for
nearly two hours on the popular New Heights podcast.

   The hit show, hosted by her boyfriend, three-time Super
Bowl winner Travis Kelce, and his brother, shattered its own
performance records, drawing nearly nine million views on
YouTube in just 12 hours.

   Swift's appearance set a Guinness World Record for the
most concurrent views for a podcast on YouTube, peaking at
1.3 million. It also earned her a spot on the platform's icon
list. On Spotify, streams surged 2,500% and female listenership
jumped 618%.

210 | CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

Celebrities Find Safe Spaces on
Podcasts

Swifties know the star rarely sits down with mainstream
media, preferring to let her music do the talking. But like other
high-profile figures, she has recognized that podcasts offer
something traditional interviews often cannot: a safer, less
confrontational space with time to shape your own story.

   Swift used that room to discuss her new album, her love of
baking sourdough bread, and more personal topics--from her
father's health to how Kelce joked about using his podcast as a
personal dating app.

   An interview environment that lets guests retain some
narrative control becomes even more appealing when the host
is another A-lister.

   That dynamic helps fuel the popularity of newer shows like
Good Hang with Amy Poehler and long-standing celebrity-led
hits including Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert and the actor-
host trio of Smartless. These conversational, longer-form
shows--often led by people with no journalism
training--have made many guests comfortable enough to
open up about personal issues, including mental health.
                            CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW | 211

   Country star Jelly Roll has spent hours on The Joe Rogan
Experience and other shows, helping reshape public perception
"from a young, incarcerated father to Grammy-nominated
musician," as Bloomberg's Ashley Carmen reports.

   Political figures have taken note, too. Ahead of the last
election cycle, the White House and major candidates
strategically sought out podcast appearances to speak directly
to voters. A Rogan episode featuring then-presidential
candidate Donald Trump drew 12 million views on YouTube
in its first 12 hours.

An Honor to be Asked

Of course, few podcasters will find themselves interviewing
global headliners. Most shows rely on everyday people--those
212 | CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

with extraordinary experiences, specialized knowledge, strong
opinions, sharp humor, or simply great relatability. The key
is booking guests who bring something meaningful to your
audience, not just someone who's easy to secure.

   New hosts may feel uneasy about inviting guests, but
remember: the worst response you can get is "no." Most people
are flattered to be asked to share their insights. Respect their
time, keep communication clear, and help them understand
how recording works if they're unfamiliar.

Experience Shows

Good interviewing is a craft learned through repetition.
Podcasting is an intimate form of storytelling--your voice is
literally in someone's ear--so you want to offer substance,
entertainment, and enough connection that listeners return
for the next episode.

   Brad Mielke, host of ABC News' Start Here, has published
more than 2,000 episodes and says he learns something new
every day--about the world and about storytelling. His biggest
lesson: "talk like a freaking person."

Remote Interviewing Challenges

Remote interviews became the norm during the pandemic,
but they can be tricky because it's easier to miss in-person
cues. (See Chapter 4 for details on conducting remote phone
interviews.)

   Still, experienced hosts have conducted successful remote
conversations for decades. Peabody Award-winning Fresh Air
host Terry Gross rarely conducts face-to-face interviews from
her Philadelphia studio.
216 | CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

Gross says remote conversations allow her to take notes, flip
through books, and find quotes without the pressure of
maintaining eye contact--comments she shared at a National
Press Club Journalism Institute event in Washington, D.C.

   Additional tips on remote interviewing are available
through the International Journalists' Network.
                            CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW | 217

Be Welcoming & Break The Ice

As host or producer, it's your job to help guests feel safe and at
ease.

Photo by Robert Zunikoff on Unsplash.com
Before the formal interview begins, warm up with informal
conversation--the weather, a recent headline, or even a simple:
"What first got you excited about this topic?"

   This helps build rapport, relax the guest, and allows you to
test audio levels. If recording in person, offer bottled water;
nerves can make people unexpectedly thirsty.
218 | CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

Be Curious

Connection starts with curiosity. Preparation shows
respect--for both guest and audience. Research helps you
craft questions that are relevant, informed, and more likely to
spark meaningful conversation.

               Photo by Elijah O'Donnell on
               Unsplash.com
Skilled hosts may sound spontaneous, but most have pre-
                           CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW | 219

planned questions or themes to keep the episode engaging.
Newer hosts especially benefit from having a structured
roadmap.

   Some veteran interviewers prefer to avoid prepared
questions, believing it keeps conversations fresh and audience-
centered. But until you've built substantial experience, some
preparation is essential.

Coach Your Guest -- Tell A Story

You never tell a guest what to say -- but you can help them
prepare to say it well.

   Encourage them to think of memorable stories or vivid
anecdotes. If you're interviewing a national correspondent,
give advance notice that you'd love to hear about their most
unforgettable assignment. If your guest is an athlete, ask them
to recall their most inspiring sports moment--perhaps, say,
watching Lindsey Vonn become the first American woman to
win Olympic downhill gold.
220 | CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

            BY 2.0
When guests have time to reflect, their stories tend to be deeper
and more candid. Professional journalists typically avoid
sharing exact questions in advance, but they do outline general
themes.
                            CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW | 221

Be A Good Listener

Active listening is one of the strongest compliments you can
give a guest.

Photo by Soundtrap on Unsplash.com
Pick up on their points, offer observations, and ask thoughtful
follow-ups. This keeps the conversation dynamic and may
require you to set aside your planned questions. But that can
be hard when so many things are going on at the same time
you're taping a conversation.

Open-Ended Questions

Good conversations rely on questions that invite reflection,
not yes-or-no answers.
222 | CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

   Try:
   "How did this unfold?"
"Can you walk us through that moment?"
Instead of: "Are you happy?" consider: "What brings you the
most joy these days?"

Photo from Unsplash.com
Questions should solicit answers with some thought instead
of a simple yes-or-no answer. Listeners love stories, and open-
ended questions are the gateway.
                           CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW | 223

Think Outside The Box

Ask the essential questions first to establish clarity. Then
explore themes that surprise or illuminate.

Photo by Diana Parkhouse on Unsplash.com
Political analyst David Axelrod often opens The Axe Files by
asking guests about their upbringing. The late James Lipton
used similar techniques on Inside the Actors Studio, grounding
big names in deeply personal origin stories.

Don't Be Afraid Of Silence

Many interviewers panic during pauses and rush to fill them.
224 | CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

Photo by Kristina Flour on Unsplash.com
But silence can be strategic. After a few seconds, guests often
add deeper reflections. As the late Jim Lehrer noted: "The
other person will either expand on what he's already said or
he'll go in a different direction... you get a clear view into his
head and heart."

A Conversation Turner

If a guest begins to ramble or drift, a "conversation turner" can
refocus the discussion.
                           CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW | 225

Photo by Daiga Ellaby on Unsplash.com
For example: "Let's go back to when you were laid off from
that first reporting job--did it shake your confidence?"

   It's the interviewer's responsibility to steer, clarify, and
reenergize the conversation.

Body Language

When interviewing in person or on camera, watch for
nonverbal cues--smiles, discomfort, tension, fidgeting.
226 | CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

Photo from Unsplash.com
Sensitive topics may reveal themselves through subtle
reactions. These cues help you decide whether to delve deeper
or ease off.

Create A Signature Question

A memorable strategy is developing a signature question tied
to your show's theme. A cooking podcast might ask every guest
who inspired their love of food. A book podcast might close
with summer reading recommendations.
                           CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW | 227

The podcast Finding Our Way uses a signature question for all
guests.

228 | CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

Ending The Interview

Journalists often end by asking: "Is there anything else you'd like
to add?" It gives guests space for final reflections.

   Avoid abrupt endings--listeners appreciate an intentional
conclusion, much like the satisfying final beat of a good film or
book.

   A bad ending is when you just stop talking -- that's not an
ending but just the end of the conversation. Instead, create the
opportunity for a strong ending, and make it memorable. We
all enjoy a surprise or unusual ending to a great book or movie
and podcasts can do the same

Even more important is to thank your guests both on-air and
                           CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW | 229

in some personal way for taking their time to come to speak on
your podcast.

   At Podcast Movement, Steve Pratt co-presented the thank
you strategy for one of Facebook's original podcasts. Each
guest got a personal note and promotional swag that includes
a personalized poster, buttons, shirts, stickers, and pins.

Facebook thank you swag, presented by Pacific Content

While most of us don't have the kind of budget to pay for such
gifts, we can and should show appreciation with a personal
thank you. That's also a good time to make sure you send them
an easy way to listen to and share the podcast.
230 | CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW

Ask Guests To Share The Podcast

There is usually a time lag of several weeks between recording
interviews and the completed podcast.

   When your show is ready send an email to guests to ask for
their help in sharing it with their networks and friends. Make it
easy for them by sending links to the podcast, along with social
media posts and audiograms you may have created.

                Sample Letter to Guests

             Hi (Guest)
             I'm delighted to let you know that (episode
             title) has been published and will be available
             (when).
             I would really appreciate if you could share it
             with your network of contacts and friends to
             get the word out about the show. I also have
             social media links and an audiogram available.
                            CHAPTER 5: THE ART OF THE INTERVIEW | 231

                  · Insert podcast link
                  · Insert social media posts
                  · Insert audiogram
             I can't thank you enough for coming on my
             show and sharing your wonderful insights, it
             was a pleasure!
             (your name)

Pitch Yourself To Podcasts

You can also use email to seek your own guest opportunities.
Keep your pitch polite, concise, and focused on what you can
offer their audience--not what the appearance will do for
you. Include a press kit and a few topical ideas.

Live-On-Tape

Most podcasts are edited programs yet interviews often sound
live because they're recorded "live-on-tape"--capturing the
natural rhythm of conversation, then editing for clarity and
pacing. Recording this way helps calm nervous guests and new
hosts, and it lets you cut long tangents or awkward pauses.

   But don't fix every small stumble; a touch of imperfection
keeps the conversation spontaneous and human.

Podcast show planning spans three overlapping stages, each
requiring creative decision-making:

     Pre-Production
     This is your planning phase: choosing a podcast title,
     description, cover art, show format, and typical
     length. It's where your concept takes shape.
    CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 237

Production
Production involves writing scripts--whether fully
scripted or in bullet-point form--recording
interviews, gathering field sound, and editing raw
audio.

Think like a radio reporter: capture sound where the
action happens -- from oyster harvesting to
someone tending a sustainable garden. On-scene
interviews and natural sound coming from a street
protest can bring powerful immediacy to a story.

Post-Production
This is the refinement stage: polishing edits, mixing
sound, adding transitions and music, publishing the
episode, and planning promotion.

Be A Fan & Listen To Other
Podcasts
          CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 239

You're probably creating your own podcast because you've
been a fan of listening to podcasts.

   But now you must listen as a podcast producer. Study how
other shows are put together, especially within your genre or
format. This will help you decide your own style, budget, and
production capabilities.

   Chapter 1 outlines tools for finding new podcasts beyond
traditional listening apps.

Deconstructing Podcasts

If you want to create a podcast, then listen to shows in the
same category (fiction or nonfiction); the same genre (sports,
mental health, pop culture, religion); and the same format
240 | CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS

(interview, monologue, co-host, roundtable, storytelling/
investigative) to see how others have put together their shows.

   It's helpful if you can find a transcript for the podcast but
you can also use technology to quickly transcribe a show, as
outlined in Chapter 9.

    Basic Criteria In Podcast Deconstruction

     Listen carefully & take notes to decipher how
     podcasts are put together:

          · The podcast name - does the name tell you
             what the podcast topic is about?

          · Is the podcast description accurate to what
             you heard? What about the episode
             description, if there is one?

          · Is there music? How long and where is the
             music used in the podcast and does it match
             the tone of the podcasts?

          · What is the podcast open? Is there a
             standard pre-taped open with music? Does
             the host just dive into the interview or do
             they use an edited clip from later in the
             interview to draw your interest in staying
             around to listen?
CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 241

 · How does the host handle the show episode
    opening?

 · How does the host handle introductions of
    guests and topics?

 · How does the host transition from one topic
    or interview to another?

 · Does the podcast artwork fit the theme of
    the podcast?

 · How interesting or compelling is the
    content? Does the podcast use audio clips to
    illustrate points they're trying to make?

 · How well is the technical portion of the
    podcast done? Think about audio quality and
    speaking clarity.

 · Does the podcast have disclaimers, to advise
    about explicit or disturbing content?

242 | CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS

             announcements?
          · Does the host ask for show reviews and

             how?
          · How does the show end? Does the host

             tease what is coming in the next show?
          · What is one thing that you DO or DO NOT

             want to imitate?

Script or Ad-Lib?

Scripting should always be done to some degree. It's a guide
for getting across your key message while also leaving room
for your personality. Even shows that seem spontaneous have
usually been planned and written out and take one of these
various forms:

   Word-for-word Script - you write the way you talk and
read the script. This makes sure you cover specific points and
cuts down on post-production time.

   Ad-lib - you wing it at the moment. Pros can make this
seem easy but in reality, it's very hard to do well without lots of
experience.

   Outline - an outline is a hybrid between the script and
ad-lib; with bullet points for key talking points and a plan to
smoothly transition from one area to the next.

Script Writing Tips

Scripting keeps interview podcasts on track, allowing the host
to fill in the gaps when a story goes too long or sideways. This
is where the hard work of producing a podcast comes into play
because a well-edited podcast takes time for the producer-host
to accomplish, doing the interview is just the starting point.

   Public radio uses the term "driveway moment" to describe
listeners who arrive home but stay in their cars to hear the
end of a story because it's so captivating. But achieving such a
storytelling moment doesn't come without a lot of hard work
in scripting -- and involves writing a setup to the story to build
interest, having strong story elements to solidify flow, with a
strong lead and a satisfying ending.

The 4 Tools of Audio Storytelling

Audio storytelling is fueled by four elements that need to work
together - words, your voice, audio sounds (music to sound
effects or natual sound), and editing. All four need to work
together, meaning that when you write an audio script you are
simultaneously using all four elements - words written using
your voice with audio sounds, and edited as a whole. When
done well it makes for a very rich storytelling experience for the
listener.

   Write short sentences and talk out loud as you write
because we write differently than we speak and it helps not to
sound scripted. It works to do this. Remember that an audio
podcast is for the ear, not the eye.
          CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 245

   Repeat for emphasis. If you want a certain point to clearly
stand out to an audience you can repeat what is said in a sound
clip, as Rachel Maddow does in her podcast, Deja News.

Script In Chunks

Podcast scripts typically break into parts or `chunks':
   · A standard pre-produced show open with music and

narration that says the show's name and describes what the
show is about

   · An episode-specific open introducing the topic and
guest(s)

   · A scripted structure built after listening to the full
interview

   · Transitions between interviews or segments
   Once an interview is done, the host/producer listens to the
audio and decides what parts of the interview to use and writes
a script. Most good interviews are not used in their entirety but
246 | CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS

are edited to sustain interest, provide greater clarity, and save
time.

    Storytelling Leads

                                                                  Pixabay.
                                                                  com

          · In a first-person lead, the host shares a
             pesonal experience

          · In an anecdotal lead, a real story illustrates a
             larger point

          · In an observational lead, the host illustrates
             trends or sets the scene

          · In a scene-setting lead, the host painta a
             vivid moment for the listener

Show Rundown

Every podcast needs a show rundown that indicates the order
of show elements. The rundown assigns approximate times for
          CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 247

each show element, which is vital to keeping a standard show
length.

     If your goal is to create a 10:00 podcast then
     plan approximate times:

Guest Introductions

Resumes are written for the eye so be sure to rewrite any guest
bio for the ear.

   That means writing shorter and sharper - include major
achievements of the guest related to your episode topic but
don't list everything because additional details can always be
put in episode Show Notes on your website.

   Most importantly, read the introduction out loud to see
how it sounds and how long it takes.

Standardize Your Show Format

250 | CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS

A podcast rundown is not as rigid as the "clock" that runs
commercial and public radio programming -- that template
follows a strict pattern of when news, traffic, and other
segments are repeated on an hourly basis. But podcast listeners
also expect consistency.
    CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 251

Typical Interview-Type Show
Format:

Music with pre-produced standard open - "This
is the XXXXX podcast, a show about XXXXX," and
then the music comes up at full strength.
EPISODE Introduction by host. "Welcome back
to another episode of XXXXX...(podcast name) I'm
your host XXXXX." Do an episode signpost on what
to expect. "On today's episode, we'll talk about some
of the more unique animals being adopted: bearded
dragons, hedgehogs, miniature donkeys ... which
ones are really safe to be home pets? How hard are
they to care for? Are they legal?"
Music bumper
Topic #1: Introduction of guest by host. Avoid
reading any long bio the guest may have sent
because it will sound stuffy and stilted because it's
usually meant to be read and not heard. Rewrite it
to be short and clear for the ear. You can put their
full credentials on your website.

Creative Uses of Sound in Podcasts

Think beyond spoken words. As a podcast producer you could
use natural sound, archival audio, and field recordings to
deepen storytelling--but gathering them can be time-
consuming.
    CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 253

Examples of Effective Sound Used in
Podcasts:

Welcome to Provincetown, uses vivid
environmental sound to place listeners in a seaside
town.

              toolsforpodcasting/?p=61#audio-61-4

     Free archival audio. In the Slate series, Slow Burn-
     Roe V Wade, producers use archival audio to tell the
     story of how the historic Roe decision came about in
     the early seventies.

              https://pressbooks.pub/
              toolsforpodcasting/?p=61#audio-61-5

     The Library of Congress has free historical archival
     audio, as does C-SPAN with 250,000 hours of online
     content of presidential speeches, Congress, and the
     Supreme Court. The TV News Archive has
     searchable broadcast news beginning from 2009
    CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 255

and there are sports broadcast highlights. Additional
links can be found here.
Use sound from events like protest rallies and
demonstrations. If you were doing a podcast
about gun control you could get sound from events
like the massive gun reform rally in Washington,
D.C., led by students from Parkland, Florida.

Do a person-on-the-street interview. You could
gather opinions from people on the street, then
include the best quotes to help the audience feel
more of a part of your podcast. In a podcast about
whether the shopping mall is dead after 70
years, Decoder Ring offers some fond memories
from Americans.

     Ask your guests for audio clips. If you're
     interviewing an author, ask them to do a short
     reading from the book. If you're profiling a musical
     artist, get some audio of their performance.
     Use music to fit the mood of your podcast. Nick
     Quah, host of Servant of Pod, says he considers S-
     town to be the best example of music fitting the
     story being told.

     Use signposts to guide the listener. Because this
    CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 257

is audio, we don't see visual cues or headlines to
guide us, so help listeners by telling them what's
coming up next. Listen to Quah as he transitions
from one interview to promoting an upcoming
interview.

You can use a signpost to move a story
forward in time. For example, if you had a quote
from a reporter who's talking about how he covered
a dangerous virus outbreak while on assignment as
a foreign correspondent.
Interview guest: "I watched the streets of Wuhan,
China, go empty, then the canals of Venice and the
piazzas of Rome, too."
Host voiceover: "Then Seth Doane got the news
he didn't want to hear, that he had tested positive
for the coronavirus."
258 | CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS

     Interview guest: "For me, the symptoms have
     been manageable, which is fortunate in a country
     where hospital systems have been overwhelmed."

Show Opens & Episode Open

Don't just wing it when starting your show; take the time to
plan things out. But, also don't be so tied to a script that you
sound robotic.

   Keep in mind that most shows really have two opens - the
first is usually the standard pre-produced open with music
and narration that says the show name and tagline or
description that explains what the show is about.

   The second is usually the episode open that explains what
the content for the day will be, the host's name, and who the
guests will be. Some of the larger, more-established podcasts
may only use an episode open, it's all a creative choice.

     the host's name introduction.
     Barbaro sets up the topic to be discussed using clips
     from news coverage about the issue. The sound
     helps set the scene for the listener and pulls them
    CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 261

into the story because they're experiencing the
event and not just being told about it. It is followed
by an edited interview with a reporter who covered
the story.

Creative Podcast EPISODE Opens:

After a regular podcast open with music, comes the show
episode open and that can also be a powerful opening. Here
are some ideas:
270 | CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS

    Examples of Creative EPISODE
    Opens

          · The host could use a teaser hook saying, "It
             seemed pretty clear what the outcome would
             be ..... but that's NOT what happened, we'll
             learn about that in this next episode."

          · The host could pose a controversial or
             probing question, then explain that experts
             will offer their views during the podcast.

          · The host could tell the audience three
             things they'll hear in today's episode. The
             magic of three works well for the ear.

          · The host could pose a multi-choice
             question, then give the audience three
             options to consider. Tell the audience that the
             answer(s) will be shared during the podcast.

          · Have the host use the word IMAGINE, then
             create a short scenario that will be explained
             during the podcast. This open might work
             well for a topic that has an uncertain
             outcome, such as whether humans might
          CHAPTER 6: SCRIPTING, OPENS, BUMPERS, ENDINGS | 271

             someday be routinely traveling to distant
             planets for vacations

Writing BUMPERS {Audio examples}

Podcast bumpers are short (05-to-15) transitions within the
podcast. They help with pacing, to identify the show, and
create natural breaks in an interview. Here are two examples of
bumpers (the first one can also work as an open):

The Unexpected Ending

One of the most creative and satisfying parts of
being a podcast creator is coming up with your own
idea in show production. Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
in her podcast, Wiser Than Me, has a unique show
ending that uses her mother as a kind of side-kick
after she has completed a guest interview.

     More routinely, podcasts end with thanks, credits,
     and reminders of how to find the podcast.
     Certainly you want to thank your listeners for
     investing time with you:

Scriptwriting For Fiction Podcasts

Fiction podcasts--descendants of 1940s radio
dramas--require multiple creators, sound design, and higher
budgets.

   Hits like Welcome to Night Vale or The Amelia Project are
difficult to do and expensive because they call for multiple
creators and many more resources and costs. Still, fiction is
growing fast; Spotify reports a 338% rise in fiction podcast
listening in Sweden.

    Marking
     CHAPTER 7: VOICING TIPS, EXERCISES, SCRIPT MARKING | 289

Most people don't love the sound of their own recorded voice.
   Recordings often seem higher-pitched or thinner than what

we think we sound like. That's because we hear ourselves in
two ways: through sound waves in the air and through internal
vibrations traveling through the bones of the skull. Those
internal vibrations create a richer, lower tone--one no
microphone ever captures.

Keys to Successful Voicing

The good news: you can strengthen and improve your vocal
delivery. Start with abdominal diaphragmatic
290 | CHAPTER 7: VOICING TIPS, EXERCISES, SCRIPT MARKING

breathing--"belly breathing"--which helps you draw air
deeper into the lungs for a fuller, more controlled voice.

   Standing while recording can also expand your breathing
capacity and reduce abdominal compression.

   Even more important than voice tone is voice style. This
chapter walks through relaxation techniques, vocal warm-ups,
and script marking tools to help you sound natural, confident,
and conversational. You don't need broadcaster-style "golden
pipes." Speech clarity, pacing, and inflection matter far more.

WARM-UPS Before Voice Work

Do warm-up exercises to pump blood into tissues to stretch
and relax the muscles by getting them to work more efficiently.
Vocal warmups help prevent injury to your delicate vocal
cords.

   They also help you center yourself mentally before an
interview, speech, or podcast taping. They may seem simple,
but with consistent practice they build agility and confidence.
      CHAPTER 7: VOICING TIPS, EXERCISES, SCRIPT MARKING | 291

Basic Warm-Up Sequence

  · Start standing. Yawn--big, wide, and repeated several
      times--to naturally stretch the vocal tract.

  · Stand tall, raise both arms overhead, inhale deeply, and
      release with a long sigh.

                      Vocal Warmups

             1) Warm-up our lips by opening the mouth
             vertically and saying "bah" "bah" "bah."
             2) Now switch to lips air-buzzing
             with Brrrrrrr ..... Brrrrrr ...... Brrrrrr .....
             3) Open up your mouth vertically and say an
             exaggerated "Lah, Lah, Lah, Lah" and sing
             up in pitch and/or down in pitch.
             4) Trill your tongue by rolling with
             an Rrrrrrrrr.
CHAPTER 7: VOICING TIPS, EXERCISES, SCRIPT MARKING | 293

        5) Now say or sing the phrase Mah-May-
        Me-Mo-Moo.
        6) Do a pitch change by counting to three and
        going up in pitch with each number; one-
        two-three; then go down in pitch and
        say three-two-one.
        7) End with a familiar nursery rhyme tongue
        twister:

          Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled
        peppers.

          Did Peter Piper pick a peck of pickled
        peppers?

          If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled
        peppers,

          Where's the peck of pickled peppers
        Peter Piper picked?

                 soft circles. Let the jaw drop. Repeat
                 three times
             · "Meowing" exercise: Give a big,
                exaggerated meow. Then say: "I love
                doing vocal exercises." Repeat three
                 times.

             together, glide up and down a
             scale. Feel the buzz in your lips.
             Repeat three times.

        Pitch Awareness

             · Say: "My voice is going UP-in-
                pitch"--raising pitch on the last three
                 words. Repeat three times.

             · Then: "My voice is going DOWN in
                pitch"--lowering pitch on the last three
                words. Repeat three times.
296 | CHAPTER 7: VOICING TIPS, EXERCISES, SCRIPT MARKING

             Articulation
                  · Rapidly repeat: "put-a-cup, put-a-cup,
                     put-a-cup," emphasizing crisp t's and
                      p's. Increase speed.

Script MARKING To Help Vocal
Delivery

Before recording, read your script aloud to spot where you
should pause, breathe, or emphasize key phrases.

   · Indicate pauses with ellipses (...) or slashes (/).
· Mark emphasis by underlining, italicizing, or using ALL
298 | CHAPTER 7: VOICING TIPS, EXERCISES, SCRIPT MARKING

CAPS.
· Use  or  arrows to note pitch shifts--typically rising at
questions and falling at statements.

Vocal Tip: Countdown To Calm Down

Public-speaking anxiety is incredibly common.
   Mentally prepare for voice work by doing the "countdown

to calm down": say "Five, four, three," then silently count to
zero. By zero, your voice should settle into its natural pitch
rather than launching too high from nerves.
     CHAPTER 7: VOICING TIPS, EXERCISES, SCRIPT MARKING | 299

Vocal Tip: Vocal Inflection

We naturally vary our inflection when talking with friends,
yet many people flatten their delivery when a microphone
appears. Use your voice to convey emotion--joy, concern,
excitement--without editorializing, especially in journalism-
based podcasts. Keep it authentic and conversational.

   Reading your script aloud as you write can also create a
more natural flow.
300 | CHAPTER 7: VOICING TIPS, EXERCISES, SCRIPT MARKING

Vocal Tip: Pace & Articulation

Slow down slightly when speaking on mic. Without visual cues,
listeners depend entirely on your pacing. Speaking too quickly
can cause dropped syllables and muddled articulation. Clarity
always wins..
     CHAPTER 7: VOICING TIPS, EXERCISES, SCRIPT MARKING | 301

Vocal Tip: Avoid Poor Speaking
Patterns

If your pitch goes up at the end of every sentence, it's called
"valley-girl speak" or "uptalking."

   The other irritating speech pattern to avoid is "vocal fry," a
low growl sound at the end of a sentence. Some people blame
the phenomenon on Kim Kardashian and those who want to
imitate her. CBS News Sunday Morning contributor Faith
Salie explains the phenomenon with a fun tongue-in-
cheek look at creaky young women.

Vocal Tip: Speak Conversationally;
High Energy

Try to be your authentic self rather than a carbon copy of
someone else. You want to be conversational and avoid stilted
language to establish rapport with your guest and audience.

   But remember that you are hosting a show for others so
you need to be energetic and to have excitement in your voice
rather than sounding flat.

   Beyond that, keep a consistent speaking level rather than
being up-and-down with volume levels that are too loud or too
soft.

Vocal Tip: Avoid Popping P's & T's
{Audio examples}

When speaking into a microphone, there's sometimes a strong
breath of air that seems to explode into the microphone. These
plosives are worse on words with p's and b's.

   Tips to reduce plosives:
  · Angle the mic slightly to the side of your mouth.
  · Step back a few inches.
  · Use a pop filter or windscreen.

POPPING P's:

Vocal Tip: Don't Let Your Voice Trail
Off

Many people develop an unconscious pattern of letting their
voice trail off at the end of a sentence, almost like they have
run out of energy. Stay focused and avoid long, meandering
monologues that drain momentum.

       Before Recording: What NOT To
                           Do

             · Avoid eating dairy products just before
                 recording because it increases mucus.

             · Avoid nuts and snack foods that
                 irritate the throat.

             · Limit caffeine or alcohol, which
                 dehyrate, prompt coughing and
                 heighten anxiety.

    Chapter 8: Editing Software & Audiograms

Once your podcast is recorded, scripted, and voiced, the next
step is digital editing. There's no single perfect Digital Audio
Workstation (DAW); the right tool depends on your budget,
production needs, device compatibility, and personal
preference.
314 | CHAPTER 8: EDITING SOFTWARE & AUDIOGRAMS

Screengrab of Adobe Audition
This chapter emphasizes free or low-cost audio editing
programs - Audacity, GarageBand, and Adobe Audition. I
created video tutorials to cover the basics and also offer links
to NPR Training. The concepts apply to all digital audio
software no matter which software program you decide to use.

Record & Edit in WAV or AIFF

Always record and edit in uncompressed formats like WAV
or AIFF. These files are large, but they preserve full audio
quality during editing.

   Once your edit is complete, export the final version as a
                CHAPTER 8: EDITING SOFTWARE & AUDIOGRAMS | 315

compressed MP3, the most universal format for podcast
distribution across digital devices.

Listen Before Editing

The editing process should always begin with a careful listen
at normal speed. While it's tempting to skim interviews at
double speed, fast listening makes it harder to identify natural
pacing, emotional beats, and breathing patterns. As you listen,
take notes and record timestamps of strong quotes, standout
moments, and potential problems.

   Remove background noise, plosives, or harsh breaths when
necessary--but avoid over-editing. Cutting too many breaths
creates an unnatural cadence. Lowering the volume of breaths
is usually better than deleting them outright so it doesn't
sound like you have artificially interrupted the flow of the
conversation.

   Let moments breathe - a lingering pause can be a powerful
moment in the story and add tension to your storytelling.

Audacity {Video tutorial}

Audacity has been a free editing workhorse since 2000 and
runs on both Mac and PC. While it comes with a modest
learning curve--and occasional quirks common to free
software--an active user community offers extensive support
through online forums.
316 | CHAPTER 8: EDITING SOFTWARE & AUDIOGRAMS

   I created a video tutorial to walk you through the basics of
recording and editing in Audacity.

Free AI Tool for Cleaner, Clearer
Sound

For removing hollow, tinny, or muffled sound, or eliminating
background hums from air conditioning, the free AI tool
Adobe Enhanced Speech (introduced in Chapter 1) delivers
remarkable results.

   Upload your audio, hit "render," and adjust how much
enhancement you want. I found it to be very good in removing
noise.

   However, if your podcast includes music, enhance voice
tracks before adding music to avoid distortion.

Syncing Up Audio Tracks in Audacity

When editing two separate voice tracks--such as in remote or
double-ender interviews--the tracks must begin at the same
moment.

   During the recording, a simple hand clap from both
speakers, creates a visual spike in the waveform that makes
syncing easy.

   To show what this sync process looks like, SOC
Photography Manager Shaun Schroth created a video tutorial
in Audacity.

Hindenburg

Hindenburg is built specifically for podcasters, journalists,
audio storytellers, and audiobook producers. Roughly 150
NPR stations, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., and more
than 30,000 independent radio producers rely on it.

   Hindenburg Pro offers a 30-day trial and can be purchased
for a one-time price of $399, or you can do an annual
subscription for $120 or monthly at $12. Look for discounts if
you are an educator or student.

   The new PRO v2 offers transcription editing for 99

languages and it gets a rave review from Podnews. The team
behind the new version offers a demonstration.

   Buzzsprout created a free online video tutorial on how to
use the software and Hindenburg has posted its own video
tutorials on Youtube.

   The name "Hindenburg" pays homage to the iconic 1937
broadcast in which a Chicago radio reporter gave a dramatic
eyewitness account of the Hindenburg airship disaster in New
Jersey.

Descript + Squadcast All-in-One App

Descript allows creators to edit audio and video by editing
text--an increasingly popular approach for fast turnaround.
Following its merger with Squadcast, Descript now offers
remote multi-person recording, editing, publishing, and cloud
backups in one platform.

   There is a limited free service to get started, see pricing here.

Editing Social Media Audiograms
324 | CHAPTER 8: EDITING SOFTWARE & AUDIOGRAMS

{Video Tutorial}

Audiograms aren't editing software but promotional tools
that turn a still image + short audio clip + text into a video
post for platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
They're fast, simple, and often free.

   To create one:
1. Choose a short audio clip from your episode.
2. Combine the MP3 with a photo or headline.
3. Use an app like Headliner to generate a shareable video. A
video tutorial walks through the process.

    Chapter 9: Publishing & Promotion
                             CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION | 329

Publishing a podcast is easier than ever, thanks to intuitive
tools that let anyone become their own publisher.

   But before a show reaches listeners, creators need a place to
store those large audio or video files and a system to deliver
them.

Photo by Steve Harvey on Unsplash.com
Just as websites require hosting, podcasts depend on a
dedicated platform to house episodes. A hosting service stores
your files and generates your RSS feed--the backbone of
podcast distribution--which enables directories like Apple
Podcasts and Spotify to find and display your new episodes.
330 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

Without a host, a podcast has nowhere to live--and no way to
reach listeners.

Free & Paid Hosting Options

There's no shortage of podcast hosting providers--some free,
others subscription-based. Yet publishing is only half the job.
With millions of podcasts competing for attention,
discoverability has become one of the biggest challenges for
new creators.

   To help make sense of this crowded hosting landscape, a
new experimental AI tool tracks which platforms podcasters
are moving to and from, offering a view of industry shifts. The
creator explains how the tool works in this video.

   Listing your show in as many podcast directories as possible
is the first step toward being found, but thoughtful promotion
remains essential for growing and sustaining an audience.

    The Most Important Podcast Directories

     Apple Podcasts - formerly iTunes, still the first and
     most important platform to submit your podcast.
     Spotify - competes with Apple for top billing and
                             CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION | 331

     attracts a younger audience thanks to its music
     base.
     The Podcast Index - syndicates your show to
     many other podcast apps.
     YouTube Music - replaced Google Podcasts after it
     shut down in March 2024.
     Listen Notes - a podcast search engine where
     listeners can discover shows by topic; also lets you
     create free podcast clips.
     Podnews maintains a comprehensive list of
     additional podcast platforms.

     Livewire Labs - measures the number of new
     podcast episodes in a given period and ranks top
     hosting companies by new episode share.

How Do You Pick a Hosting Service?

All reputable hosts can distribute your show to major
platforms, but these factors help narrow the choices:
332 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

   Can you use free hosting services?
Yes--but review the fine print. Some delete episodes after 90
days, include ads, or disappear suddenly. Spotify for Podcasters
(formerly Anchor) is a major free option, though critics note
many shows hosted there "podfade," meaning they stop
publishing.

   How do they charge?
Some hosts price by storage, others by downloads. Paid plans
may include ad-free streams, automatic distribution, or
detailed analytics--worth considering for professional or
branded podcasts.

   Ease of use and support.
Check for responsive IT help and whether you can easily
migrate your show elsewhere if needed.

   Is the host IAB Certified?
IAB certification follows industry standards for counting
downloads. If a company claims "IAB Certified," it means they
believe they follow the rules, but "nobody has checked," notes
James Cridland of Podnews.

   Analytics and exports.
Make sure you can download your full analytics history.

   Extras.
Some hosts offer transcription, audio processing, advertiser
marketplaces, or video podcast support.

          · Podchaser breaks down more than 50 hosting
             sites.

          · Look for speciality hosting sites like one from
             Transitor for faith or non-profit organizations.

RSS: The `Secret Sauce'

RSS--Really Simple Syndication--is the open technology
that keeps podcasting decentralized and free from gatekeepers.
Unlike social platforms, your RSS feed belongs to you. Once
submitted to directories such as Apple Podcasts or Spotify, it
updates automatically every time you publish a new episode.

   Jamie Perkins writes in Medium: "RSS champions the little
guy. It empowers the unheard voice, and has made a monopoly
in podcasting impossible." On web pages, the RSS feed is
indicated by an orange logo.
                             CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION | 335

   Each year on September 30, International Podcast Day
celebrates this global, open ecosystem.

RSS Feed Validators

When a feed breaks--often due to hidden formatting
issues--your podcast can disappear from certain apps.
Validators such as Cast Feed Validator and PodBa.se help
identify and fix issues like missing enclosures or poor hosting
settings.
336 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

How To Put RSS Feeds Into Apple

    Publishing to Apple Podcasts

     Apple remains the most influential podcast
     directory. To submit:
     1. Log in with your Apple ID at Apple Podcasts
     Connect.
     2. Click the "+" icon to add a new show and validate
     your RSS feed.
     3. Submit for review (approval may take 24 hours to
     two weeks).
     4. The Podcast Host offers additional submission
     tips.
     New Apple Subcategories & Optimization
     In 2023, Apple added nine subcategories--including
     Mental Health, Documentary, and Language
     Learning--to help niche shows stand out. Each
     subcategory has its own charts, which display the
     Top Shows and Top Episodes available in a listener's
     market.
                             CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION | 337

     Remember: episode numbers belong in the
     metadata field, not in the episode title.
     Here's a look at how some popular podcasts add ID3
     tags.

WHEN Should You Publish?

Consistency matters more than any specific day or hour.
Regular schedules build listener habits and improve
downloads.
338 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

       Photo by Clinton Kayode on Unsplash
Research shows:

  · Mondays are the top release day for charting U.S.
      podcasts.

  · Twice-weekly shows often post on Mondays and
      Thursdays. (The top-rated Mel Robbins Show follows
      that schedule).

  · Most podcasters publish 2-5 am, though 10 am-12
      pm is also strong.

  · Midnight releases see lower engagement.
When launching a new show, have at least three episodes "in
the can"--production always takes longer than expected.

Do You Need A WEBSITE?.

Nearly half of podcasts now have dedicated websites offering
episodes, transcripts, show notes, and merchandise. A website
builds community and supports monetization. Some hosting
sites offer free website options.

    WHY To Build A Podcast Website

     Websites can be easy to build yourself or you can
     hire someone. Find website builders here.

          · Audience connection. A podcast website
             develops relationships with the audience.
340 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

             Listeners/viewers can get Show Notes that
             provide content summaries, guest info, and
             links.
          · Build support for your show. Include
             donation buttons or requests for show
             reviews.
          · Accessibility for everyone to your
             podcast. Transcripts serve deaf and hard-of-
             hearing listeners and support non-native
             English speakers.
          · SEO benefit. Search engines index your
             pages, improving discoverability.
          · Assist journalists and creators. Transcripts
             make your show easier to quote or reference.

FREE Ways To Create Transcripts
{Video tutorial}

    Free Transcription Services

     With the explosive growth of artificial intelligence,
     there are dozens of ways to get free podcast
     transcriptions. However, while the transcript may
     cost nothing, there are usually usage limits, and on
     several apps you cannot download the transcript
     itself unless you do a paid subscription. While
     transcripts can be a real time-saver, a human is still
     needed to check accuracy.
                CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION | 343

· Google Docs (offers a built-in dictation tool
   called Voice Typing, which can capture spoken
   words in real time).

344 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

     There are also paid transcription services that
     remove usage limits and often offer higher accuracy,
     faster turnaround, and additional features such as
     speaker identification or export in multiple formats.
                             CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION | 345

1) Google Docs: Free Voice Typing

Google Docs offers a free, easy-to-use transcription option via

    A Style Guide for Podcast Transcripts
     There is no one standardized style guide when it
     comes to creating a podcast transcript so take a look
     at how other shows do it and then create your own
     consistent rules for handling format, identifying
     names, sound effects, and music:

          · A speaker's name could be in bold (or use
             all CAPS) followed by a colon and then
             the dialogue.

     Jill: Why did you guys decide to get married in
     Cancun?
                       CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION | 351

Colleen: We both love the ocean and wanted a
destination wedding to bring everyone together.

     · Put music or sound effects in {brackets}
        and regular font.

Alyssa: It looks like the Mariachi band has arrived!
{:25 Music from guitars, trumpets, and violens}

     · Include non-speech elements in
        transcripts.

Radio Public did a podcast about Helen Keller and
included non-speech elements like the mood of
music and use of archival audio clips.

The transcript was also available in American Sign
Language.

                   One or more interactive elements has
                   been excluded from this version of the

              effects are clear and text is in clear, short
              paragraphs.

PAID Transcript Services

As you might expect, transcript accuracy improves with paid

services.

Automated services such as Descript and Happy

Scribe transcribe audio or video using voice recognition

technology with charges by the minute or hour. Technology

reporter Ren LaForme of Poynter.org is a big fan of Descript.

You can find out other paid services from The Podcast Host.

Of course, there are always human transcribers where real

people     do  the  work.  Sites  such
354 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

as Fiverr.com or Upwork.com can connect you to freelancers.
Prices and quality will vary by the job.

Use Embedded Player

It's recommended that you install free embedded players on
your website that automatically update with every new
podcast episode. This tool allows anyone to listen or share your
show outside of major listening apps like Apple or Spotify.

   Many podcast hosting services offer free players. For other
options, Podnews show how to install players from platforms
such as Spotify, RadioPublic, and Castbox.

What Are SHOW NOTES?

A blog or website with good podcast Show Notes (also called
`Episode Notes') offer a summary of episode content - the
`takeaway' moments - that make the show memorable. Good
notes improve search traffic and listener engagement.

Reaching the MOST Listeners

According to Edison Research:
  · Advertising on the Top 10 podcasts reaches a third of
      all podcast listeners.
  · The Top 25 reaches 45%.
  · The Top 100 reaches 60%.
  · Niche podcasts can still thrive by targeting highly
      specific audiences.

First Steps In PROMOTION

Podcasts get a lot of love from their creators but it's a challenge
358 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

to get the word out to potential listeners with so many
podcasts available.

 1. Submit your podcast into every podcast directory
      app such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify

 2. Identify target potential audiences and then reach out
      via social media, forums, email lists.

 3. Create a podcast website with show notes, transcripts
      and trailers.

 4. Build a press kit for news outlets, potential guests,
      advertisers, or sponsors, and pitch yourself as a podcast
      guest. Bello Collective offers some tips.

SOCIAL MEDIA - the Secret Sauce in
Promotion

With 55% of Americans now consuming podcasts monthly,
social media is where podcasts build loyalty.

   Shows such as The Mel Robbins Podcast, Crime Junkie,
and Call Her Daddy are building strong connections with
their audience and have evolved into multi-platform brands.

   · YouTube hosts the most active podcast communities.

· Instagram drives the highest interaction.
· X/Twitter sees heavy posting but low engagement.

    How Often to Post About Your
360 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

    Podcast on Social Media

     Headliner offers guidance on posting frequency, but
     keep in mind: growing your audience to monetize
     your podcast looks different from podcasting for
     community-building or personal projects. Start by
     focusing on 1-2 key platforms and adjust as you
     learn what resonates with your audience.

    Recommended Posting Frequency
    by Platform

          · Facebook: 1-2 posts per day
          · Instagram: 3-5 posts per week; 2 stories per

             day
          · TikTok: 1-5 posts per day
          · YouTube: 1-3 videos per week
          · Twitter/X: 2-3 tweets per day
                             CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION | 361

          · LinkedIn: 1-2 posts per day

          · Threads: 2-3 posts per day

          · Pinterest: At least 1 post per week
     Tip: Consistency matters more than volume. Start
     small, track engagement, and scale up when you
     find what works.

Short-Form Video: A Mixed Bag

It's certainly tempting for podcasters hoping to expand their
audience to spread the word through TikTok, Instagram, X,
or YouTube Shorts. Video marketers known as "clippers" take
the engaging parts of a show, put on a snappy headline and
blast out clips seen by millions of people.

   They can be highly successful in getting attention -- but
may not translate into full-episode listening. At this stage it's
not clear, but "it's nowhere near as impactful as people want,"
says Dan Misener, a co-founder of the podcast growth
company Bumper.

   Bloomberg's Ashley Carmen writes that heavy clipping
"could also disrupt the primary source of a podcast's revenue -
362 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

that is the full-length episode of shows and the substantial ad
inventories they deliver to listeners."

Instagram REELS Work Best

In social media, Instagram reels outperform static posts and
offer the best reach and engagement. Nearly 80% of podcast
content on Instagram appears as Reels--short, high-energy
vertical videos (15-30 seconds) with high-energy, music, and
effects.

   The remote podcasting platform Riverside.fm shares advice
on how to share your podcast on Instagram using a reel to
hook the audience to your most captivating content. Use a
9:16 aspect ratio to be compatible with Instagram reels and
make sure your podcast is live and working correctly on all
platforms.

    TIPS To Attract Listeners

          · Expand Your Reach Beyond the Top
             Platforms
             Don't stop at the top three
             directories--submit your podcast to every
             available podcast directory to maximize
             discoverability.

          · Getting Search and AI to Suggest Your
             Podcast
             People are increasingly asking artificial
             intelligence for podcast recommendations, so
             optimize your show to be suggested by these
             tools.

          · Develop a Press Kit
             Create a comprehensive press kit that tells the
             story of your podcast, highlights key episodes,
             and provides visuals and links for media use.

          · Promote and Cross-Promote
             Produce a promo for your podcast and
             collaborate on cross-promotions with other
             podcasts. Getting featured on another show
                            CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION | 367

             as a guest can also boost your audience. Alex
             Greenwood offers a suggested pitch letter for
             reaching out.
          · Join Podcasting Communities
             Engage with Facebook groups like Podcast
             Movement, Podcasters' Support Group, and
             She Podcasts. Additional groups are listed in
             Appendix A.
          · Advertise Strategically
             Simplecast provides guidance on advertising
             your podcast on Facebook. Leverage
             Instagram for audience building and
             promotional content.
          · Measure Success
             Track key metrics to evaluate how well your
             podcast is performing and which promotion
             strategies are most effective.

moments. CNN Digital's Amy Eason recommends clips
around 45 seconds.

Free creators include Audiogram, Headliner, and Waave

Podcast TRAILERS

Borrowing from film marketing, podcast trailers--typically
:30 to :90 seconds--build anticipation for new shows or
seasons. The trailers can be posted on social media, used in
                            CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION | 369

newsletters, cross-promotions on other podcasts, or in paid
ads.

   Pacific Content's Dan Misener looked at 400 of the top
shows in Apple Podcasts and found that 40% had trailers and
that the shows near the top had a higher percentage of trailers
across all categories. "Done right, listening to a podcast trailer
is the audio equivalent of reading the back cover of a book: it'll
give you the gist," he writes.

Ask for REVIEWS

After you've done a few podcast episodes, you might be
interested in getting some feedback from your audience. You
can do that informally by creating space on your website.

   Or, you can make a more formal request during your show
and ask for a review; it helps the audience feel like part of a
community. "If you love this podcast, please leave a review in
Apple Podcasts."

How to Do Podcast Reviews

Reviews of podcasts are most commonly left on
Apple Podcasts or Podchaser--the latter requires
creating a free account. For creators, it's often
helpful to briefly explain how to leave a review, even
though the process is fairly straightforward in most
podcast apps.

How to Leave a Review on Apple
Podcasts

    1. Open the Podcast App.
   2. Type the name of the show in the search

        bar.
   3. Select the podcast and scroll down to Write a

        Review.
   4. Click the button, enter a title and review,

        select a star rating (1-5), and hit Send.
Leaving a review acts as a call-to-action for your
380 | CHAPTER 9: PUBLISHING & PROMOTION

     audience, encouraging engagement and building
     loyalty over time.

    Why Podcasters Seek Reviews

     Reviews provide more than feedback--they help
     creators understand their audience, improve
     content, and increase discoverability. Positive
     reviews can also influence new listeners and
     reinforce a podcast's credibility in a crowded market.

Host a LIVE Recording

Another option for publicizing your podcast is to host a live
recording of the show. However, because most podcasts are
recorded and edited and you can do as many re-takes as you
want, a live event isn't something to be taken lightly or done
without years of experience under your belt.

   If you feel ready to try, Suchandrika Chakrabarti writes that
using quizzes, stand-up comedy, and backdrop images can
enhance the audience experience.

                             CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 385

How Many Listeners/Viewers?

First, let's ask the question: do you really need to know how
many people are listening to your podcast?

   If it's a hobby, it's nice to know--but the number of
listeners is just one metric of success. A small but engaged
audience can be equally, if not more, meaningful. Measuring
time spent listening often tells you more about audience
engagement than downloads alone.

   Beware of download numbers--they can be misleading.
Downloads only measure what was delivered, not consumed,
and they don't tell you how long someone listened or when.
In fact, most downloads never reach listeners' ears. That said,
if you want to impress a boss, a client, or have paid ads, you do
need to pay attention to your listener numbers.

How Podcast Charts Work

Unlike the music industry, where Billboard charts rank songs
and artists, podcasting has no single, authoritative "chart
topper." Instead, there are multiple charts, each measuring
different metrics, which makes comparisons tricky. Only the
podcast publisher knows the actual number of listeners and
downloads. For everyone else, you rely on app charts, rankings,
and services like Rephonic to estimate audience size.
                             CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 387

   Here's a look at how the various podcast charts work.

Apple Podcasts

Apple Podcasts has charts like Top Shows, Top Episodes, Top
Subscriber Shows, and Top Subscriber Channels. But keep in
mind: these charts only measure activity within Apple
Podcasts, not across other platforms or the web. The rankings
reflect popularity at the moment, based on new followers and
listeners, rather than downloads.

   There are separate charts in Apple Podcasts for each
country.

Top Chart from Apple Podcasts

Apple also curates its New and Noteworthy lists and offers a
Top Series chart for narrative shows meant to be listened to
in order. For channels offering paid subscriptions, Apple
Podcasts Connect provides more granular reports, including a
unique count of listeners per channel.
388 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

    Apple Podcast Analytics

     To find your show's numbers in Apple Podcasts,
     log into your Apple Podcast Connect account,
     open Analytics, select an episode, and look for the
     graph showing listeners over time.
     Spotify calls this metric "episode performance."
     In Spotify for Podcasters, you'll see data for the past
     60 days, including:
                      CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 389

Apple Listener analytics

Number of followers - total number of people
following your show.
Number of listeners - total number of people who
listened to your show.
Engaged listeners - total number of people who
listened for at least 20 minutes or 40% of your
episode.
Plays - total number of times the Play button was
pressed. Note: Spotify counts every press, so
stopping and restarting will register as another play.
This can make your total plays appear high even if
your listener count is low.
Top countries/regions - unique devices per
390 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

     country or region.
     Top cities - total number of devices per city.
     Bumper, a podcast growth agency, provides
     guidance on how to combine audio and video
     analytics from different platforms.

Spotify Charts

Spotify updates its podcast charts daily, measuring unique
streams--listens longer than 60 seconds. Repeat plays in a
single day only count once.

   Its Trending Chart highlights shows gaining popularity
quickly, reflecting rising stars and hot topics. Spotify also offers
charts by genre and country, but again, only measures activity
on its platform.
                             CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 391

YouTube Podcasts

YouTube podcasts reach over 1 billion active viewers (Edison
Research), yet stats from YouTube won't appear on your
hosting platform. The YouTube Top Podcast Chart lists the
top 100 shows in the U.S., updated weekly, based on total
listen time. This means a single person listening to a multi-
hour show could rank higher than multiple people listening to
a shorter show.
392 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

Popular podcasts on YouTube

Categories include money, business, football, popular,
Spanish, and live now. For more on how YouTube charts work,
see James Cridland on Podnews.

Chart-Topping Confusion

But wait, there's more.
   Every hosting service has its own analytics, and research

companies maintain separate rankers, leading to differences
in methodology. Nick Quah, a podcast analyst, told The Verge,
"chart-topping doesn't mean what most people think it
means.... It just says you had a lot of new interactions one
given week." Comparing charts can be tricky because some
emphasize weekly activity while others focus on monthly
downloads.
                       CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 393

PODCAST RANKERS

1) Podtrac Rankings
Podtrac provides monthly rankings of downloads
for the Top 20 Podcasts and Top 20 Podcast
Publishers, along with monthly rankers for 30
countries. Keep in mind that downloads do not
mean that people have listened to the podcast.
The rankings also depend upon podcasts that
choose to opt in, so not all shows are counted.
However, Podtrac says it measures the majority of
top podcast publishers. For a fee, you can also
access Podtrac rankings by audience category --
such as Arts, Sports, or True Crime.
2) Edison Podcast Metrics
Edison Podcast Metrics measures listening rather
than downloads and is the only quarterly U.S.
podcast measurement service that reports the
relative audience size and demographics of all
podcast networks. Data is collected from U.S.
394 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

     podcast consumers age 13+ who are asked to recall
     which shows they listened to in the past week.

     It ranks the Top 50 podcasts by reach, not
     downloads. Reach reflects the percentage of weekly
     podcast listeners who say they've listened to a show
     within the past week.

     3) Triton Digital
     Triton Digital measures podcast audiences by
     country or region based on weekly downloads or
     listeners/users over a four-week period.
     Companies must opt in for their metrics to be
     publicly released. Triton has also added a survey-
     based quarterly listener ranking, covering
     podcasts with the most listeners across all
     publishers.

     The U.S. Podcast Ranker now includes all
     publishers -- even those not using Triton's listener-
     based system -- expanding visibility for more
     shows. The ranker lists the Top 200 podcasts
     based on listener responses about what they
     listened to or watched, including video podcasts on
     platforms like YouTube. It also provides audience
     profiles.

     4) Podscribe
                             CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 395

     Podscribe offers "Top Podcasts" plus publisher and
     advertising rankings based on estimated monthly
     listeners (U.S. only). This ranker includes podcast
     downloads, YouTube views, Spotify Video, and more.
     Companies verified by IAB Tech Lab -- earning its
     "seal of approval" -- offer added confidence to

What Does Download Success Really
Mean?

Downloads have long been a way to measure podcast success,
especially for advertising purposes, and are tracked via
compliance programs by the Interactive Advertising Bureau
(IAB). However, downloads are not the only--or always the
most meaningful--metric.
396 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

    SHOW ME THE DOWNLOAD
    NUMBERS

     So, what are good podcast download
     numbers?
     The podcast hosting service Buzzsprout says that if
     a new podcast episode gets the following number of
     downloads within seven days of release:
     · More than 27 downloads  Top 50% of podcasts
     · More than 109 downloads  Top 25%
     · More than 454 downloads  Top 10%
     · More than 1,048 downloads  Top 5%
     · More than 4,269 downloads  Top 1%
     But download numbers alone don't tell the full story.
     A download does not mean an episode was actually
     played. As James Cridland, editor of Podnews,
     explains: a show with 4,000 downloads may not
     have 4,000 listeners -- automatic downloads can
     inflate numbers even when episodes go unheard.
     Only a listen or play truly indicates that someone
     pressed the play button.

     A small, niche show may not generate large
     download numbers, yet still attract a highly engaged
     audience -- something valuable to both podcasters
     and advertisers. However, shows averaging fewer
     than 1,000 downloads per episode are generally
     harder to monetize.
     Beyond downloads, success for a podcast can
     be measured by:
     · Serving underserved populations
     · Influence (a show may be small, but its listeners
     could be highly influential)
     · Amount of ad revenue
     · Reviews and critiques (useful for marketing and
     promotion)
     · Engagement (listener actions, loyalty, and time
     spent listening)

Can You Make Money With
Podcasts?

Podcasts do make money -- very big money for a select few
and absolutely nothing for most creators. That's absolutely
fine if your podcast is a hobby and a labor of love, but there are
some ways to make a few bucks for production expenses.

   Ad experts say the future for podcast advertising will involve
398 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

several different models - ad-free, subscription-based,
crowdfunding and paywalls.

Podcast Advertising Sees Growth &
Influence

In 2025 podcast advertising rates are climbing as global
listening rises. It's a very engaged audience according to Edison
Research, "74% of podcast listeners have taken action after
hearing a podcast ad, whether by visiting a website or
purchasing a product." U.S. podcast ad revenue is projected to
grow to $2.3 billion in 2025 and $3 billion by 2029.

   Ad placement matters: pre-roll at the beginning, mid-roll
during the episode, and post-roll at the end, which is least
expensive. The standard is CPM--Cost Per Mille, or cost per
thousand downloads. Rates range from $15-$50 for 15-30
second ads and $25-$100 for 30-60 second ads.

400 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

Studies by MAGNA and Spotify suggest podcast ads are more
effective than TV ads, and host-read ads perform best because
listeners trust hosts. "The reason they've been successful is
their deep connection to listeners," marketing executive David
Raphael told Vulture magazine. He says one focus group asked
listeners why they went to hotels.com. "They said, `Because Ira
Glass told me to.'

   Someone completely new to podcasting should concentrate
first on producing a really good podcast. Make some
adjustments and seek out reviews before considering how to
build revenue streams.

    Making Money Strategies

          · Use a Patreon or Substack account and/or a
             donation model from your podcast host.

          · The Spotify Partner Program helps creators
             in the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada &
             Australia earn income and has expanded to
             France, Belgium, Luxembourg, The
             Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Austria,
             Switzerland and New Zealand,

          · Sponsorship is where you endorse a
             company's service or products in exchange for
                 CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 401

   payment, i.e. $25 per 1000 (listens) for a
   30-second pre-roll.
· Affiliate marketing is where you refer
   listeners to purchase a product or service and
   you get a commission when it's purchased.
· Provide consulting help to others in creating
   podcast cover art, website design, scripting,
   transcription, vocal performance, social media,
   marketing.
· Become a public speaker as an expert at
   conferences and live events.
· Create and sell market swag for your
   podcasts (mugs, T-shirts, bags, pens).
· Offer premium content such as live events
   and behind-the-scenes interviews.

Donation Models - Patreon & Substack

   Fans can pay support creators directly on subscription
platforms such as Patreon and its newer competitor, Substack.
They take about a 10% cut from creators' earnings. Podcasting
is the top-earning category on Patreon, with $472 million
earned from 6.7 million paid memberships last year.

             Top podcaster on Patreon earns $12
             million

Top earners like Joe Budden are outliers--his 2025
subscription revenue is expected to exceed $12 million. These
platforms are attractive because podcasters can focus on their
financial independence and control of intellectual property.

   You can see the top 1000 Patreon creators each month.
                             CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 403

Patreon monthly charts, August 2025
The New York Times reports that 70,000 paid subscribers
contribute $5 to $50 per month. Since most podcasters earn
nowhere near that amount, Patreon chief executive Jack Conte
told the Times, "Joe is in a league of his own."

   CBS News correspondent David Pogue talked with
podcasters and artists who earn income from subscribing
patrons.

Patreon now offers live streaming, community features, and
partnerships with Sony and Wondery. Substack also provides
subscriber-based revenue, with a $20 million fund to attract
podcasters from other platforms.

Show Me the Money

Patreon, Substack, Twitch, and Spotify illustrate the variety
of ways podcasters can turn passion into income. While top
creators earn eye-popping sums, even modest earnings can
cover production costs, support growth, and provide a
foundation for future opportunities.

   In an interview with Business Insider, three podcasters
shared their Patreon income: Therapy for Black Girls earned
$2,000 per month; Wondery's RedHanded brought in
$59,000; and The Yard raked in an astonishing $242,000
monthly.

   For independent podcasters, income is often smaller but
still meaningful. Tamar Avishai, creator of The Lonely Palette,
encourages creators to move past the hesitation of asking for
                             CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 405

support. In her article for The Bello Collective, she explains
how to maximize Patreon contributions. With 175 patrons
giving at various levels, she earns over $1,000 per episode.
While most independents don't make huge sums, they gain
other rewards--career redirection, skill-building, and creative
growth.

   Substack offers a similar model, allowing subscribers to
follow and support favorite creators. The platform recently
launched a $20 million fund to entice podcasters away from
Patreon and other services, promoting a subscription-based
approach to revenue.

                   Twitch logo

Live-streaming platforms like Twitch, which started in the
niche community of video gamers, is emerging as another
potential goldmine for podcast income. Shows like Lemonade
Stand, which covers business, tech, and politics, earn over
$58K per month from 16,000 subscribers, reaching
predominantly Gen Z audiences. Twitch's live format allows
creators to engage directly with their communities, building
loyalty and recurring revenue.

   As Bloomberg's Ashley Carman says, the future of
podcasting could come from Twitch and success on the
streaming platform - "one that is particularly popular with
406 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

young video-game fans - could eventually prove to be a
podcasting goldmine."

   Meanwhile, the Spotify Partner Program offers creators a
50% share of revenue from ads monetized on the platform. To
qualify, podcasters must have published at least 12 episodes
and logged 10,000 consumption hours on Spotify in the
previous 30 days. This program allows both large and smaller
creators to earn from streams, expanding opportunities
beyond traditional ad deals.

   The New York Times reports that Spotify has paid over one
million dollars with a 40% increase in video consumption since
the launch in January.

Grants or Accelerators

Independent podcasts can also seek grants, accelerator
programs, or fellowships. These typically require a project
proposal, budget, timeline, and application. A grant is a
funding award made to a person or organization to fund a
project that is not paid back. There is a competitive application
process with specific requirements.

   To find funding sources look online, at private foundations,
at government agencies especially at the local level like arts
organizations. In my home base of Washington, DC grant
funding is available from Humanities DC to fund history,
culture, relationships, and topics that shape the community.
There are similar organizations elsewhere.

Careers, Jobs, & Pay in Podcasting

Podcasts are produced by traditional media, digital startups,
408 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

government agencies, religious organizations, sports
franchises, authors, and educational institutions. This
diversity creates roles for hosts, reporters, producers, editors,
scriptwriters, marketers, and sound engineers. Some
individuals manage multiple roles, which can be
rewarding--or overwhelming.

All of these organizations need to hire hosts, reporters,
producers, scriptwriters, artists, marketers, and sound
engineers. Some people can do it all or know how to outsource
and hire others. You might find such an opportunity.

   However, job seekers should also be aware of layoffs in
major podcast companies, including NPR, Wondery, iHeart
                             CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 409

Media, and Spotify. Reasons include advertising declines,
subscription shifts, AI automation, and cost-cutting measures.

Podcast Job Titles

Job titles are determined by the employer and by the style
of storytelling -- nonfiction vs fiction or narratives, dramas,
interviews, and such. Someone with the job title of producer
in one workplace may be called a story editor elsewhere and
it's not uncommon for one or two people to do multiple jobs.
That can be fulfilling or frustrating depending upon your
workload.

    Defining Major Podcast Jobs

     From Podcast Taxonomy (additional roles
     defined in a White Paper):

          · EXECUTIVE PRODUCER: "The Executive
             Producer is the lead producer on a production.
             The role can range in terms of creative control
             with some "EP"s owning the creative
             direction of a podcast (in effect taking the role
                 CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 415

   of director), while others may take a more
   hands off approach. Executive produce may
   have raised the money to fund the
   production, but it is not a necessary
   responsibility of the role."
· SENIOR PRODUCER: "The Senior Producer
   is the second most senior producer of the
   production (second to the Executive
   Producer). They supervise producers and the
   general direction and logistics of the entire
   production."
· PRODUCER: "The Producer coordinates and
   executes the production of the podcast. Their
   duties can include helping craft the creative
   direction of a project, budgeting, research,
   scheduling, and overseeing editing and final
   production."
· REPORTER: "The Reporter finds and
   investigates news or stories for the podcast,
   often interviewing subjects and conducting
   research. The Reporter can be an on-air
   position as well, as they convey the insights
   of their investigation."
· HOST: "The Producer coordinates and
   executes the production of the podcast. Thier
416 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

             duties can include helping craft the creative
             direction of a project, budgeting, research,
             scheduling, and overseeing editing and final
             production."
          · WRITER: "The Writer has written the story
             or dialogue of a podcast. They are often
             involved in the creative arc of a production,
             but this is not a necessary requirement.
             Writers may work in scripted podcasts, in
             both fictional or non-fictional contexts, and
             may work on their own or in partnership with
             1-2 other writers if necessary. Given the
             requirements of a podcast, the script that a
             Writer produces may be read word-forword
             on a published podcast episode."
          · STORY EDITOR: "The Story Editor is
             responsible for broad stroke direction of the
             story arc and character development of a
             podcast. Often seen in fiction and
             documentary podcasts."
          · AUDIO EDITOR: "The Audio Editor cuts and
             rearranges audio for clarity and storytelling
             purposes. The Audio Editor may also perform
             general audio processing and mastering."
          · PRODUCTION ASSISTANT: "The Production
                              CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 417

             Assistant helps support an executive member
             of a podcast (often a director or producer),
             helping prepare them in a variety of ways
             including scheduling, logistics,
             communications, and more."
          · MARKETING MANAGER: "The Marketing
             Manager is responsible for the promotion of a
             podcast's content through various awareness
             strategies such as social media campaigns,
             cultivating a web presence, managing public
             relations and communications strategies, and
             other creative techniques to acquire and
             retain listeners. Also known as: Podcast
             Marketing Coordinator, Podcast Marketer."

What Does a Producer Do?

Typically the producer oversees the management of a show
from concept to writing scripts, scheduling guests, doing
interviews, and hiring any contractors needed for editing,
distribution, or promotion. Job duties can differ widely
depending on the size of the employer and the style of the
podcast
418 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

What Does An Editor Do?

An editor could be involved in story structure or editing audio
or both.

   Catherine St. Louis is senior editor of podcasts at Neon
Hum. In episode 10 of "Servant of Pod with Nick Quah,"
she talks about creating memorable podcast moments, how
she became a story editor and her love of deconstructing story
structure., "I think a good podcast does three things - it
educates, it enrages, it entertains," she said.

   St. Louis says part of the problem is that most people don't
understand what it means to be an editor. She says editors are
made and that diversity is vital. "I wish we took more young
people of color, women, and guided them so that they became
editors. ...I think we have to demystify that editors are
somebody who are older or who are established."
                             CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 419

   St. Louis also talks about how she approaches being a story
editor on podcasts such as This Land by Crooked Media
and Murder on the Towpath by Luminary -- both are longer
form, narrative non-fiction podcasts that have different
storytelling techniques than audio dramas or interview
podcasts.

What's the Income for Top Podcasters?

Although it's hard to know revenue unless it's self-reported,
top podcasts like The New York Times' The Daily, earn more
than $1 million in revenue.

422 | CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS

Celebrity podcasts earn big money, too -- Dax
Shepard's Armchair Expert Dax Shepard brings in about $9
million. It's been widely reported that sports analyst Bill
Simmons earns at least $7 million while the Joe Rogan
Experience, with an estimated 190 million downloads per
month, will make its namesake host more than $100 million
for exclusive rights on Spotify. Stylist offers their list of the 20
best celebrity podcasts.

Freelance Work Rates

It's a valid question whether you can turn your passion project
podcast into a paid professional gig. Salaries for podcast jobs as
producers, editors, production assistants, writers, and website
creators fluctuate depending upon the employer, show format,
and market location.

   Salaries vary depending upon whether you are on staff for
a media company or as a freelancer. Some companies pay by
the hour, others by the day or project. You also need to pay
close attention to job titles because what one employer calls
a production assistant job might be labeled as an associate
producer job at another, so be sure you are clear on defining
the role.
                       CHAPTER 10: AUDIENCE, INCOME, JOBS | 423

    Chapter 11: Avoiding Legal Trouble
                             CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE | 431

Podcasters enjoy a great deal of creative freedom, but that
freedom comes with important legal and ethical
responsibilities.

   The most common red-flag areas include podcast names,
recording and consent laws, and the right to use music,
sound effects, or other third-party content. Never assume
that being a "small" or hobbyist podcaster protects you from
complaints, takedown notices, or even lawsuits--because it
doesn't.

In the United States, traditional commercial broadcasters are
subject to federal oversight and FCC regulations. Podcasters,
432 | CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE

by contrast, are generally not regulated in the same way as long
as their shows are not transmitted over public airwaves.

   However, this does not mean podcasters operate in a legal
vacuum. A smart approach is to think in terms of
risk--consider where your show is produced, where it's
distributed, and where it can be heard, because a lawsuit can be
filed anywhere your podcast is accessible.

   The information in this chapter is meant to be general and
educational. Always consult a qualified attorney for legal
questions about your specific situation

For a useful starting point, Creative Commons offers a helpful
overview of legal considerations for podcasters, and many
                            CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE | 433

other free online resources break down issues such as
copyright, licensing, and fair use in more depth.

Names: Protecting Your Brand

Do some research in podcast apps to ensure no one else is
already using the podcast name you've chosen, especially one
that is in the same genre, and that it doesn't violate trademark
law.

   Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Inc. successfully settled a lawsuit
against a podcast called Oprahdemics, which was forced to stop
using the name and brand of the famous talk show host and
434 | CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE

producer. That's one example of why media executives say
podcasters should consider filing for trademark protection.

Trademark

Trademark is a word, phrase, symbol, design, or combination
that identifies the goods of a party--think the Nike logo or the
phrase "Let's get ready to rumble," trademarked in 1992 by a
wrestling announcer who licenses it for movies, commercials,
and video games.

   You can search the federal Trademark Electronic Search
System (TESS), but it can be tricky. Hiring a trademark
attorney is recommended. Registration gives you a legal
presumption of ownership and allows you to use the TM mark.
Attorney Jeanine Percival Wright emphasizes that your show
title, logo, and artwork all require protection.

Recording Laws: Do You Need Guest
Releases?

Podcasts that discuss public figures generally benefit from
strong First Amendment protections, but episodes involving
private individuals require more caution and proactive
communication.

In most cases, if someone agrees to appear on your podcast,
that consent is understood to include permission to be
recorded. But complications arise when a guest later changes
their mind--either before publication or after the episode has
already aired.

   This uncertainty is why the podcasting community remains
divided on whether guests should sign a formal, written
release form.

   Pro-release perspective: For maximum protection, many
producers obtain verbal or written consent that clearly
outlines how the guest's name, image, and voice may be used,
including in online or social-media promotion. Always save
436 | CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE

the recording itself as documentation of consent. These steps
help safeguard your right to publish if a guest later asks to
withdraw or restrict their interview.

   A lawsuit involving publicity rights for the Peabody Award-
winning S-Town podcast has been settled, but attorney David
Oxenford recommends getting a release from those
interviewed to lessen liability. In this case, the allegation was
over violating a dead man's likeness and Alabama's right of
publicity law.

   Written guest release forms are available for download here:

Consent Laws Vary

For investigative reporters, documentary podcasters, or anyone
gathering sound, it's especially important to understand
recording-consent laws. Federal and state rules differ:
· One-party consent states allow recording as long as you are
part of the conversation.
· All-party consent states require the permission of everyone
being recorded.

   You can review your state's laws here and international
regulations vary even more widely.

   From an ethical standpoint, most journalists ensure that
subjects know they are being recorded. Exceptions are rare and
typically limited to circumstances involving significant public
interest, and only after all reasonable ethical approaches have
been exhausted.
                            CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE | 437

   Professional guidance is available through the Radio-
Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) and the
Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ).

   For additional insight, Buzzfeed's Q & A Podcast explored
these issues in a conversation with experts at The Podcast
Lawyer.

Copyright: Protect Music & Sound
Effects

Music is central to many podcasts, but free access to audio
does not mean you have legal permission to use it. Even short
clips of commercial music are protected by copyright.

   If you download a music sample without paying, you may
notice an audio watermark--an embedded voice identifying
the company that owns the track. This exists because copyright
law prohibits the use of commercial music in a podcast, even if
the amount is extremely small.

Myths & Tips to Stay Legal

Common myths--such as the belief that you can use 10
seconds of music, or that it's fine if your show doesn't make
money, or that crediting the artist makes it legal--are all
incorrect.

   Following these myths can expose your podcast to copyright
claims or takedown notices. Because copyright starts from the
moment a work is created by someone in a tangible form,
there's no way to avoid this.
                            CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE | 439

440 | CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE

The reality is that you can't use someone else's creative work
without their permission. When you create music, sound
effects, take a photo, or record a video, that work is
automatically protected by copyright the moment it is fixed
in a tangible form. There's no requirement to register it with
any government office for those rights to exist (although
registration provides additional legal benefits if you ever need
to enforce your rights). In most cases, copyright protection
lasts for your lifetime plus 70 years after your death.

   To stay legal, properly attribute works using the TASL
method:Title, Author, Source, License, and consider hiring
musicians or friends to create custom music under a work-
for-hire agreement. This ensures your podcast--not the
composer--owns the copyright.

Understanding Fair Use

Stay clear from using music created by popular stars because
such use violates the copyright. However, if your podcast is
about the work of an artist, the concept of fair use might come
into play. Be careful, however, because this can be a tricky area.
                             CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE | 441

Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material for purposes
like commentary, criticism, parody, news reporting,
research, teaching, or scholarship.

   The Center for Media and Social Impact at American
University has detailed studies on fair use, free speech, and
intellectual property.

Legal Resources To Use

Creative Commons is one of the best places to find legally
licensed music, sound effects, images, and video.

   Founded in 2001, the nonprofit helps bridge the gap
between older copyright laws and the realities of the digital era.
442 | CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE

Licenses are free to the public, and today more than 1 billion
creative works use CC licensing.

   Artists choose the specific terms for their creative
works--deciding who may use them, whether they can be
copied, shared, or remixed, and under what conditions so be
sure to meet these rules. It can be as simple as giving
attribution to the creator and/or not using the work for
commercial purposes.

    Creative Commons Licensing

     The use of royalty-free music is a type of licensing
     you pay for once and have lifetime use. Other sites
     allow creators to use music for free in exchange for
     credit.
                      CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE | 443

In Creative Commons, licenses go to creators so they
can give public permission to use their creative work
under U.S. copyright law. There are four CC licensing
types.

     · Attribution {free to copy, redistribute and
        adapt; remix and transform with appropriate
        credit}

     · ShareAlike {distribute your contributions
        under the same license as the original if you
        remix, transform or build upon the material}

     · Non Commercial {Can't use the material for
        commercial purposes}

     · Non Derivatives {You may not distribute the
        modified material if you mix, transform, or
        build upon the material.}
444 | CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE

How To Search Creative Commons

               Photo by Charles on Unsplash.com
To search CC, use the platforms for music.
Here are some best practices on how to attribute works
under a Creative Commons license that uses the acronym
TASL (title, author, source, license). Look carefully among the
choices below for free or low-cost music. In addition, several
podcast host services offer free music for their clients.

Sound Effects & Sound Libraries

Sound effect and sound library sites provide audio clips just
as music sites provide music and usually require permission to
use. To stay within the law, use royalty-free sites and follow the
rules for use.

    Free and Paid Sound Libraries

          · BBC Sound Effects will allow students,
             teachers, and researchers use for non-

Accessibility

Web and content accessibility are now essential. Providing
transcripts and maintaining an accessible website is not only
                            CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE | 449

legally prudent--it's also one of the simplest ways to broaden
your audience.

   By 2050, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates
that 2.5 billion people worldwide will experience some form
of hearing loss. In the United States today, 1 in 8 people has
hearing loss in both ears.

Organizations such as the National Association of the Deaf
(NAD) and Disability Rights Advocates (DRA) argue that
when podcast content is not accessible--particularly through
transcripts or captioning--companies may be in violation of
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

   Legal actions highlight these concerns:
450 | CHAPTER 11: AVOIDING LEGAL TROUBLE

  · SiriusXM faced a 2021 lawsuit alleging a lack of
      transcript accessibility.

  · Gimlet Media / Spotify faced a class-action lawsuit over
      missing closed captioning.

Do You Own Your Podcast?

Podcast ownership can become complicated quickly--even in
small creative partnerships. Disputes often arise when co-hosts
or collaborators contribute ideas, labor, or on-air work
without a clear written agreement outlining ownership.

   A well-known case involved comedian Adam Carolla, who
was sued by a former co-host claiming partial ownership of a
successful podcast concept. The dispute ended in an out-of-
court settlement, with the terms kept confidential. Situations
like this show how vital it is to establish clear agreements before
a podcast grows or monetizes.

          CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 455

Podcasting didn't appear fully formed--it was built piece by
piece by technologists, journalists, storytellers, educators, and
creative risk-takers. Some became household names, while
others worked behind the scenes, but all laid the foundation
for a medium that now reaches hundreds of millions of
listeners.

   This chapter spotlights the first-generation innovators who
helped define podcasting, including the researchers and
educators who quickly saw its power for teaching, scholarship,
inclusion, and community--and whose work often predicted
where the industry was headed.

The WORD "Podcast"

The term podcast blends "pod," from Apple's iPod, with
"broadcast." It entered the mainstream in 2005 when the
Oxford Dictionary named it "Word of the Year," crediting
journalist Ben Hammersley with coining the phrase.

   Early podcasts were largely extensions of traditional radio.
Public radio organizations such as NPR sought new ways to
distribute audio programs online. Initially, a podcast was
defined as downloadable audio files automatically delivered to
subscribers' devices.

   Today, that definition is more fluid. Audiences encounter
podcasts on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and
across countless apps. Purists argue that a podcast must be
downloadable audio, while others see it as an on-demand
456 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

storytelling format--audio or video--untethered from any
single platform

Humble Origins

Podcasting's roots trace back more than two decades. By 2004,
three figures--an MTV veteran, a pioneering software
engineer, and a journalist--had set the stage for what would
become a global medium.

   In 2001, media personality Adam Curry floated an idea
on his blog that would spark the creation of the first podcast
feed. Journalist and podcast historian Eric Nuzum has since
chronicled that moment and preserved Curry's original post.
Curry had met in a New York hotel room with software
          CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 457

innovator Dave Winer, whose work on blogging and RSS
revolutionized online publishing.

   After the meeting, Winer wrote: "Adam wants the Internet
to be Everyman's broadcast medium... to route around TV
and radio networks, with no compromise in quality." Winer
soon modified RSS to allow audio enclosures--a
breakthrough that made podcast distribution possible.

   Two years later, Winer teamed with journalist Christopher
Lydon to produce what is widely considered the first true
podcast. Their show eventually became Open Source, now the
longest-running podcast in the world.

The BOOM Year

Podcasting's watershed moment arrived in 2014 with the
debut of Serial. The investigative, serialized narrative shattered
458 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

listening records--now surpassing 300 million
downloads--and became the first podcast to win a Peabody
Award.

   Hosted by Sarah Koenig, Serial revisited the 1999 murder
of a Baltimore teenager and the conviction of her ex-boyfriend,
Adnan Syed. Courts cited the podcast in legal proceedings, and
the case underwent multiple twists over the next decade. In
2025, a Baltimore court ruled Syed would not return to prison
and reduced his sentence to time served.

   Serial ignited the "Serial effect," fueling mass-market
interest in narrative nonfiction, especially true crime. Vox
provides a retrospective on the role of Serial in the genre
boom.

Podcasting at 20

To mark the 20th anniversary of podcasting, Apple Podcasts
released a list of what it considers the 20 most influential
shows. The selections reflect podcasting's breadth--from
Serial to Call Her Daddy, Las Culturistas, Huberman Lab,
and others that helped define new creative and commercial
possibilities.

A Documentary Record: Age of Audio

Podcasting's early years are chronicled in the documentary Age
         CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 459

of Audio, described by one reviewer as "a podcast meets
documentary--really creative," highlighting how the medium
continues to reinvent itself.

Innovators Who Helped Shape
Podcasting

Measuring innovation in podcasting is complex. The industry
grew quickly and spans multiple sectors--journalism,
entertainment, technology, education, and business. Audience
metrics and revenue are often opaque and influence can be
creative, cultural, political, financial, or technical.

   Here is a limited list of the leaders who have left a lasting
imprint on the medium - with roles as hosts, producers, sound
designers, entrepreneurs, and media executives.

Jad Abumrad (Journalist, Sound Design,
Host) & Robert Krulwich (Journalist, Host)
          CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 461

   Radiolab popularized long-form, story-driven podcasts and
influenced a generation of audio storytellers. As both a public-
radio program and a podcast, the show presented complex
scientific and philosophical ideas through a mix of investigative
reporting, conversational explanation, and innovative sound
design.

   Co-founder Jad Abumrad's experimental audio
style--layering voices, soundbeds, and silence--became widely
imitated. Robert Krulwich's plain-spoken interviewing and
willingness to interrupt experts for clarification helped make
challenging topics accessible without oversimplifying them.

   Radiolab's influence is evident in later narrative shows,
including Invisibilia, Freakonomics Radio, and Stuff You
Should Know. Its impact is comparable to foundational
programs such as This American Life and, later, Serial.

Ashley Flowers (Creator, CEO, Host)

   Ashley Flowers is the creator of Crime Junkie, one of the
most consistently top-ranked podcasts in the United States,
drawing an estimated 20 million weekly listeners and
cultivating a large, loyal, and predominantly female audience.

   As the founder and CEO of Audiochuck, she built one of
the most successful independent podcast networks in the
country--an empire centered on crime victims, cold cases, and
community-driven public-safety storytelling. Under her
leadership, Audiochuck expanded beyond a single hit show
462 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

into a portfolio of chart-topping podcasts, charitable
initiatives, and partnerships with law-enforcement and victim-
advocacy organizations.

   Flowers reshaped the true-crime landscape by showing that
a woman-led, listener-supported operation could achieve
mainstream dominance in a genre historically shaped by male
hosts, producers, and gatekeepers. She also influenced the
business of podcasting: demonstrating the power of niche
networks.

Ira Glass (Host, Creator, Producer)

   Ira Glass is one of the central architects of modern audio
storytelling. Through This American Life, he pioneered the
narrative style that later defined the podcasting era--character-
driven scenes, emotional arcs, and purposeful use of music and
         CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 463

ambient sound. His signature structure--opening tension,
unfolding scenes, reflection, and a late narrative turn--became
techniques for nonfiction podcasts from Serial to In the Dark
and Reveal.

   Glass was also early to embrace digital distribution, showing
that long-form narrative journalism could thrive as a podcast
and helping bring public-radio storytelling into the on-
demand era. His influence shapes how podcasts are reported,
narrated, and scored across nearly the entire nonfiction
landscape.

   Glass typically opens episodes with an unresolved question
or mystery, then moves through scenes, reflection, and a late
narrative turn. His willingness to share his own uncertainties
or reactions became part of the storytelling approach adopted
by later podcasters.
464 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

Kerri Hoffman (Media Executive)

   Kerri Hoffman's leadership at PRX--the Public Radio
Exchange--has had a significant impact on independent audio
production. PRX functions as a major distribution hub where
independent creators publish their work and public-radio
stations license programming.

   Hoffman expanded training, grantmaking, and
development programs aimed at broadening the pipeline for
new audio talent, including women, at a time when many
newsrooms and audio teams skewed male. She also played a
key role in the creation of Radiotopia, a podcast collective that
became a platform for emerging storytellers and producers.
         CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 465

   Her work supported the growth of shows such as Ear
Hustle, Reveal, and The Moth Radio Hour and helped foster a
more diverse generation of creators.

Sarah Koenig (Host, Journalist, Producer)

   Few podcasters have had a cultural impact as large as Sarah
Koenig. When Serial debuted in 2014, it didn't just become
a hit--it shifted the medium from a niche format to a
mainstream cultural product.

   Serial reignited national attention to the criminal justice
system in the Adnan Syed case and introduced a new
storytelling model: a season-long investigation delivered with
transparency, skepticism, and real-time discovery.

   Following Serial's success, major media companies
increased investment in podcasting and raced to greenlight
investigative series like In the Dark, S-Town, and Bear Brook.
Koenig became the face of the podcast boom, with the series
parodied by Saturday Night Live. Her work contributed to
an industry-wide shift in funding, hiring, and editorial
development.
466 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

Jessica Cordova Kramer (Media
Entrepreneur)

   Jessica Cordova Kramer is the co-founder and CEO of
Lemonada Media, an independent network built around the
mission of "making life suck less." Her brother's death from
an opioid overdose informed the company's emphasis on
storytelling that connects personal experience with social
issues.

   Kramer established Lemonada without backing from a
major corporation, proving that independent operators could
compete at scale. Her leadership has included developing new
formats, securing investment, and growing a slate of original
shows, among them Wiser Than Me with Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

   She was named to The Hollywood Reporter's list of the most
powerful people in podcasting. Lemonada was co-founded
with Stephanie Wittels Wachs.

Marc Maron (Comedian, Host)
         CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 467

   Marc Maron's WTF became a model for independent,
personality-driven podcasting. His long-form interviews with
comedians, actors, and public figures helped establish comedy
as one of the most successful podcast genres.

   Maron recorded from a home studio, stripped away
production polish, and approached interviews with unusual
candor about his own struggles. This openness frequently
prompted guests to speak in ways they had not in traditional
media settings. His conversations with Robin Williams and
President Barack Obama became defining moments for the
show.

   After 16 years, Maron ended the podcast in 2025, leaving
behind a body of work that reshaped expectations for what
independent hosts could achieve.

Conan O'Brien (Comedian, Host,
Entrepreneur)

   Conan O'Brien is a comic who was an early adopter of
podcasting and saw the medium's potential long before other
late-night television hosts. He used his TV fan base to build a
thriving audio audience for his show Conon O'Brien Needs A
Friend and demonstrated how comedians could expand their
brands across platforms--TV, podcasts, YouTube, and social
media.

   O'Brien embraced the freedoms podcasting offered: longer
conversations, more sincerity, more silliness. His approach
468 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

strengthened listener loyalty and helped propel the multi-
platform, personality-driven strategy now common in late-
night entertainment.

   His digital media company, Team Coco, grew into a
powerhouse of podcasts, live events, merchandise, and comedy
specials. SiriusXM eventually acquired it for $150 million,
with O'Brien staying on as a producer and executive.

Joe Rogan (Comedian, Host,
Entrepreneur)

   Joe Rogan hosts one of the largest and most influential
podcasts in the world, The Joe Rogan Experience. His long,
unstructured interviews helped define the conversational
format that dominates much of podcasting's top tier.

   Rogan's rise was accelerated by the use of YouTube clips,
which expanded his audience. In 2020, Spotify signed him to
an exclusive deal reportedly worth $100 million, at the time
the largest in podcasting. The agreement triggered broader
industry interest in exclusive contracts and reshaped
negotiations around talent, ownership, and distribution. His
subsequent multiyear deal, valued at $250 million, reinforced
that shift.

   Rogan remains a polarizing figure. Some episodes have
included vaccine misinformation, unverified political claims,
and the use of racial slurs--prompting criticism from medical
experts, media analysts, and civil-rights groups. Supporters
         CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 469

describe him as an advocate for open dialogue. Regardless, his
influence on podcast economics is substantial.

Connie Walker (Journalist, Host, Producer)

   Connie Walker is an investigative journalist whose work
centers on Indigenous stories, particularly those involving
missing and murdered Indigenous women and the legacy of
Canada's residential-school system. A member of the Okanese
First Nation in Saskatchewan, Walker has become a leading
voice in Indigenous-centered audio reporting.

   Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning podcast Stolen combined
rigorous investigation with survivor-focused narrative,
bringing national and international attention to longstanding
systemic abuses. Walker's reporting avoids sensationalism and
470 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

emphasizes firsthand accounts, family histories, and
community context.

   She spent two decades at the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation (CBC) before joining Gimlet Media in the
United States and later moving into academia as a journalism
professor in Toronto. Her work has influenced both
investigative podcasting and the broader inclusion of
underrepresented voices in audio media.

The Wide-Wide World of Podcasts in
Education

Podcasting didn't just change media--it changed how we learn.
   Educators were among the earliest adopters of the medium,

using podcasts to teach, highlight faculty research, strengthen
institutional reputation, attract prospective students and
donors, and support faculty and staff development.

   These outcomes--impact on learning, visibility,
community engagement, and institutional advancement--are
all meaningful indicators of success. They demonstrate that
the value of educational podcasts goes far beyond download
numbers and lies in reaching audiences where they are, when
they're ready to listen.

   This chapter highlights a selection of what is happening in
the education podcast space today.

    How Podcasts Impact Higher
    Education

          · Enhance Student Learning (Assignments,
             Competition)
          CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 473

         · Showcase Faculty Research &
            Expertise (Connecting with Global
            Audiences)

          · Institution-Branding (Academic Programs,
             Leadership, Alumni)

          · Demystify College & University Offices
             (Admissions, Standardized Tests)

          · Professional Development (Employee
             Enrichment & Morale)

    Enhance Student Learning

Core to the missions of higher education--podcasts help
teaching and student learning.

   Innovators quickly recognized the power of sound,
storytelling, and connection: if podcasts could capture
millions of listeners, they could also capture students'
attention--turning lessons into stories, classrooms into
conversations, and learning into experiences that extend far
beyond school walls.

   In student learning, podcasts can be used to:
474 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

   · Reinforce learning: Provide review opportunities,
supplement lectures, and clarify complex concepts.
· Engage students: Allow on-demand listening, support
flipped classrooms and encourage peer learning.
· Build community: Connect students with real-world
experts and alumni.
· Develop research and digital literacy skills: Student-
created podcasts and multimodal assignments.

Assignments & Academics

Podcast assignments can supplement or even replace
traditional essays, giving students a powerful format to
develop communication, research, and professional skills.

   For example, in my public affairs journalism course at
American University in Washington, D.C., graduate students
create podcasts to examine complex topics--such as
disinformation--from multiple angles.

   Similarly, the Washington College of Law with its
commitment to social justice and public interest law, launched
A Hard Look, a podcast exploring challenging questions in
administrative law and regulatory policy--a project I helped
them bring to life.

             Washington College of Law
          CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 475

See the end of this chapter for a list of student podcast
competitions.

    Showcase Faculty Research &
    Expertise

Learning and teaching may define classroom life, but they're
only part of how faculty share knowledge today. Institutions
large and small are turning to podcasts as a platform to
showcase faculty research and expertise.

   Through podcasting, scholars present cutting-edge research
and participate in cross-disciplinary conversations across
business, history, the arts, sciences, humanities, law, and
today's most pressing social issues. The conversational format
makes complex scholarship accessible to listeners far beyond
traditional academic circles.

   As a result, faculty research reaches broader audiences,
elevates institutional reputation, supports student and donor
engagement, and occasionally transforms professors into
recognizable academic podcast voices.

High-Profile Academic Podcasters

Just like podcasters everywhere, academics who podcast have a
476 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

passion for what they do and want to share their expertise with
others. Many produce shows independently, while others are
fortunate to have institutional financial or staffing support.

   Some of the more established scholars with podcasts
include:

   Andrew Huberman (The Huberman Lab) is a
neuroscientist and professor at the Stanford School of
Medicine. His podcast is frequently ranked in the top 10 of all
podcasts, with more than 7 million YouTube subscribers.

   Huberman's episodes explore science in everyday life,
breaking research into understandable biology-based wellness
and self-improvement lessons. His work educated and
entertains a broad audience, though he has occasionally faced
criticism for what some consider pseudoscience.

   Matt Abrahams (Think Fast, Talk Smart) is a best-
selling author and a professor of Organizational Behavior at
Stanford University's Graduate School of Business. His show
has over 68 million listens and a consistent listenership of
150,000 per episode.
          CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 477

   Abrahams focuses on enhancing communication skills
--especially under pressure--to elevate professional
performance. His academic work on performance anxiety and
improvisational communication directly informs the exercises
he shares on the podcast, translating classroom techniques into
practical lessons listeners can apply immediately.

   While these are two examples of highly-popular academic
podcast hosts, many other scholars exert significant influence
within their disciplines--even without large, mainstream
audiences.

Representation Gaps

However, representation matters. Of the top 100 podcast
hosts in the U.S., 77.1% are white, and women of color make
478 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

up only about 7%, according to a recent report by the
Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. This disparity persists even
though podcast listening in the U.S. is only marginally higher
among men.

   The inequality in hosting highlights an important
opportunity: elevating diverse academic voices who bring new
perspectives and experiences to the medium.

    Institution-Branding Podcasts

Beyond individual scholars, colleges and universities are using
podcasts for institution-branding tools--showcasing academic
programs, faculty expertise, university leadership, and life-long
alumni engagement.

   The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of
Business, has expanded its brand by building a podcast
network of five shows focused on major business issues.
          CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 479

The Wharton Podcast Network

Wharton began modestly with a single flagship show, The
Ripple Effect, featuring business scholars discussing emerging
ideas. What started as a small experiment quickly gained
traction as faculty recognized podcasting as a powerful way to
highlight their research.

   The school invested in a studio, provided financial support,
and committed to producing a weekly program. "We had to
make sure our podcasting is informational, educational, and
entertaining," says Dee Patel from the Office of University
Communications. Since then, Wharton has added additional
shows covering business trends, AI, marketing, and sports
analytics.
480 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

Podcast By Academic Programs:

American University's Health Studies Department has
launched Health Snaps, a series of brief, two-minute podcasts
that break down timely public health topics. The cross-
disciplinary project is produced within the College of Arts and
Sciences.

Alumni Podcasts:

Podcasts also offer a powerful way to engage community and
alumni--showcasing their expertise, involving them as
mentors, and illustrating the real-world impact of academic
programs. These connections build alumni pride, strengthen
community, attract future students, and support development
goals.
          CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 481

   This Is Purdue, is the official show from Purdue
University, hosted by alum Kate Young. The podcast
strengthens brand awareness and audience engagement by
featuring ideas, research, and thought leadership from faculty
and alumni every other Thursday. The show has won several
podcast awards, ranks in Apple Podcasts' top charts, and draws
thousands of downloads.

   Originally launched as an audio-only program, the podcast
has since expanded into video, with YouTube as its primary
outlet and short-form video clips amplifying reach on social
media.

    Demystify College & University
    Offices

Student recruitment is the lifeblood of any college or
university, and it's occurring amid dizzying changes in private,
state, and federal regulations. That makes the process
increasingly complex for both institutions and the students
and families they serve.

   To help cut through that complexity, colleges are turning
to podcasts to offer behind-the-scenes insights into financial
aid, admissions, housing, and other high-stakes campus
processes. These shows add a human voice to offices that can
482 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

feel opaque or intimidating, and they help answer the
questions applicants care about most--especially the perennial
one:

   "How do colleges decide who gets in and who doesn't?"
   Bucknell University, a private liberal arts college in
Pennsylvania, tackles this question directly through its podcast
College Admissions Insider, which is part of a broader
communications strategy that also includes a blog and social
media outreach.
         CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 483

   Dartmouth College in New Hampshire offers a similar
public-facing resource with Admissions Beat, a podcast
designed for high school students, counselors, and parents.
Billed as "news you can use" on the path to college, the show
covers topics such as sticker shock, the evolving testing
landscape, and lessons learned from families who have been
through the process.
484 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

   Because admissions and financial aid questions recur year
after year, many university offices develop episodes around so-
called "evergreen" topics--content that remains relevant long
after release. Others, such as athletics or breaking-news
updates, are more time-sensitive. The mix allows institutions
to both respond to immediate needs and build a lasting library
of guidance for future applicants.

    Professional Development on
    Campus

Podcasts also play a growing role in professional
development and employee morale, especially at a time when
campus budgets are under stress due to declining enrollment
and reduced federal and state funding.

   These shows are not aimed at students but instead focus
on faculty and staff, supporting teaching excellence, workplace
culture, and professional development. Typical themes include
teaching and learning, educational technology, organizational
dynamics, and strategies to help educators adapt to change.
         CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 485

   The EdUp Experience, one of the largest and most
established higher education podcasts, talks with college and
university innovators about topics such as the complexities of
accreditation, college rankings, and higher education's future.
The podcast is hosted by Dr. Joe Sallustio and Elvin Freytes.

   The Cult of Pedagogy Podcast is a long-running and
popular show focused on educators' professional growth, with
10+ million total downloads.

   Episodes offer practical strategies--from classroom
management to education reform--featuring conversations
with teachers, administrators, and researchers. Host Jennifer
Gonzalez also publishes articles, blog posts, and teaching
resources on her website.
486 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

   The Continuing Studies Podcast explores the unique
world of university podcasting by sharing experiences, lessons,
and advice from those behind the mic--including production
teams, hosts, and campus marketing professionals.

   Hosted by Neil McPhedran and Jennifer-Lee Gunson, the
show covers everything from the technical aspects of audio
production to the art of storytelling and interviewing,
featuring campuses with strong institutional podcast support
as well as institutions where podcast creators are navigating the
process independently.

   The Teaching Table at the University at Buffalo is a
monthly podcast offering conversations to support educators
with tips on teaching strategy, faculty well-being, and
pedagogical issues. Hosted by learning designer Maggie Grady,
the show explores practical approaches to teaching in today's
higher education environment.

Building Workplace Pride: Staff

Podcasts are also being used to build workplace pride,
community, and satisfaction, especially during times of
financial strain. Any college or university faculty member
knows that while students may be attracted to a particular
program or professor, it is the broader community of staff
members who make campus life function.
         CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 487

   Central Speaks, at the University of Central Missouri,
highlights the people and stories that shape the institution.
Episodes feature staff and community members who reflect
innovation and service on campus. The goal is to energize,
engage, and reaffirm staff members' value in the educational
mission.

Internal Podcasts:

Instead of making all podcasts public--just like many
businesses, colleges and universities can use internal podcasts
to help employees stay connected, share updates without
screen fatigue, support training and onboarding, and provide a
space for important conversations.

   While similar to public podcasts, internal podcast access
is restricted to employees, keeping content private. Platforms
488 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

like uStudio report that clients now produce an average of
10 internal podcasts, demonstrating the growing value of this
approach.

HigherEdPods Directory

It's become much easier to locate and explore higher education
podcasts thanks to the creation of the searchable podcast
directory "HigherEdPods," which lists hundreds of shows.

   The goal of the site is to build a community for those
producing, promoting, and supporting college and university
podcasts.

HigherEdPods Directory

The directory was created by co-founders Neil McPhedran
and Gregg Oldring.
         CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 489

Higher Ed PodCon Convention

The growth of the community of higher ed podcasters took a
major step forward in 2025 with the launch of the first `Higher
Ed PodCon,' which brought together academic podcasters,
students, strategists, faculty, and staff to share expertise and
build new connections.

Olmsted.

The community is continuing to expand with a two-day, in-
person event planned in Cleveland, Ohio in 2026 --further
evidence that institutions are recognizing the value of
podcasting for teaching, research communication, and
outreach, and has evolved into a dedicated convention.
490 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

   The event was founded and organized by a team of higher-
ed podcasting leaders: Elvin Freytes and Dr. Joe Sallustio of
The EdUp Experience, Dean Hoke of Small College America
and EDU Alliance Group, and Gregg Oldring and Neil
McPhedran of HigherEdPods. Oldring also created the
community hub, `HigherEdPods` directory.

Student Podcasts Gain Real-World
Recognition

As podcasting gained momentum in classrooms, a natural next
step emerged: opportunities for students to share their work
beyond campus. That demand helped fuel a growing
ecosystem of student podcast competitions.

   Student podcast competitions have rapidly become a
vibrant training ground where young storytellers can test their
skills, gain national recognition, and engage deeply with real-
world issues through audio journalism and narrative craft.

   NPR's Student Podcast Challenge--now drawing
thousands of entries nationwide --includes competitions for
both middle-school and college students.
          CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS | 491

NPR Student Podcast Challenge

For college students, the competition runs during the fall
academic season and awards a $5,000 grand-prize scholarship
and $500 finalist prizes. Entries must be 3-12 minutes long,
and submissions may come from individuals, teams, personal
projects, or class assignments.

   Topics among finalists have included climate change, gender
and identity, campus politics, and mental health. Winning
entries have ranged from a deeply personal narrative about a
rare mental health condition to a reflective piece on happiness
as a young, single person. Many entries stand out for sound-
rich storytelling, strong writing, and compelling narration.

   For grades 4-12, NPR's Challenge has spotlighted stories
on immigration experiences, hair discrimination, and even
what happens when a high school party spirals out of control.
A recent top prize went to a student whose podcast explored
life with an incarcerated parent.
492 | CHAPTER 12: PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, & EDUCATORS

   Beyond NPR, several other prestigious contests recognize
high-quality, sound-rich work produced fully by students,
helping them build portfolios, confidence, and real-world
media experience.

                  Assignment #1: Ethics
                         Discussion

             Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are now widely
             available for podcasters--handling everything
             from mundane tasks (like transcribing) to
             creative work such as cover art, music, cloned
             voices, or even generating entire podcasts
             from AI. See Chapter 1 for coverage of AI
             issues in podcasting.
             Prepare for a class discussion on the
             following issues:

                  · Are there good uses of AI in podcasting,
                      if so, what are they?

                  · Are there downsides, and if so, what
                      are they?

                  · Since AI is built from existing data
                      bases, do you have concerns over
                      discrimination abuses against
APPENDIX C: PODCAST ASSIGNMENTS & EXAMPLES | 511

          individuals or groups?
      · How important is disclosure of use of

          AI tools in podcasting? Should listeners
          be informed that AI has been used in
          research, preparing guest bios, doing
          ads, or performing any other part of
          podcast production, or is it assumed in
          the world we live in today?
  This exercise may be used for Discussion
  Boards, Blog Posts, Podcasts, or written
  papers.

                Assignment #2: Podcast
                Listening & Deconstruct

             The goal of this assignment is to help
             students understand the diversity of podcast
             formats and the techniques used to produce
             them.
             Students should take notes and listen
             critically--not as casual listeners but as
             analysts studying how the podcast is made.
             Your written analysis should be clear enough
             for someone who has not heard the episode
             to understand how it works.
             See Chapter 6 for guidance on podcast
             deconstruction. By examining how creators
             structure their episodes, you will gain insights
             into storytelling approaches you can apply to
             your own work.
             Instructions:
APPENDIX C: PODCAST ASSIGNMENTS & EXAMPLES | 513

  Select a nonfiction, conversational
  podcast to analyze. Listen to the entire
  show, so pick one that is 20-60 minutes or so
  in length. Take notes to dissect how the show
  is put together by producers. Include a live
  link to the episode you analyzed.

      1. Identify the podcast name and
          description.

       · Explain whether they match the
          content you heard.

       · Evaluate the podcast's music and
          artwork and provide a link to the
          artwork.

       · Discuss whether these elements fit the
          topic and tone.

      2. Evaluate the content.

       · Was it interesting or compelling?
       · Provide specific examples that show

          why.

      3. Identify the show's format.
514 | APPENDIX C: PODCAST ASSIGNMENTS & EXAMPLES

                  · Is it single-host, co-hosted, or a
                      roundtable?

                  · Is the podcast interview-based, a
                      round-table format, or a nonfiction
                      narrative (with the story told through
                      narration plus edited audio clips)?

                  · Identify the genre (such as crime,
                      investigative, sports, politics, pop
                      culture, self-help, educational).

                 4. Evaluate technical quality.
                  · Consider audio quality, clarity of speech,

                      and host/guest vocal energy.
                 5. Identify one thing you DO want to

                      imitate and one thing you DO NOT
                      want to imitate.

       #3: Podcast Pitch & Post

  This assignment has two components, posted
  on the course online Discussion Board, and/or
  also do a class discussion.
  1. Write a Podcast Pitch
  · Propose a podcast title.
  · Describe your podcast in 10 words or fewer.
  2. Review Classmates' Pitches
  · Respond to the pitches of two other
  students.
  · Provide constructive, helpful
  feedback--critical is fine, but your goal is to
  guide improvement.
516 | APPENDIX C: PODCAST ASSIGNMENTS & EXAMPLES

           Assignment #4: Produce & Edit
                       Podcast Open

             The goal of this assignment is to create your
             podcast's standard opening using music and
             voiceover narration. An audio example
             appears at the end of this exercise.
             You will voice and edit the narration and
             music audio and upload the final version to
             the course Assignments area, or whatever
             outlet your instructor provides. Another
             option is SoundCloud, a free cloud-based
             distribution system.
             Instructions:

                  · Select music for your open using
                      royalty-free tracks or original
                      compositions. (See Chapter 11 for places
                      to find royalty-free music).

                  · Submit a written sheet documenting
APPENDIX C: PODCAST ASSIGNMENTS & EXAMPLES | 517

          where you obtained the music and how
          you followed copyright rules.

                If credit is required, note how
                   you will give oral and website
                   credit.

       · Your show open should include:
                The show name
                Your name

             A short description of the
               podcast

       · Edit the audio:
                Place the music on one track,
                   narration on another.
                Start with full-volume music,
                   lower it when narration begins,
                   then bring it back up and fade
                   out after narration ends.

       · Export as an MP3 and send it to your
          instructor.

  storytelling. In sound-based stories, listeners
  must immediately recognize what they are
  hearing.
  An audio example appears at the end of this
  exercise.
  Instructions:

       · Create a short fictional audio story
           (50-90 seconds).

       · Use a combination of:
                Sound effects

     Assignment #6: Descriptive
          Writing & Recording

  This assignment focuses on writing vivid,
  sensory descriptions that help the listener
  imagine a scene, like the one below.
  Instructions:

       · Select a photo from the 100 most
          influential photos of all time.

       · Research the historical context, then
          write about the scene without
          explicitly stating what the photo
          depicts.

       · Use strong adjectives, adverbs, and
          sensory details.

       · Record your writing using clear
          articulation and vocal energy.

     #7: Deconstructing Podcast
                Storytelling

  The goal of this option is to expose students
  to a broad range of podcast topics and styles,
  comparing how different creators approach
  content, structure, and production.

       · Go to a podcast directory and
           select two podcasts on different
           subjects to listen to for at least 15
           minutes.

       · Go to a podcast directory and
           select two podcasts on the same
           subject (hopefully on a topic you
           expect to cover on your podcast) and
           listen for at least 15 minutes.

       · Write a 4-5 page critical analysis based
           on the following criteria:

      1. Describe/critique the podcast name,
524 | APPENDIX C: PODCAST ASSIGNMENTS & EXAMPLES

                      description, music, and artwork;
                 2. How interesting or compelling is the

                      content? Think in terms of quality,
                      style, format, and genre;
                 3. How well is the technical portion of the
                      podcast done? Think about audio
                      quality and clarity of speech;
                 4. Identify one thing from each of the
                      four podcasts that you DO or DO NOT
                      want to imitate.

   Assignment #8: Create & Edit a
               Mini-Podcast

  This assignment requires combining your
  previous work into a small pilot episode,
  adding three new elements: narration,
  bumper, and show ending. To understand
  these terms review Chapter 6 on scripting.
  Assembly Instructions
  Your mini-podcast should include:

      1. Your completed podcast open
      2. Your audio sound story
      3. Make a voiceover recording of your

           descriptive-writing photo story
      4. Create a bumper, such as:

                "You are listening to `Home
