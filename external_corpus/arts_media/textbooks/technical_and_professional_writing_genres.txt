Reviews

Amy Rubens, Associate Professor, Radford University, on
1/12/23 for the Open Textbook Library.

      4.5/5 Stars
      Comprehensiveness: 4
      The title suggests the textbook book offers a genre-
driven exploration of technical and professional writing
(TPW). On the whole, the textbook delivers on this
promise. It is divided into two sections: the first describes

                                              xv
xvi Katrina Peterson

the foundational principles of TPW while the second
outlines how those strategies are used within the most
common TPW genres, such as instructions, proposals, and
reports. Also addressed are additional genres that are
crucial for accomplishing the work of TPW, such as
correspondence (e.g., email) and writing for the hiring
process (e.g., resumes). The textbook does not cover genres
such as flyers, websites, or social media; this is not
surprising given the explicit focus of the textbook. That
being said, TPW writing style in the textbook is given little
attention-just a few short paragraphs. This is surprising
considering the extent to which the book purports to be an
introduction to TPW; most students encountering this text,
therefore, would have had little guidance in understanding
how TPW writing style differs from the academic writing
style they have been trained in for most of their educational
lives. Overall, though, instructors who choose this text may
be able to rely on it in their TPW courses (introductory, at
least) to a significant extent.

      Content Accuracy rating: 5
      The textbook offers theoretical frameworks and
practical applications that are in keeping with TPW as a
scholarly discipline and professional field.
      Relevance/Longevity rating: 3
      TPW is intertwined with technology, but references
to technology in this textbook are a mixed bag in terms
of their currency. For instance, the chapter on ethics is
very current, as it helps TPW students navigate the use of
online sources in ways they may not have considered in
previous writing courses. But, the sections on email and
text messages could be updated so that they speak more
authentically to today's college students and the ways in
which email, video conferencing, chat, and social media
messages have become central to our personal and
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres xvii

professional lives post-COVID-19. The chapter on resumes
and cover letters could be updated to be more relevant to
the needs and expectations of today's job seekers.

      Clarity rating: 4
      For the most part, the text is written with accessible
language, and in this way, the text models plain language,
a mainstay of PTW. At times, language can become
somewhat esoteric or "academic."
      Consistency rating: 5
      Terminology is used consistently throughout the text
and is in keeping with conventions of the field.
      Modularity rating: 5
      The text easily lends itself to modular use, which is
a boon for TPW instructors who are using OER in their
courses. NB: The topics of "design" and "research" appear
to be organized within (discrete) chapters, but they also are
addressed at length in other parts of the textbook. This does
not detract from the overall modularity of this textbook, in
my view.
      Organization/Structure/Flow rating: 5
      The textbook's structure is logical; this is especially
true of the early chapters, which introduce students to the
field (i.e., purpose, basic tenets). Still, because the book
is highly modular, it can easily be reordered to suit an
individual instructor's pedagogical needs.
      Interface rating: 4
      For most computer users, the interface is clean and
easy to navigate. Collapsible menus allow users to easily
navigate to specific areas of the textbook. The textbook
occasionally utilizes internal links to allow navigation to
related content in another chapter. An important note:
Instructional graphics and some short sample documents
(e.g., submittal letter) are embedded in the textbook as
images (.png) while lengthier student sample documents
xviii Katrina Peterson

open to web-accessible PDFs that are supported by a
university library system. The non-decorative images
(graphics and short sample documents) embedded in the
text do not appear to have alt text added to them. Some
PDFs do not appear to be optimized for screen readers.

      Grammatical Errors rating: 5
      This text models good writing in terms of grammar.
      Cultural Relevance rating: 4
      The textbook is inclusive and respectful in terms of its
use of language, sample document content, and suggested
exercises. However, the textbook does not extensively
address how TPW practitioners can be inclusive and
respectful in their own use of language. Inclusiveness as it
relates to document design is addressed in detail, though.
      Comments
Relevant, useful, and meaningful practice activities are
included in the textbook; many seem lend themselves well
to in-class work (think-pair-share). Sometimes, these
activities are not always listed in each chapter's table of
contents.
      Mandy Palmer, on OERCommons
      This is an excellent, accessible, comprehensive
textbook for Technical Writing. A review of this resource
demonstrates that it hits the evaluation markers of: 1.
Reliability/Credibility/Quality of Content, 2. Scope of
Content, 3. Organization & Design, 4. Current or up-to-
date information, and 5. Credentials of author(s).
      Further, students find this book approachable and
relevant.

OpenOKState Student Privacy
Guidelines

OpenOKState and the OSU Libraries Library Teaching and
Learning (T&L) Team* strive to enable engaging learning
experiences for students using a variety of digital
resources**. When you--the student--use these resources,
you're likely to produce some data, such as data about
how you used the resources (e.g., what you clicked on) or
the content you produced while using the resources (e.g.,
answering a question).

      In line with our values and our beliefs about student
data privacy, our T&L team has created and closely follows
a set of guidelines, made up of 5 core principles, for any
type of student data we might come in contact with.

      We aim to be exceedingly transparent with you
about your data. On this page, you can learn about our
team's values and beliefs regarding student data privacy as
well as explore the 5 core principles of our Student Data
Privacy Guidelines.

      If you have any questions about these guidelines or
about your data privacy, please don't hesitate to contact the
Director of Library Teaching and Learning, Holly Reiter, at
holly.reiter@okstate.edu.

      *The data and Guidelines referenced on this page are
unique to Library Teaching & Learning, and do not indicate
guidelines for the Library or the University as a whole.

      **For our purposes, digital learning objects include
interactive tutorials, OStateTV or YouTube videos, the
mobile Library Scavenger Hunt, visits to web pages that

                                             xix

workshop registration.

Values and Beliefs

Values

Our Library Teaching and Learning team values:

         · Prioritizing student needs and welfare
         · Restoring and protecting equity and assisting

            students in doing the same
         · Incorporating student voice and experiences and

            using it to shape our practice
         · Providing "digital sanctuaries," or digital

            environments that prioritize and promote student
            safety

Student Data Privacy Beliefs

As a Teaching and Learning team, we have foundational,
ethical, scholarship-shaped beliefs about student data that
have shaped our student data practice and guidelines.

      We believe in prioritizing student data privacy to...

         · Protect students
         · Respect student autonomy
         · Return power to students and establish equity
         · Protect students' intellectual freedom
         · Build trust between students and Library
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres xxi

            Teaching and Learning
         · Enable student data privacy literacy

Core Principles of Student Data Privacy

Responsibility

The Teaching and Learning team believes it's our ethical
responsibility to protect your data privacy. Specifically, we
uphold the responsibility to:

         · Ensure any collected data is handled carefully,
            used effectively, and used only for the stated
            purpose.

         · Prevent unauthorized disclosure, use, or
            collection of your data

         · Follow specific steps in data collection, use,
            storage, and destruction.

         · Carry a shared understanding of our role in your
            data privacy.

Transparency

T&L believes you shouldn't have to wonder what's
happening with your data, so we strive to be as open and
transparent with you as possible. For each digital learning
object we use, we'll share the following:

         · What we are and are not collecting
         · Why we're collecting it
xxii Katrina Peterson

         · How it's being collected

         · How it's being used

         · Who has access to the data

To keep you safe, we strive to store and process all data
according to best practices. We'll only collect the minimum
amount of data necessary to achieve our stated objectives.

Privacy and Consent

T&L believes that privacy is your right. We strive to honor
your privacy by never releasing any personally identifiable
information unless it is to your instructor of record who is
using the digital learning object within their class.

      Occasionally, we may share aggregates of de-
identified or anonymized data internally (e.g., with Library
administrators) or externally (e.g., at Library or industry
conferences). We do this to continuously improve
effectiveness, evaluate the effectiveness of our teaching
and learning program, or to help evolve and shape the
practices of our profession. Aggregating the data means
that the data is in summary form and no individual student
can be identified.

      Finally, we will never sell or otherwise commodify
your data, and will always prioritize the use of vendors and
resources that do the same.

Confidentiality and Security

T&L takes great strides to ensure that any and all data we
collect is kept confidential and secure.

      We use several vendors to help us create and host
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres xxiii

digital learning objects and collect analytics. Sometimes,
these vendors have access to your personally identifiable
information for operational purposes, so we intentionally
investigate and select vendors that also prioritize
confidentiality and security.

Access

Sometimes we do collect and store personally identifiable

Chapter 1: Introduction

Michael Beilfuss

1.1 What is Technical Writing?

You are probably wondering what this "technical writing
thing" is. Someone may even have told you "It's this course
where they make you write about computers, rocket
science, and brain surgery." Well, not really, as you will see
in a moment.

      Technical writing is an audience-centered means of
communication that provides a reader with clear and easy
access to information so they understand both the
document's and the author's purpose and respond
accordingly. The technical writer and reader have a vis-
à-vis relationship. The writer recognizes, respects, and
addresses the importance of the audience's time by being
clear, concise, and accessible. The writer strives for
effective and efficient communication by providing
documents written in specific formats, using unambiguous
language to convey clearly accessible information. The
reader in turn thoroughly processes the information in
order to give a thoughtful response or take appropriate
action.

      Technical writing courses introduce you to the skills,
genres, and other important aspects of writing in the worlds
of science, technology, and business--in other words, the
kind of writing that scientists, nurses, doctors, construction
managers, computer specialists, government officials,
engineers, and other professionals do as a part of their

                                      3
4 Katrina Peterson

regular work. The skills learned in technical writing
courses are useful in a broad spectrum of fields, including
education and social sciences.

      To learn how to write effectively for the professional
world, you will study common types of reports, special
format items such as lists and headings, simple techniques
for creating and using graphics in reports, and some
techniques for producing professional-looking final copy.
This book focuses on skills and genres. The idea is that
while you learn the conventions that govern one genre,
such as technical instructions, you will also practice skills
such as the appropriate use of graphics and design to
facilitate communication. It is important to build a strong
foundation of skills and genre knowledge so that you can
more efficiently complete writing tasks when they arise.

      This approach will allow you to apply what you learn
here to a variety of situations. The skills and genre
knowledge you will acquire in this book should be flexible
and adaptable. Sometimes technical writing is formulaic,
which can be a good thing if you need to communicate
something with great clarity and efficiency. However, do
not let formulaic writing sap the energy out of everything
you write.

Rhetorical Situation

One of the most important skills you will practice is
analyzing and understanding the rhetorical situation of
your writing task. Essentially, the rhetorical situation
describes the relationships between and among the
audience, writer, content, and context of communication.
That might sound complicated right now, but it can
basically be broken down into an awareness and sensitivity
to the needs of your audience. What does your audience
                                    Technical and Professional Writing Genres 5

  already know? What do they want out of your document?
  Where, when, and how are they going to use the document
  you create? These are some of the questions you want to
  ask yourself before you begin any writing task. There is
  more on audience below, and throughout this book.

        Without even knowing it, you may be familiar with
  these concepts from your college, or even high school,
  composition course. If you have ever heard of the terms
  ethos, logos, or pathos, you know something about
  classical (Aristotelian) rhetoric and what is often called the
  rhetorical situation. If your writing is based on logos, you
  would be using facts, reason, and logic to communicate
  your message; if your argument is based on ethos, you
  would be relying on your credibility as a writer to
  communicate your message; and if your writing is based
  on pathos, you are attempting to appeal to your audience's
  emotions (joy, fear, hope, anger, pride, etc). For more about
  these appeals see "Ethos, Logos, Pathos" 1.

        Technical writing courses build on what you have
  learned in other writing courses. You will have an
  opportunity to dust off those writing tools, and practice
  the art and craft of effective communication. However,
  there is plenty new to learn! If you currently have a job
  in which you do some writing, you will discover that you
  can put what you learn in your technical writing course to
  immediate use.

  About Technical Writing

  While technical communication is essential in a wide range
  of fields and occupations, technical writing is also a fully

1. http://georgehwilliams.pbworks.com/w/page/14266873/Ethos-Pathos-Logos-
      The-3-Rhetorical-Appeals
6 Katrina Peterson

professional field of its own with degree programs,
certifications, and even theory. There are no fewer than five
scholarly journals that are devoted completely or in part
to publishing articles related to technical writing; what it
is, how it works, how it is changing, and how to teach it.
The journals include: Technical Communication Quarterly,
Journal of Technical Writing and Communication; Journal
of Business and Technical Communication; English for
Specific Purposes; and Issues in Writing. Technical writing
is a field with a lot of growth and income potential, and
an introductory technical writing course is a good way to
determine if you are interested in a career in this field or
work in which writing is a major component.

Workplace Writing

Many students of technical writing courses are not
necessarily planning for a career as a technical writer or
instructor. However, this course will provide you with an
introduction to the kinds of writing skills you need in
practically any professional career. No matter what sort of
work you do, you are likely to do some writing--and much
of it may be technical in nature. Furthermore, if you hope
to advance in your career and eventually manage people or
open your own business, having technical writing skills is
a critical communication tool that will save you time and
money. If you lack these skills, you may not be able to
properly assess the quality of a report you have assigned
someone to write, or you may end up sending emails that
are unintentionally offensive, or you may be forced to
hire a professional writer to create your employee manuals
and instructional guides. The more you know about, and
practice, the basic technical writing skills revealed in this
text, the better you will be at writing. And that will be good
                                 Technical and Professional Writing Genres 7

for the projects you work on, for the organizations you
work for, and--most of all--for you and your career. Make
no mistake, if you want to succeed in your career, you have
to be a successful communicator - and a large part of that
includes writing.

The Meaning of "Technical"

Technical communication--or technical writing, as the
course is often called--is not writing about a specific
technical topic such as computers, but about any technical
topic. The term "technical" refers to knowledge that is
not widespread, that is more the territory of experts and
specialists. Whatever your major is, you are developing
an expertise--you are becoming a specialist in a particular
technical area. Whenever you try to write or say anything
about your field, you are engaged in technical
communication.

Importance of Audience

Another key part of the definition of technical
communication is the receiver of the information--the
audience. Technical communication is the delivery of
technical information to readers (or listeners or viewers)
in a manner that is adapted to their needs, their level of
understanding, and their background. Most technical
documents are also written with a respect for the audience's
time, meaning sentences are written as efficiently as
possible and content is arranged and displayed in a way
that allows the reader to quickly locate relevant
information. In fact, this audience element is so important
that it is one of the cornerstones of technical writing: you
8 Katrina Peterson

are often challenged to write about technical subjects in a
way that a beginner could understand. Sometimes you have
to write for an audience of other specialists, but generally
speaking, you are communicating information to someone
who does not already know or have it.

      This ability to "translate" technical information to
non-specialists is a key skill to any technical
communicator. In a world of rapid technological
development, many people are constantly falling behind.
As a result, technology companies regularly struggle to
find effective ways to help current or potential customers
understand the advantages or the operation of new
products. Even within businesses, people with different
skill sets need to be able to communicate effectively with
one another; engineers need to communicate with lawyers;
mechanics with accountants; sales people with managers
and executives.

      You do not have to write about computers or rocket
science--write about the area of technical specialization
you know or are learning about. And plan to write about it
in such a way that your audience will understand. (See the
chapter 2 for more on this topic.)

Really Technical Writing

You should know that professional technical writers do in
fact write about very technical stuff--information that they
cannot begin to master unless they go back for a Ph.D.
But without a PhD in rocket science, how is a technical
writer supposed to know create accurate instructions for
how to properly secure the linkages between rocket mounts
and fuel delivery systems? How is the writer supposed to
gain that knowledge in just a few weeks before the rockets
need to ship? How do they manage? Professional technical
                                 Technical and Professional Writing Genres 9

writers rely on these strategies to ensure the technical
accuracy of their work:

         · Study books, articles, reports, websites related
            to the product

         · Review product specifications: What the
            product is supposed to do, how it is designed

         · Interview subject-matter experts (SMEs): The
            product specialists, developers, engineers

         · Attend product meetings during the
            development cycle

         · Participate in live demonstrations of the product

         · Become familiar with similar, competing
            products

         · Experiment with working models of the product

         · Ask subject-matter experts to review work for
            technical accuracy and completeness

Of course, experienced technical writers will tell you that
product development moves so fast that specifications are
not always possible and that working models of the product
are rarely available. That is why the Subject-matter
Experts' review is often the most important. Based on the
list above, you can also see that technical writing is often a
collaborative process, where many people contribute to the
process of creating the final product.

Technical Writing and Academic Writing

You have probably taken at least one academic writing
10 Katrina Peterson

course before this one, so you will be familiar with some of
the practices of writing for your college classes.

      The concentration on definite purpose, strict format,
and use of appropriate language in technical writing define
the differences between technical writing and academic
writing. The academic writer's purpose may be to write
an assignment, a story, a letter, etc. These works may or
may not have a reader outside the classroom. However,
technical writing is always much more concerned with
articulating a clearly defined purpose with a specific,
known reader. Regardless of the number of stakeholders,
and the variety of people who may encounter and read your
documents, it is important to have a clear idea of your
primary reader.

      In technical writing courses, the focus is typically
the analytical report. Just about everything you do in the
course is aimed at developing skills needed to produce
this report. Of course, most technical writing courses begin
with a resume and application letter, and many include
writing a set of instructions to help practice making
technical knowledge available to non-experts. Remember
that much of this book is based on mastering both skills
and genres. While creating these documents and mastering
the forms (or genres), you will also learn advantageous
strategies for a document's graphics, layout, and design.
However, the main assignment in most technical writing
courses is the analytical report.

      Planning to write this report consists of several
phases:

       1. Establishing group roles

       2. Writing a proposal in which you lay out your
            research strategy
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 11

       3. Performing primary and secondary research

       4. Analyzing research

       5. Writing the report

Before writing the report, however, you will likely be
assigned shorter documents (memos, emails, outlines,
drafts) where you get accustomed to using things like
headings, lists, graphics, and special notices--not to
mention writing about technical subject matter in a clear,
concise, understandable way that is appropriate for a
specific audience.

      CAUTION. You should be aware that technical
writing courses are writing-intensive. If you are taking a
full load of classes, working full time, and juggling unique
family obligations, please consider whether this is the right
time for you to take technical writing. Consult with your
professor about the workload for this class in order to make
your decision.

      You will probably write more in your technical-
writing course than in any other course you have ever
taken, and the writing is expected to look professional. It
is time to stop thinking of yourself as students and your
assignments as inconsequential busy-work. Instead, start
thinking of yourselves as professionals who are learning
new skills and putting into practice those skills you have
already mastered.

1.2 Cultural Diversity and Technical
Communication

Culture is part of the very fabric of our thought, and we
cannot separate ourselves from it. When you are analyzing
12 Katrina Peterson

the rhetorical situation, it is a good idea to consider the
cultural context(s) that may be in play. Every business
or organization has a culture, and within what may be
considered a global culture, there are many subcultures or
co-cultures. For example, consider the difference between
the sales and accounting departments in a corporation. We
can quickly see two distinct groups with their own
symbols, vocabulary, and values. Within each group, there
may also be smaller groups, and each member of each
department comes from a distinct background that in itself
influences behavior and interaction. Now, change that
context to an act of communication. Who will hear it?
Who could read it? What will your colleagues or readers of
another culture take from it--intended or not? Sometimes,
the focus of technical communication is quite easy; the
primary reader is clearly targeted through demographic
research. But, think about how much more effective and
more dynamic a communication could be if the writer
considered the potential cultural perspectives at work.

      Diversity includes many different factors, ranging
from race and ethnicity to culture and worldview. The
more diverse an audience, the harder it becomes to tailor
a speech to that audience. However, the more we study
cross-cultural communication issues, the more aware we
become. It is, of course, impossible to know every culture
well; some of us are still working on learning our own!
However, it may be helpful to recognize several paradigms
used to discuss culture, in order to recognize certain
characteristics, while also appreciating cultural uniqueness
and seeking to avoid generalizations.

      Appreciating cultural uniqueness helps us to
understand major communication styles. The terms
collectivist and individualistic are sometimes used to
discuss cultural differences. Many Americans value family,
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 13

but American culture also places a strong emphasis on
making our own choices in career, education, marriage,
and living arrangements. In more collectivist cultures, the
family or larger community may have a strong voice in an
individual's life choices. An individual's decisions may be
more strongly influenced the community than individual
preferences.

      Closely related to the distinction between
collectivistic and individualistic is the distinction between
high-context and low-context cultures. High-context
cultures are so closely tied together that behavioral norms
are implicit, or not talked about directly; they tend to be
understood and unstated, having been learned through
close observation and/or even unconsciously through
immersion in the culture. Here is an example of a high-
context exchange. If you and your friends have a routine of
watching football every Sunday, saying "I'll see you guys
this weekend for the game" implies that the "when" and
"where" of the game is so ingrained that it does not need to
be explicitly stated.

      Continuing the example from above, in these cases
you might be gathering with a new group of friends who
need explicit, high-context communication to know what
is going on: "We'll meet at Jay's house on Bleaker Street
at 11:30 on Sunday morning." High-context cultures are
described as more relational, collectivist, intuitive, and
contemplative. This means that people in these cultures
emphasize interpersonal relationships; developing trust is
an important first step to any business transaction. High-
context cultures may emphasize group harmony and
consensus over individual achievement. Low-context
cultures are often described as more action-oriented,
practical, direct, and precise. In contrast, high-context
cultures spend more time on interpersonal trust, may be
14 Katrina Peterson

less direct and straightforward, and may use more polite
or flowery language. These descriptions are useful to some
extent, but they can also be problematic due to their
tendency to generalize. A person from a high-context
culture is perfectly capable of being action-oriented, for
example, while a person from a low-context culture still
values interpersonal trust and politeness. While it is
important to be aware of these possible cultural
differences, you should never allow this awareness to
ossify into an unconscious stereotype or bias. Do not base
your judgments on people solely on generalizations -
whether those generalizations seem ungenerous or even
generous.

      Another way to distinguish among cultural groups
is to consider decision-making and the predominant
communication modes. Some cultures emphasize a
strongly narrative communication mode, with storytelling
being the way the important information is conveyed.
Others value group discussion and keeping the harmony
of the group, while others rely heavily on the advice of
elders in decision making. These practices say a lot about
our shared histories and our values, views of the past, and
approach to interpersonal trust. Nonverbal communication,
which is very noticeable to us when we experience a new
culture, is divided into types such as: oculesics (eye
behavior), haptics (touch behavior), proxemics (distance
from others), vocalics (voice characteristics), chronemics
(use of time in communication), and kinesics (use of the
arms, legs, and posture).

      Each of these focal points has unique patterns in
various cultures, and the differences in nonverbal
communication behavior may have deeper cultural
meanings. Some cultures may avoid eye contact out of
respect; their high-context nature means direct
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 15

confrontation is discouraged. Other cultures tend to judge
low eye contact rather harshly, as either dishonest,
disinterest, or indicating low self-esteem. In many Western
cultures, punctuality is valued strongly. Other cultures
simply do not understand the Western love affair with the
hands on the clock.

      People from the United States are sometimes seen by
other cultures as loud (vocalics), too direct and forward
(oculesics), taking up too much space (kinesics and
proxemics), and uncomfortable with touch or close spaces
(haptics and proxemics). Of course, audiences of different
cultural backgrounds may include those for whom English
is a second (or third or fourth) language. Watch out for
metaphors, slang, and figurative language that simply have
no meaning to non-native speakers of English. Many
American expressions have to do with sports--everything
from poker to football--and have no significance to those
who have not grown up around those sports. Some of
our expressions are actually racist or have a racist past,
without our knowing or recognizing it because we do not
know the origin of the phrase. Even a phrase that seems
innocuous such as "bury the hatchet" could be viewed as
culturally insensitive to Native Americans. If you use it,
you are referring (inadvertently) to ethnic stereotypes as
well as using references that non-U.S. cultures would not
understand. There are many other such phrases that are
worth interrogating and avoiding when recognized.

      As emerging technology makes communicating with
people around the world easier and more common, there
is a good chance you will find yourself communicating or
interacting with persons from other cultures in your future
careers. Primarily, recognize the underlying values of the
culture. The value and place of family may matter greatly,
for example. You would want to be sure to show respect
16 Katrina Peterson

to parents and grandparents in everything you say; if you
cannot do that, do not mention them at all. Other values
may have to do with how genders are treated, modesty in
clothing, or criticism of the government. Do not jump to
judge speakers of other cultures by Western standards. As a
piece of concluding advice, always seek for commonalities
over differences; if you dig into cultural differences far
enough, you will often find that our different houses are
built on similar foundations.

1.3 Chapter Summaries

Below you will find brief summaries of each chapter in this
book. After reading through them all, you should have a
good sense of what you will learn as you work through the
content.

Chapter 2: Audience

This chapter focuses on audience and different
considerations for revising your document based on the
audience(s). The type of audience identified will shape
your document's format, terminology, style, and technical
level. There are several types of audiences, including
experts, technicians, executives, gatekeepers, and
nonspecialists (laypeople). However, most documents you
create will have multiple audiences: often, a primary
audience--the main audience for the document--and a
secondary audience--other audiences that are likely to
read the document, but who are not the main focus of the
document. In addition to the type of audience, you should
analyze the audience to identify other factors that can affect
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 17

how the document is received, including background,
needs and interests, culture and values, and demographic
characteristics. The rest of the chapter gives strategies to
revise a document's content for your audience, including
changes to the content, style and format, sentence style,
and document design.

Chapter 3: Group Work

This chapter covers some of the fundamentals of team
work. After introducing the importance and prevalence of
team work in the workplace, the chapter describes how best
to build teams and ensure that they run smoothly. One of
the first things a team needs to do is take an inventory
of each member's qualifications. Assessing qualifications
allows teams to better assign roles, some of which are
described here. Once the team has been built and everyone
knows their roles, the planning stage begins - specific
responsibilities are allocated among the group members to
best fit their qualifications, the group writes out a schedule,
and plans for any problems that may arise either within or
outside the group. The chapter ends with a number of tips
for a successful team project.

Chapter 4: Ethics

In this chapter, you will learn about some of the ethical
challenges that you may encounter in your professional
and academic life, especially when it comes to technical
writing. First you will want to consider what your ethical
code is so you can be prepared when you find yourself
18 Katrina Peterson

in uncomfortable and/or unethical situations. The chapter
covers ethical principles, how ethics may affect the
presentation of information, and some common ethical
problems encountered by technical writers. Much of this
chapter is concerned with the appropriate and ethical use
and documentation of sources. The chapter provides some
practical information on how to make sure your writing is
ethical and how to handle ethical dilemmas and possible
legal issues in the workplace.

Chapter 5: Design

This chapter briefly summarizes fundamental concepts to
consider as you craft print and electronic texts. In this
chapter you will read about basic principles of document
design that allow writers to combine graphic elements with
text to convey a message to audiences. Beginning with
a discussion of standard conventions (of formatting,
language, and style), the chapter then shares some basic
guidelines for document design, moving forward to focus
on integration of graphics, callouts and captions. Other
topics include tables of contents, figures and tables,
headings and the well-known CRAP test used by graphic
designers. For additional resources, see the activities
included at the chapter's end.

Chapter 6: Emails, Letters, Memos

This chapter introduces the basics of email writing and
etiquette, also providing information on memos and
texting. It offers suggestions about when (and when not to!)
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 19

use email in business communication. It details the basic
conventions of structure: the header/address information,
greeting, message body, and closing. It gives an overview
of Netiquette, the expectations of online etiquette, which
has application for other genres of online communication
as well. The chapter concludes with a bulleted list of
takeaways and tips, followed by additional teaching and
learning resources.

Chapter 7: Career Documents

Looking for and landing the perfect job may seem like a
daunting task. If you are uncertain where to start, know that
most successful job applicants feel the same uncertainty
at some point. This chapter will walk you through the
process of applying for jobs from start to finish. Perhaps
most importantly, it will provide you with two distinct
tools that can help you to construct the materials for a
strong, effective, and successful job application (Bay 75):
1) the résumé and 2) the job application letter. Résumés
and application letters are among the most important
documents in the employment process (Oregon 199).
Beginning with an overview of the big-picture process, this
chapter moves forward with suggested methods for finding
job ads and constructing the genre documents for a job
packet. In the résumé section, it discusses the following
topics: Purposes and Goals, Types of Résumés, Sample
Résumés, Drafting and Design: Where to Start, What to
Include/Exclude, Optional Sections, and Drafting
Activities and Resources. The next section on application
letters will share information about deciphering the job
description, as well as letter format, structure, and content.
The chapter concludes with information on interviews,
20 Katrina Peterson

followed by specific guidelines for the job packet you will
construct in English 3323.

Chapter 8: Technical Instructions

The chapter begins with a brief overview of the importance
of knowing how to write instructions followed with some
basic guidelines. The chapter goes into some depth in
regards to analyzing the rhetorical situation for writing
instructions. The rhetorical situation includes the purpose,
audience and context for any particular set of instructions.
Next we cover how to plan and organize the writing
process followed by information about the content that is
typically included in instructions. The chapter ends with
some nitty-gritty tips on writing the instructions.

Chapter 9: Proposals

This chapter defines when and where you would use a
proposal. Before drafting, you define some preliminary
qualities, including if the proposal is written for internal or
external audiences, is solicited or unsolicited, and if you
are proposing a known or unknown solution. Next, the
chapter discusses further considerations for your audience,
followed by a breakdown of common sections present in
most proposals. As proposal content can vary depending
on the type and purpose and audience, a section is included
on additional, project-specific sections which could be
included in some proposals, such as client analysis and
implementation sections. The standard design and format
of a proposal is discussed, with emphasis on adaptability
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 21

for the reader. The end of this chapter contains a revision
checklist for proposals.

Chapter 10: Research

In this chapter, you will learn how to plan for conducting
different types of research, depending on your research
goals. The chapter starts by giving information on creating
a hypothesis and research questions to guide your research.
In addition, you will learn about conducting both primary
and secondary research and when to choose one or the
other. Different types of both primary and secondary
research are discussed, to help you decide which is best
for your specific project. Information for creating your own
survey and interview questions is included, as well as tips
for evaluating secondary sources.

Chapter 11: Reports

The standard components of the typical technical report are
discussed in this chapter, including preliminary choices,
audience and purpose considerations, common sections of
reports, and format. As you read and use these guidelines,
remember that these are guidelines, not commandments.
Different companies, professions, and organizations have
their own varied guidelines for reports--you will need to
adapt your practice to those as well the ones presented here.
In some industries, reports even use Excel files and other
types of untraditional formats. In addition to the content
and style of a standard report, the end of the chapter
included details on two specific sub genres of reports that

Chapter 12: Oral Reports

This chapter shares basic principles for the preparation and
delivery of oral reports. Since presentations often include
a visual component, the chapter begins with guidelines
for creating an effective PowerPoint, Prezi, or Keynote.
It includes tips for developing effective slides, while
acknowledging the drawbacks of presentation software. It
also offers suggestions to help speakers prepare well,
overcome anxiety, and consider their speaking context. It
gives an overview of expected structural
conventions--how to set up an introduction, body, and
conclusion--and ends with useful delivery tips.

Chapter 2: Audience

Staci Bettes

Chapter Synopsis

This chapter focuses on audience and different
considerations for revising your document based on those
audiences. The type of audience identified will shape your
document's format, terminology, style, and technical level.
There are several types of audiences, including experts,
technicians, executives, gatekeepers, and non-specialists
(laypeople). However, most documents you create will
have multiple audiences: often, a primary audience--the
main audience for the document--and a secondary
audience--other audiences that are likely to read the
document, but who are not the main focus. In addition to
the type of audience, you should analyze the audience to
identify other factors that can affect how the document
is received, including background, needs and interests,
culture and values, and demographic characteristics. The
rest of the chapter gives strategies to revise a document's
content for your audience, including changes to the
content, style and format, sentence style, and document
design.

2.1 Introduction

A key concern of technical communication is the receiver
of the information--the audience. Technical

                                     23
24 Katrina Peterson

communication is the delivery of technical information to
readers (or listeners or viewers) in a manner that is adapted
to their needs, level of understanding, and background.
Your documents must clearly convey new information to
the reader, and you often need to translate highly technical
concepts to groups with differing levels of technical
knowledge--this is a key skill for any technical
communicator. Therefore, the audience is one of the most
important considerations in planning, writing, and
reviewing a document. Adapt your writing to meet the
needs, interests, culture, and background of those who will
be reading your documents.

      It is often not enough to identify a single audience for
documents. There are several types of readers who may use
them, each with different backgrounds, education levels,
needs, and interest in the topic. All should be considered
when analyzing the audience for a successful technical
document.

2.2 Types of Audiences

During the planning stages of your document, you should
analyze the audience to identify the type (or types--it is
rarely just one type) of readers. Identifying what type of
reader may be interested in your document will help you
create an improved, more effective document.

Common Types of Audiences

The following are several types of common audiences for
technical documents:

         · Experts: People who know the business or
                   Technical and Professional Writing Genres 25

   organization (and possibly the theory and the
   product) inside and out. They designed it, they
   tested it, and they know everything about it.
   Often, they have advanced degrees and operate
   in academic settings or in research and
   development areas of the government and
   technology worlds (the creators, specialists).

· Technicians: People who build, operate,
   maintain, and repair the items that the experts
   design and theorize about. They have highly
   technical knowledge as well, but of a more
   practical nature (the hands-on users, operators).

· Executives: People who make business,
   economic, administrative, legal, governmental,
   or political decisions about the products.
   Executives frequently have little technical
   knowledge about the subject. Often, executives
   will be the primary audience for documents such
   as proposals and reports (the CEOs, committees,
   hiring managers).

· Gatekeepers: People who oversee the writer
   and the document. They decide if the document
   is compliant with rules, regulations, legal
   obligations, and/or the needs of the writer's
   employer. Think of them as the direct
   supervisors of the writer--they confirm that a
   document will fulfill its purpose for the client,
   as well as ensure compliance with the
   company's rules, regulations, and policies. In
   the classroom, your instructor will often be your
   gatekeeper--they ensure you follow the
   standards and goals of the assignment (the
   writer's supervisors, lawyers, instructors).
26 Katrina Peterson

         · Non-specialists: People with the least technical
            knowledge of the topic. They want to use the
            new product to accomplish tasks; they want to
            understand the new technology, products, or
            procedures enough to use them in a particular
            situation. Or, they may just be curious about a
            specific technical matter and want to learn about
            it--but for no specific, practical reason (the
            laypeople).

Audience analysis can become complicated when you
consider that you may have a combination of audience
types and backgrounds: mixed audience types, wide
variability within audience, and/or unknown audiences.

Multiple or Mixed Audiences

Most documents you write will have multiple or mixed
audiences. Often, it is best to think of these in terms of the
primary audience(s) and secondary audience(s).

      The primary audience is the main reader of the
document. For example, if you create a set of safety
protocols to be displayed in a laboratory, the primary
audience will be the technicians which use the laboratory.
In this example, it is important to adapt the safety protocols
for the technicians to understand, as unclear steps could
lead to physical harm.

      The secondary audience(s) is made up of others who
may read or be interested in a document, but who is not
the main (primary) reader. In the laboratory example, these
groups could be experts who enforce laboratory regulations
and safety standards, but also could be non-specialist
custodial staff that clean and maintain the lab. Both of these
groups may be interested in this document--the experts
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 27

ensure that safety standards are met, while the non-
specialists may need to follow the displayed protocols in
an emergency. Additionally, the secondary audience may
be someone your primary reader consults if your message,
report, proposal, etc. is a request for a specific action.
For example, if you are a salesperson making a pitch to
a client, that client may need to consult their supervisor
before agreeing to your terms.

      How should you approach writing a document with so
many possible readers? First, identify the primary audience
of your document. Then, identify likely secondary
audiences, if any.

      Most of the time, you will know who the primary
audience is--you will be writing a document aimed at a
particular group of people or a single person. You may
have a client you are writing for or a group you specifically
want to understand your ideas. In this case, you should
write your document for the primary audience, but also
include information for the secondary audiences. For
example, if you write a set of new procedures for a
company's technicians, you must also include information
that your gatekeepers insist accompany the document, such
as legal clauses or business descriptions. You will also need
to think about the technicians' bosses (executives) who
need to approve any new procedures implemented at the
site.

      If you believe a document is unlikely to be used by
the secondary audience(s), you can write for the primary
audience only. This would be applicable if you create a set
of instructions over "How to Change a Tire" for a website.
You can assume most readers will be non-specialists who
need assistance with the task, not mechanics, designers, or
engineers in the automotive industry.

      If you believe the document will likely be used by
28 Katrina Peterson

multiple audiences or you are unsure who the primary
audience is, you can then write the document so that all
the audiences can understand it. This is also a good choice
if you know that many different types of readers will be
interested. For example, imagine you wrote a research
report over the use of a city's public park facilities.
Community members (non-specialists) are just as likely to
read the report as those on the city council (executives),
the head of the Parks Department (experts), and those who
maintain the parks (technicians). In this case, you would
want to write your report to be accessible to all these types
of audience.

2.3 Audience Analysis

Once you have identified the types of readers for a specific
document, it is important to determine some of the qualities
of these groups. If you are writing to a known, specific
audience (e.g., Hiring Manager Serena Tims; Director of
University Dining Services Ollie Lopez; the corporate
board at Sony Inc.; etc.) versus a general, unknown
audience (e.g., people who want to learn how to change
their car's oil) you may need to do some research on the
individual (if available), the company or organization they
work for, or even the industry your audience is a player
in. Determining these characteristics will help guide your
document creation--you can decide what information
needs to be included or eliminated, which terms to use
or which need to be defined, an effective design for the
document, and so on. Regardless of which type of reader
you identify (experts, technicians, executives, gatekeepers,
or non-specialists), you should analyze these groups in
terms of their characteristics:
                   Technical and Professional Writing Genres 29

· Background--knowledge, experience, and
   training: One of your most important concerns
   is just how much knowledge, experience, or
   training you can expect in your readers. If you
   expect some of your readers to lack certain
   background, do you automatically supply it in
   your document? Imagine you are writing a guide
   to using a software product that runs under
   Microsoft Windows. How much can you expect
   your readers to know about Windows? If some
   are likely to know very little about Windows,
   should you provide that information? If you say
   no, then you run the risk of customers getting
   frustrated with your product. If you say yes, you
   increase your work effort and add to the
   document's page count (and thus the cost), and
   could annoy users with more knowledge.
   Obviously, there is no easy answer to this
   question--part of the answer may involve just
   how small a segment of the audience needs that
   background information.

· Needs and interests: To plan your document,
   you need to know what your audience is going
   to expect from that document. Imagine how
   readers will want to use your document. What
   will they demand from it? For example, imagine
   you are writing a manual on how to use a new
   smartphone--what are your readers going to
   expect to find in it? Do they want to quickly
   find answers to specific user questions, or do
   they expect a comprehensive breakdown of each
   phone function? Make decisions on what readers
   want to read about as well as what they do not
   want to read about.

         · Culture and values: The difference between
            culture and values can be difficult to define, but
            both influence how an audience approaches new
            ideas. Culture consists of the shared beliefs,
            attitudes, behaviors, values, and assumptions
            shared by an identified group of people. It is
            what sets a group apart from others. Values are
            the deeply held principles that guide thoughts
            and actions. Think of culture as the social
            dynamic that sets the tone, and values as the by-
            products of the culture that affect decisions.

When analyzing the reader's culture, remember these five
things:

                      It is learned: The conscious and
                        unconscious learning we undergo,
                        over time, turns into beliefs that we
                        consider to be valid. We then teach
                        each other that these beliefs are
                        cultural norms. They are expressed in
                        our daily lives as behaviors and
                        actions.

                      It is shared: Although you may think
                        of yourself as an individual, you share
                        beliefs, rituals, ceremonies, traditions,
                        and assumptions with people who
                        grew up or live in similar cultural
                        backgrounds.

                      It is dynamic: Culture is dynamic and
                        complex. Culture is fluid rather than
                        static, which means that culture
                        changes every day, in subtle and
                        tangible ways. It is important to pay
                     Technical and Professional Writing Genres 31

                attention to the cultural context of a
                communication to understand the
                depths of its dynamic properties.

              It is systemic: There are patterns of
                behavior and deeply rooted structural
                systems which are beneath the
                waterline. What we see at the top of
                the iceberg are the behaviors; we do
                not see what contributes to those
                behaviors. Changes to the system are
                slow and gradual; visible changes may
                not appear until later.

              It is symbolic: Symbols are both
                verbal and nonverbal in form within
                cultural systems, and they have a
                unique way of linking human beings
                to each other. Humans create meaning
                between symbols and what they
                represent; as a result, different
                interpretations of a symbol can occur
                in different cultural contexts. (See
                chapter 1 for an in-depth discussion
                on cultural diversity and technical
                writing)

There are two levels of culture and values you should
consider: personal and corporate. Personal culture
may be created by shared religion, race, ethnicity,
region, and/or social groups. A classic example is
the culture within a religious group--this can lead to
specific types of dress, language, and celebrations.
Personal values are the beliefs held by the
32 Katrina Peterson

       individual, but they are influenced by culture as well
       as other factors.

             Corporate culture and values are similar, but on
       a micro level. Corporate culture is created by the
       employees and how they interact. Within a company,
       different departments may have their own cultures,
       in addition to the company's collective culture.
       Corporate values are set by the company, and are
       often reflected in their mission statements, policies,
       and other structures. These are the principles that
       guide the company's decisions and goals. When
       considering culture and values, identify both
       personal and corporate factors which can influence
       the reader.

         · Other demographic characteristics: Of course
            there are many other characteristics about your
            readers that might influence how you should
            design and write your document--for example,
            age groups, type of residence, area of residence,
            gender, political preferences, and so on. For
            example, if you write a proposal to raise gas
            taxes by $.01 to fund speedbumps in
            neighborhood streets, you will need to consider
            the neighborhood's habits (do most residents
            drive, walk, or take public transportation?), the
            age of resident (older residents are often on a
            fixed budget; younger residents may think
            speedbumps are a nonissue), political preference
            (some could be against infrastructure spending),
            and other qualities.

Wide Variability in an Audience
You may realize that, although you have an audience that
fits into only one category, its background varies widely.
If you write to the lowest common denominator of reader,
you are likely to end up with a cumbersome, tedious, book-
like report that will turn off the majority of readers.
However, if you do not write to that lowest level, you
lose that segment of readers. In this situation, most writers
compose for the majority of readers and sacrifice the
minority readers. Others put the supplemental information
in appendixes or insert cross-references to beginners'
books.

2.4 Adapt Your Writing to Meet Your
Audience's Needs

Once you have identified and analyzed your audience, how
do you use this information? How do you keep from
writing something that may potentially still be
incomprehensible or useless to your readers? Draft your
document with your audience's needs in mind, but
remember that writing can be refined over many drafts.
With each subsequent draft, think more carefully about
your readers, and revise and edit your document so that
you make technical information more understandable for
specific audiences.

      The following list contains some strategies to help
you make technical information more understandable for
differing audiences. You can use these strategies to revise
and refine as you begin to put your final document together.
However, it is a good idea to be aware of your audience's
needs even in the early stages of your report drafting.

Strategies to Revise Content

         · Add information readers need to understand
            your document. Check to see whether certain
            key information is missing--for example, a
            critical series of steps from a set of instructions;
            important background that helps beginners
            understand the main discussion; definition of
            key terms. Note that some of this information
            can be added in the main document body, but
            you can also add appendices or glossaries--it
            depends on your audience and document type.

         · Omit unnecessary information. Unnecessary
            information can also confuse and frustrate
            readers--after all, it is there so they may feel
            obligated to read it. Technical document are
            often skimmed for important detail--excess
            unnecessary information could make the reader
            miss important information. For example, you
            can probably chop theoretical discussion from
            basic instructions.

         · Change the technical level of the information.
            You may have the right information in your
            document, but it may be pitched at too high or
            too low a technical level. Are you using terms
            the reader will be familiar with? Is the sentence
            structure clear for the audience's reading
            comprehension? It may be pitched at the wrong
            kind of audience--for example, an expert
            audience rather than a technician audience. This
            happens often when product-design notes are
            passed off as instructions. Think about your
            audience's education level and familiarity with
36 Katrina Peterson

            the topic and terms used, and revise to make
            sure your content is clear for that audience.

         · Add examples to help readers understand.
            Examples are one of the most powerful ways to
            connect with audiences, particularly in
            instructions. Even in a non-instructional text,
            when you are trying to explain a technical
            concept, examples are helpful--analogies in
            particular. If you already have examples, it may
            help to alter the technical content or level of
            your examples. Common examples may not be
            useful to experts; highly technical ones may
            totally miss your non-specialist readers.

Strategies to Revise Style and Format

         · Change the organization of your information.
            Sometimes, you can have all the right
            information but arrange it in the wrong way. For
            example, there can be too much background
            information up front (or too little) such that
            certain readers get lost. Other times, background
            information needs to be placed throughout the
            main text--for example, in instructions it is
            sometimes better to feed in chunks of
            background at the points where they are
            immediately needed. If the document does not
            seem to work for the audience, try reorganizing
            some of the information so that the document is
            clearer and easier to understand.

         · Strengthen transitions and key words. It may be
            difficult for readers, particularly non-specialists,
            to see the connections between the main
                   Technical and Professional Writing Genres 37

   sections of your report, between individual
   paragraphs and sometimes even between
   individual sentences. You can make these
   connections much clearer by adding transition
   words and by echoing key words more
   accurately. Words like "therefore," "for
   example," "however" are transition
   words--they indicate the logic connecting the
   previous thought to the upcoming thought. You
   can also strengthen transitions by carefully
   echoing the same key words. A report
   describing new software for architects might use
   the word software several times on the same
   page or even in the same paragraph. In technical
   documents, it is not a good idea to vary word
   choice--use the same words so that people can
   clearly understand your ideas. Your design
   choices can also visually connect and transition
   between sections (see the "Strategies to revise
   document design" below).

· Write stronger introductions--for the whole
   document and for major sections. People seem
   to read with more confidence and understanding
   when they have the big picture--a view of what
   is coming, and how it relates to what they have
   just read. Therefore, writing a strong
   introduction to the entire document--one that
   makes clear the topic, purpose, audience, and
   contents of that document--makes the
   document easier to understand. In most types of
   technical documents, each major section
   includes mini-introductions that indicate the
   topic of the section and give an overview of the
   subtopics to be covered in that section to let the
38 Katrina Peterson

            reader know what information each section will
            contain.

         · Create topic sentences for paragraphs and
            paragraph groups. It can help readers immensely
            to give them an idea of the topic and purpose of
            a section (a group of paragraphs) and in
            particular to give them an overview of the
            subtopics about to be covered. This is the first
            sentence of the paragraph, and states the main
            point or idea. The type of topic sentence can
            vary depending on document type. In an
            argumentative paragraph, you will make a claim
            which you will prove through the rest of the
            paragraph (e.g., reports; proposals; some emails,
            letters, and memos). In informative documents,
            the topic sentence will be an overall point which
            you will explain and back up in the detail
            sentences (e.g., informative emails, letters, and
            memos; results section of a report).

Strategies to Revise Sentence Style

         · Change sentence style. How you write--at the
            individual sentence level--can make a
            difference to the effectiveness of your
            document. In instructions, for example, using
            imperative voice and "you" phrasing is vastly
            more understandable than the passive voice or
            third-personal phrasing. Passive voice is where
            one switches the location of the subject and
            object in a sentence. A simple, active sentence
            such as "The boy threw the ball" becomes the
            wordy, passive sentence "The ball was thrown
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 39

            by the boy." Taking the emphasis off the
            noun--in this case, the boy--and the
            action--throw vs was thrown--detracts from
            meaning of the sentence. Passive, person-less
            writing is harder to read--put people and action
            in your writing. There are times to write in
            passive voice, but technical documents generally
            need active sentence structure.

Revise to use more active verbs, and less be verb phrasing.
All of this makes your writing more direct and immediate.
Also, personalizing your writing style and making it more
relaxed and informal can make it more accessible.

         · Edit for sentence clarity and economy. This is
            closely related to the previous strategy. Writing
            style can be so wordy that it is hard or
            frustrating to read. Sentence length matters. An
            average of somewhere between 15 and 25 words
            per sentence is about right; sentences over 30
            words are often mistrusted. When you revise
            your rough drafts, put them on a diet--go
            through a draft line by line trying to reduce the
            overall word, page, or line count by 20 percent.
            Try it as an experiment and see how you do.
            You will find a lot of fussy, unnecessary detail
            and inflated phrasing you can chop out.
            Eliminate excess words and phrases; state ideas
            as simply as possible while still providing
            necessary detail.

Strategies to Revise Document Design

         · Add and vary graphics. For non-specialist
40 Katrina Peterson

            audiences, you may want to use more, simpler
            graphics. Graphics for specialists are often more
            detailed and technical. In technical documents
            for non-specialists, there also tend to be more
            "decorative" graphics--ones that are attractive
            but serve no strict informative or persuasive
            purpose at all.

         · Break text up or consolidate text into
            meaningful, usable chunks. For non-specialist
            readers, you may need to have shorter
            paragraphs. A six to eight-line paragraph is the
            usual maximum. This is because a paragraph
            should contain content about a single ideas;
            breaking up paragraphs into smaller ideas can
            help the reader more easily understand the
            individual topics, while also making the text less
            (visually) overwhelming. Notice how much
            longer paragraphs are in technical documents
            written for specialists--the ideas do not need to
            be broken down as much visually for a specialist
            to understand the content.

         · Add cross-references to important information.
            In technical information, you can help readers
            by pointing them to background sources. If you
            cannot fully explain a topic at a certain time in a
            document, point to a section, chapter, or external
            source where the information is located. One
            can also include glossary of terms or appendices
            at the end of a document with extra information
            that is related, but not 100% necessary, to
            understand the document's content.

         · Use headings and lists. Readers can be
            intimidated by dense paragraphs and "walls of
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 41

            text" uncut by anything other than a blank line
            now and then. Search your rough drafts for ways
            to incorporate headings--look for changes in
            topic or subtopic. Search your paragraphs for
            listings of items--these can be made into
            vertical lists, or look for paired listings such as
            terms and their definitions--these can be made
            into two-column lists. Of course, be careful not
            to force this type of formatting, and do not
            overdo it.

         · Use special typography, and work with margins,
            line length, line spacing, type size, and type
            style. Depending on your audience, you can
            modify the format by making the lines shorter or
            longer (adjusting margins), using larger or
            smaller type sizes, and other such tactics.
            Typically, sans-serif fonts, such as Ariel, are
            useful for online readers. Serif fonts, such as
            Time New Roman, are useful for print texts.
            (See chapter 5 for more information about
            document design)

By now you should be able to see that many of the
decisions you make as a technical writer depend on who
will read your report. From content, to language, to layout,
every aspect of your communication must keep your
readers' needs in mind.

      We will spend time later in this book expanding our
discussion of audience as well as document design-an
important consideration that can help tremendously in
making your document professional and easy to read.

Chapter 3: Team Work and
Collaborative Writing

Michael Beilfuss

Chapter Synopsis

This chapter covers some of the fundamentals of team
work. After introducing the importance and prevalence of
team work in the professional world and workplace, the
chapter describes how best to build teams and ensure that
they run smoothly. One of the first things a team needs to
do is take an inventory of each member's qualifications.
Assessing qualifications allows teams to better assign
roles, some of which are described in this chapter. Once
the team has been built and everyone knows their roles,
the planning stage begins - specific responsibilities are
allocated among the group members to best fit their
qualifications, the group writes out a schedule, and plans
for any problems that may arise either within or outside
the group. The chapter ends with a number of tips for a
successful team project.

3.1 Introduction

Collaboration is a necessary task in most workplaces.
Collaborative writing is one of the common ways people
in the worlds of business, government, science, and
technology handle large writing projects. In the

                                     43
44 Katrina Peterson

professional and scholarly worlds, a lot of time, research,
and energy have been devoted to understanding how teams
work, and how to make them work more effectively. There
is an entire industry devoted to assisting companies and
organizations to get the most out of teamwork. In your
career, you are more than likely to encounter situations
where you have to work, and write, collaboratively. This
chapter aims to help you develop the knowledge and skills
to work effectively in groups.

      Some people dislike group work due negative past
experiences. They may be the person who seems to do
more work than others, they may dislike having to rely
on another person to follow through, or maybe they feel it
was difficult to pull together so many ideas from so many
people. Others do not mind it. They may have had positive
experiences and see the value in group work. In fact, if
done correctly, collaboration can be an effective tool to
getting work done.

      Thanks to ever emerging new technologies, writers
can collaborate in exciting new ways. Using tools such
as Google Docs, writers can work on texts synchronously
even when they are separated by continents and oceans.
Using discussion forums, musicians can exchange and
remix chords with other artists from around the world. Via
Skype, writers can talk with one another as they collaborate
in a shared white space. And then there is Wikipedia, one
of the most successful collaborative writing project ever
conceived and executed. Clearly, good collaboration skills
are more important now than ever before.

      In our e-culture, being a successful collaborator is
crucial to success. Today's workers use multiple media
to share and construct meaning. Today's workers must be
symbol analysts and are especially social in terms of how
they communicate and learn.

      When the first cave man started doodling on a stone
canvas, he probably had colleagues looking over his
shoulder, suggesting that he hold the brush a different way,
mix the paint differently, perhaps make the buffalo appear
fiercer, and so on. Many people find discussions with
trusted colleagues to be an invaluable way to develop and
polish ideas. Professionals in most disciplines, for
example, attend conferences so that they can discuss ideas
with colleagues and leading researchers. Writers in
business and scientific contexts commonly work in teams
with individuals responsible for their areas of expertise,
such as marketing language, audience, finance, research,
and editing. Some authors do not feel comfortable
beginning a new project until they have discussed their
ideas with others. Successful writers do not wait until they
have completed a project before seeking constructive
criticism. Instead, they share early drafts with critics.

     This chapter will provide information and
resources to help you master collaboration skills.

3.2 Building a Team

In the 1960s the psychologist Bruce Tuckman described
four stages of team building: Forming, Storming, Norming,
and Performing. While there has been a lot of research
since then on team formation, Tuckman's stages are still
often considered the benchmark for team building. You
can find any number of articles, books, and videos that
elaborate on Tuckman's research. For a quick overview,
have a look at this Mind Tools article and brief video:
"Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing:
   46 Katrina Peterson

  Understanding the Stages of Team Formation" 1 before you
  read the rest of this chapter.

                       excluded from this version of the text. You can

        If you can choose your partners for a collaborative
  project, it is tempting to choose friends and/or people with
  similar backgrounds as yourself. If the project is deeply
  discipline-specific, this may be a good idea. Working with
  friends and close colleagues can help ease the awkward,
  early stages of a project. However, projects that require
  teams often include aspects from multiple fields and
  disciplines.

        When you begin picking team members for a writing
  project in a technical writing course, you should consider
  choosing people with different backgrounds and interests.
  Just as a diverse, well-rounded background for an
  individual writer is an advantage, a group of diverse
  individuals makes for a well-rounded writing team. As a
  side note, it is never a good idea to work in a team with a
  romantic partner. It can be annoying and awkward for the
  rest of the team to watch as you and your partner canoodle
  or bicker. And modern romance such as it is, nothing can

1. https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_86.htm
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 47

damage a team quicker than a romantic break-up in the
middle of a project.

      At the same time, collaborators can become obstacles,
requiring constant supervision. In group situations, other
students can fail to attend classes or out-of-class meetings;
they can ignore your efforts and just focus on their own
missions or visions about ways documents should be
written. When collaborators do not do their job, they can
become an annoyance-just another obstacle rather than a
support and an inspiration to colleagues.

      The whole truly can be larger than the sum of its parts.
Through collaboration, we can produce documents that we
alone could not imagine. Collaborators can inspire us, keep
us on task, and help us overcome blind spots.

      Due to the many potential problems with teamwork,
it is crucial at the beginning of any team project to do the
following:

         · Articulate and clarify team members'
            qualifications

         · Define roles for each member

         · Establish responsibilities of each team member

Qualifications

As a first step, you want to identify any strengths and
weaknesses. There are at least two ways to think about
qualifications: 1. knowledge, skills, and abilities, and 2.
personality types.

      The first aspect--knowledge, skills, and abilities--is
pretty straightforward. The engineer in your group should
work on the engineering aspect, the accountant should
work on the financials, the lawyer should work on the legal
   48 Katrina Peterson

  matters, and you want the marketer to work on PR. When
  writing proposals for external clients (and sometimes even
  internal proposals) you may be asked to include résumés of
  each of the team members. This is to help demonstrate the
  group's strengths through its expertise and diversity.

        The second aspect of qualifications is perhaps a little
  fuzzier and has to do with interpersonal relations. A recent
  study by Google found that "psychological safety" - that
  "team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable
  in front of others" - is the most important characteristic
  of effective teams.2 One can only feel safe in a group if
  they are comfortable with the other team members'
  personalities.

        Articulating personality skill sets can help divide the
  work most effectively, and help avoid unnecessary conflict
  and confrontation. For example, if someone in the group
  is very social and outgoing, they might be the best person
  to stop people on campus to ask them survey questions.
  If someone in the group is a careful listener, they should
  probably be one of the people who talks to clients or
  experts. If one of the team members is more studious,
  or internet savvy, perhaps they should complete more
  secondary research. The Meyers-Briggs test activity at the
  end of this chapter may be a good method to begin to
  understand personality types and how to best harness their
  strengths.

  Roles

  Once the group has completed an honest assessment of its

2. https:///rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/
      steps/identify-dynamics-of-effective-teams/. This is a great resource to learn
      more about effective group dynamics.
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 49

strengths and weaknesses, you can move on to determine
the roles for each member. Roles are slightly different from
responsibilities. Roles describe each individual's general
purpose and duty on a team. It designates their main areas
of concern. On the other hand, responsibilities refer to the
specific tasks each member will complete.

      To use a sports analogy - the position you play on a
team is your role, but the specific responsibilities during a
game will often shift, sometime from play-to-play or even
within a play. In football, a wide receiver's responsibilities
vary greatly - on one play it is to get open for a reception,
on another it may be to cross up the defense to allow
another receiver to get open. A wide receiver could be
called on to block a defensive player, or in rare
circumstance even pass the football. Sometimes a wide
receiver must instantly switch their responsibility from
offense to defense, and tackle an opponent who just
intercepted a pass. But the role of a wide receiver is never
likely to be confused with the roles of a center who snaps
the ball, or a linebacker who is always looking to tackle the
person with the ball.

      Every project is slightly different and demands
different roles but some common roles include:

         · Leader/Coordinator/Project Manager: this
            person is not the boss, but rather the person who
            makes sure that everything runs smoothly. They
            do not give orders or make demands, but rather
            they serve to keep the group operating at its best
            and sticking to schedules.

         · Monitor: this member keeps track of decisions
            and their outcomes and keeps an eye out for any
            potential flaws or conflicts.
50 Katrina Peterson

         · Recorder/Note Taker/Secretary: this person is
            responsible for keeping the records of the group.
            They should be able to tell everyone what was
            agreed and when. They keep the notes (or
            minutes) of the meetings.

         · Shaper: this team member often has the big
            ideas, the drive to see them through, and the
            assertiveness to steer the group.

         · Investigator/Researcher: whether it is through
            secondary or primary research, this person likes
            to look for answers to the questions driving the
            project. In a big project, everyone will likely
            contribute some research, but this person would
            be the one who dives into the topics the most.

         · Specialist: often referred to as subject-matter
            experts (SMEs), this is the person with the deep
            background on a topic. Often groups will have
            specialists in more than one area.

         · Editor: the best writer will often write the least
            amount of original content in a large project -
            rather their role will be to edit and improve upon
            everyone else's writing. They also help create
            one voice in documents written by multiple
            people with multiple writing styles.

         · Designer: the designer is the person who makes
            sure any documents, presentations, videos, or
            websites created by the team look appealing and
            professional. As the name implies, they are in
            charge of graphics and design.

For more on some of these common roles, and others,
                                  Technical and Professional Writing Genres 51

  see "The Nine Belbin team Roles." 3. Just like a wide
  receiver, you might find you have to take on a variety
  of responsibilities related to your role as well as some
  responsibilities that seem tangential to your role. You
  might also find you have to take over unfamiliar
  responsibilities because someone else "dropped the ball."
  Defining roles helps establish accountability in the group
  and makes it clear who is in charge of what.

  Responsibilities and Planning

  Once you have articulated the qualifications of each
  member and established the roles, it is time to assign
  responsibilities and plan the project. This includes dividing
  the work, creating a schedule, and anticipating problems
  (obstacles and conflicts). You should also agree on the
  main avenue of communication, and create an online
  document and/or folder that will be shared by all group
  members.

        Capture your team's roles, responsibilities, and
  decisions in a simple team-plan document. It can contain
  the key dates in the team schedule, a tentative outline of
  the document to be team-produced, formatting agreements,
  individual writer assignments, word-choice preferences,
  and so on. The planning stages will often include all or
  most of the following actions:

           · Analyze the writing assignment

           · Pick a topic

           · Define the rhetorical situation

           · Brainstorm and narrow the topic

3. https://www.belbin.com/about/belbin-team-roles/
52 Katrina Peterson

         · Create an outline

         · Plan the research (primary and secondary)

         · Plan a system for taking notes from sources

         · Plan any graphics you would like to see in your
            writing project

         · Agree on style and format questions

         · Develop a work schedule for the project and
            divide the responsibilities

         · Develop a system for resolving disputes

Much of the work in a team-writing project must be done
by individual team members on their own. When dividing
the work, aim for these minimum guidelines:

         · Have each team member responsible for the
            writing an equal amount of the assignment.

         · Have each team member responsible for
            locating, reading, and taking notes on an equal
            amount of sources.

Some of the work for the project that could be done as a
team you may want to do first independently. For example,
brainstorming, narrowing, and especially outlining should
be completed by each team member on their own; then
get together and compare notes. Keep in mind how group
dynamics can unknowingly suppress certain ideas and how
less assertive team members might be reluctant to
contribute their valuable ideas in the group context. If you
noticing this happening, be proactive and ask for
everyone's thoughts or opinions - especially those group
members who may be hesitant to talk over others - so that
good ideas do not remain unheard.
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 53

      After you divide the work for the project, write a
formal chart or calendar and distribute it to all the
members.

Scheduling

Early in your writing project, set up a schedule of key
dates and deadlines. This schedule will enable you and
your team members to make steady, organized progress and
complete the project on time. It is a good idea to figure
a day and time during the week when all group members
are free and can meet, in person or online. Block off that
hour every week. Before you meet, write out an agenda
that includes all the main topics of discussion, including
old business, ongoing business, and new business. The
agenda should include a time schedule for the meeting to
make sure everything is covered in the time allotted for the
meeting. If you find one week that there is no real reason
to meet, you can cancel it.

      As shown in the example schedule below (Figure 1),
your project schedule should include not only completion
dates for key phases of the project but also meeting dates
and the subject and purpose of those meetings. Notice these
details about that schedule:

         · Several meetings are scheduled in which
            members discuss the information they are
            finding or are not finding. One team member
            may have information another member is
            looking everywhere for.

         · Several meetings are scheduled to review the
            project details, specifically, the topic, audience,
            purpose, situation, and outline. As you learn
54 Katrina Peterson

            more about the topic and become more settled in
            the project, your team may want to change some
            of these details or make them more specific.

         · Several rough drafts are scheduled. Team
            members peer-review each other's drafts of
            individual sections at least twice, the second
            time to see if the recommended changes have
            worked. Once the complete draft is put together,
            it too is reviewed twice.

Anticipating Problems and Conflicts

Think about how to resolve typical problems that can arise
in a team project and document your team's agreements
about these matters in a by-laws document:

         · Workload imbalance. When you work as a team,
            there is always the chance that one of the team
            members, for whatever reason, may have more
            or less than a fair share of the workload.
            Therefore, it is important to find a way to keep
            track of what each team member is doing.
            Periodic group evaluations and self-assessments,
            including logging hours spent on the project,
            can help accomplish a good balance of work.

Both during and at the end of the project, if there are any
problems, the evaluations and assessments should make
that fact clear and enable a more equitable balancing of
the workload. Before the end of the project, team members
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 57

can add up their hours spent on the project; if anyone has
spent a little more than their share of time working, the
other members can make up for it. Similarly, as you get
down toward the end of the project, if it is clear from the
evaluations and assessments that one team member's work
responsibilities turned out, through no fault of their own,
to be smaller than those of the others, they can make up
for it by doing more of the finish-up work such as typing,
proofing, or copying.

         · Team members without relevant skills.
            Sometimes a member may claim to have no
            relevant skills. That could just be an indication
            of that person's anxiety or lack of interest in
            engaging in a group project. Each team member
            in a writing course should contribute a fair share
            of the writing for a project. However, there are
            plenty of tasks that do not require technical
            knowledge, formatting skills, or a sharp editorial
            eye, for example: typing and distributing the
            team plan, the by-laws, and the minutes of team
            meetings; or reminding team members of due
            dates and scheduled meetings. In fact, except for
            the anxiety or lack of interest, the self-professed
            unskilled team member might make the best
            team leader!

         · Disappearing team members. If your team is
            unfortunate enough to have an irresponsible
            member who simply vanishes, have a plan for
            what to do about that, and document it in your
            team by-laws. One obvious solution is to kick
            the team member off the team and inform the
            instructor (if it is a writing course) or the next
            level of management (if it is a nonacademic
58 Katrina Peterson

            organization). Of course, you want to try to
            avoid losing a team member, so constant
            communication is a key ingredient to well-
            functioning groups. The sample email below
            (Figure 2) demonstrates that the team leader did
            all they could to get the disappearing member
            back in the fold, and is about to give them up as
            lost.

Figure 2: A sample email sent to a disappeared team member.

         · Seemingly entrenched team-member
            disagreements. It is amazing how vehemently
            team members can disagree on aspects of a
            team-writing project. Have a plan, written in
            your team by-laws, how to resolve these
            matters. Should they be put to a vote? Flip a
            coin? Should you "escalate" the matter to a
            neutral or higher-level party? Do you have a
            group mediator who can be impartial and make
            judgement calls?
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 59

         · Radically inconsistent writing styles and format.
            Because the individual sections will be written
            by different writers who are apt to have different
            writing styles, set up a style guide in which your
            team members list their agreements on how
            things are to be handled in the paper as a whole.
            These agreements can range from the high level,
            such as whether to have a background section,
            all the way down to picky details such as when
            to use italics or bold and whether the phrase you
            group wants to use is "click" or "click on."

Before you and your team members write the first rough
drafts, you cannot expect to anticipate every possible
difference in style and format. Therefore, plan to update
this style sheet when you review the rough drafts of the
individual sections and, especially, when review the
complete draft.

      One of the best ways to smooth out the different
writing styles is to have everyone consistently work on the
entire document together. That is, read all the sections and
make comments and edits throughout the writing process.
Then, at the very end, have one person edit the entire
document for consistency and design.

Communication

Good communication is the key to successful team
projects. You should decide early on how you will
communicate (group text, email, an app, etc) and how you
will share documents.

      Once the team is formed and work begins, it is
imperative that any issues that arise are addressed early.
Most group conflicts start as miscommunication and/or
60 Katrina Peterson

misunderstanding. Everyone in the group should always be
a part of any information that is sent between members.
Include all members in all communication, even if it does
not seem all that important. That is what the cc line is for
in emails.

      Team projects are generally evaluated on their own
merits, regardless of group dynamics and participation. In
other words, you cannot tell a client that one of your team
members was slacking and that is why the graphics and
design does not look so nice. In a professional setting, who
did how much work does not matter to the client - they
only care about what the team delivers.

      Although some members in the group may fulfill
different roles and do more or less writing, in a project for
a writing class, each member of a group should contribute
actual writing and research to the project.

      Group work needs to be a collaborative effort. If
someone in the group is not pulling their weight, it needs
to be addressed right away. Sometimes it is due to simple
misunderstanding. Discuss problems with the entire group
as soon as possible, but if that does not work, contact your
instructor (or supervisor in a professional setting) so you
can sort things out before it is too late. There are usually a
number of opportunities to evaluate and assess the group as
the project unfolds. However, it is not possible to quit the
group or kick someone out without serious repercussions.
In the workplace, there is no leaving a group project unless
you quit you job.

3.3 Completing the Project

Try to schedule as many reviews of your team's written
work as possible. Communicate and meet regularly and
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 61

read each other's work as often as possible. You can meet
to discuss each other's rough drafts of individual sections
as well as rough drafts of the complete paper.

      A critical stage in team-writing a paper comes when
you put together those individual sections written by
different team members into one complete draft. It is then
that you will probably see how different in tone, treatment,
and style each section is. You must, as a group, find a way
to revise and edit the complete rough draft that will make it
read consistently so that it will not be so obviously written
by three or four different people.

      When you complete reviewing and revising, it is time
for the finish-up work to get the draft ready to hand in. That
work is the same as it would be if you were writing the
paper on your own, only in this case the workloads can be
divided among the group.

3.4 Final Thoughts

Business leaders commonly complain that college
graduates do not know how to work productively in
groups. In American classrooms, we tend to prize
individual accomplishment, yet in professional careers we
need to work well with others. Unfortunately, the terms
"group work," "team work," or "committee work" can
appear to be oxymorons - like the terms "honest politician"
or "criminal justice." Many groups, teams, and committees
simply do not work, despite the potential of individuals in
the group.

      It is certainly true that many people waste time in
group situations, politicking as opposed to defining tasks
and solving problems. In writing classrooms, some
students want to slide by, get the grade without doing the
62 Katrina Peterson

work; others are willing to do the work, but are not sure
how to proceed. While working in groups presents unique
challenges, your success as a writer, leader, or manager is
somewhat dependent on your ability to help others focus,
communicate, and collaborate.

Tips for Effective Groups

Follow these tips for nurturing teamwork in group
situations. Try experimenting with the following strategies
to help ensure the success of group work.

         · When the group first meets, select a project
            manager. This person provides leadership and
            helps forge consensus and a coherent plan.
            Being a leader is different from being an
            autocrat or a dictator. Even if you are selected as
            the project manager, it is important to remember
            that you are an equal team member and
            collaborator who has simply been assigned the
            task of coordinating the project and ensuring
            that progress does not fall behind schedule. This
            does not, in effect, make you the "boss" of all
            the other team members, so remember to act like
            a partner rather than an overlord. As team
            coordinator, your attitude and behavior may help
            set the tone for the rest of the group.

If you are the leader, be sure to make fair assignments
and let others own ideas and parts of the project. If people
slack off, talk to them discreetly, giving them fair warning
before speaking with other members or your teacher. Be
concrete and specific about building consensus regarding
shared goals, due dates, and processes.
                   Technical and Professional Writing Genres 63

· All team members need to work to be positive.
   Be generous. Be respectful regarding members'
   feelings and needs. Focus on the strengths of the
   members in your group. Give more than you
   take. Ideally, collaborative projects should not
   be about one person being in control. Decisions
   should be made by the group, not by one
   individual.

· Respect different ideas and approaches. Listen
   before talking; be articulate about your position
   but flexible when others want to go another way.

· Clarify evaluation criteria up front. Understand
   what your instructor wants, how the documents
   will be evaluated, and what the due dates are.

· Beyond outlining the project, come up with a
   project management plan, outlining:

             Responsibilities for each group
               member

             Descriptions of the steps or tasks
               involved in implementation

             Timelines for completion

             Summaries of problems/opportunities
               you anticipate (and a list of possible
               solutions/recommendations)

· Draft a document planner for the group project.
   Write a research proposal and submit it to your
   instructor/supervisor. Your proposal--which is
   formal request that will be discussed at length in
   the Proposal chapter--should identify what you
   want to do, how you want to do it, and when
   you can have it done.
64 Katrina Peterson

         · Your instructor (or supervisor) may request that
            you maintain individual journals or progress
            reports or keep a log of your contributions to the
            project. Alternatively, you can log about your
            collaborative efforts in a wiki, perhaps
            writingwiki.org. The advantage of using the
            wiki space is that it enables group members to
            enter their contributions on the same page.
            Teachers appreciate the wiki format because
            each edit to a page is recorded by the wiki
            software, enabling the instructor to see when
            particular contributions were made and by
            whom. Teachers can account for individual
            efforts when you keep records and perhaps
            include a one-page summary about what you
            learned as a result of the collaborative
            experience. Create a Web portfolio for the
            project with an index or default page that links
            to major sections of the group project and
            relevant appendixes. Report appendixes should
            include links to the document planner, the
            document proposal, individual students'
            journals, and related resources.

         · Evaluate your peers' contributions; be sure to
            copy your peers on your evaluation.

Group work can be difficult, and the amount of time
required to complete a group project may very well take
longer than if you were tackling the project on your own,
but group work can also be a richly rewarding experience
with synergistic results that are impossible to achieve
otherwise. With a clear understanding of each group
member's strengths and qualifications, with clearly
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 65

articulated roles and responsibilities, and with a well-
defined plan, any group project can be a success.

3.5 Activity

You might consider having everyone in the group take

the  Meyers-Briggs            personality  test

(http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp) to get

a good sense of where everyone is coming from and where

they stand. There are a number of free versions of the test

online. The official version from the Meyers and Briggs
Foundation 4 is far more thorough and costs money.

     The test measures preferences and general attitudes

and can help you understand communication and learning

styles. In conjunction with the other skills, knowledge, and

abilities, it can help determine which roles and tasks are

most suitable for each team member.

     After taking the test, record your personality type and

some of it is major attributes. Then meet with your group

so you can all share your results and discuss how best to

capitalize on the knowledge.

Chapter 4: Ethics

Michael Beilfuss

Chapter Synopsis

In this chapter, you will learn about some of the ethical
challenges that you may encounter in your professional
and academic life, especially when it comes to technical
writing. The chapter explains the importance of articulating
your own ethical code so you can be prepared when you
find yourself in uncomfortable and/or unethical situations.
The chapter covers ethical principles, how ethics may
affect the presentation of information, and some common
ethical problems encountered by technical writers. Much of
this chapter is concerned with the appropriate and ethical
use and documentation of sources. The chapter provides
some practical information on how to make sure your
writing is ethical and how to handle ethical dilemmas along
with possible legal issues in the workplace.

4.1 Ethics in Technical Writing

You probably think about technical writing in relation to
communicating technical information clearly in an
accessible format that meets the needs of its audience.
These are important aspects of technical writing, to be
sure, but they only represent the surface of what you need
to know. This chapter will introduce some of the ethical

                                     67
68 Katrina Peterson

issues that may arise as technical writers research, write,
revise, and produce a technical document.

      Like other professionals, technical writers come up
against ethical issues regularly and must make decisions
about how to move forward with a project in the face
of ethical dilemmas. Writers may encounter situations in
which they must ask the following kinds of questions:
What kinds of support material and sources are ethical
to use? Are open web sources just as valid as academic
sources for certain topics? Can email communications be
used without permission? What if the writer discovers that
a company falsified data about the effectiveness of its
product? Should they reveal this in their report or should
they take other courses of action? How much should a
writer adapt to an audience without sacrificing their own
views?

      Ethics principles provide the basis for deciding
whether "x" is ethical, but in reality, ethical issues are
complicated--for example, imagine working for a large
company that employs substantial numbers of people in
your town, where relatively few other employment
opportunities exist. Imagine that the company disposes of
its chemical waste in a way that could endanger people's
health. While the company may be following the law, it is
clear they could dispose of their waste more safely and be
more responsible stewards of the neighborhood. However,
that would cost the company more money, and may affect
profit margins, result in slower growth, and provide fewer
jobs for the locals. What do you do? Is quarterly growth
and expanding jobs more serious than the risk of future
health problems and a degraded environment? Which
choice is really more ethical?

      Many ethical lapses that occur in the workplace are
not so obvious, and they often begin with good intentions
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 69

- for example, a manager or owner of a business may
commit financial fraud to avoid laying off employees. The
intention may be good, but breaching ethics results in a
slippery slope - one that often leads to further and larger
ethical breaches. Falsifying one report will make it that
much more likely the subsequent reports will be falsified,
just as neglecting to properly cite one source at the end of
a report only makes it more tempting to neglect citing the
remainder of the sources.

      Acting ethically is rarely rewarded from the outside
- you are not likely to be congratulated by your boss and
co-workers for passing on an opportunity to undermine
the competition in an unethical manner. The "rewards" of
acting ethically are often simply internal. It is important to
think about ethics and articulate your ethical values before
you find yourself in a situation where ethics will factor into
your decision-making. With a strong set of ethical values,
you will be better prepared to make the right decision
and stick to your principles when faced with an ethical
dilemma.

      There is a good chance that at some point in your
career you will find yourself in a situation that involves
unethical behavior at your workplace. You may be faced
with having to decide to go along with unethical actions or
behavior, ignore the behavior, or report unethical conduct
to the appropriate person (internally or externally). It could
be something as simple (albeit pernicious) as harassment,
or it could be something as large as major fraud. It may
be easier to mind our own businesses and keep quiet, but
really the only right thing to do is to stand up, and speak
up, for what is right.

      We are taught from a young age that you should never
"rat" on anyone, and staying silent is often easier than
mustering the courage to reveal ethical corruption.
70 Katrina Peterson

However, sometimes speaking up, and/or notifying
authorities is the only right thing to do, as difficult as that
may be. The National Whistle Blower center is a non-
profit, non-governmental organization that has many
resources available for individuals who may be faced with
the difficult situation of doing the right thing
(https://www.whistleblowers.org/index.php).

      You should spend some time examining your ethics
and thinking about how and where they may be challenged
in your career. What will you do when you are asked,
implicitly or explicitly, to compromise your ethics? What
will you do when you witness unfair, demeaning, and
unethical behavior? In almost every field, there are legal
and professional consequences for committing unethical
behavior, and often remaining silent about corrupt
conduct--whether the action are yours or a
colleague's--can implicate you as well.

4.2 General Principles

In day-to-day life, most people have a sort of sliding scale
on what constitutes ethical behavior. For example, you
might tell your best friend their new haircut looks attractive
when in fact you believe that it does not. This lie, though
minor, preserves your friend's feelings and does no
apparent harm to them or anyone else. Some might
consider the context before determining how to act. For
example, you might not tell a stranger that they were
trailing toilet paper but you would tell a friend. With a
stranger, your calculations may include how the stranger
might respond to the interruption, and both of you may feel
some embarrassment in the exchange. Such calculations
may make it easier for you to look away and let someone
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 71

else deal with it, but with a friend, you would be willing to
risk some short-term awkwardness to do the right thing.

      In a far more serious situation, a person might not
risk their lives to help a stranger, but they might risk their
lives to help a close friend or relative. For example, if you
witnessed a stranger attacking someone you do not know
on a crowded street, you may be afraid to interfere because
you could be injured in the event. Instead, you might stay
back and call the police. But if a close friend or a relative
was in the same danger, you may be more likely to put
yourself in harm's way to protect your friend. In this case,
your commitment to loyalty might outweigh your sense of
self-preservation. In the former case, if you valued physical
courage above all else, you might be willing to step into a
fight to protect a victim. In either case, weighing the costs,
and having a strong value system would help you feel like
you did the right thing, especially upon reflection after the
event.

      Ethical behavior, including ethical technical
communication, involves not just telling the truth and
providing accurate information, but telling the truth and
providing information so that a reasonable audience is
made aware of the behavior. It also means that you act to
prevent actual harm, with set criteria for what kinds and
degrees of harm are more serious than others. For example,
saving someone's life should always outweigh the prospect
of financial damage to your company. Human values, and
human life, are far more important than monetary values
and financial gain. As a guideline, ask yourself what would
happen if your action (or non-action) became entirely
public, and started trending on social media, got its own
hashtag, and became a meme picked up by the national
media. If you would go to prison, lose your friends, lose
your job, or even just feel embarrassed, the action is
72 Katrina Peterson

probably unethical. If your actions cannot stand up to that
scrutiny, you might reconsider them. Having a strong
ethical foundation always helps. However, nothing is ever
easy when it comes to ethical dilemmas. Sometimes the
right thing to do is the unpopular thing to do. Just because
some action enjoys the adulation of the masses, does not
necessarily means it is ethical. That is another reason why
it is important to give some serious thought to your own
value system and how it may fit into the value systems
of the exemplars your admire and respect. That way, you
will be better prepared to do the right thing when you
are confronted with an ethical dilemma. Internalizing your
ethics in such a manner will certainly make you a more
ethical writer.

4.3 Professional Ethics

Many organizations and employers have a corporate code
of ethics. If you are a technical writer and you join a
professional associations such as the Society of Technical
Communicators you will need to be aware their codes of
ethics, published online (e.g., http://www.stc.org/about-stc/
ethical-principles). If you are a technical writer researching
and writing a report within a specific professional field,
you will also need to be aware to that field's codes of
ethics. For example, if you are writing a report for a group
of physical therapists on the latest techniques for
rehabilitating knee surgery patients, you should be aware
of the code of ethics for physical therapists so that you
work within those principles as you research and write your
report.

      Look for the codes of ethics in your own discipline
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 73

and begin to read and understand what will be expected of
you as a professional in your field.

4.4 Presentation of Information

How a writer presents information in a document can affect
a reader's understanding of the relative weight or
seriousness of that information. For example, hiding some
crucial bit of information in the middle of a long paragraph
deep in a long document seriously de-emphasizes the
information. On the other hand, putting a minor point in
a prominent spot (say the first item in a bulleted list in
a report's executive summary) might be a manipulative
strategy to emphasize information that is not terribly
important. Both of these examples could be considered
unethical, as the display of information is crucial to how
readers encounter and interpret it.

      A classic example of unethical technical writing is the
memo report NASA engineers wrote about the problem
with O-ring seals on the space shuttle Challenger. The
unethical feature was that the crucial information about
the O-rings was buried in a middle paragraph, while
information approving the launch was in prominent
beginning and ending spots. Presumably, the engineers
were trying to present a full report, including safe
components in the Challenger, but the memo's
audience--non-technical managers--mistakenly believed
the O-ring problem to be inconsequential, even if it
happened. The position of information in this document did
not help them understand that the problem could be fatal.

      Ethical writing, then, involves being ethical, of
course, but also presenting information so that your target
audience will understand the relative importance of
74 Katrina Peterson

information and understand whether some technical fact is
a good thing or a bad thing.

4.5 Ethical Issues in Technical Writing

There are a few issues that may come up when researching
a topic for the business or technical world that a writer
must consider. Let us look at a few.

Research that Does Not Support Project Idea

In a technical report that contains research, a writer might
discover conflicting data that does not support the project's
goal. For example, your small company continues to have
problems with employee morale. Research shows bringing
in an outside expert, someone who is unfamiliar with the
company and the stakeholders, has the potential to impact
the greatest change. You discover, however, that to bring
in such an expert is cost prohibitive. You struggle with
whether to leave this information out of your report,
thereby encouraging your employer to pursue an action that
is not the most productive. In this situation, what would
you do, and why?

Suppressing Relevant Information

Imagine you are researching a report for a parents' group
that wants to change the policy in the local school district
requiring all students to be vaccinated. You collect a
handful of sources that support the group's goal, but then
you discover convincing medical evidence that indicates
vaccines do more good than potential harm in society.
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 75

Since you are employed by this parents' group, should
you leave out the medical evidence, or do you have a
responsibility to include all research, even some that might
sabotage the group's goal? Is it your responsibility to tell
the truth (and potentially save children's lives) or to cherry
pick information that supports the parent group's initial
intentions?

Limited Source Information in Research

Thorough research requires a writer to integrate
information from a variety of reliable sources. These
sources should demonstrate that the writer has examined
the topic from as many angles as possible. This includes
scholarly and professional research, not just from a single
database or journal, for instance, but from a variety. Using
a variety of sources helps the writer avoid potential bias
that can occur from relying on only a few experts. If you
were writing a report on the real estate market in Stillwater,
Oklahoma, you would not collect data from only one
broker's office. While this office might have access to
broader data on the real estate market, as a writer you
run the risk of looking biased if you only chose materials
from this one source. Collecting information from multiple
brokers would demonstrate thorough and unbiased
research. (See chapter 10 for more on research.)

Presenting Visual Information Ethically

Visuals can be useful for communicating data and
information efficiently for a reader. They provide data in
a concentrated form, often illustrating key facts, statistics
or information from the text of the report. When writers
76 Katrina Peterson

present information visually, however, they have to be
careful not to misrepresent or misreport the complete
picture.

      The graphic below shows two perspectives of
information in a pie chart. The data in each is identical
but the pie chart on the left presents information in a
misleading way (see Figure 1). What do you notice,
however, about how that information is conveyed to the
reader?

Figure 1: Misleading and regular pie charts

Imagine that these pie charts represented donations
received by four candidates for city council. The candidate
represented by the green slice labeled "Item C," might
think that she had received more donations than the
candidate represented in the blue "Item A" slice. In fact,
if we look at the same data in a differently oriented chart,
we can see that Item C represents less than half of the
donations than those for Item A. Thus, a simple change in
perspective can change the impact of an image.

      Similarly, take a look at the bar graphs in Figure 2
below. What do you notice about their presentation?
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 77

Figure 2: Misleading and regular bar graphs

If the bar graph above were to represent sales figures for
a company, the representation on the left would look like
good news: dramatically increased sales over a five-year
period. However, a closer look at the numbers shows that
the graph shows only a narrow range of numbers in a
limited perspective (9100 to 9800). The bar graph on the
right, on the other hand, shows the complete picture by
presenting numbers from zero to1200 on the vertical axis,
and we see that the sales figures have in fact been relatively
stable for the past five years.

      Presenting data in graphical form can be especially
challenging. Keep in mind the importance of providing
appropriate context and perspective as you prepare your
graphics. You need to be extra vigilant to avoid misleading
your readers with graphics. Graphics will usually be the
first thing a reader notices about your document; if a reader
finds your graphics misleading, your entire document may
be called into question.

Additional Concerns

You might notice that most of these ethics violations could
happen accidentally. Directly lying is unlikely to be
accidental, but even in that case, the writer could
rationalize and/or persuade themselves that the lie achieved
78 Katrina Peterson

some "greater good" and was therefore necessary. This is a
slippery slope.

      An even more common ethics violation results from
the person who designs the information mistakenly
believing that they are presenting evidence objectively,
without recognizing their own bias in how they presented
that information.

      Most ethics violations in technical writing are
(probably) unintentional, but they are still ethics violations.
That means a technical writer must consciously identify
their biases and check to see if a bias has influenced any
presentation: whether in charts and graphs, or in
discussions of the evidence, or in source use (or, of course,
in putting the crucial O-ring information where the launch
decision makers would realize it was important).

      For example, scholarly research is intended to find
evidence that the new researcher's ideas are valid (and
important) or evidence that those ideas are partial, trivial,
or simply wrong. In practice, though, most folks are
primarily looking for support. "Hey, I have this great new
idea that will solve world hunger, cure cancer, and make
mascara really waterproof. Now I just need some evidence
to prove I am right!" This is one version of confirmation
bias (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) -
where people tend to favor evidence that supports their
preconceived notions and reject evidence that challenges
their ideas or beliefs. (See chapter 10 for more information
on ethical research principles.)

      On the other hand, if you can easily find 94 high-
quality sources that confirm you are correct, you might
want to consider whether your idea is worth developing.
Often in technical writing, the underlying principle is
already well-documented (maybe even common
knowledge for your audience) and the point should be
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 79

to use that underlying principle to propose a specific
application.

      Using a large section of your report to prove an
already established principle implies that you are saying
something new about the principle--which is not true.
Authors of technical documents typically do not have the
time or space to belabor well-known points or common-
sense data because readers do not need to read page upon
page of something they already know or something that can
be proved in a sentence of two. When you use concepts,
ideas, or findings that have been established by others, you
only need to briefly summarize your source and provide
accurate references. Then you can apply the information
from your source(s) to your specific task or proposal.

4.6 Ethics and Documenting Sources

The most immediate concern regarding ethics in your
technical writing course is documenting your sources.
Whatever content you borrow must be clearly documented
both in the body of your text and in a works cited or
references page (the different terms reflect different
documentation systems, not just random preference) at the
end. See chapter 10 for more information on appropriately
documenting your research.

      Including an item only in the source list at the end
suggests you have used the source in the report, but if you
have not cited this source in the text as well, you could be
seen as misleading the reader. Either you are saying it is a
source when in fact you did not really use anything from
it, or you have simply failed to clarify in the text what are
your ideas and what comes from other sources.

      Documenting source use in such a way as to either
80 Katrina Peterson

mislead your reader about the source or make identifying
the source difficult is also unethical--that would include
using just a URL or using an article title without
identifying the journal in which it appears (in the works
cited/references; you would not likely identify the journal
name in the report's body). It would also be unethical
to falsify the nature of the source, such as omitting the
number of pages in the works cited entry to make a brief
note seem to be a full article.

      Unethical source use includes suppressing
information about how you have used a source, such as not
making clear that graphical information in your report was
already a graph in your source, as opposed to a graph you
created on the basis of information in the source.

      With the ease of acquiring graphics on the internet, it
has become ever more tempting to simply copy and paste
images from a search engine. Without providing accurate
citation information, the practice of cutting and pasting
images is nothing less than plagiarism (or theft); it is
unethical, and may be illegal if it violates copyright law.
Furthermore, it is downright lazy. Develop good habits
now and maintain them through practice. Properly cite
your images by providing credit to the original creator of
the image with full citations. You cannot just slap a URL
under a picture, but rather you need to give full credit with
an appropriate citation. Any assignment turned in that uses
material from an outside source, including graphics and
images, needs to include in-text citations as well as a list of
references.

What about Open Source Images?

If you need to use graphics from the internet, a good option
is to look for graphics that are open source. Open source
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 81

refers to material that is freely available for anyone to use.
Creative Commons is an organization that has developed
guidelines to allow people to "share their knowledge and
creativity." They provide "free, easy-to-use copyright
licenses to make a simple and standardized way to give the
public permission to share and use" creative work ("What
we Do" https://creativecommons.org/about/). There are a
number of options (https://creativecommons.org/share-
your-work/licensing-types-examples/) that a creator has in
regards to how they want to set up permissions, but the idea
is that these works are free for anyone to use; they are open
source.

      Graphics created by the federal government, say from
the National Park Service, or the FDA, or the EPA, are not
under copyright, and therefore can be used without having
to go through the sometimes-onerous process of securing
permissions. This is particularly helpful for written
materials that will be professionally published.

      Likewise, you can customize a Google image search
so that only images that are open source will come up.
If you click on the "Tools" button, you have the option
of filtering results by how they are licensed. See Figure 3
below.
82 Katrina Peterson

Figure 3: A screen shot from a Google search where the images
are filtered by their license.

      Regardless of the copyright, you should always keep
track of where you found the graphics, and for assignments
for your class, you need to record the source so you can cite
it. If you use graphics (or anything at all) in an assignment
that you did not create, you need to indicate as much. Just
because a graphic is open source, does not mean that you
can pass it off as your own work, and if you don't cite it,
that is exactly what you are doing, whether or not that was
your intention.

      Many problems in documenting sources occur
because the writer is missing the point of source use.
Remember, you must clearly distinguish between your
ideas and borrowed material; and you must use borrowed
material primarily as evidence for your own, directly stated
ideas.

Intellectual Property

Patents and trademarks are company names (WalMart),
logos (the Target bullseye), processes or slogans
(McDonald's "I'm lovin' it") that belong to a person or
company. None of these things can be used without proper
recognition of or approval from the appropriate company
or individual involved. A company uses a TM to show
something is trademarked or an ® for something registered
with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office. An example
would be Nike and their famous swoosh symbol.

      This law extends beyond the major companies. Any
written document in your own company is copyrighted by
law once produced. That means if you are borrowing a
good idea from a friend at another company, you must cite
them as a source. Also, although not required by law, it is
a good idea to cite sources from inside your own company
as well. You would not want someone else taking credit for
your ideas. Why should you treat others any differently?

      The legal consequences are most notable when one
considers writing in the professional world. While
plagiarizing may give you a failing grade in a class,
plagiarizing in the workplace can get you fired, and could
result in a costly lawsuit or possibly even jail time. It is
not only ethical to follow these rules, it is an enforced law.
Make sure you properly document all sources so as not to
mislead a reader.

      Copyright law includes items whose distribution is
protected by law (books, movies, or software). The
copyright symbol is shown with a ©. Copyright is different
from plagiarism in that it is a legal issue. Only the
copyright holder, the person/organization who owns the
protected item, can copy it. Spend a few minutes checking
out The United States Patent and Trademark Office
84 Katrina Peterson

(https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-getting-started/

trademark-basics/trademark-patent-or-copyright)       for

clarification on trademarks, patents, and copyright.

Some considerations made by the court when

determining if a copyright law has been violated include:

· The character, purpose of use, and amount of
   information being used. Was it a phrase,
   sentence, chapter, or an entire piece of work?
   Was the information simply copied and pasted
   as a whole or changed? Was it taken from
   something published or unpublished? What was
   it used for?

· If the person using another's material did so to
   profit from it. Only the copyright holders
   should profit from material they own. For
   example, this is why a faculty member cannot
   use their personal DVD for a movie screening
   on campus and charge students to attend the
   viewing.

· If using someone else's property affected the
   market for the copyrighted work. For example,
   if you take an item that would cost money to
   buy and copy it for other people, you are
   affecting the market for that product since the
   people you give it to will now not have to
   purchase it themselves. Therefore, the original
   owner of the material is denied a profit due to
   your actions.

When dealing with copyright questions, consider the
following tips. First, find out if the item can be used.
Sometimes, the copyright holder allows it if credit is given.
Second, do not use large amounts of another person's
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 85

information. Third, if possible, ask permission to use
another person's work. In addition, and most importantly,
cite sources accurately so as to give credit to another
person's ideas if you are able to use them.

4.7 Ethics, Plagiarism, and Reliable Sources

Unlike personal or academic writing, technical and
professional writing can be used to evaluate your job
performance and can have implications that a writer may
or may not have considered. Whether you are writing for
colleagues within your workplace or outside vendors or
customers, you will want to build a solid, well-earned,
favorable reputation for yourself with your writing. Your
goal is to maintain and enhance your credibility, and that of
your organization, at all times.

      Credibility can be established through many means:
using appropriate professional language, citing highly
respected sources, providing reliable evidence, and using
sound logic. Make sure as you start your research that you
always question the credibility of the information you find.
You should ask yourself the following questions:

         · Are the sources popular or scholarly?

         · Are they peer reviewed by experts in the field?

         · Can the information be verified by other
            sources?

         · Are the methods and arguments based on solid
            reasoning and sound evidence?

         · Is the author identifiable and do they have
            appropriate credentials?
86 Katrina Peterson

Be cautious about using sources that are not reviewed by
peers or editor, or in which the information cannot be
verified, or seems misleading, biased, or even false. Be
a wise information consumer in your own reading and
research in order to build your reputation as an honest,
ethical writer. See chapter 10 for more information on
credibility and evaluating secondary sources.

      Quoting the work of others in your writing is fine,
provided that you credit the source fully enough that your
readers can find it on their own. If you fail to take careful
notes, or the sentence is present in your writing but later
fails to get accurate attribution, it can have a negative
impact on you and your organization. That is why it is
important that when you find an element you would like to
incorporate in your document, in the same moment as you
copy and paste or make a note of it in your research file
you need to note the source in a complete enough form to
find it again.

      Giving credit where credit is due will build your
credibility and enhance your document. Moreover, when
your writing is authentically yours, your audience will
catch your enthusiasm, and you will feel more confident in
the material you produce. Just as you have a responsibility
in business to be honest in selling your product or service
and avoid cheating your customers, so you have a
responsibility in business writing to be honest in presenting
your idea, and the ideas of others, and to avoid cheating
your readers with plagiarized material.

4.8 Ethical Writing

Throughout your career, you will be required to create
many documents. Some may be simple and
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 87

straightforward, some may be difficult and involve
questionable objectives. Overall, there are a few basic
points to adhere to whenever you are writing a professional
document: a) do not mislead, b) do not manipulate, and c)
do not stereotype.

Do Not Mislead

This has more than one meaning to the professional writer.
The main point is clear. When writing persuasively, do
not write something that can cause the reader to believe
something that is not true. This can be done by lying,
misrepresenting facts, or just "twisting" numbers to favor
your opinion and objectives. Once you are on the job,
you cannot leave out numbers that show you are behind
or over-budget on a project, no matter how well it may
work once it is completed. Be cautious when using figures,
charts and tables, making sure they visually represent
quantities with accuracy and honesty. While this may seem
easy to read about, when the pressure is on and there are
deadlines to meet, taking shortcuts and stretching the truth
become ever more tempting.

Do Not Manipulate

Do not persuade people to do what is not in their best
interest. A good writer with bad motives can twist words
to make something sound like it is beneficial to all parties.
The audience may find out too late that what you wrote
only benefited you and actually hurt them. Make sure all
stakeholders are considered and cared for when writing a
persuasive document. It is easy to get caught up in the
facts and forget all the people involved. Their feelings
88 Katrina Peterson

and livelihood must be considered with every appropriate
document you create.

Do Not Stereotype

Most stereotyping takes place subconsciously now since
workplaces are careful to not openly discriminate. It is
something we may not even be aware we are doing, so it
is always a good idea to have a peer or coworker proofread
your documents to make sure you have not included
anything that may point to discriminatory assumptions.

      The not-for-profit organization Project Implicit
(https://www.projectimplicit.net/) has been researching
subconscious biases for years and has developed several,
free online tests. (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/
takeatest.html) The tests can help you understand your
proclivities and subconscious biases. Knowing your biases
may help you begin to overcome them.

4.9 Addressing Unethical Practices

It is difficult to deal with unethical practices when they
surface in the workplace. The hardest part may be simply
raising the issue with your co-workers and/or supervisor.
In his book Technical Communication: A Reader-Centered
Approach, Paul Anderson reviews three ways that you can
bring your company's practices to the surface. It is easiest
to first start asking questions. Simply asking questions can
be an effective way of bringing attention to your
company's problems. Ask questions about who their
decisions are affecting and why they are making those
decisions. This will allow you to voice your thoughts
without putting you on the spot for being the bad guy.
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 89

      The second idea Anderson describes is to use facts or
reason, instead of accusation. Before you raise questions
about your company's unethical practices, make sure you
use evidence instead of accusations. Often, accusations are
made about situations when people do not truly know the
reason those decisions were being made. If you base your
concerns on evidence, your company will assume you
looked into the situation and will take your thoughts more
seriously.

      The third helpful way to bring your company's
unethical practices to the surface is to remain open to
other's ideas. What this allows you to do is base a solution
around many different sides instead of just your own. Since
people usually have different ethical values, your own
stance may not coincide with everyone else's. Make sure
you identify possible values of others when considering
possible solutions.

Ethics Decision Checklist

         · What is the nature of the ethical dilemma?

         · What are the specific aspects of this dilemma
            that make you uncomfortable?

         · What are your competing obligations in this
            dilemma?

         · What advice does a trusted supervisor or mentor
            offer?

         · Does your company's code of conduct address
            this issue?

         · Does your professional association's code of
            conduct address this issue?
90 Katrina Peterson

         · What are you unwilling to do? What are you
            willing to do?

         · How will you explain or justify your decision?

4.10 Legal Issues and Communication

In business, image is everything. Public opinion of a
company affects a consumer's views on that company's
products. This, in turn, affects the company's public profit,
and essentially its standing. When a company is involved
in a lawsuit or a recall, the company has to consider the
consequences that these issues will have on their business
and needs to consider the costs of repairing the company's
reputation. These are among the reasons certain documents
are carefully reviewed before being sent to their intended
readers. To write ethically, you must also identify another
group of people: the individuals who will gain or lose
because of your message. Collectively, these people are
called stakeholders because they have a stake in what you
are writing. Only by learning who these stakeholders are
can you assure that you are treating them in accordance
with your own ethical values. When crafting your
communication, think about who will be affected by what
you say and how you say it.

      Under the law, most documents written by employees
represent the position and commitments of the organization
itself. There are always legal issues to consider when
writing a professional document and they reflect in writing
style. Professional documents can serve as evidence in
disputes over contracts and in product liability lawsuits.
Being caught in a lawsuit has many consequences for a
company. The money spent on lawyers and the time spent
in court takes away resources a company could use for
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 91

improving business and products. Lawsuits also have
ramifications for a company's reputation. Product recalls
can be another legal problem for companies.

      There are a number of reasons why a company may
face a lawsuit or a recall. One of the main reasons a
company gets involved in a lawsuit is because the
directions to the company's product were not clear to the
consumer. For this reason, the general guideline is that
instructions should be understandable, clear and concise
at the fourth to sixth grade reading level. Also, when in
a lawsuit, a company has to remember that all documents
may be subpoenaed. This means that any document from
memos and emails to proposals and studies can be subject
to revision by a court of law. Another reason a company
gets into a lawsuit may be over a recall. Many products
are recalled for potential safety concerns, even if no one
was actually hurt. To avoid safety recalls, companies need
to make sure they consider every possible danger involved
with a product. Some dangers may seem to be common
knowledge, but companies should be aware of those and
label the product accordingly, regardless of assumptions
about common knowledge.

Legal Requirements: Protecting Consumers

Documentation should prepare readers to safely use the
product. US law stipulates that a manual must list any
hazards that may occur "from the intended or unintended
but reasonably foreseeable use of its products."
(https://www.google.com/
url?q=http://www.productliabilityprevention.com/images/
6-LegallyAdequateWarningLabelsAConundrumforEvery
Manufacturer.pdf&sa=D&ust=1553803200010000) You
have a legal duty to warn consumers when:
92 Katrina Peterson

         · The product supplied is dangerous

         · The danger is or should be known by the
            manufacturer

         · The danger is present when the product is used
            in the usual and expected manner

         · The danger is not obvious or well known to the
            user

Failure to "adequately" warn consumers opens your
company up to lawsuits. What exactly makes a warning
"adequate"? Good question. Adequacy is almost
impossible to define. It is much easier to define what is not
adequate. Here are a few common ways that manuals or
instructions fall short:

         · Failure to warn users about how to properly use
            a product

         · Failure to warn against risks from proper use of
            a product

         · Failure to warn against any reasonably
            foreseeable misuses of a product

The key commonality is that everything listed could result
in bodily harm or death.

      Safety information must also be accessible to your
readers. Therefore, warnings should stand out from the
rest of the documents, possibly with icons, colored fonts,
or bolding. They should also be easy to understand. A
confusing warning is just as bad as not warning users at all.

Contract and Liability Laws

Contract Law is an agreement between two entities. It can

be written or oral. There are usually two kinds: express

warranty and implied warranty. An express warranty is a

clearly written or oral statement that the product of what

a product is capable of. An implied warranty can be

reasonably inferred by the purchaser. How so? How the

packaging is done and what is on the accompanying fliers

or material can be part of this.

Liability Law helps companies and organizations act

responsibly. Therefore, the company or organization is

responsible for giving adequate instructions and warning

users about the risks associated with the product. They can

also be held liable if a consumer is injured or damages

occur.

Liability and contract laws can vary by country.

European regulations are decidedly strict, and Asian laws

are starting to follow suit. If you plan on selling wares

internationally, account for various regional requirements.

Chapter 5: Document Design

Katrina Peterson

Chapter Synopsis

This chapter briefly summarizes fundamental concepts to
consider as you craft print and electronic texts. In this
chapter you will read about basic principles of document
design that allow writers to combine graphic elements with
text to convey a message to audiences. Beginning with
a discussion of standard conventions (of formatting,
language, and style), the chapter then shares some basic
guidelines for document design, moving forward to focus
on integration of graphics, callouts and captions. Other
topics include tables of contents, figures and tables,
headings and the well-known CRAP test used by graphic
designers. For additional resources, see the activities
included at the chapter's end.

5.1 Introduction

A text's visual appeal matters to the reader, so it should
also matter to the writer. Letters, reports, and blogs are
more than just words on a page or screen. How ideas
are arranged and delivered, whether electronically or on
paper, can make reading seem intimidating, confusing, or
downright unfriendly, even if the content itself is perfect.
Conversely, a document's design can draw in readers and
engage them with your ideas. Think of the text as a room

                                     95
96 Katrina Peterson

for your thoughts. Sometimes you want readers to get in
and get out quickly, but often you want them to sit down
and make themselves comfortable, put their feet up and
stay a while. Regardless of your specific goal, it is
important to make deliberate decisions about the design
elements that affect audience experience.

      As readers, we may seem a bit like TV viewers with
remote controls. In a moment, attention may be diverted
to another channel if something about the content distracts
us. For this reason, a writer must consider carefully how
to capture readers' attention and hold it. Good content is
a key part of this, of course, but the visual presentation of
the content matters too. Reading is a difficult, cognitively
demanding task, so if your design helps make readers'
journey through the text easier, you will hold their attention
longer. Give your audience reasons to linger, and they will.

      You already engage in document design practices. For
instance, when formatting an academic essay, you center
your title and separate the content into paragraphs, which
signals to the reader that it is time for a breather, the
content is shifting slightly, or you are introducing a new
topic. You illustrate blogs, Web pages, and PowerPoint
slides with photos and graphics, animations, or videos.
Even small elements of your writing help guide readers:
indentation, changes in type style (bold, italics, underline),
or punctuation at the end of a sentence. Professional
writers, especially those who work for well-funded web
sites and mass-market print publications, are fortunate
enough to have the services of artists, graphic designers,
skilled photographers, and layout experts. But most of us
just want to have a cooler-looking blog, a more
professional-looking report, or an eBay listing that
reinforces our credibility.

      In many respects, document design is both a science
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 97

and an art. The layout of documents--their content, color
scheme, alignment, etc.--is the result of individual
choices. It takes a long time to master the finer points of
design. As a starting point, this chapter will offer some
strategies for making your documents intuitive and
audience friendly: easy to scan, search, and read. The goal
of this chapter is to familiarize you with a few basic ways
of thinking that designers know well. Whether you are
typing up a memo on safety policies at work, producing
a newsletter for your community, or putting together a
booklet describing a new app, the following elements of
document design are meant for you.

5.2 Standard Conventions

Appropriate format, language, and style are the basic
design elements of all technical documents. A format with
a structure that leads readers thorough the text and shows
the hierarchical relationships among ideas--from most
important to least important--is crucial. Readers should
be able to identify the organizational pattern very quickly
when scanning a technical document. The document
should be reader friendly, or reader-centered rather than
writer-centered. Using appropriate language provides
readers with a thorough understanding of the document's
purpose, how it relates to the individual needs, and any
actions readers will need to take. Although it is helpful
to examine each element of a document individually, it
is also wise to step back and consider the interrelation
of elements, or how all components work together to
communicate a message to a specific audience. In this
sense, everything from language and style to a text's visual
98 Katrina Peterson

aspects may either contribute to or detract from its overall
design.

      As discussed previously in the chapter on audience
(see Chapter 2), a document may have one primary reader,
several secondary readers, or a combination of both. A
primary reader is the person who ordered the report to
be written or the person for whom a report is intended.
This reader will usually read the entire report. Secondary
readers are those who will read only the sections of the
report that relate to them, their jobs, their departments,
responsibilities, etc. For example, in the case of a report
that details funding for different departments, a
superintendent may only want to read the section that
relates to piping. This is where format, a table of contents,
page numbers, the use of headings, etc. is significant in
allowing easy access to information. It saves time when the
piping superintendent can scan through the document and
clearly find the heading that identifies his department.

      Similar to formatting and language, there are also
specific style conventions, or expectations, associated with
different genres of writing. Academic papers, cover letters,
résumés, business plans, and other documents tend to
follow these conventions--some explicit (stated directly)
and some implicit (unstated or indirectly stated). For
example, Modern Language Association (MLA) and
American Psychological Association (APA) styles dictate
exactly what academic papers should look like. Associated
Press (AP) style shapes the look of newspaper text, and
Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
style governs engineering documents.

      For every context in which you write, you will
discover that field-specific style guides influence the
appearance of a text, the way language is used, the
preferred terminology and vocabulary, and the way sources
                               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 99

are cited. Business- and commerce-established firms like
Panasonic, IKEA, eBay, Sears, and Trader Joe's have a
style too. To preserve their brand identity, firms create
recognizable, memorable logos and make sure their
documents follow a certain agreed-upon style. Government
and civic organizations also have logos and letterhead;
even government and military documents are influenced by
specific style conventions.

      These style conventions matter. For each document
design, you will need to know which set of conventions
applies to it. For example, a cover letter should generally
follow traditional business letter format. Memos and
emails will look slightly different; we do not expect to
see an address block for the letter recipient on an email
because a street address is not needed to reply. Within your
program of study and individual classes, the program or
the professor will determine style, citation, and formatting
conventions like MLA or APA. Style and formatting guides
recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
still help you when dealing with online publications. In the
professional world, you will need to find out field-specific
or company-specific style and citation conventions.

      Many bemoan the lack of a consistent style on web
pages; inconsistency sometimes detracts from readability,
can negatively affect the document's/author's ethos, and
may create confusion that reduces clarity. We may not
know who wrote the text, where it comes from, or when
it was produced. Readers may hesitate to assign real
credibility to an undated, unsourced blog written by a
stranger--and rightly so. This is why sites like Wikipedia
demand sources and format all entries exactly the same.
The look and feel of Wikipedia is now familiar to people
around the world, and it is used as a source in some writing
contexts, for good or for ill, precisely because its content
100 Katrina Peterson

has predictable regularity and its easy-to-navigate entries
are popular with readers. However, producing good
publications involves much more than following style
conventions. There are a variety of concepts to consider
and many important choices to make when planning the
best method of communicating your message.

5.3 Basic Guidelines

The first step in document design involves identifying the
genre and its conventions (as discussed above), which may
vary widely based on context, audience, and purpose. Here
are some basic guidelines to keep in mind when dealing
with business writing:

         · Add and vary graphics. For non-specialist
            audiences, you may want to use more
            graphics--and simpler ones at that. Documents
            geared toward the non-specialist tend to have
            more decorative, technical, and detailed
            graphics.

         · Break up text or consolidate it into
            meaningful, usable chunks. For non-specialist
            readers, you will likely construct shorter
            paragraphs of around six to eight lines.
            Technical documents written for specialists will
            include much longer paragraphs.

         · Use headings and lists. Readers can be
            intimidated by dense paragraphs of writing.
            (Technical writers may refer to a long paragraph
            that is difficult to scan as "a wall of prose.")
            Incorporate headings whenever possible--for
                  Technical and Professional Writing Genres 101

   example, when a topic or subtopic is introduced.
   Also search your document for written lists that
   can be made into vertical lists. Look for paired
   listings such as terms and their definitions; these
   can become two-column lists.

· Use special typography. Typically, sans-serif
   fonts, such as Ariel, are useful for online
   readers. Serif fonts, such as Time New Roman,
   are useful for print texts.

· Work with margins, line length, line spacing,
   type size, and type style. For non-specialist
   readers, you can increase readability by making
   the lines shorter (adjusting the margins) and
   using larger type sizes.

· Include bullet points. Long lists can often be
   broken down into smaller bulleted chunks of
   information for ease of reading. Some genres,
   like the résumé, place the emphasis on bulleted
   phrases rather than complete sentences. When
   using bullet points, keep in mind the following:

             Use a lead-in to introduce the list
               items and to indicate the meaning or
               purpose of the list (and punctuate it
               with a colon).

             Check spacing, indentation,
               punctuation, and caps to ensure
               consistency.

             Make list items parallel in phrasing.

             Confirm that each item in the list is
102 Katrina Peterson

                        parallel and grammatically correct.
                      Avoid overusing lists; using too many

                        lists destroys their effectiveness.
                      Use similar types of lists consistently

                        within the same document.

         · Strive for balance and parallelism among
            elements. Keep in mind that items at the top of
            a document weigh more than those at the
            bottom, while items on the right side of the page
            weigh more than those on the left. Text and
            graphics should work together to create a sense
            of balance and unity.

In summary, while these basic guidelines may be applied
to many different documents, the individual decisions you
make will depend on your audience, or who will read your
report. From content and language to layout, every aspect
of your communication must keep your readers' needs in
mind.

             In the slide below, which of the principles
       above have been applied well? It utilizes both
       headings and subheadings to break materials into
       useable segments. It also includes bullet points,
       relying on fragments and phrases rather than full
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 103

       sentences, which encourages a speaker to elaborate
       on major points rather than over-relying on reading
       from the slide. The simplicity of the triangular
       graphic and color scheme could be said to enhance
       rather than detract from the main message.
       However, some might argue that the weight of the
       graphic on the right side throws off the visual's
       balance (since items on the right weigh more than
       those on the left). A simple adjustment to the
       graphic's size or placement would adjust the
       imbalance.

5.4 Creating and Integrating Graphics

Technical writers often integrate graphics or visuals to
104 Katrina Peterson

complement text in a report. Graphics can take many
forms--tables, charts, photographs, drawings, to name a
few--but their purpose rarely varies: they should help to
clarify information presented in the report. They should
work together with the text to communicate, rather than
replacing the text altogether. Graphics provide an
additional benefit. They help to break up a text-heavy
report, making the report more visually appealing.

      As you begin thinking about possible visuals to
include in your document, the first step is to consider which
graphics are most appropriate for the message you want to
convey. The table below provides some general guidelines
on the graphics most suitable to convey specific types of
information.

Information to Convey               Visual Type
Numbers, percentages, categories    Tables, charts
Processes                           Flow charts
Geographic data                     Maps
Chronological or prioritized lists  Numbered lists
Non-chronological lists             Bulleted lists

Preparing Readers for Graphics

When developing graphics, you will want to consider
where they should be placed and what information should
surround them. Make sure your visuals are appropriate
to your audience, subject matter, and purpose. To prepare
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 105

readers for the information a graphic conveys, also
consider these tips:

         · Explain or introduce the information/topic of the
            graphic in the preceding paragraph.

         · For easy reference, give each visual a name.

         · Make sure the information within the graphic is
            clear and easy to understand.

         · Whether above the visual or somewhere else in
            the document, provide source information,
            references, or citations (if the visual and/or data
            is not your original work and comes from a
            secondary source).

         · Include a caption or follow-up text after the
            graphic, such as an interpretation or a final
            comment about the implications of the visual. If
            the graphic contains extensive data, you may
            need to tell your audience what information to
            focus on.

         · Intersperse graphics and text on the same page.
            Avoid placing graphics on pages by themselves;
            ideally, no visual should take up more than one-
            third of a page unless absolutely necessary.

         · Include identifying details within the graphics
            such as illustration labels, axis labels, keys, and
            so on.

         · Leave at least one blank line above and below
            graphics.

         · Place graphics near the text that they are
            illustrating. If a graphic does not fit on the same
            page, indicate that it appears on the next page.
106 Katrina Peterson

         · Cite all images that you take from elsewhere.
            While it is perfectly legal to borrow
            graphics--to trace, photocopy, scan, or extract
            subsets of data from them--you are obligated to
            accurately cite your sources for graphics. Also
            be aware that some graphics may require extra
            permissions from the creator based on the type
            of copyright.

   Examples

         The graphic below, provided by Wikimedia Commons,
   follows at least some of the design principles given above.
   What is done well, and what might be done better? You will
   notice, for example, that the graphic incorporates a space
   above and below, along with a descriptive caption. Would
   readers benefit from also seeing labels that identify key
   information, or would additional descriptions seem
   superfluous?

   commissioned by Ludwig II.

Callouts and Captions

Callouts and captions contain information that help readers
to interpret graphics; they identify specific elements or
features. Whereas captions are short phrases or sentences
that describe the graphic, callouts (or labels) are used when
parts of the image need to be labeled or each part requires a
longer explanation. Captions for graphics should be placed
immediately under the graphic; they include the title and
any explanatory material. Here are a few starting
guidelines when creating captions: place words such as
Figure, Illustration, and Table in bold type; italicize caption
titles; and treat tables and figures just the same. Good
captions guide readers not only to see, but also to
understand.
108 Katrina Peterson

      Writing Style for Captions
      The following paragraphs share five
recommendations for style based on The Franklin Covey
Style Guide for Business and Technical Communication.
First, use interpretive captions whenever possible.
Interpretive captions provide both a title and explanatory
information, usually expressed in a complete sentence, to
help readers understand the central point(s) that the writer
wants to convey. A graphic and its caption should be clear
and understandable without requiring readers to search for
clarifying information in the text: "Figure 23-Check Valve.
The risk of bad air entering the changer is near zero
because the check valve permits air flow in one direction
only." This interpretive caption gives the title of the figure
and emphasizes that the cabin has a constant
temperature--a benefit provided by the feature described
in the figure. The caption states clearly what the writer
wants the reader to learn from the drawing.
      Secondly, avoid using short or ambiguous titles to
replace interpretive captions. In the past, styles for
technical and scientific documents used only simple title
captions for visuals. How would the effect of the
Neuschwanstein visual change if the caption simply read
"Castle"? Such a title makes the caption unnecessary,
providing no real information other than the obvious to
the reader. Titles that are so short and/or cryptic that they
sound telegraphic are not useful.
      Thirdly, number figures and tables
sequentially throughout the document, and place the
number before the caption. If an important figure or table is
presented twice, treat it as two separate visuals and number
each.
      Fourthly, use periods following interpretive captions
but omit punctuation following short captions that are not
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 109

complete sentences. Interpretive captions are usually
complete sentences and should therefore end with a period.
Short captions, like titles and headings, are not usually
complete sentences, so they require no punctuation.
Captions may appear below or above a visual, but
consistency throughout a document is critical. Arguments
support both options; choose one, know the rationale for
your choice, and be consistent.

      Lastly, put the caption above the visual for better
visibility when captions are used with slides and other
project visual aids. Captions placed at the bottom may be
blocked by the heads of those seated in front or the limits
of the projector/screen. Safety information must also be
accessible to your readers. Warnings should stand out from
the rest of the documents, possibly with icons, colored
fonts, or bolding. They should also be easy to understand.
A confusing safety label is just as bad as no warning at all.

      To give a warning prominence, you may decide to
list it at the beginning of the manual; be sure to also list
hazards where the reader might encounter them in your
instructions. In the case of technical instructions where
action is required, list the safety label before the step to
ensure that the reader sees the information in time to
prevent mishap. As a preemptive strike against lawsuits,
you may be tempted to list every possible hazard that
comes to mind. Some companies do this to an extent that
the warnings become ridiculous--i.e. "Do not use this
rotary drill as a home dentistry kit" or "Do not use your
hairdryer while sleeping." Keep in mind that too many
warnings--especially ridiculous ones--make the whole
safety section seem silly. Then, no one takes the hazard
seriously, not even the real ones. Remember: You only
have to inform users when a hazard is "reasonably
110 Katrina Peterson

foreseeable." In other words, find the middle ground
between not enough warnings and way too many.

Guidelines for Callouts

Here are a few additional guidelines for callouts:

         · Determine the number of items to identify
            in the image.

         · Create a consistent visual style.
         · Use the same terms on the callout as in the

            text.
         · Place callouts next to the elements in the

            graphic they identify, using a line to
            connect the two, if necessary.
         · Use a standard font and size for readability.
         · Align the labels and callouts for a neater
            appearance.

      The following graphic adopts a consistent visual style
in the way that it identifies the parts of a locomotive. Its
terms are placed directly next to the graphic, connected by
lines. Its title is placed above rather than below the visual
for easy differentiation from the callouts.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 111

Figure 3: Locomotive graphic with a label and additional callouts.

Types and Placement of Callouts
Callouts typically take one of three different forms: 1)
They may be placed directly on the graphic (whereby they
become part of the visual), 2) They may be placed around
the graphic near lines that point to the relevant element in
the graphic, or 3) They may include links or hotspots where
more information about the element is displayed on mouse
rollover or on another page. The visuals below feature two
of the three major label types.
112 Katrina Peterson

            labels directly into the graphic, making them
            part of the visual.

Figure 5 (second type): Illustration that places labels near lines,
connected to the graphic.

When to Use Callouts
Callouts are best used when many parts of the image
need to be labeled and each part requires a longer
explanation. In fact, the label sequence may be in
alphabetical or numerical order, as shown in the
example below. Ensure that the explanation is near
the graphic.

5.5 Tables of Contents

Most people are familiar with tables of contents (TOC), but
have you ever stopped to look at their design? The TOC
shows readers what topics are covered in the report, how
those topics are discussed (subtopics), and on which page
numbers sections and subsections start. In creating a TOC,
you will have to make design decisions having to do with
levels of headings, indentation, spacing and capitalization.
Such decisions keep the TOC from becoming long and
unwieldy; it should provide an at-a-glance way of finding
information in the report quickly.

      In the illustration below, items in each of the three
levels of headings are aligned. Main chapters or sections
are written in all capital letters, first-level headings use
initial capitals on each main word, and lower-level sections
use initial capitals on the first word only. The first-level
sections also have extra space above and below, which
increases readability. Using the automatic TOC creator in
your word processor can help you produce a clean,
professional document. If you prefer to make your own,
use dot leader tabs to line up the page numbers correctly.
See the following example of a table of contents:
116 Katrina Peterson

Figure 7: Detailed Table of Contents with leader lines and
indented subsections.

5.6 Figures and Tables

If your document has more than two figures and tables,
create a separate list of figures. The list of figures has many
of the same design considerations as the table of contents.
Readers use it to quickly find the illustrations, diagrams,
tables, and charts in your report. Complications arise when
you have both tables and figures. Strictly speaking, figures
are illustrations, drawings, photographs, graphs, and charts.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 117

Tables are rows and columns of words and numbers; they
are not considered figures.

      For longer reports that contain dozens of figures and
tables each, create separate lists of figures and tables. Put
them together on the same page if they fit, as shown in the
illustration below. You can combine the two lists under the
heading List of Figures and Tables and identify the items
as figure or table as is done in the illustration below.

Figure 8: Visual illustration of separate lists of figures and tables
placed on the same page.
118 Katrina Peterson

5.7 Headings

In all but the shortest reports (two pages or less), use
headings--titles and subtitles--to mark off the different
topics covered. Headings are an important feature of
professional technical writing: they alert readers to
upcoming topics and subtopics, help them find their way
around in long reports, and break up long stretches of
straight text. They are also useful for keeping writers
organized and focused on the topic. When some writers
begin using headings, they are tempted to insert them after
writing the rough draft. Instead, take time to visualize the
headings before starting the rough draft, and plug them in
as you write. Here are helpful tips for headers:

         · Make phrasing self-explanatory: instead of
            Background or Technical Information, be more
            specific, like Physics of Fiber Optics.

         · Indicate the range of topics covered in the
            section: if the section covers the design and
            operation of a pressurized water reactor, the
            heading Pressurized Water Reactor Design may
            seem incomplete and misleading.

         · Do not use stacked headings (consecutive
            headings without intervening text).

         · Avoid pronouns referring to headings: if you
            have a heading like Torque, do not begin the
            sentence following it with: "This is a physics
            principle."

         · Omit articles from the beginning of headings:
            The Pressurized Water Reactor can easily be
            changed to Pressurized Water Reactor.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 119

         · Avoid widowed headings: widowing occurs
            when a heading is placed at the bottom of one
            page and the text starts at the top of the next
            page. Keep at least two lines of body text with
            the heading or place all the information on a
            new page.

Manually formatting each heading using the guidelines
presented above will lead unnecessarily repetitive work.
The styles provided by Microsoft Word, OpenOffice
Writer, and other software save you this work. You can
simply select Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, and so on.

5.8 The CRAP Test

Despite the unfortunate acronym, the major four principles
of CRAP are familiar to any graphic designer and they
should be familiar to writers as well. This guideline
originated with the influential designer and writer Robin
Williams; she now regrets the acronym, but not the ideas
behind it.

      1. C is for Contrast: Use difference to draw readers'
eyes to and through your text or publication.

      You can see evidence of the most basic aspects of
contrast in any web page or magazine. The headline text
is always different from the body text. It is often bigger
and bolder; it can also be in a different typeface. Headlines
make it easy to skip from one story to the next and get a
cursory understanding of the news.

      Applying strong contrasting elements to your text is
important because the human eye is drawn to difference,
not necessarily size. When everything looks the same, it is
difficult to focus on anything. When things are different,
120 Katrina Peterson

they are more noticeable. When a document has few or no
contrasting elements, nothing stands out. The document is
not easy to scan, and it does not invite the reader to jump in
and read. It is also difficult for readers to glean information
from the text easily and quickly.

Figure 9: What stands out here? Use contrast to make
data-gathering easy for readers.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 121

Figure 10: The contrast in this image quickly draws the eye to a
central focus.

      Some documents, like business letters or academic
papers, have fewer contrasting elements, but even line
spacing and paragraph breaks help indicate where a related
chunk of information begins and ends. Contrast helps draw
the reader's eyes to specific elements in your text, and it
also helps the reader follow the flow of the information,
while assessing which items are most important and require
immediate attention. It creates readability. The following
elements of a text can help you create a friendly, appealing
sense of contrast:

      Contrast in size: Your eye moves toward things
because they are different, not because they are large or
small. Your eye is impressed by novelty more than sheer
size or color or any other visual characteristic. There are all
sorts of scientific theories about why this is so, but in short,
it is not so much that making something bigger makes it
more noticeable. A person's height, for example, is not so
122 Katrina Peterson

noticeable until the principle of contrast comes into effect.
There is such a thing as too much size contrast: think of
those web sites with huge type or an overly enthusiastic
use of the CAPS LOCK key. Less is more, but some size
contrast is essential to draw the reader's eye.

      Contrast in font size/style/weight: A typeface is a
collection of fonts. The distinction between the terms
typeface and font stretches back to the days of typesetting:
hand-placing individual letters made of wood or metal,
inking them, and rolling paper over them. In the digital
age, most people use the words typeface and font
interchangeably, though the distinction still matters to
experts like designers and typographers.

      What is important to most people is that we all have
a huge variety of typefaces, or font families, to choose
from: Times New Roman, Arial, Bookman, Georgia, and
Garamond are familiar to many of us. It is important to
choose a font (a particular size, style, and weight within
a typeface) that fits our purpose. Some, like script and
handwriting typefaces, are too hard to read and thus
inappropriate for body text, for example. Some typefaces
work well as headlines: Franklin Gothic Condensed and
Caslon are two typefaces often used for newspaper
headlines. The "font" chosen (size, weight, style--italic,
bold, etc.) will be the designer's choice.

      It is also important to distinguish between serif and
sans-serif fonts. Sans serif fonts, like Helvetica or Futura,
are simple and smooth; the letters do not display the feet
and ornamentation (serifs) that serif fonts do. Sans serif
fonts are often used for headlines, but serif fonts are more
likely to be used for body text. Many typographers think
serif fonts (also called Roman fonts) make large blocks of
body text easier to read. Some of the preference is really
just about tradition.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 123

Figure 11: Three common sans serif typefaces/font families

      Contrast in Direction (vertical, horizontal, circular,
etc.) or position (top, bottom, side): Changing the direction
or orientation of text, graphic elements like lines, banners,
or screens.
124 Katrina Peterson

Figure 12: The spoon's angle adds visual appeal through contrast
and avoids monotony.

Contrast in alignment (center, left, right, justified): A
change in alignment can create visual interest. For
example, headlines are often centered to make them
noticeable. Images may be placed in a location on a page
(or slide) to draw readers' attention in one direction or
another. Consistent alignment with slight variations to
provide interest is particularly important in PowerPoint
presentations. You will be flipping from one slide to
another, and if the text blocks and headlines are not aligned
identically, your text and headlines will appear to jump
around the screen in a distracting way.

      Contrast in graphic elements like photos, banners/
bands, pull quotes, or logos: Breaking up huge blocks of
text with a variety of graphic elements can really add visual
appeal and interest. As with the examples below, less is
more. Think of all the publications and web sites you have
seen whose designers thought it was awesome to make text
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 125

bold AND underlined AND multicolored AND flashing.
With a bright yellow background. And too many animated
GIFs. It repels readers rather than attracting them.
126 Katrina Peterson

Figure 13: This poster uses contrasting alignment, contrast in text,
and simple color contrast to create a dramatic effect. Less really
can be more.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 127

      Contrast in color (of background, text, graphic
elements, etc.): Use color to make certain elements stand
out. Create a sense of drama when you contrast one color
with another. Make sure you do not use too many colors
and your color combinations are easy to read.

      Contrast in negative or white space: Sometimes, the
best way to attract a reader's attention to a contrast is
by using negative space. Negative space, or white space,
describes the space around text, images, and other elements
in a document. The absence of content draws attention to
the content itself. It makes documents of all kinds (digital
and print) more readable, more restful-looking, more
inviting to the reader, simpler, and more elegant. It is
associated with that high-end restaurant or salon menu
look.

Figure 15: Not so high-end visually, but probably still delicious.

       2. R is for Repetition: Repeat design strategies
            throughout your document to provide a sense of
            connection.The basic rule of repetition means
            that in any text, visual or textual elements that
            have similar functions should be formatted
            similarly to create continuity and show close
            relationships between the elements. For
            example, newspapers have consistent ways of
            labeling different sections, like Sports, that does
            not change on a daily basis, but there is also
            design consistency throughout so that you can
            identify the newspaper. For example, in a
130 Katrina Peterson

            standard newspaper all the column widths utilize
            consistent spacing, which increases visual
            appeal through uniformity and repetition. USA
            Today in particular is notorious for its consistent
            repeated color-coding and design.

Figure 16: Blue-and-white USA Today color coding.

      On a smaller scale, in a résumé most applicants use
bullet-pointed sections to list their job duties. Repetition
in this context means that all these bullet points should
be formatted identically: the same font, size, line spacing,
and indentation. Each group of bullet-pointed items should
be the same distance from the text above and below. The
bullet points themselves should be exactly the same shape
and size. Repetition also applies to styles like MLA or
APA. All titles are centered. All page numbers are in the
upper right-hand corner, after your last name and a single
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 131

blank character space. The same typeface is used
throughout the paper. All paragraphs have exactly one
empty line space between them. And so on.

      Repetition means that every line classified as a
headline should look like a headline, and headlines
formatted to look alike can be identified as having a similar
function in the text. The same principle applies to body
text. Fonts should not change without a reason. Lines,
logos, and other graphic/visual elements should be
formatted consistently. This repetition provides a sense of
order and continuity that makes the document more
readable and professional looking.

      Since managing the formatting of multiple elements
by hand can be difficult, many software programs provide
templates--ready-made layouts into which you can plug
your text and photos and thereby produce a variety of
documents with a consistent look and feel. Microsoft
Word, for example, also allows you to set Styles that will
keep formatting choices like size, font, and style (bold,
italic, etc.) the same for blocks of text with the same
functions (body text, headlines, bullet points,
subheadings). Templates for newsletters, résumés, and
PowerPoint presentations ensure that basic design elements
like font size/style, color, image size and alignment are
consistent from page to page. Templates provide a quick,
easy way to solve repetition issues. Look at the difference
repetition makes in even the most basic of résumés, for
example.

       3. A is for Alignment: There should be a clear,
            deliberate arrangement of items on a page.

Alignment can refer to text, as in the left-aligned body
text required in MLA style. But in document design, it
132 Katrina Peterson

means much more; it refers to how the entire document
is arranged. Most designers align all their content to some
sort of a grid or pattern, creating a distinct, intentional
arrangement of items on a page or screen. They use plenty
of white space to cushion the items, which makes higher-
contrast items pop.

Figure 17: Simple visual illustration of the alignment principle.

      In the following sample Table of Contents, not only
are the numbers misaligned, but the TOC also lacks leader
lines, which detracts from the document's professionalism
(possibly undermining the writer's credibility with
readers).
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 133

Figure 18: Table of Contents with misaligned numbers.

       4. P is for Proximity: Items that have similar
            functions or purposes should be grouped
            together.

When we work with pictures and blocks of text, think of
this: placing design or text elements next to each other in
certain ways helps readers to see the relationship among
elements. For example, photos and figures have captions
that explain their contents. Nearby images often illustrate
the content found in body text. Headlines are placed above
body text whose content and focus they describe in briefer
form.

      Proximity can be especially critical in booklets,
newsletters, and brochures, in which certain pages or
panels might be grouped together under a subheading.
Individual pages can be designed to reflect a larger
relationship with the overall theme or subject matter. For
example, the themes provided by blogging platforms like
WordPress take care of this for you--every page will have
a recognizable layout and though individual pages might be
slightly different, they will be recognizably related to the
134 Katrina Peterson

blog's main page. Web sites work the same way, as do book
chapters.

Figure 19: Example of confusing proximity.

The principle of proximity even affects white space: equal
amounts of white space and equal line spacing indicate
that items are related or should be considered as parts of a
whole.

      The PowerPoint slide above is very confusing. Why
are there three different groupings under one headline, and
why is each column grouped under a different graphic?
Note the two whales
listed in the far bottom right. They are actually types of
dolphins, but their relatively distant position (proximity)
from the others in their group makes it look as if they are
not. There are no headlines or labels here to help us group
these lists, and the design strategy is not doing readers any
favors.

      Planning and adjusting how items are grouped on a
page helps you design your text, graphics, and images so
that readers can see relationships: what goes together, what
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 135

is different, and what is similar. Relationships between
items should be clear.

Figure 20: A color's message or emotional connotation can vary
across cultures.

5.9 Cross-Cultural Audience Considerations

When creating graphics, it is very important to keep your
audience in mind. This relates not just to the content you
share, but also how that content appears on the page. Are
you aware, for instance, that the same color has different
meanings across various cultures? Take a look at the
graphic below and notice how the color red means
something very different across culture.

      Similar differences exist across cultures with other
colors, as well, so be aware that the choices you make in
136 Katrina Peterson

colors for your graphics may communicate ideas you do
not actually intend.

      Technical writers need to be aware of cultural
differences in behaviors, norms, beliefs, and values.
According to Edward T. Hall and Mildred Reed Hall, in
Understanding Cultural Differences, each culture operates
according to its own rules (1990, pp. 3-4). Hall and Hall
add that problems occur when members of one culture
apply the rules to another culture (1990, pp. 3-4). To
communicate effectively with other cultures, the technical
writer needs to not only be aware of (explicit or stated)
rules governing behaviors that can be observed, but also of
the not-so-obvious (tacit or unstated) rules. The invisible
rules of a culture dramatically impact the acceptance of
ideas, plans, and strategies. The Cultural Iceberg below
illustrates patterns of world communication, showing
indicators of Institutional Culture (the obvious behavior
of a culture), which can be clearly seen as the tip of the
iceberg, and People Culture (the norms, beliefs and values
of a culture), which cannot be seen and which may provide
barriers to successful communication. (See Chapter 2 on
audience for more information on how to revise with
differing cultural expectations in mind.)

communication.

Chapter 6: Emails, Memos, and Texting

Katrina Peterson

Chapter Synopsis

This chapter introduces the basics of email writing and
etiquette, also providing information on memos and
texting. It offers suggestions about when (and when not to!)
use email in business communication. It details the basic
conventions of structure: the header/address information,
greeting, message body, and closing. It gives an overview
of Netiquette, the expectations of online etiquette, which
has application for other genres of online communication
as well. The chapter concludes with a bulleted list of
takeaways and tips, followed by additional teaching and
learning resources.

6.1 Email Introduction

Electronic mail, or email, is among the most versatile
genres of business writing. It is used to communicate
issues ranging from serious to trivial, and its formality
level varies greatly based on context and rhetorical
situation. It may be used like text, or synchronous chat,
and recipients often choose to access email messages on
a cell phone. When composing an email, a sender must
account for the time constraints readers may face due to
high email volume. Recipients, on the other hand, should

                                     147
148 Katrina Peterson

plan to answer a business email within 24 hours, or the
general time frame that they would respond to a text.
Strong subject lines, clear formatting, and concise writing
are all characteristics of a well-written email. Emails may
also present ethical challenges as the forwarding and
carbon copy functions enable communications to be shared
with additional recipients.

      Email, texting, and microblogs are all workplace tools
that are used both internally and externally. Prior to email,
genres of business writing were more clearly differentiated
based on function: hard copy letters were sent outside the
company, and memos were directed to those inside the
company. This distinction still exists in some business
contexts, but email has largely replaced hard copy letters
in external and internal correspondence. Email can be very
useful for messages that have more content than a text
message, but conciseness remains one of its major features.
A clear structure with a greeting, message body, and
closing is also expected of this genre.

      Many businesses use automated emails to
acknowledge communications from the public, or to
remind associates that periodic reports or payments are
due. The form email is also common; in this case, a
recipient chooses from a menu of sentences to make the
wording suitable for a specific transaction. Email may be
informal in personal contexts, but business communication
requires attention to detail, awareness that an email reflects
both you and your company, and a professional tone.
Although email may have an informal feel, remember that
it needs to convey professionalism and respect. Never write
or send anything that you would not want to share publicly,
or in front of your company president.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 149

6.2 When (and When Not!) to Email

Email is a good way to communicate when:

         · You need to contact a person who is difficult to
            reach via telephone, does not come to campus
            regularly, or is located in another part of the
            country or world (for instance, someone who
            lives in a different time zone).

         · The information you want to share is not time-
            sensitive. Email is instantaneous, but it does not
            guarantee an instantaneous response. For many
            people, keeping up with their email
            correspondence is a part of their job, and they
            only do it during regular business hours. Unless
            readers have promised otherwise, assume that it
            may take a few days for them to respond.

         · You need to send someone an electronic file,
            such as a document for a course, a spreadsheet
            full of data, or a rough draft of your paper.

         · You need to distribute information quickly to
            many people (for example, a memo that needs to
            be sent to the entire office staff).

         · You need a record of the communication.
            Saving important emails can be helpful if you
            need to recall what someone said in an earlier
            message, provide proof (for example, as receipt
            for a service or product), or review the content
            of an important meeting or deadline.

         · You are unable to ask a direct question or make
            a request in person. In this case, frame your
150 Katrina Peterson

            question/request politely, being careful to avoid
            a demanding tone or the underlying assumption
            that your request will be granted.

Email is not an effective means of communication when:

         · Your message is long (i.e. could not be read in
            20 minutes or less), complicated, or requires
            additional face-to-face discussion. For example,
            if you want feedback from your supervisor, or if
            you are asking your professor a question that
            requires more than a yes/no answer, you should
            schedule a meeting instead.

         · Information is highly confidential. Email is
            NEVER private! Keep in mind that your
            message could be forwarded to other people
            without your knowledge. A backup copy of your
            email is always stored on a server where it can
            be retrieved, even when you have deleted the
            message and think it is gone forever.

         · The tone of the message could be misconstrued.
            If you would hesitate to say something to
            someone's face, do not write it in an email.

         · The information itself is emotionally charged.
            For example, if you must communicate bad
            news to someone, it is better to deliver it in
            person.

6.3 Email Structure

Professional communication requires careful attention to
the specific writing context. In addition to its language
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 151

and content, the structure of a email should also reflect
a writer's understanding of audience and purpose; a well-
crafted email helps to establish credibility with an audience
by showing awareness of the genre's conventions, or its
standard moves and expectations. The principles explained
here apply to the educational context as well as business
writing, so be sure to use them when communicating with
your instructors and classroom peers. Four elements of
structure should be considered when composing an email:
the header/address information, greeting, message body,
and closing.

Header/Address Information

As used here, header/address information refers to the
subject line and the recipient lines: To, Cc, and Bcc. Make
sure you include a clear, brief, and specific subject line.
This helps recipients to quickly grasp the essence of a
message. Email subject lines are like newspaper headlines.
They should convey the main point of your email or the
idea that you want readers to take away from it. They may
also keep the email from being diverted to a junk mail
folder, so be as specific as possible. One-word subjects
such as Hi, Question, or FYI are not informative and may
undercut the message's importance. Overly long or
rambling subjects may result in a similar problem. Instead,
consider using a subject line like Economics Proposal
Attached or Your English 110 Question. If the message is
time sensitive, it may be helpful to include a date: Meeting
on Thurs, Dec 2. Also keep in mind: just as an email's
subject line can communicate either professionalism or a
lack of it, so also does your own email address. Consider
two brief examples: jackjohnson@yahoo.com and
bigdaddy2000@gmail.com. The former address is clearly
152 Katrina Peterson

more professional, including the sender's name for easy
recall. In contrast, the latter lacks professionalism, coming
across as overly casual and informal.

      The email's recipient lines should be given careful
thought as well. In general, copying individuals on an
email is a good way to deliver your message
simultaneously to several people. In professional settings,
copying someone else on an email can help get things
done, especially if the person receiving the copy is in a
supervisory role. For example, copying your boss on an
email to a nonresponsive co-worker might prompt the co-
worker to respond. Be aware, however, that when you
send a message to more than one address using the Cc:
(or carbon copy) field, both the original recipient and all
the recipients of the carbon copy can see all the email
addresses in the To: and Cc: fields. Each person receiving
the message will be able to see the addresses of everyone
else. Also, while carbon copying supervisors on an email
may prompt immediate action from the original recipient,
this option may raise important ethical and/or rhetorical
considerations. If injudiciously used, it may have the
appearance of manipulating recipient(s).

      Blind carbon copying (Bcc-ing) emails to a group of
people can be useful when you do not want everyone on the
list to see each other's email addresses. The only address
that will be visible to all recipients is the one in the To:
field. If you prefer not to show any of the listed email
addresses, you can put your own address in the To: field
and use Bcc: for recipients' addresses.

      Based on previous discussion, you may be wondering,
"In what situations would the Cc: and Bcc: functions be
helpful and appropriate to use?" As a student and a
professional you will work collaboratively at some
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 153

point--for example, on a class project--and need to ask a
question of a supervisor or professor, perhaps at the request
of group members. You would of course have the option to
email the inquiry directly, later sending the response you
receive to your group. However, you might also choose to
include classmates in the Cc: line of the original email:
1) to keep them in the loop and confirm that you have
followed through on their request, 2) to provide the
professor with the option of hitting Reply All in order to
inform the group directly, and 3) to preclude the need for a
separate email if/when the professor responds to the group
as a whole. If you do include others in the Cc:, however,
you will may want to draw attention to that fact in your
email, so that the respondent does not overlook the carbon
copied individuals due to high email volume.

      The previous information gives a sense of just how
useful carbon copying can be--it may offer a means of
cutting out an extra step in the communication process,
while keeping others informed. However, the Bcc: may be
trickier to determine when to use, due to the blind aspect
of its communication. As noted, it may be a good option
if you wish to deliver information to additional recipients
while obscuring their email addresses. Perhaps you did not
obtain permission to share their email information with
others, but you had offered to send them the information
as well. In such an instance, the Bcc: will enable you to
be respectful of their privacy, while avoiding sending a
separate email.

      In other instances, you may be called upon to make
a more difficult decision, for example, when working with
a challenging co-worker. Perhaps this co-worker has a
history of unwise decision-making, like violating company
policy or not following through on required procedures. If
your supervisors are aware of the situation, they may ask
154 Katrina Peterson

that you keep them updated on developments as a form
of documentation. As part of your job, you might have
to remind the individual of a company procedure that has
not been followed. Your supervisor may want to know
that the individual has been informed of the policy, and
you may simultaneously wish to avoid fallout with a co-
worker who could misunderstand the supervisors' request
for information. Including your supervisors in the Bcc:
would be one way to make them aware of the steps you
have taken to address a situation or fulfill the duties of your
job position.

      When drafting a message with sensitive content, you
might consider waiting to enter recipients' email addresses
to ensure that the email is not sent until after you have
edited the document; after all, send is only one click away.
The same holds true for the Cc: and Bcc: lines, which raises
another important consideration. The instantaneous aspect
of email communication can be both blessing and curse.
No writer wants to send an email inadvertently, and yet
many senders make the mistake of emailing a quick reply
when strong emotions have the upper hand. Especially
when an individual is on the receiving end of an angry
email, anger may seem like the appropriate response.
However, such a step is unprofessional and may have
serious ramifications. Avoid flame wars. When tempted to
send an emotional response, always wait; instead, consider
holding off until the message can be phrased in a more
objective, professional manner.

Greeting

When first initiating contact by email, open with an
appropriate greeting or salutation. Avoid simply starting
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 155

with the message body and be sure to include a polite
signature. Proper greetings and closings demonstrate
respect, also helping to avoid mix-ups in case a message
is sent to the wrong recipient. For example, you might
consider using a greeting like Dear Ms. X (formal, for
someone external to the company) or Hi Barry (informal,
for someone you know well). Unless someone has
expressed an individual preference, never use the title Mrs.
as you cannot assume a woman is married.

      If the gender of a person is not evident, use the entire
name, like this: Dear Sam Jones. If you do not know the
person well, it may be confusing to identify an appropriate
greeting (What do I call my TA/professor?) or closing
(From? Sincerely?). When in doubt, address recipients
more formally to avoid offending them. Some common
ways to address readers are: Dear Professor Smith, Hello
Ms. McMahon, or Hi Mary Jane. If a person's name is
not available, or if the email addresses a diverse group,
try something both generic and polite: To whom it may
concern, Dear members of the selection committee, or
Hello everyone.

Message Body

When writing an email, here are some tips to ensure that
the message is clear and accessible. In general, avoid using
all caps since it may have the appearance of yelling.
Emojis, though helpful in informal communications like
texting with friends, may also be perceived as
unprofessional in business contexts. Use bolding,
underlining, and italics as needed to increase clarity, but
be careful not to overload readers with too much at once.
Bullet points may be helpful for sharing listed information,
156 Katrina Peterson

while included links may permit recipients to access
information quickly. Double-check these links before
sending, however, to ensure that they work.

      State your purpose for writing directly at the email's
beginning to provide a context for your message.
Reference any included attachments up front as well, so
that readers are aware of the additional content and its
purpose; in your email state the name of the file, along
with the type of document and program needed to open it,
for example: "Please see the attached Word document of
my essay, The Many Facets of Richard III." In the case of
an included question, cut and paste any relevant text (for
example, computer error messages, assignment prompts,
segments of a previous message, etc.) into the email so
that the reader has a frame of reference from which to
answer. When replying to someone else's email, it may be
helpful to either include or restate the sender's message.
Conversely, if you are emailing back and forth with the
same person, you might delete the previous messages to
avoid clutter and make communication more direct.

      Use paragraphs to separate thoughts (or consider
writing separate emails if you have many unrelated points
or questions), and state the desired outcome at the end of
your message. When requesting a response, let the reader
know what type of response you require (for example,
an email reply, possible meeting times, a recommendation
letter, etc.). If you request something that has a due date,
be sure to place the due date in a prominent position in
your email. Ending your email with the next step may be
helpful in work settings (for example, you might write "I
will follow this email up with a phone call this week" or
"Let's discuss this further at the Wednesday meeting").
         Technical and Professional Writing Genres 157

Closing

An email's closing is extremely important because it
identifies the sender and provides contact information.
Always include your full name at the end of your email.
In an educational context, keep in mind that your professor
may be teaching multiple students with the same name, or
multiple sections of many students, so including your class/
section number along with first and last name is a good
idea. When closing, end with something brief but friendly:
Thank you, Best wishes, See you tomorrow, or Regards.
For a very formal message, such as a job application, use
the kind of closing that you might see in a business letter:
Sincerely, or Respectfully yours. If you do not know the
reader well, you might also consider including your title
and the organization you belong to, for example:

      Mary Watkins
Senior Research Associate
or
Bain and Company
or
Joseph Smith
UNC-CH, Class of 2009

6.4 Netiquette

Netiquette refers to etiquette on the net, or protocols and
norms for online communication. These general guidelines
apply to most forms of electronic communication,
including email. We may send or post messages, create
personal pages, and interact via online technologies as a
normal part of our careers, but how we conduct ourselves
158 Katrina Peterson

will leave a lasting image. The photograph you posted
on your Facebook page or Twitter feed may be seen by
a potential employer, or a nasty remark in a post may
come back to haunt you later. Since the days when the
Internet was a new phenomenon, Virginia Shea and others
have sought to establish ground rules like the following for
online contexts:

         · Remember the human on the other side.

         · Make an effort to forgive mistakes.

         · Avoid assumptions about your readers.

         · Ask for clarification and delay judgment.

         · Consider possible cultural differences.

         · Check your tone before you publish.

         · Think of the text as permanent.

         · Be aware that jokes and sarcasm may be
            misunderstood.

         · Establish ground rules when working
            collaboratively.

         · Respect original ideas by quoting correctly and
            asking permission.

         · Research your organization's Acceptable Use
            Policy.

         · Respect people's privacy.

         · Do not abuse your power.

         · Keep flame wars under control.

         · Know where you are in cyberspace.

         · Respect others' time and bandwidth.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 159

         · Create a positive online image.

         · Share expert knowledge.

Basically, you should adhere to the same polite standards
of behavior online that you follow in real life. Such rules
remind us that the golden rule (treat others as you would
like to be treated) is relevant in any human interaction.
Because basic social conventions for writing and
responding to email are continually in flux,
miscommunication can easily occur when people have
different expectations about the communications that they
send and receive.

6.5 Takeaways and Tips

         · Electronic mail, or email, is among the most
            versatile genres of business writing.

         · Email has largely replaced hard copy letters in
            external and internal correspondence.

         · Context and the conventions of genre help to
            determine when/when not to use email.

         · A clear structure (header/address information,
            greeting, body, and closing) is expected.

         · Netiquette matters--remember the golden rule
            in all communications.

         · Always proofread for tone, spelling, grammar,
            and content before hitting send.

         · When possible, respond to an email within 24
            hours, but account for possible delays in
            response from others.
160 Katrina Peterson

         · Be aware of the uses and ethics associated with
            Reply All and Carbon Copy functions.

         · Avoid using all caps; use formatting like
            underlining and bolding to make reading easier.

         · Test links before sending, to ensure they work
            properly.

         · Follow up politely when necessary to ensure
            that the information was received.

         · Always remember that electronic
            communications are not private.

6.7 Sample Activities

Use what you have just learned to explain why Student 2's
email to Professor Jones is more effective than the email
written by Student 1. How does the tone of the messages
differ? What makes Student 2's email look and sound more
appropriate? What are the elements that contribute its
clarity? If you were Professor Jones and you received both
emails, how would you respond to each one?

      Email from Student 1:

             hey,
             i need help on my paper can i come by your
       office tomorrow
162 Katrina Peterson

             thx

      Email from Student 2:

             Hi Dr. Jones
             I am in your ENGL 101 class on Thursdays,
       and I have a question about the paper that is due
       next Tuesday. I'm not sure that I understand what is
       meant by the following sentence in the prompt:
       "Write a 10 page paper arguing for or against
       requiring ENGL 101 for all UNC freshmen and
       provide adequate support for your point of view." I
       am not sure what you would
       consider adequate support. Would using 3 sources
       be o.k.? Can I come by your office tomorrow at
       2:00 pm to talk to you about my questions? Please
       let me know if that fits your schedule. If not, I could
       also come by on Friday after 1:00.
             Thank you,
             Tim Smith

      Here are two versions of an email from a supervisor,

       to discuss the status of all of our current projects.
       Donuts will be provided. Be sure to arrive on time
       and bring along the materials you have been
       working on this week--bring enough copies for
       everyone. Some of these material might include
       your calendars, reports, and any important emails
       you have sent. Also, I wanted to remind you that
       your parking permit requests are due later this week;
       you should turn those in to Ms. Jones, and if she is
       not at her desk when you stop by, you can email
       them to her.

6.9 Memo Introduction

A memo--or memorandum, meaning reminder--is used
for communicating policies, procedures, or related official
business. It is less versatile than the typical email in
audience and formality level; its recipients usually consist
of individuals within rather than outside of an organization,
and it rarely adopts an informal tone. It tends to be written
from a one-to-all perspective (like mass communication),
broadcasting a message to multiple recipients, rather than a
single individual. A memo must be concise, well organized
(following the guidelines given in the next section), and
addressed to specific audiences with standard subject lines.

      Memos are a place for just the facts, and should have
an objective tone without personal bias, preference, or
168 Katrina Peterson

interest on display. The successful operation of a company
may depend on memos--possibly even memos that are
sent via email--for communication between the employees
of the company. Types of memos include: inquiries,
recommendations, problem-solution, etc. The memo's
message is direct and follows a preset format for easy
access to information. While it may contain a request for
feedback, the memo is linear, from the organization to the
employees, or from one employee to another. It may be
used to update a team on activities for a given project, or
to inform a specific group within a company of an event,
action, or observance. The memo as a genre may have
legal standing, as it often reflects policies or procedures; it
may reference an existing or new policy in the employee
manual, for example.

      All organizations have both informal and formal
communication networks. One effective way to address
informal, unofficial speculation involves sending a memo
that clearly states what the status of a specific issue. If
budget cuts are a concern, then it may be wise to send a
memo explaining imminent changes. A memo's primary
purpose is informational in nature, but it occasionally
includes an element of persuasion or a call to action. This
call to action does not often require personal spending, but
it does represent the organization's interests. Memos may
also include statements that align business and employee
interest, thereby underscoring common ground and benefit.
For example, on February 13, 2009, upper management
at the Panasonic Corporation issued a declaration that all
employees should buy at least $1,600 worth of Panasonic
products. The company president noted that if everyone
supported the company with purchases, it would benefit all.
             Technical and Professional Writing Genres 169

Memo Format

A memo includes a header or heading block, an
introduction, a body, and a conclusion. The header
identifies the recipient (To:), the sender (From:), the date
(Date:), and the subject of the message (Re: or Subject:).
Similarly to the email, the memo's subject is declared in
the subject line and should be clear and concise (Oregon
20). If the memo announces the observance of a holiday,
for example, the holiday should be named in the subject
line--for example, use Thanksgiving Weekend Schedule
rather than Holiday Observance. Again, as with the email,
pay particular attention to the title of the individual(s) in
this section to ensure accuracy and communicate respect.

      The order of the parts of the memo heading block and
location of specific part of the block varies, according to
different companies' expectations. However, the message
body itself has three parts, as noted. The introduction
references background information and informs the
purpose of the message. The body, consisting of one simple
paragraph or multiple paragraphs, communicates the
message. The conclusion expresses the action expected
of the recipient. The conclusion could consist of one
paragraph or several, or it could be simple sentence that
asks for the recipient to contact the sender if there are
questions.

Sample Memo

The following memo illustrates the format explained
above.

6.10 Business Texting

Whatever digital device you use, written communication
in the form of brief messages, or texts, is becoming a
common way to connect in the business world. It is useful
for short exchanges, when talking on the phone would be
cumbersome. Texting is not useful for long or complicated
messages, and careful consideration should be given to the
audience. It can be a great tool for connecting while on the
go, but consider your company, and choose words, terms,
or abbreviations that will deliver your message clearly.
Here are some useful tips for texting within a business
context:

         · Know your recipient: "? % dsct" may be a clear
            way to ask a close associate what discount to
            offer a certain customer, but if you are writing a
                  Technical and Professional Writing Genres 171

   text to your boss, it might be wiser to write,
   "What % discount does Murray get on $1K
   order?"

· Anticipate unintentional misinterpretation.
   Texting often uses symbols and codes to
   represent thoughts, ideas, and emotions. Given
   the complexity of communication, and the
   useful but limited tool of texting, keep in mind
   its limitations. Also be wary of using text speak
   like lol and fyi that might be considered overly
   informal.

· Be aware that contacting someone too
   frequently can border on harassment. Texting is
   a tool. Use it when appropriate.

· Unplug yourself occasionally. Do you feel lost
   or out of it if you do not have your cell phone
   and cannot connect to people, even for fifteen
   minutes? Sometimes being unavailable for a
   time can be healthy--everything in moderation,
   including texting.

· Never text and drive. Research shows that the
   likelihood of an accident increases dramatically
   if the driver is texting behind the wheel. Being
   in an accident while conducting company
   business would not only endanger your own
   health; it would reflect poorly on your employer
   and on your own judgment.

Chapter 7: Applying to Jobs

Katrina Peterson

Chapter Synopsis

Looking for and landing the perfect job may seem like a
daunting task. If you are uncertain where to start, know that
most successful job applicants feel the same uncertainty
at some point. This chapter will walk you through the
process of applying for jobs from start to finish. Perhaps
most importantly, it will provide you with two distinct tools
that can help you to construct the materials for a strong,
effective, and successful job application: 1) the résumé
and 2) the job application letter. Résumés and application
letters are among the most important documents in the
employment process. Beginning with an overview of the
big-picture process, this chapter moves forward with
suggested methods for finding job ads and constructing the
genre documents for a job packet. In the résumé section, it
discusses the following topics: Purposes and Goals, Types
of Résumés, Sample Résumés, Drafting and Design: Where
to Start, What to Include/Exclude, Optional Sections, and
Drafting Activities and Resources. The next section on
application letters will share information about deciphering
the job description, as well as letter format, structure, and
content. The chapter concludes with information on
interviews, followed by specific guidelines for the job
packet.

7.1 Introduction

Job seeking is a process that involves multiple steps in
order to obtain the desired position. Besides the résumé and
the job letter, job descriptions, interview questions, writing
samples, hiring materials, and the thank-you note sent post-
interview are other materials you might find yourself
reading and writing as your hiring process moves forward.
If the big-picture job seeking process were visualized
through a flow chart, it might look something like the
following:
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 175

Figure 1: Flow chart that illustrates the job-seeking process.

Most job candidates begin with research to gain a clear
picture of their target (see Step #1 above), or ideal job,
176 Katrina Peterson

along with the company where they would like to be
employed. From there, they may think in terms of creating
a compelling marketing campaign (Step #2) through a
unified job packet. Research (Step #3), of course, will
occur throughout this process, all the way up until the
interview (Step #4) and through the final stages of
negotiating and closing the offer (Step #5). While this
graphic helps to visualize both the big picture and some
of the individual steps involved, it is only one of many
variations of the job application process. This chapter will
provide a framework for you to construct your own process
(citation clarification: paragraph based on Bay's above
graphic and terminology, though written by me). As you
research and pursue job choices, keep in mind that the
job search process requires a high degree of self-
awareness--not only of strengths, but also of weaknesses.
In general, most people find it easier to identify and discuss
their strengths. However, knowing your weaknesses is just
as important to your job search as knowing your strengths.
Here are a few reasons to be able to speak fluidly and
confidently about weaknesses:

         · Employers want to hire individuals who are self-
            aware, which requires an awareness of both
            strengths and weaknesses. Being self-aware is
            the only way to improve.

         · During an interview, a prospective employer
            may ask about strengths and weaknesses.
            Employers know it takes a certain level of
            maturity to talk about your weaknesses. They
            want to ensure you have achieved that level of
            maturity before extending an offer.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 177

      Remember that everyone has strengths and everyone
has weaknesses, including every CEO, every president,
every manager, and every one of your coworkers. You
will be in good company when considering and discussing
your weaknesses. The trick, if there is a trick, to your
weaknesses lies in your plan to strengthen them. Having a
plan to strengthen a weakness is impressive, especially if
you have already taken steps to do so.

7.2 Finding Job Openings

Investing the preparation time to write your employment
materials, including researching available positions, can
save you many headaches in the job process. Finding a
suitable opening itself can be time-consuming; if you are
serious about finding employment, you have to dedicate
the time and energy to make your materials competitive.
Here are some resources to get you started:

         · Job boards: Browse sites like Indeed,
            CareerBuilder, Glassdoor and Monster to search
            for jobs in your field.

         · Specialty job lists: Look for lists of jobs in
            specific industries such as food service
            (Poached), nonprofits (Idealist), or media
            (MediaBistro).

         · Company, organization and government web
            sites: Visit the employment section on websites
            of companies you admire; search federal, state,
            county, and city websites for government job
            postings.
178 Katrina Peterson

         · Your own network: Talk to friends, past
            employers, and professors or visit LinkedIn to
            search for openings at companies in your
            network. If you are a member of any social
            media groups that are career-oriented, check for
            mention of available jobs there.

         · Your college: Visit your college or university
            placement office/career center and attend job
            fairs hosted at your college.

         · Craigslist: Many job seekers also use Craigslist
            to look for work; just be aware that Craigslist
            postings often lack detail and may come from
            headhunters or placement agencies, rather than
            from the direct employer. Scams have also been
            reported on Craigslist job boards, so verify the
            legitimacy of any posting before providing
            personal details.

Once you have found a job, be sure to print and/or save
a copy of the job posting or job description. You will use
this document to help you tailor your application materials.
Companies often delete the job posting once they have
received sufficient applicants, so it is important that you
save your own copy of the document, along with the date
and location you found it (this information is often
referenced in the job letter); you might also copy and paste
the text into a new document, or bookmark the webpage.

7.3 Constructing Modular Materials

It probably sounds like a lot of work to create a new
set of employment materials for every job opening you
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 179

will identify. While it is true that it takes time and effort
to customize application materials for each new job
application, you do not have to create a new résumé and
cover letter for every job opening. Instead, you can create
modular materials with moving parts that can be adapted
and reorganized for each job.

      For example, if you are a nursing student wanting
to work in a different (or indirectly related) field during
school, you might consider applying to be an
administrative assistant, a medical translator, or a biology
tutor. Several different résumé formats are available to you.
However, you may choose the functional (skills) résumé
format to place more emphasis on a specific set of current
qualifications and slightly less emphasis on your education
or work experience; you might create three different
templates of your résumé that emphasize and expand upon
different skill categories: administrative, communication,
and educational.

      The same holds true with the application letter. Once
you have a letter draft, you can work with it as a template
for numerous other jobs, keeping the overall format but
revising some key sentences. It is quite likely that the final
paragraph of your cover letters will change very little if you
are applying to multiple jobs within the same career field
or industry. The central paragraphs, on the other hand, may
undergo substantial revision, depending on how different
one potential job is from another. Just make sure to change
the name of the potential employer and company for each
application; addressing a potential employer by the wrong
name is the surest way to remove your materials from
consideration.

7.4 Crafting Résumés

The purpose of a résumé is twofold: first, to serve as an
overview or quick summary of your skills, experience, and
education as they relate to your career objective; secondly,
to function as a marketing tool that conveys your personal
brand. All of us want our résumés to stand out from the
stack. The best way to create an eye-catching résumé is not
through gimmicks or flash, but rather through substance
and customization. As a marketing document that sells
your candidacy, your résumé should have a format that is
pleasing to read, efficient in its use of the English language,
and very concise. Once you have several years of
experience, it is acceptable to have a two-page résumé;
the average résumé is now two pages in length, although
résumés may range from one to three pages. You should
aim for a full page as you are building experience and
generating content.

      Regardless of your starting point--whether you are
unsure you can fill a two-page résumé, or whether you
think it will be difficult to fill a single page--this chapter
will help you accomplish your goal: designing an
exceptional résumé. Remember, as the most critical
component of a marketing campaign in which you
advertise your professional self, your résumé must be clear,
concise, and error free. Most seasoned recruiters scan a
résumé in about seven to twenty seconds; because they
have many documents to review, they look for reasons to
reduce the number of résumés that demand a second look.
This means that a single error can be all that is needed
to discard your résumé and your candidacy. However,
recruiters also have an eye for key details, so they will
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 181

quickly recognize a well-constructed résumé and discard
one that is poorly designed.

      While writing your résumé, it is important that you
keep in mind not only its purpose, but also its general
goals, which include the following:

         · To make an exceptional first impression. Your
            résumé will likely be the first impression a
            potential employer has of you and your
            qualifications, so it must hold attention long
            enough to propel your job search forward.

         · To quantify strengths, responsibilities,
            abilities, and accomplishments. Mentioning
            factual, numerical examples of praiseworthy
            attributes and skills will allow you to boast
            without sounding boastful

                      For example, if you reduced errors by
                        35% and increased profits by 55%.

                      If you have been a student teacher
                        with 35 students and student grades
                        improved by 25%.

                      If you are part of a marketing team
                        that has increased new patient
                        accounts by 10% last

                      If you worked in the school library
                        and the number of lost books has
                        declined by 50%.

         · To argue, in an articulate and polite way, that
            you are well suited for the job. Based on the
            content of the job ad, you will want to address
182 Katrina Peterson

            how your education and/or work experiences
            (including internships and volunteer work) have
            taught you both technical and "soft" skills that
            will help you perform the listed job duties.

         · To represent you when you are not there.
            Your résumé can be uploaded to onlineglobal
            job boards like Monster and CareerBuilder. It
            can be sent to a company's online database with
            a push of a button, where it will be shared with
            dozens of recruiters and hiring managers.

         · To obtain an interview and create talking
            points. Listing your accomplishments and
            quantifying them can create talking points for
            future interviews. For example, perhaps you
            bullet point the following: Responsible for
            intake and outtake of approximately 1,000
            books daily, resulting in 80% fewer lost books
            this year. During an interview, with this example
            in mind, you can easily talk about using
            technology to improve processes. You can
            discuss the team environment of the library staff
            and how you worked toward decreasing the
            number of lost books.

         · To show your command of the written word.
            You do not have to be an English major to make
            sure that your résumé is well-written. Your
            professors, teachers, peers, and family members
            may be willing to help by answering questions
            based on their expertise, or even reviewing a
            résumé draft.

Overall, highlighting specific results in each résumé
category will increase your chances of getting your résumé
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 183

noticed. Unlike financial investments, past performance is
an indicator of future success: include details about your
past performance and quantify your accomplishments
whenever possible, and future employers will be inclined
to believe you can do the same for them. What exactly do
you do, or what have you done in the past? Your résumé
should answer this question very quickly. The more you
quantify your accomplishments using specific details, the
more your abilities will be understood.

      For example, stating that you "worked in sales" on
your résumé does not provide specific proof of your
skills--and therefore is not likely to be as impressive--as
a statement that quantifies your experiences and provides
unique details. Stronger examples of résumé statements
might include: "completed an average of 65 customer
transactions per hour, setting a company record for the
2019 fiscal year" or "managed national and international
supplier accounts with purchase ranges from $1,000 to
$10,000,000 USD."

Types of Résumés

Just as work histories come in a variety of forms, so also
do résumés. Although career experts debate which style is
the best, you must decide which fits your current situation.
There are many reasons to choose one format over another.
The chronological résumé is the most common résumé
format. It is best for candidates with a long/uninterrupted
work history, in fields where the company worked for is
of paramount importance. It is also well suited for those
applicants who want to highlight their education, as many
jobs will ask for a degree (e.g. BA, JD, MBA, MA, MD,
PhD, etc.) in a certain field as a minimum requirement. In
contrast, the functional (or skills) résumé serves candidates
184 Katrina Peterson

who are transitioning between fields, who are shifting from
a military to a civilian career, or who have gained skills
in a variety of different settings (workplace, academic,
volunteer). The following information offers an overview
of these two best-known formats. Visual examples are
given in the section afterwards, followed by suggestions
on where to begin a résumé draft or how to develop your
current draft further.

       1. The chronological résumé is a traditional
            format whose principal section is the
            Employment Experience section. In this section,
            jobs are listed in reverse chronological order
            (starting with the most recent positions/schools
            and working backward), and achievements/skills
            are detailed underneath each position. The
            chronological résumé presents experience under
            headings by job title, company, location, and
            dates of employment. Education is another
            common category that, like all sections on a
            résumé, is also in reverse chronological order.
            While the chronological résumé dedicates the
            majority of its space to providing relevant
            details from previous work experience, the
            education section is often placed above the work
            section.

       2. In contrast, the functional (skills) résumé,
            centers around well-developed Skills &
            Achievements section, in which skills are
            organized into categories. The functional résumé
            still includes an Employment Experience section
            and likely an Education section, but these
            sections are streamlined to include only the
            basic information about each position held or
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 185

            each school attended. The functional résumé
            focuses on skills and experience, rather than on
            chronological work history. It describes
            responsibilities, accomplishments, and
            quantifiable achievements under categories in
            the skills section. The functional résumé
            typically opens with a brief summary/profile
            detailing strengths (one to three sentences) and
            demonstrates how you match the requirements
            of your potential job by including relevant
            achievements and accomplishments.

      It is worth noting that, especially in the case of
advanced positions, many recruiters expect to see a
chronological résumé with traditional sections like
employment and education. In most cases, it is best to
give recruiters the résumé they expect. However, both the
college student and the more experienced candidate may
choose a functional résumé for these reasons:

         · To highlight skills and achievements rather than
            past employment/companies.

         · To minimize a less-than-extensive work
            experience history.

         · To emphasize other achievements, honors, and
            abilities.

         · To de-emphasize gaps in employment or career
            mobility.

         · To include categories like communication,
            teamwork, and leadership skills, as well as
            volunteer experience or athletic achievements.

Drafting and Design: Where to Start
Concerned about where to begin when drafting your
résumé? Here are a few general guidelines and tips. Based
on your qualifications, goals, and job ad, first use the
information from the previous section to choose from the
two major résumé types. You might consider using a
template as a helpful starting point. However, if you do
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 189

use a common template to help with layout and section
format, be sure to modify it in some way so it does not look
identical to another candidate's résumé. As you modify
your chosen résumé type and template, keep in mind the
following information on basic design features and
conventions.

Design Conventions

         · Use tables to align sections, then hide the
            borders to create a neat presentation.

         · Choose a standard ten-to-twelve-point font such
            as Times New Roman.

         · Use the same font in your résumé and your
            cover letter to create coherence.

         · Choose a font that looks serious and
            professional and is easy to read.

         · When describing work experience (and possibly
            education), include bullet points. Start your
            bullet with an action verb describing a skill or
            achievement. Follow it with the details of that
            skill or achievement, and then describe the
            positive impact of your achievement. For
            example: Developed (VERB) new paper flow
            procedure (DETAILS), resulting in reduced staff
            errors and customer wait times (RESULT);
            Provided (VERB) friendly customer-focused
            service (DETAILS) leading to a 15%
            improvement in customer satisfaction and
            loyalty (RESULT).

         · Avoid relying on graphics or ornate design
            feature. Too many design features may make the
190 Katrina Peterson

            résumé look busy.

         · Be strategic and consistent in your use of
            capitalization, bold, italics, punctuation, and
            underlining.

         · Place more space between sections than within a
            section to create visual groupings of
            information. This way your reader will be able
            to easily distinguish between the key sections of
            your résumé, and between the items in each
            section.

         · Write in sentence fragments that begin with
            active verbs and leave out sentences' subjects.
            Example: "I eliminated the duplication of
            paperwork in my department by streamlining
            procedures" would become "Eliminated
            paperwork duplication in a struggling
            department by streamlining procedures."

         · Place your name at the top of the résumé to
            make it obvious to readers that you are the
            subject of each verb.

         · Learn about field-specific conventions. The
            conventions in your field or industry will affect
            your choices in writing your résumé. Length,
            formality, design, delivery method, and key
            terms are just some of the factors that may vary
            across disciplines. Ask faculty or professional
            contacts in your field about employers'
            expectations, visit your school's career center, or
            conduct web research to make informed field-
            specific choices.

         · Quantify your skills and achievements, as
            explained previously. This means including
                  Technical and Professional Writing Genres 191

   references to technologies and equipment you
   have used; types of documents you have
   produced; procedures you have followed;
   languages you speak; technical languages you
   know; types of clients you have worked with
   (demographic information that might be relevant
   in your new workplace); and so on.

· Avoid filler words, or fluff that does not show
   meaningful skills. Filler words include: team
   player, results-oriented, fast-paced, and self-
   motivated. If you MUST use these phrases, find
   concrete examples to back them up. For
   example, instead of using team player, include a
   time you "collaborated with peers to save the
   company over $500/month on delivery
   methods" or "co-managed a team of six to
   interview/hire vendors for annual company
   picnic."

· Use key terms gathered in your pre-writing,
   preparation phase (from the job description and
   research into your field). If your potential
   employer is using a résumé-scanning program,
   these key terms may make the difference
   between getting an interview or a rejection.

· Make sure your résumé is completely error free.
   Proofread your résumé several times, use spell
   check, and ask an exceptional proofreader to
   review it. Always assume that an error lurks
   somewhere in your résumé and review it until
   you find that error!
192 Katrina Peterson

What to Include and Exclude

Despite variations in résumé type, formatting, and design,
there are understood rules of thumb on what to include
and exclude. Here are a few general guidelines on what
to exclude. For example, high schools, no matter how
prestigious, should not be included in a résumé. Also avoid
including sections with titles like Hobbies or Other, with
interests that may seem irrelevant to the position: golfing
for business jobs, video game play for software design
jobs, and blogging for PR jobs have little direct bearing on
your professional training.

      In a North American context, never include
information like height, weight, or marital status, as this
information is unrelated to your qualifications and might
become a source of discrimination. Similarly, although you
may have seen résumé samples that include a picture (this
may be common in some cultural contexts), it is non-
standard and strongly discouraged in the United States to
include a photo with the job packet. It may also be a good
idea to be appraised of your legal rights when working
through the job process, from application to interview. To
become more aware of protections guaranteed by federal
law, you may want to review a resource like the following,
published by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Permission: https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/qanda.html.

      Now that you know what to exclude, what
information should you include in a résumé? As their
foundation, most résumés integrate three sections or types
of information: the résumé header with contact
information, education section, and work experience.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 193

Résumé Headers

First of all, your Résumé Header should include four items:
full name, address, email address, phone number, and
possibly your professional website or Linkedin page. If
your first name is difficult to pronounce, you could include
your nickname in quotation marks or parentheses (e.g.,
Xioang "Angie" Kim or Massimo "Mass" Rapini). Names
are typically bolded and centered on the page, but aligning
your name to the right or left is also appropriate, depending
on the template or style you have chosen. You may include
your school address or your permanent home address, or
both. Most recruiters prefer both because, at times, they
may need to send information to both addresses at different
times of the year.

      As noted in the chapter on email etiquette, it is
important to choose a professional e-mail address because
employers frown upon addresses such as
greeneyes2@gmail.com or runningguy62@verizon.net.

      Instead, consider using your first name and your last
name in a simple email format. If you continue your job
search after graduation, you might not be permitted to
use your school email address, nor should you once you
have graduated. Include only one phone number on your
résumé and record a professional voicemail in case the
employer calls. Do not play music on your voicemail. If
in a loud area, do not answer your cell phone, especially
when you do not recognize the number. Allow the call to
go to voicemail, listen to it in a quiet place, and return the
call as soon as possible. A professional voicemail might
sound like the following: "You've reached John Smith at
555.555.5555. Please leave a message and I will call you
back as soon as possible." Be sure to check your voicemail
on a regular basis.
194 Katrina Peterson

Figure 4: Resume header with contact information, both a school
address and a permanent address.

Education Section
Secondly, the Education Section will likely appear before
your experience section. Once you are a working
professional, you may choose to flip these two sections, in
order to emphasize the information that is more important
to a particular employer, or to follow the conventions in
your field. Within the education section, it is standard to
include your GPA, typically if it is 3.0 or better, along with
your expected graduation date, major(s), and minor(s). You
may include your overall GPA, or you may decide to list
the GPA of your major. Certain industries are more
concerned with GPA than others, including consulting,
investment banking, and trading, which can require a 3.6 or
3.7 and above.

      Be sure to research each industry to familiarize
yourself with such requirements. If you attended only one
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 195

college, only that college should be listed in this section.
If you transferred from another college, you should list
both schools in this section. The first school you list is
the current school you attend, followed by the previous
school. If you attend graduate school, law school, and so
forth, your postgraduate institution would be listed first.
You also have the option of including relevant courses that
prepared you for the job you are seeking and any special
accomplishments related to school--like projects, offices
held, service, and awards or scholarships. If you have many
of the latter, you might alternatively consider placing them
in their own section marked Honors.

attended.
196 Katrina Peterson

Figure 6: Resume header followed by contact information, an
objective statement, and education.

Employment Section
Thirdly, the Employment Section should highlight most
the most relevant jobs you have held and downplay less
significant experience. This section is arguably the most
important of your résumé because recruiters often look
for past work experience as a predictor of future work
experience. The conventional method of listing your work
experience is in reverse chronological order (as with your
education section). List your most recent job experience
first and include the following information:

         · The name of the company.
         · The city and state and, when outside the United

            States, the country.
         · The years of employment. (If you have had
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 197

            several jobs at one company, include the overall
            years of experience; for separate jobs, note
            specific years of experience.)

         · Three to seven bullet points describing your
            responsibilities and the results of your work,
            depending on years of experience.

As noted in the section on design, you should use bullet
points as a means of clearly and succinctly listing your
responsibilities and achievements.

Optional Sections

In addition to contact information, education, and work
experience, you may be wondering what other sections to
include while developing résumé. Your options are many,
but here are a few additional ideas.

         · Objective Statement: This statement is
            increasingly controversial--some sources will
            recommend that you include an objective
            statement, while others will warn strongly
            against it. Proponents will tell you that recruiters
            appreciate clarity, and an objective can help a
            recruiter understand exactly what you offer or
            what business would best suit your background.
            Naysayers argue that the résumé is meant to be
            scanned in a matter of minutes and the objective
            statement only slows this process down with
            details that will likely be explored in the cover
            letter. If included, objective statements should
            be very targeted and mention a specific position.
            Whatever objective you choose, it should be
198 Katrina Peterson

            highly specific in stating what you are looking
            for and what you have to contribute. It should
            also be you-centered, showing what you can do
            for the company in no more than two sentences.

Figure 7: Resume header with contact information followed by an
objective statement.

      If you are unsure about including an objective
statement, or if it would be too vague and general, it is best
to omit it altogether.

      Here are a few examples of possible objective
statements:

                      An entry-level accounting position in
                        auditing, allowing me to use my
                        analytical and detail orientation to
                        ensure accuracy in all reports and
                        reviews.

                      A communications internship at a top
                        media company that will allow me to
                        use my knowledge and experience to
                        produce and edit clear and effective
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 199

                        communications.

                      An entry-level position in the
                        healthcare industry, enabling me to
                        use my business and communications
                        skills to enhance a company's bottom
                        line.

Consider the above examples to be a general starting point.
In writing your objective statement, you would want to
use the specific job title as it is given in the job ad or
on the company website (with proper capitalization), and
you would likely want to state the company name as well.
This shows your focused intention to apply for a specific
job position at a specific company, rather than producing a
one-size-fits-all résumé that lacks focus.

         · Skills and Additional Information: This
            section of your résumé includes, but is not
            limited to, the following information.

                      Computer Skills: Most employers
                        expect Microsoft Word, Excel, and
                        PowerPoint, but include additional
                        software knowledge (e.g.,
                        Dreamweaver).

                      Language Skills: Include your honest
                        level of fluency (e.g., Spanish, fluent,
                        French, beginner).

                      Study Abroad: Include the name of
                        the university, the city and country,
                        and the coursework.

                      Community Service: Include any
                        volunteer work, such as park cleanups,
200 Katrina Peterson

                        walk-a-thons for various causes, or
                        fundraising events of any kind. Be
                        specific about your responsibilities
                        and your results including dollars
                        raised, hours spent, leadership
                        position, end-user experience (e.g.
                        fund-raising efforts reached over
                        $20K, providing for five
                        developmentally disabled students and
                        their parents to travel to Florida to
                        swim with the dolphins).

                      Licenses and Certifications:
                        Individuals can achieve literally
                        hundreds of professional licenses in
                        the areas of health care, finance, real
                        estate, insurance, and so forth.
                        Examples include Chartered Financial
                        Analyst (CFA) Level I or Licensed
                        Real Estate Agent.

                     

In constructing this section, be sure to keep in mind your
options. If you want to highlight certain information, or if
you need to add a lot of detail, you might consider making
a separate section for an item, or you might decide to
combine similar items within the same section.

Figure 8: A skills section that groups together additional
qualifications from computer skills to language.

         · References: One of the famous last lines of a
            résumé is References furnished upon request.
            This is not necessary because employers can
            simply ask for references when they want them.
            In fact, if you simply include a references page
            with your résumé, it may save an interested
            employer the trouble of having to ask in the first
            place; a proactive, impressive strategy would be
            to create a single-page document that includes
            the following information.
                      Header (that matches the résumé
                        header) to include your name, address,
                        and contact information
                      Reference's name
                      Reference's company and title
                      Reference's relationship to you (e.g.,
                        manager, peer, vendor, and so forth)
                      Reference's contact information,

7.5 Writing Job Letters

In the era of social media, the idea of writing an application
letter to introduce your résumé may seem outdated.
However, the application letter still serves several crucial
functions. If the résumé is characterized by breadth (giving
a broad overview of your qualifications), the application
letter is characterized by depth (choosing a few most
significant qualifications to cover in detail). Written in
paragraphs rather than bullet points, this letter is the first
writing sample your employer will see from you. It offers
an opportunity to market your unique qualifications and to
show how you will fit with the culture of the company. An
effective application letter will create a picture of you as
a potential employee and inspire a potential employer to
learn more about you. Keep the following tips in mind as
you write your cover letter:

         · Your letter is essentially an argument for why
            you should be granted an interview. Make sure
            to support the claim that you are qualified for
            the position with evidence.

         · Demonstrate your authority by speaking in
            detail about your qualifications.

         · SHOW the reader that you have the skills and
            abilities necessary to do the job at hand. The
            more detail you offer and the more precise your
            language is, the more the reader will be able to
            picture you doing the job.

         · Consider your audience carefully as you craft
            your letter.

         · Conduct additional research to help you connect
204 Katrina Peterson

            with the company and to choose the appropriate
            tone, level of formality, and level of technicality.

At some point you may find yourself asking, "Is it worth
writing an application letter knowing it might never be
read?" The short answer is yes. Some recruiters go straight
to the résumé and make an initial decision, while other
recruiters carefully weigh the information in the letter.
There is no way of knowing which will be the case, so you
are better off putting your best foot forward every time. A
well-written application letter is an opportunity to present
yourself well and influence a recruiter, so always take full
advantage of that opportunity. It can also be viewed as your
first conversation with a future employer, so its quality
should be exceptional.

      When writing an application letter, remember that you
have competition. Your audience is a professional who
screens and hires job applicants--someone who may look
through dozens or even hundreds of other applications on
the day yours is received. The immediate objective of your
application letter and accompanying résumé is to attract
this person's attention. The ultimate goal is to obtain an
interview. As you write your application letter, strive to
complete three tasks: 1) catch the reader's attention
favorably, 2) convince the reader that you are a qualified
candidate for the job, and 3) leave a lasting impression.

      Many people use the terms application letter and
cover letter interchangeably. It is good to keep in mind,
however, that they may refer to different business writing
genres. The letter of application is much like a sales letter
in which you market your skills, abilities, and knowledge.
The term cover letter may refer to a document of
transmittal sent with faxes or emails. It identifies an item
being sent, the person to whom it is being sent, and the
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 205

reason for its being sent, providing a permanent record of
the transmittal for both the writer and the reader.

Deciphering the Job Description

Most job descriptions can be copied from the employer's
website. The previous section (Finding Job Openings)
shares additional ideas on how to search for job ads. Once
you have identified a position that interests you, copy the
job description into a Word document. (If you only have
a hard copy of the ad, it might be worthwhile to type it
into a new Word document, so that you can copy pertinent
phrases from the job description into your letter.) You can
complete two prewriting steps before writing to decipher
the job description: 1) List each skill and qualification on a
separate line and 2) Group like with like. If communication
skills are listed as important, in addition to giving
presentations, list one after the other. An example of a job
description and the deciphering process is given below.

Sample Job Description

Entry-Level Sales
      The CML Company, a leading provider of recruiting

and staffing services, is currently seeking motivated,
career-oriented individuals to join our recruiting team. Our
recruiters work with our clients and inside sales team
identifying, screening, interviewing, and presenting
qualified candidates for contract and permanent positions.
CML promotes from within. Entry-level sales staff start as
recruiters. Once they master that role and have a desire
to become a member of our sales team, they can be
206 Katrina Peterson

considered for promotion. Qualified candidates for the
recruiter position will:

         · Develop recruiting strategies designed to
            identify qualified candidates through various
            recruiting tools.

         · Evaluate candidates' strengths compared with
            clients' requirements by evaluating, screening,
            and interviewing the candidate.

         · Negotiate wage rates and other terms and
            conditions of employment with candidates and
            gain commitment from candidates for current
            and future job requirements.

         · Complete necessary pre-employment processes,
            including reference and background checks and
            drug tests.

         · Work with account executives to identify top
            accounts, client skill sets, and key market
            segments, and to assess clients' staffing
            requirements.

         · Interact effectively with others to create a
            productive team environment.

         · Communicate with peers by sharing recruiting
            best practices and providing accurate, thorough
            documentation on contract employees in our
            applicant-tracking system.

         · Maintain relationships with industry contacts to
            provide customer service, gain industry
            knowledge, and get referrals and sales leads.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 207

      Qualified candidates for the recruiter position must
also:

         · Have a bachelor's degree or related sales or
            recruiting experience.

         · Be available to work before and after typical
            office hours as work may demand.

         · Possess strong written and oral English
            communication skills.

         · Be familiar with Microsoft Word and MS
            Outlook (or similar e-mail applications).

         · Have work experience in a service-oriented
            business.

         · Reflect a desire to learn and advance in a fast-
            paced sales environment, and be capable of
            regularly using good judgment and discretion to
            accomplish goals.

         · Be currently authorized to work in the United
            States for any employer.

Sample Deciphering Process

As you consider the preceding sample, study each
component of the job description and how it relates to your
skills so that you can apply for and gain an interview for
the position. Also simplify the job ad description as you list
and group. Your streamlined (second) list of requirements
might look something like this:

      Requirements:
208 Katrina Peterson

         · Bachelor's degree

         · Able to work flexible, long hours

         · Strong written and verbal communication skills

         · Computer literate

         · Desire to learn in a fast-paced sales environment

         · Good judgment

         · Discretion

         · Authorized to work in the U.S.

      As you compare your abilities and credentials to your
list(s), ask yourself how closely your qualifications match
the items are listed. Do your skills match all of these
requirements, or the vast majority of them? Highlight the
skills that do match and consider where you might
reference them directly in your job letter. Your next step
might involve identifying and writing down any
requirements that are NOT stated directly. For example, the
job ad seems to imply: 1) individuals must be motivated, 2)
they must have the ability to master the work, and 3) they
must have a desire to be a part of the sales team in order to
be promoted.

      Do not rule yourself out if every requirement does
not match. Instead, think of something that is somewhat
related. For example, if you have never worked in a fast-
paced sales environment, focus on your desire to learn.
Highlight the fact that you have observed fast-paced sales
environments, and those situations appeal to you. At the
very least, you could use the fact that you have always
been very proactive in completing tasks as efficiently as
possible. Or maybe you have taken a course or two in
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 209

economics or marketing that might have provided
tangentially relevant knowledge. In contrast, if you are
a strong match for most of the requirements, generate
specific, results-oriented examples to demonstrate these
skills.

      Oftentimes, you will not have a clear indication as
to which skills are more important than others in the job
ad, so use your best judgment call. Treat each skill as if
it is the most important. For instance, when considering
communication skills have a specific, results-oriented
example of your verbal skills and your written skills. At
some point, however, you will want to select the three skills
you think are most important, match them to your strongest
skills, and then write your cover letter. These three skills, if
positioned properly, will make the case for why you should
be hired.

Format and Structure

Formatting of all business letters--but especially the
application letter--must be neat and professional. It is
recommended that you use left alignment for all text, since
various software programs can wreak havoc with
indentations and tabs. Common business letter formats
include the block letter, the semi-block letter, the
alternative letter, and the simplified letter. Block format,
among the most widely used business letter formats, is
recommended for application letters. The application letter
includes five main sections: 1) heading and greeting/
salutation, 2) introductory paragraph, 3) middle
paragraphs, 4) closing paragraph, and 5) complimentary
close.

      The heading contains the writer's address and the
210 Katrina Peterson

date of the letter. The writer's name is not included; only
a date is needed in headings on letterhead stationery. Next
comes the inside address, which shows the name and
address of the recipient of the letter. This information can
help prevent confusion at the recipient's offices. Also, if
the recipient has moved, the inside address helps to
determine what to do with the letter. In the inside address,
include the appropriate title of respect of the recipient, and
copy the name of the company exactly as that company
writes it. When you do have the names of individuals,
remember to address them appropriately: Mrs., Ms., Mr.,
Dr., etc. If you are not sure what is correct for an individual,
do some extra online research and/or consider using the
title that the individual prefers. Another standard rule of
thumb is to use Ms. if unsure of a woman's marital status.

      The greeting or salutation directly addresses the
recipient of the letter and is followed by a colon. If you do
not know the recipient's gender, you may use the full name.
Again, the best solution is to do a little extra research, or
make a quick, anonymous phone call to the organization
and ask for a name. In some cases, you may address the
salutation to a department name, committee name, or
position name: Dear Personnel Department, Dear
Recruitment Committee or Dear Hiring Committee.

      In the introductory paragraph, you introduce
yourself to the hiring manager or recruiter. The paragraph
should include these general items:

         · Why you are contacting them (to apply for X
            position--give its specific name).

         · How you heard about the position (for example,
            give the name of the website where you found
            the ad).
                  Technical and Professional Writing Genres 211

· The date of the ad if applicable.

· What the minimum requirements for the job are
   and how you meet them (for example, if the job
   requires a degree and three years of experience,
   you will want to mention right away that you
   meet these requirements).

· Optional: Something specific about the
   company or the job itself that has made you
   interested in the position (for example, does the
   company have a good environmental track
   record? Do they mention on their website that
   they like to promote from within? Have they
   won awards? Are they working on any projects
   that pique your interests?).

              business letters, technical instructions, internal
              proposals, and external analytical reports.
212 Katrina Peterson

     The middle paragraphs of the cover letter
should make the case for why you would be an
exceptional hire. Select two to four strengths
necessary to excel and assign each strength to a
bulleted section or brief paragraph. Boldly indicate
your strengths and include your best examples of
how you excel at each strength. For a one-page
application letter, some candidates have two
paragraphs, while others have three. Oftentimes,
one of these paragraphs will focus on education
and the ways it has prepared the candidate for the
position, while another discusses work experience
and applies skills learned to the position. Anything
listed as a strength in the résumé needs to include
visible proof of that strength. For example, if you
mention having strong interpersonal skills, be sure
to give a concrete example, like writing about a
course that required group work to finish a large
project. Again, be specific. Show exactly how the
event built or showcased the skill you reference.

      The closing paragraph should reiterate any major
points or takeaways that you want readers to remember. It
will likely do the following:

         · Re-state your interest.
         · Highlight how your strengths mesh well with

            the required skills.
         · If applicable, inform them when you will

            contact them within a certain time period.
         · Invite them to contact you (and include contact

            information, typically your professional email
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 213

            address).

         · Refer them to your enclosed résumé.

         · Thank them for their time and consideration.

      The Sincerely element of the business letter is called
the complimentary close. Other common ones are
Sincerely yours, Respectfully, or Thank you. Notice that
only the first letter is capitalized, and it is always followed
by a comma. Usually, you type your name four lines below
the complimentary close and--if the letter is a physical
copy--sign your full name in between.

Concluding Thoughts

Preparation and practice are critical to every step of the
job search process, and the cover letter is no different. Five
actions can help make your cover letter compelling:

       1. Make a list of your top ten strengths.

       2. Make a list of your top five weaknesses (areas
            you would like to strengthen).

       3. Decipher the job description to identify each
            separate skill and qualification.

       4. Compare the two lists to see if they are in
            alignment. Also identify the gaps--does the job
            description list something that you haven't
            done?

       5. Highlight your top skills that align with the job
            description as you will use them in Other
            strengths and skills could include (in
214 Katrina Peterson

            alphabetical order).

7.7 Interviewing

Interviewing for a job position comes with its own set
of challenges. However, having made it to this moment
in the hiring process means that you have already faced
and beat many obstacles. Be encouraged! Even if you do
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 223

not receive (or accept) a job offer after interviewing, the
interview itself provides valuable preparation for career
advancement. Some universities offer mock interviews to
help students prepare, so you may want to check with
your adviser, department, and career services to be aware
of these opportunities. There are ways of preparing for
possible interview scenarios--for example, drafting a set
of potential questions that you may be asked and writing
out or speaking possible responses in advance. Keep your
support system involved. Just as you may have asked
family or friends to look over job materials, so also might
you ask a friend or family member to help you practice
responding to interview questions. The following
information is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to
interviewing; however, it will provide you with
information on the types of interviews that you may
encounter.

On-Campus Recruiting

If you are participating in on-campus recruiting (when a
company comes onto your campus to recruit), three
interview scenarios are possible: open, closed, or mixed
schedule. The school dictates the type of schedule, and it is
important to know in which type you are participating.

         · An open schedule allows any student to go to
            the career services office to submit their résumé
            for the specific position in which they are
            interested. An open schedule is open to any
            candidate who wishes to be considered for an
            interview. The company recruiter will then
            review all of the résumés and select the top ten
            or twelve candidates they will interview on
224 Katrina Peterson

            campus. (For example, thirty-minute interview
            schedules would allow for twelve students to be
            interviewed, while forty-five-minute interview
            schedules would allow for nine students to be
            interviewed.) The company will select the
            length of interviews when they initially book the
            schedule with career services.

         · A closed schedule happens when the recruiter
            selects all of the ten or twelve individuals they
            will interview from the résumé book, from
            interactions they have had on campus, or from a
            colleague's recommendation. Perhaps they met a
            student who impressed them at a marketing
            event. The recruiter could choose to include that
            student in a closed schedule.

         · A half open/half closed schedule is a hybrid of
            the two preceding schedules. Half the students
            will be selected from students who have
            submitted their résumés, and the recruiter will
            select the other half from the résumé book, a
            recommendation, or a direct interaction with
            students while they were on campus.

Whether you submit your résumé for an open schedule,
or you are selected to participate in a closed schedule, the
recruiting cycle is fast-paced and résumés can be easily
missed due to no fault of the job seeker and résumé writer.
Sometimes recruiters review hundreds of résumés to find
the ten or twelve they will pursue, and sometimes résumés
can be missed because of something as simple as pages
sticking to one another. Should your résumé be one of the
many that is not selected, you can write to the recruiter,
using your cover letter to make a strong case for why you
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 225

should be considered. In some cases, this may work to get
you an interview. The recruiting process is not perfect, so
it is recommended that you apply for as many positions
as possible. Never rely solely on the submission of one
résumé. Instead, when on-campus recruiting takes place,
apply for all positions that fit your strengths and interests.

Off-Campus Recruiting

Do not limit your search to only on-campus opportunities
because off-campus opportunities can also be fruitful.
Conducting both an on-campus and off-campus job search
increases the number of opportunities you can consider.
You may pursue off-campus opportunities for three
reasons:

       1. Your school does not have a robust career
            services department that attracts a variety of
            employers.

       2. You are interested in a company that does not
            recruit on campus.

       3. You want to hedge your bets to have as many
            opportunities as possible, representing a mix of
            on-campus and off-campus possibilities.

The main difference between on-campus and off-campus
recruiting is that in off-campus recruiting, you manage
the entire process. You are responsible for getting your
résumé into the hands of the company recruiters or hiring
managers, along with scheduling the interview and
following up on your own. An off-campus job search
demands that you are organized and proactive enough to
keep things moving. One final thought: After completing
226 Katrina Peterson

a job interview, always send a follow-up letter thanking
interviewers for their time; this additional step
demonstrates your professionalism and attention to detail.

7.8 Activities and Resources

As you work on your résumé, you may worry that you
have nothing valuable to include, or you may feel that you
sound like you are bragging. One way to get over these
hurdles is to allocate pre-writing time to a self-inventory.
Brainstorm your skills, accomplishments, and knowledge.
What did you accomplish at work, school, or a volunteer
position? What skills have you learned? What would you
tell a friend or family member you were proud of having
achieved there? What sort of technical advice do friends
and family members seek from you? Start writing down
key terms and action verbs that describe your experiences
and accomplishments, but do NOT worry yet about putting
them into a résumé format.

      Action Verb Activity
      Here are some action verbs that may be helpful to use
in your résumé sections.

Chapter 8: Technical Instructions

Michael Beilfuss

Chapter Synopsis

The focus of this chapter is one of the most important of

all uses of technical writing-- instructions. Instructions are

step-by-step explanations of how to do something: how

to build, operate, repair, or maintain things. For a quick

overview of writing instructions, check out this link:

"Instructions: How to Write Guides for Busy, Grouchy

People"    (https://jerz.setonhill.edu/writing/technical-

writing/instructions-how-to-write-for-busy-grouchy-

people/).

The chapter begins with a brief overview of the

importance of knowing how to write instructions, followed

by some basic guidelines. The chapter goes into some

depth in regards to analyzing the rhetorical situation for

writing instructions. The rhetorical situation includes the

purpose, audience and context for any particular set of

instructions. Next, we cover how to plan and organize the

writing process followed by information about the content

that is typically included in instructions. The chapter ends

with some nitty-gritty tips on writing the instructions.

8.1 Introduction

One of the most common and important uses of technical
writing is instructions--step-by-step explanations of how

                                     229
230 Katrina Peterson

to do things: assemble, operate, repair, or do routine
maintenance on something. Many people associate
instructions with appliances, computer accessories,
products that require assembly (e.g., furniture) and DIY
projects. Because we do not find ourselves using them
regularly or we come to expect them only in certain
contexts, it is easy to forget how important they are. The
quality of a well-designed instruction manual may go
unnoticed. Yet, when we encounter frustration with putting
together a bookshelf or toy, or with trying to figure out
how to change or activate a particular appliance setting,
the significance of well-written and designed instructions
becomes clear.

      Although it may seem intuitive and simple to write
instructions, it is not always that easy. What follows in
this chapter may not be a fool-proof guide to writing
instructions, but it will show you what professionals
consider the best techniques.

      Ultimately, good instruction writing requires:
      · Clear, simple writing that utilizes strong,
descriptive verbs to reveal the process's discrete actions
      · A thorough understanding of the procedure in all
its technical detail
      · The ability to put yourself in the place of your
audience and help them avoid common errors
      · The ability to go through the procedure with
concentrated attention and to capture that awareness on
paper
      · The willingness to go that extra distance and
test your instructions on the audience for whom they are
written
      This chapter explores some of the features of
instructions that can make them more complex to write, but
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 231

easier for the reader to use. It also explains the common
elements of instructions and how to write them.

8.2 The Rhetorical Situation

Instructions, like other types of texts, are shaped by a
rhetorical situation. The choices technical writers make
in regards to content and form depend on the purpose of
the instructions, the intended audience, and the context in
which the instructions are used. Altogether, the audience,
purpose, and context of the instructions make up to the
rhetorical situation. As you begin to plan your project, it
is crucial to define the audience, purpose, and context for
your instructions. Remember that defining your audience
means defining its level of familiarity with the topic as well
as other such details. (See chapter 2 for the discussion of
audiences.)

      Most importantly, if you are in a writing course, you
will need to create a planning document that identifies the
rhetorical situation and how it will inform the composition
of your instructions. This will enable your instructor to
assess how well your instructions are customized for the
intended audience.

      When writing your own instructions, consider the
following ideas and questions regarding the rhetorical
situation.

Purpose

In general, the purpose of a set of instructions is to guide
the user through a series of steps that lead to the completion
of a task. However, each set of instructions will also have
a more specific outcome. Identifying what that specific
232 Katrina Peterson

outcome is will help you make more effective rhetorical
decisions about content and design. Ask yourself:

      · What are the specific intended outcome(s) of
the instructions, e.g., building a doghouse, installing an air
conditioner, etc.?

      · Are there other purposes that the instructions
serve, e.g., offering troubleshooting advice, teaching users
how to accomplish additional, simple tasks necessary for
reaching the main objective, defining unfamiliar terms,
etc.?

Audience

Creating a profile of your audience (i.e. the primary
intended user of the document) is integral for making
thoughtful choices about scope, content, and design. For
some projects, it is tempting to say your audience is
"everyone or anyone," but you are better off tailoring your
instructions for a specific audience. Check out this airline
safety video from Air New Zealand:

                    One or more interactive elements has been
                    excluded from this version of the text. You can
                    view them online here:
        https://open.library.okstate.edu/
        technicalandprofessionalwriting/?p=32#oembed-1

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOw44VFNk8Y
      Ostensibly, the audience for the video is everyone and
anyone (because just about anyone could be on a flight),
but Air New Zealand tailor their instructions to appeal to a
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 233

very specific audience (i.e. fans of The Hobbit), while also
making it accessible to anyone on the flight. Customizing
their instructions so specifically allows them to really grab
their audience's attention, even if the customization is not
grounded on a universal appeal.

      In order to draft your instructions to serve your
audience, consider these questions before writing:

         · Who is the primary audience? Who is the
            secondary audience?

         · What is the primary audience's familiarity or
            expertise regarding the topic of the instructions?

         · What is the audience's general comfort level
            with learning new skills related to the software,
            apps, craft, etc.?

         · What is your audience's "typical" approach to
            learning? How will your instructions address the
            audience's learning style, goals, and task-related
            needs?

Context

Think of context as the temporal, social, technological, and
cultural situation surrounding the creation and use of the
instructions. The following questions will help you identify
the context:

         · How much time will you have to complete this
            set of instructions?

         · Are there time constraints the user might
            encounter when reading the instructions or
            performing the process?
234 Katrina Peterson

         · Is there a degree of urgency to the rhetorical
            situation that might dictate the instruction's pace
            or flow? How will the design of the document
            contribute to the pace or flow? For example, a
            guide on how to properly administer CPR might
            need to anticipate a reader who is under duress
            and needs information quickly so that they can
            save someone's life, whereas instructions on
            how to play "Mary Had a Little Lamb" on the
            violin will be read by a recreational audience
            that may not feel the same pressure or exigence.

         · What technological constraints must you
            consider in writing the instructions? Consider
            your skills with technology and level of access.

         · How will your audience gain access to the
            instructions? For example, your audience may
            access it online via a company website on a
            desktop computer or their smart phones. Will
            they need to print it?

         · What additional tools or materials are you
            assuming the audience already has? Will they
            have access to the technology or materials
            needed to follow the instructions? For example,
            to successfully build a bookshelf, the user will
            need a hammer, screwdriver, and open work
            area.

         · From what cultural perspective are you writing
            the instructions? Will the audience share this
            same cultural context? For example, a German
            recipe that calls for vanilla sugar, an ingredient
            not readily available in the United States, may
            need to be modified for American users.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 235

8.3 Planning and Shaping

Once you have described the rhetorical situation, you can
begin drafting your set of instructions. A comprehensive
set of instructions contains many components. These are
listed in the next section. This section provides a
foundation for your draft.

Number of Tasks

How many tasks are there in the procedure you are writing
about? The term procedure refers to the whole set of
activities your instructions are intended to discuss. A task
is a semi-independent group of actions within the
procedure: for example making spaghetti and meatballs
is a procedure that--while containing dozen of individual
steps--can be broken down into three distinct tasks: 1)
preparing the meatballs; 2) stewing the sauce; and 3)
boiling the pasta.

      A simple procedure like changing the oil in a car
contains only one task; there are no semi-independent
groupings of activities. A more complex procedure such
as making spaghetti and meatballs, or constructing a
doghouse, contains many semi-independent tasks. For
example, constructing a doghouse would include the tasks
of: leveling the ground, setting the foundation, building
the floor, constructing the walls, adding the roof. The
instructions for the Kobolt Swing Trimmer are organized
by tasks - Assembly Instructions and Operating
Instructions. The Assembly Instructions include further
divisions related to particular parts such as the guard and
the front handle.

      In Figure 1, the procedure is the total sum of the
236 Katrina Peterson

actions needed to build a doghouse. The introduction and
list of tools and supplies is not part of the procedure. In this
schematic those sections are represented in gray.

      The separate tasks that comprise the procedure are
represented by the blue boxes: Level the Ground and Set
the Foundation. The steps are the individual actions taken
in sequential order and are nested within the tasks.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 237

Figure 1: The procedure encompasses all of the actions in your
instructions. You might think of it as the title of the process.

      Some instructions have only a single task, but have
many steps within that single task. For example, imagine a
set of instructions for assembling a swing set. There could
238 Katrina Peterson

be over a 100 steps. That can be daunting. If there are no
natural, semi-independent tasks, or if there are too many
semi-independent tasks for clearly denoted task sections,
you can simply group similar and related steps into phases,
and start renumbering the steps at each new phase. A phase
then is a group of similar steps within a single-task
procedure. In the swing-set example, setting up the frame
would be a phase; anchoring the thing in the ground would
be another; assembling the box swing would be still
another.

      Returning to the spaghetti and meatballs example, the
tasks--1) preparing the meatballs; 2) stewing the sauce;
and 3) boiling the pasta--can be broken down further into
phases. The task of preparing the meatballs can be divided
into several phases--seasoning the meat, forming the
meatballs, searing the meatballs--and each of these phases
will include multiple action steps. Phases for stewing the
sauce might include: dicing onions, dicing garlic, browning
the vegetables in the pan, adding herbs, and simmering
the sauce. But since there are a limited number of steps
within these phases, and the procedure already contains
natural, semi-independent tasks, there is no need to add
extra phases to preparing spaghetti and meatballs.

      For further discussion, see this resource on task
analysis (https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/
task_analysis.html).

Groupings of Tasks

Listing tasks may not be all that you need to do. There
may be so many tasks that you must group them so that
readers can find individual ones more easily. For example,
the following are common task groupings in instructions:
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 239

         · Unpacking and setup tasks

         · Installing and customizing tasks

         · Basic operating tasks

         · Routine maintenance tasks

         · Troubleshooting tasks

8.4 Content

The standard sections of instructions include front matter,
an introduction, the procedure (a series of numbered steps
divided into tasks or phases), a conclusion, and back
matter. Some sets of instructions may not use all of these
sections or label them in this way. Extensive front and
back matter, for example, are often found in longer, more
complex manuals.

      Most sets of instructions, however, contain an
introduction that provides information necessary for
completing the steps safely and efficiently. The
introduction may include an explanation of who should
carry out the task (maybe the user needs to have
proficiency in a certain skill), the materials needed, any
precautions that the user should take (safety tips or other
warnings), and an estimate for how long the process will
take, among other elements. It is often necessary to include
an explanation of why the user should follow the
instructions. For example, instructions for changing the oil
in a car may explain why the task is necessary for the
proper functioning of the vehicle.

      Following this introductory material is the sequence
of step-by-step instructions, divided into separate tasks.
240 Katrina Peterson

See the section below for how to draft clear and effective
steps.

      Lastly, instructions typically include some closing
sections or appendices such as a "Troubleshooting Guide"
or a section for "Tips" to help users address common
problems that they may encounter while following the
instructions or after completing the process.

      The following is a review of these different parts you
will commonly find in instructions. Most of them should
be included in all instructions, but do not assume that
all of them always need to be present, or that they must
follow this exact order. There are other possible sections
that could be included in instructions. However, all
instructions should have at minimum an Opening/
Introduction, a Body with numbered steps that are divided
into separate tasks or phases, and a Conclusion and/or
Closing sections.

      As you read the following on common sections in
instructions, check out the sample instructions linked at the
end of this chapter. Figure 2 provides a simple schematic
of the foundational elements for a set of instructions.

Figure 2: Schematic view of instructions. Remember that this is a
typical or common model for the contents and organization --
many others are possible.

Introduction/Opening
Before you even get to the introduction, you need to craft
a clear title that is easy to understand. You want to be
detailed and specific, but also succinct. For example, some
good titles would include: "How to Clean a Freshwater
Aquarium," "How to Install Long-Tube Headers on a 1999
Trans Am," "Cleaning a Bathroom: Instructions for
College Students Living on Their Own for the First Time."

      Plan the introduction to your instructions carefully.
Just as the title should provide your reader with a good
   242 Katrina Peterson

  idea of what the instructions involve, the goal of your
  introduction is to give your reader general information
  about the process. What is it? Why should it be done? The
  introduction should contain an overview of the process and
  why it is important. Often, the writer lists the benefits of
  completing the process so that the reader feels good about
  the task they are about to complete.

        The introduction/opening should do the following:

           · Include a title
           · Describe the goal and/or purpose of the

              instructions. Richard Johnson-Sheehan[11]
              provides the following verbs as possible
              options:

  to instruct
        to show
        to illustrate

        to explain
        to guide
        to lead

        to direct
        to train
        to tutor

            knowledge and background information or skills
            they will need to understand the instructions and
            complete the procedure.

         · Indicate the conditions when these instructions
            should (or should not) be used.

         · Give an overview of the contents of the
            instructions.

         · Provide motivation and stress the importance of
            the task (i.e., what does the audience stand to
            gain from learning this information? How will it
            prove useful? Why should the reader follow
            these instructions? What will happen if they do
            not?)

         · Indicate the time for completion for people of
            varying skill-levels.

      The following sections should be included as part of
the opening of the instructions before the tasks begin. They
can be folded in as subheadings of the introduction, or
they can stand on their own, depending on the rhetorical
situation.

Precautionary Statements/Warnings

Instructions must alert readers to the possibility of

damaging the equipment, botching the procedure, and

injuring themselves or others. For these situations, use

special  notices       (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Precautionary_statement) --notice, caution, warning, and

danger notifications.

         · The "Notice" precaution is the lowest level
            statement. The standard color for notices is blue.
            Use it to indicate when there is a risk to damage
            property or equipment. You can also use it to
            draw attention to important operational
            considerations. There is no threat to bodily harm
            or safety with a notice.

         · A "Caution" statement should include the safety
            symbol of an exclamation mark within a
            triangle. The standard color for caution
            statements and symbols is yellow. All the other
            higher warning should include this symbol as
            well, in the appropriate color code. It indicates
            there is a "non-immediate or potential hazard"
            for minor injury to a user or general public.

         · A "Warning" statement appears in orange and
            indicates that death and/or serious injury could
            result to users and the public. These signs are
            not used to indicate property or material
            damage, but rather the potential for personal
            bodily injury or death.

         · A "Danger" statement is the highest level
            precautionary statement and should appear in
            red. It indicates a situation with an immediate
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 245

            hazard that will result in death or serious injury.
            It is not used for property damage.

If any part of the procedure merits a precautionary
statement or warning, you must include a statement at
the beginning of your instructions, either as part of the
Introduction/Opening or as a separate section before the
tasks begin. Each of these warnings must always contain
the corresponding colors and icons to help them stand out
on the page. See the link above for more information.
See below for more information about precautionary
statements.

Technical Background or Theory

For some instructions you will need to provide a more
thorough discussion of background related to the
procedure. For certain instructions, this background is
critical--otherwise, the steps in the procedure make no
sense. For example, you may have had some experience
with those software applets in which you define your own
colors by nudging red, green, and blue slider bars around.
To really understand what you are doing, you need to have
some background on color. Similarly, you can imagine that,
for certain instructions using cameras, some theory might
be needed as well.

List of Parts, Tools, Materials, Equipment, and/or
Supplies

Most instructions include a list of things you need to gather
before you start the procedure. This includes equipment,
the tools you use in the procedure (such as mixing bowls,
246 Katrina Peterson

spoons, bread pans, hammers, drills, and saws) and
supplies, the things that are consumed in the procedure
(such as wood, paint, oil, flour, and nails). In instructions,
these are typically listed in a simple vertical list or in a two-
column list. It may help to notify your reader where they
can acquire the equipment or supplies. The audience needs
to know and gather all the materials necessary to complete
the procedure before they begin any of the tasks.

Step-by-Step Instructions

When you get to the actual writing of the steps, there are
several things to keep in mind: (1) the structure and format
of those steps, (2) supplementary information that might be
needed, and (3) the point of view and general writing style.

Structure and Format

Normally, we imagine a set of instructions as being
formatted as vertical numbered lists, and most are in fact.
There are some variations, however, as well as some other
considerations:

         · Fixed-order steps: must be performed in the
            order presented. For example, if you are
            changing the oil in a car, draining the oil is a
            step that must come before putting in the new
            oil. These are numbered lists (usually, vertical
            numbered lists).

         · Variable-order steps: steps that can be
            performed in practically any order. Good
            examples are those troubleshooting guides that
            tell you to check this, then check that, when you
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 247

            are trying to fix something. You can do these
            steps in practically any order. With this type, the
            bulleted list is the appropriate format.

         · Alternate steps: those in which two or more
            ways to accomplish the same thing are
            presented. Alternate steps are also used when
            various conditions might exist. Use bulleted lists
            with this type, with OR inserted between the
            alternatives, or the lead-in indicating that
            alternatives are about to be presented.

         · Nested steps: in some cases, individual steps
            within a procedure can be rather complex in
            their own right and need to be broken down into
            substeps. In this case, you indent further and
            sequence the substeps as a, b, c, and so on.

         · "Stepless" instructions: some instructions
            really cannot use numbered vertical list and that
            do little if any straightforward instructional-style
            directing of the reader. Some situations must be
            so generalized, or so variable, that steps cannot
            be stated. Generally, these are not appropriate
            for a classroom assignment. In your classes, you
            will need to demonstrate your mastery of the
            form with more traditional, straight-forward,
            sequentially numbered steps, otherwise it may
            begin to resemble a collection of tips or advice.

In any case, remember to divide your procedure into
separate tasks or phases. It is easier for your audience
to complete the procedure if they can work through it in
smaller chunks.
248 Katrina Peterson

Supplementary Discussion

Often, it is not enough simply to tell readers to do this or
to do that. They need additional explanatory information
such as how the thing should look before and after the
step; why they should care about doing this step; what
mechanical principle is behind what they are doing; even
more micro-level explanation of the step--discussion of
the specific actions that make up the step. When including
supplementary information, it should be formatted as a
"Note" or "Tip" similarly to how you would format a
"Notice." This type of supplementary information derives
from "craft knowledge." In certain circumstances,
especially less formal instructions, it is even appropriate
to include personal narrative to help convey your craft
knowledge.[2]

      The problem with supplementary discussion,
however, is that it can hide the actual step. You want the
actual step--the specific actions the reader is to take--to
stand out. You do not want it buried in a wall of words.
There are at least two techniques to avoid this problem:
you can split the instruction from the supplementary
information into separate paragraphs; or you can bold the
instruction. In figure 3, you can see how the supplementary
discussion is distinguished from the main action of the step
through the use of bold-face type.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 249

Figure 3: The main action of the steps above is bolded, while
supplementary discussion is in regular font. Note also that the
precautionary label really stands out in this sample.

Language and Writing Style
The questions about "Audience" and "Context" earileir
in this chapter can help guide you in making effective
language choices. The following subsections include
explanations of common linguistic features of instruction
manuals along with tips for writing clearly and concisely in
this genre.
Imperative Mood
Instructions, like commands, often use the imperative
mood. To write in this way, address the audience directly
using active voice and specific verbs. Imperative mood
typically leaves out the subject ("you") and positions the
verb first.

      The way you actually write the steps, sentence by
250 Katrina Peterson

sentence, may seem contradictory to what previous writing
classes have taught you. However, notice how professional
instructions are written--they use the imperative
(command, or direct-address) and a lot of the second
person. That is entirely appropriate. You want to get your
reader's full attention. For that reason, instruction-style
sentences sound like these: "Press the Pause button on
the front panel to stop the display temporarily" and "You
should be careful not to ..."

      Which of the following provides the clearest
instructional step?

         · Press the red button to begin playing the game

         · When the red button is pressed, the game will
            begin

         · The operator should press the button

Though a user could probably make sense of any of these
sentences, the first one provides the clearest explanation of
what action the user should performed because the action is
the first thing mentioned. The second, passive construction
does not specify who should press the button. The third
example refers to a vague subject, the "operator," which
may confuse the user.

Word Choice

When writing instructions, a careful consideration of word
choice is important because in some cases, the user's safety
is at risk. Always strive for clarity and concision. To make
effective decisions about word choice, consider your
primary audience's level of expertise and cultural
background. You may find it necessary to:
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 251

         · Define complex terms.

         · Spell out acronyms the first time they are
            introduced (e.g., digital single-lens reflex
            camera, DSLR).

         · Avoid using similes, metaphors, slang, jargon
            (unless it is defined in a glossary) or
            substitutions that may confuse users. Keep
            terminology consistent.

         · Use plain language. In some cases, serious legal
            consequences can arise when a set of
            instructions is unclear. For more on plain
            language, see the website plainlanguage.gov
            (https://www.plainlanguage.gov/index.cfm).

         · Include translations of the instructions into
            multiple languages.

         · Use brief and informative headings and
            subheadings.

Consistency and Parallelism

Parallel structure, or parallelism, means using the same
grammatical structure to present information or ideas.
Parallelism often improves readability and aids
consistency.

      This numerical list of instructions contains a step that
breaks parallel structure. Which of these steps seems
different from the others?

       1. Remove the screw to open the battery
            compartment.

       2. Insert batteries by following the image on the
252 Katrina Peterson

            battery compartment.

       3. Now you may close the compartment, and screw
            it closed.

Step three breaks the parallel structure of the list because it
does not start with a directive verb.

      Do the following headings use parallel structure?
Why or why not?

         · Installing batteries

         · Turning device off/on

         · How to charge your device

Keep your word choices as accurate and consistent as
possible. There is no reason to make your audience wonder
if "turn," "twist," "screw," and "tighten" mean the same
thing. If they do mean the same thing, do not introduce
the synonym simply to vary word choice. If they indicate
distinct actions/movements, it may be helpful to explain
that, either in a note or a glossary.

Conclusions, Closing Sections, Appendices

After all the steps are completed, you must signal the
completion of the task. End the instructions with positive
comments about the product and/or the process the user
just completed. Congratulate the reader on a job well done.
Sometimes there is a phone number for a Help Line if
further assistance is needed. You might also describe the
finished product or indicate other tasks the reader may now
complete with the same set of skills they used to complete
the procedure.

      The benefits can also be restated but make sure not
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 253

to use the exact words from the introduction. Readers do
not like to read the same exact words/phrases/sentences in
the conclusion as they did in the introduction because it
feels like the writer was too lazy to actually work on the
document.

      Depending on the task completed in the instructions,
you should include additional closing sections and/or
appendices. For example, the instructions might require
trouble-shooting advice, frequently asked questions, clean
up and/or maintenance information, product specifications,
or sources of additional information. References should be
listed at the end as well.

Conclusion Examples

Conclusions for technical instruction reports are designed
to provide audiences with additional facts, resources, or
information that may be outside the scope of the report's
process (or topic, as indicated by the title), but are
nevertheless still important to a general understanding of
the subject. In many cases, technical instruction
conclusions help educate the audience as to what happens
after the main process has ended.

      When providing instructions in the conclusion, don't
forget to rely on the verb-first sentence structure used to
describe the action steps.

      Conclusion Option A: Clean-Up Information
      This conclusion style is appropriate for processes that
create excessive waste/mess, require specific disposal
instructions for hazardous substances (e.g. automotive oil;
medical/chemical contaminants; nuclear materials, etc.), or
require unique cleaning processes to preserve the integrity
of tools, equipment, and/or the environment.
254 Katrina Peterson

             Example Topic A: How to Make Extra Crispy
       Chicken Wings in a BRAND X Air Fryer

             Cleaning-up

                   1. Remove the Teflon-coated racks and
                        drip tray once your air fryer has
                        cooled (approximately 20 minutes).
                        Wash the trays by hand with a non-
                        abrasive towel or sponge. Alternately,
                        clean racks and trays in the
                        dishwasher.

                   2. Remove the door of the air fryer by
                        opening to a 45-degree angle, then
                        gently pulling upward; the hinge of
                        the door should release easily. Wipe
                        both sides of the door with a non-
                        abrasive towel or sponge. Do not fully
                        submerge the door in water, and do
                        not place the door in the dishwasher!
                        Doing so may cause water to collect in
                        the door, which can degrade
                        components and decrease longevity.

                   3. Use a non-abrasive towel or sponge to
                        wipe the interior of the air fryer. For a
                        deep clean, lightly soap the towel/
                        sponge, wipe the interior of the air
                        fryer, rinse towel/sponge until the
                        soap is removed, then wipe the
                        interior of the air fryer again.

      Conclusion Option B: Maintenance or Service
Information

      This conclusion style is appropriate for processes
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 255

involving automated machinery, electronics, or other
physical components that should be inspected and/or
serviced on a regular basis.

             Example Topic B: How to Play Three
       Beginner Songs on Your New Electric Guitar

             Maintaining Your Guitar's Sound and
       Appearance

                      Guitar strings will eventually need to
                        be replaced. A general rule is to
                        replace strings every 3 months, or
                        after 100 hours of playing. The
                        material/gauge of your strings,
                        combined with your individual
                        playing style, will determine how
                        quickly your strings stretch and
                        degrade. If you notice your guitar will
                        not stay in tune or sounds dull, these
                        can be indicators that it is time to
                        change your strings.

                      When changing strings, use this time
                        as an opportunity to inspect your
                        guitar for loose knobs/screws on the
                        headstock, pickups, pick guard, output
                        jack, bridge, backplate and neckplate.
                        Use a damp cloth with a mild
                        detergent to clean the front and
                        backside of the neck, fretboard, pick
                        guard, and tuning pegs. Oil from your
                        hands can build up in these areas, so
                        regular cleaning will ensure that your
                        guitar plays consistently while also
                        continuing to look visually appealing.
256 Katrina Peterson

                      Store your guitar in an upright
                        position so that the neck is not leaning
                        at a sharp angle. Leaving you guitar at
                        an angle for weeks or months can
                        warp the neck, as can storing your
                        guitar in an overly humid
                        environment. Guitar cases--both soft
                        and hard-shell--protect against
                        humidity and collision damage. If
                        storing in a hard case, do not
                        horizontally stack cases on top of one
                        another; always store guitars
                        vertically.

      Conclusion Option C: Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ)

      This conclusion style is appropriate for providing
audiences with additional information that will allow them
to avoid common mistakes, or to answer common
questions about the steps, materials, tools/equipment, or
the processes' practical applications. This style is often
presented in a question/answer format.

             Example Topic C: How to Start Pepper
       Seedlings Indoors Before Transferring to an
       Outdoor Garden

             FAQ
             Q: None of my pepper seeds germinated.
       What did I do wrong?
             A: Peppers are notorious for being somewhat
       difficult to germinate (but not as difficult as
       eggplants). If after 3 weeks none of your peppers
       have sprouted, start the process over, but soak your
       pepper seeds in water for 24 hours before planting.
                    Technical and Professional Writing Genres 257

Additionally, some gardeners find that lightly
scouring both sides of the seed with sandpaper or an
emery board can improve germination rates.

      Q: I don't want my peppers to be overly hot.
Is there anything I can do to limit how fiery a
pepper will be?

      A: Much of a pepper's heat level (or capsaicin
content) is a product of genetics, so if a pepper has
been bred to be spicy there is no way to remove
this characteristic in a single generation. However,
watering your pepper plant regularly will help
moderate capsaicin production. By contrast, if you
want your peppers to be as hot as possible, you
should limit watering. If your desire is to produce
hot peppers, wait until your pepper plants looks a
little droopy--or until the edges of the leaves just
start to dry--before watering. The stress on the plant
encourages capsaicin production.

      Q: What is the difference between a red and
a green pepper?

      A: Maturity. Most green peppers will change
colors as they ripen, eventually, turning red, orange,
yellow or even purple. (Peppers are fruits, after all!)
In addition to the color change, the flavor of a pepper
also develops over time. Peppers become sweeter as
they age, and a red, yellow, orange, or purple color
typically indicates that sugar content is increasing
and chlorophyll decreasing. This means that a
mature pepper will taste less "green" or "vegetal"
than an immature pepper and, in general, a mature
version of the same pepper (e.g. red jalapeño) will be
somewhat less spicy than the immature pepper (e.g.
green jalapeño) due to the additional sugars.

      Conclusion Option D: Troubleshooting Advice
      Similar to the FAQ, this conclusion style can provide
specific advice for avoiding both common and uncommon
mistakes, or for navigating around predictable obstacles
that may arise during the process. Be aware that this
conclusion style does not replace traditional safety labels
(i.e., notice, caution, warning, danger) but should be used
in conjunction with them. Troubleshooting advice may also
serve to address issues, concerns, or difficulties that might
arise toward the end of a process.

             Example Topic D: How to Safely Drive a
       Standard Transmission Automobile

             Troubleshooting Driver Frustrations

                      If you're experiencing difficulty
                        mastering the clutch and keep stalling
                        the engine, the solution may be to
                        become more familiar with your
                        clutch. Many cars have clutches that
                        respond somewhat differently
                        underfoot, requiring more or less force
                        to depress. Learning the unique
                        behavior of your car's clutch will help
                        in the mastery of this skill.

       Warning: Only practice driving in safe
       environments, such as empty parking lots.

                     To gain the needed familiarity, release the
               emergency brake, start the car and place it in
               first gear. Keep the clutch depressed. Then,
               very slowly and without pressing the gas,
               release the clutch until you feel the car begin
               to move on its own. Keep the clutch in this
               mid-way position for a few seconds and make
          Technical and Professional Writing Genres 259

a mental note of how much you released the
clutch to get here. Then fully engage the clutch
to slow your momentum. Repeat this until you
consistently find the spot in the clutch where
the car begins to roll on its own. From this
position, slowly depress the gas pedal with
your right foot while simultaneously--but
slowly--releasing the clutch the rest of the
way.

      If after stalling you quickly try to
         restart the car but turning the ignition
         does not cause the engine to fire, one
         of two things may be happening:

                1. You may own a model car
                     that requires the clutch to be
                     fully depressed/engaged
                     when starting the car;

or

                2. You may own a model car
                     that requires you to place
                     the ignition in the full OFF
                     position (i.e. cutting all
                     power to the car but not
                     removing the key) before a
                     restart is allowed.

      Driving in mud or snow can prove
         tricky in any automobile, but some
         drivers notice that standard
         transmission cars are more likely to
         "peel out" in mud or snow. If you're
260 Katrina Peterson

                        experiencing difficulty getting traction
                        in mud or snow when pulling away
                        from a parked location, place the car
                        in second gear. While drivers are
                        generally instructed to begin
                        accelerating from first gear, in some
                        weather conditions starting from
                        second gear may be offer potential for
                        more control.

      Conclusion Option E: Sources of Additional
Information

      This conclusion style provides the audience with
additional resources (books, articles, websites, databases,
etc.) should they want to satisfy their curiosity and learn
more about the process itself.

             Example Topic E: How to Pick the Right
       Winter Resort for Your Family Vacation

             Sources of Additional Information
             The following channels and websites offer in-
       depth analytics and reviews of ski/snowboard
       resorts:

                      JB Boudhens
                        (https://www.youtube.com/channel/
                        UCY&D*D)

       This video channel offers reviews of winter resorts
       using 10 different criteria. Boudhens is an amateur
       snowboarder who provides casual, unscientific but
       earnest reviews of resorts with copious Go-Pro
       footage of Boudhens and friends performing tricks.
       Boudhens's channel is unique in that he is more
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 261

       interested in assessing new school terrain parks and
       stunt features than evaluating backcountry and/or
       off-piste options.

                      Powderhounds
                        (https://www.powderhounds.com/)

       The definitive online site for winter resort reviews,
       Powderhounds uses an eight-criteria scale to assess
       the overall character of each winter resort.
       Powderhounds provides reviews of resorts both in
       the United States and beyond, and is also a reliable
       site for determining how family-friendly a resort
       might be. Also offers helpful breakdowns of terrain
       difficulty percentages.

                      OpenSnow (https://opensnow.com/)

       Because not all winter resorts receive equal snow
       amounts or storm frequency, ensuring that the resort
       you're planning on patronizing will in fact have the
       conditions you are expecting is essential research.
       OpenSnow provides global resort snowfall totals,
       base depth, current conditions, as well as storm
       predictions. Its network of local skier/meteorologists
       provide reliable daily weather forecasts by
       incorporating multi-sourced models and imaging
       tools. Snow estimates are to be trusted as expected
       minimums, as Open Snow's conservative predictions
       regularly underestimate snowfall totals.

      Conclusion Option F: Product Specifications
      When a process focuses on assembling new
equipment or machinery, this conclusion style provides
technical information such as the final weight of the
262 Katrina Peterson

assembled product, the dimensions of the assembled
product, materials and components of note, energy usage
data, warranty information, and any special instructions for
transportation/care of the product.

             Example Topic F: How to Assemble the Trash-
       Compactor 1000X

             Product Specifications

                   1. Finished dimensions: 10' x 6.25' x
                        8.5' (length x width x depth)

                   2. Finished weight: 2,389 pounds

                   3. Maximum Capacity: 350 pounds/load

                   4. Estimated electricity usage/load: 0.3
                        kWh

      Conclusion Option G: Tips and Tricks
      The conclusion style provides audiences with general
advice that may improve their ability to perform the
described process or develop a related skill. This option
can also be used to combine elements of other conclusion
styles (for example, providing clean-up instructions,
maintenance routines, and troubleshooting advice in the
same conclusion), or to address variations on the process
that might allow the audience to make adjustments and
changes (e.g. adding optional ingredients to a recipe;
altering fermentation temperatures used by breweries and
distilleries to achieve different ester profiles).

             Example Topic G: How to Forage Edible
       Chanterelle Mushrooms

             Tips and Tricks
             Finding chanterelle mushrooms can be difficult
       enough, but cleaning them is another story. The
                    Technical and Professional Writing Genres 263

advice below will help make the process efficient
while also ensuring that the quality, taste, and
integrity of your mushrooms is not compromised.
Handle your mushrooms gently; they are both rare
and fragile, and should be treated as such.

            1. Do not wash or clean mushrooms until
                you are ready to consume them.

            2. Store unwashed mushrooms in a paper
                bag in the refrigerator.

            3. Do not fully submerge chanterelle
                mushrooms in water when washing
                them. Most mushrooms absorb water
                readily, which can affect the way they
                cook and their final taste/texture.

            4. Use a toothbrush or medium-stiff
                bristled paint brush to dust away any
                dirt that has accumulated in the
                chanterelle's false gills, on the cap,
                and along the stem.

            5. Wipe mushrooms down with a damp
                paper towel to remove grit.

            6. Wet a second toothbrush/paintbrush in
                a bowl of water and clean the false
                gills a second time.

            7. Wipe a second time with a damp paper
                towel, then place on a dry towel until
                ready to cook.

8.5 Graphics

Probably more so than in any other form of writing (except
maybe comic books), graphics are crucial to instructions.
Sometimes, words simply cannot clearly explain the step
without the assistance of images. Illustrations are critical to
readers' ability to visualize what they are supposed to do.
Your reader will need graphics to refer to and act as a guide
through the process. Remember to label the graphics as
Figure 1, Figure 2, and so on, and then title each graphic so
readers know what they are looking at. Graphics can never
fully replace text, and they MUST be referred to within the
step-by-step part of the instructions, e.g., "Tighten the bolt
located to the left of the main shutoff valve (see Fig. 5) by
turning the socket wrench clockwise."

      In a technical writing course, instructions usually
require you to include illustrations or other kinds of
graphics--whatever would normally be used in the
instructions. The problem of course may be that you do
not have access to graphics that would be suitable for
your particular instructions, and that you do not feel wildly
confident in your artistic abilities. There are ways to
overcome these problems! Take a look at these suggestions
about graphics (https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/
textbook/graphics.html). You will see not only suggestions
for creating graphics, but also requirements on their format.
(See chapter 5 for more information on graphics and
design.)

      Given the ubiquity of smart phones, and the
increasing quality of the cameras they include, it should
be no problem to produce high quality graphics for your
instructions for a class project. If you are creating
instructions as part of your job, you may need to hire
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 265

a professional photographer or illustrator, and/or rely on
drawings by engineers. In any case, it is crucial that you
do not simply copy and paste images from internet search.
(See chapters 4 and 10 for the ethical practices regarding
the use of graphics.)

8.6 Design

Document design refers to the way information is
organized and presented. Because visual elements require
less time to process, users will typically notice--and
respond to--quality of design before quality of content.
Minimally, design includes making choices about layout,
order of information, font size, typeface, headings, color,
and white space. Design elements should guide the user
through the instructions smoothly. This means making the
document scannable; a scannable document allows users to
navigate through the content to locate specific information.
As with any document, decisions regarding design should
consider the audience, purpose, and overall ease of use.
(See chapter 5 for more information on document design.)

Consistency/Repetition

Using design elements in a uniform way throughout the
entire document guides users by giving them a sense of
what to expect (e.g., the same typeface and size for all
headings; the same layout from page to page).

Contrast

Use design elements to highlight specific information or
266 Katrina Peterson

features of the instructions (e.g., capitalizing a word for
emphasis; placing a box or border around an item;
changing colors for emphasis). Contrast is primarily
effective when a document uses consistency overall. If
there is a lack of consistency, it is more difficult to create
contrast.

Alignment

Organizing items on a page with horizontal and/or vertical
alignment creates hierarchy and structure, and can help
achieve balance, contrast, or consistency.

Balance

Distribute items evenly across a given space. To achieve
this, each item's weight--that is, the tendency of the eye
to gravitate toward an item--should be considered. For
example, since an image weighs more than text, decisions
about image placement should consider how to balance
its weight against other items in order to prevent visual
confusion.

White Space

Use white space to create a professional, balanced
document. Rather than indicating the color of the space,
this design element refers to an absence of images and text.
White space helps distinguish between individual items
and groups of items (i.e., sections of the manual) and
makes scanning documents easier.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 267

Grouping/Proximity

Place related images or content close to one another. For
example, grouping together images of all the materials
needed to complete the given task.

Color

Select colors to create contrast and emphasis, to guide
readers across space, and to design a visually pleasing
document. You should consider the document overall in
order to create a consistent color scheme. For example, if
you want to use blue in your document, you will want to
ensure that it is used consistently and complements other
document colors. This is particularly important when
integrating color graphics and/or images.

Headings

In your instructions, make good use of headings. Normally,
you want headings for any background section you might
have, the equipment and supplies section, a general
heading for the actual instructions section, and subheadings
for the individual tasks or phases within that section. Take
a look at the examples at the beginning of this chapter. See
headings (https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/
headings.html) for common requirements.

Lists

Similarly, instructions typically make heavy use of lists,
particularly numbered vertical lists for the actual step-by-
step explanations. Simple vertical lists or two-column lists
268 Katrina Peterson

are usually good for the equipment and supplies section.

In-sentence lists are good whenever you give an overview

of  things            to  come.  See  lists

(https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/lists.html)

for common requirements.

Number, Abbreviations, and Symbols

Instructions also use plenty of numbers, abbreviations, and
symbols. Follow the link for guidelines
(https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/
gram2.html#numbers) on these areas.

Precautionary Statements/Warnings

You must alert readers to possibilities in which they may
damage their equipment, waste supplies, cause the
procedure to fail, injure themselves or others--even
seriously or fatally. Companies have been sued for missing,
poorly written, and out-of-place warnings. Figure 4
provides an example of a clear precautionary statement.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 269

Figure 4: The precautionary statement stands out and comes
before any steps are taken. The warning is placed at the beginning,
before any of the steps, because missing the warning could result
in material damage or bodily harm.

      All procedures that require warnings must also have
precautionary statements at the beginning as part of the
introductory material. Warnings must also be dispersed
throughout the procedure. It is especially important to
include warnings before a step where damage or injury
could occur. Do not create instructions where the user has
already completed the process and injured themselves
before the warning comes. If someone is injured as the
result of misplaced, hidden, or omitted warnings, the
technical writer can be held accountable. Notices, on the
other hand, including user information and tips, are
typically placed after a step (see figure 5 below).
270 Katrina Peterson

Figure 5: In this example, the notice is indented and follows the
step because the information in the notice does not concern
material or bodily harm.

      Also, remember legal and ethical obligations. It is the
writer's job to protect the reader from harm or damage.
That being said, any set of instructions needs a careful
balance of warnings strategically placed throughout the
document. If the writer overuses them, there is a risk of
scaring the user. Alternatively, a reader may become numb
to the warnings if there are too many of them, and may start
ignoring the warnings.

      If the writer under-uses warnings, there is a risk of
someone getting injured. Strike a balance.

      There are standard precautionary statements that are
color-coded and used for danger, warnings, cautions, and
notes or notices (see above, or you may review them here:
Precautionary Statements) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Precautionary_statement) . You will be expected to
incorporate information from this link into the instructions
you create for the course.

8.7 Revision Checklist

As you reread and revise your instructions, watch out for
problems such as the following:

         · Make sure you provide real
            instructions--explanations of how to build,
            operate, or repair something.

         · Write a good introduction--in it, indicate the
            exact procedure to be explained, indicate
            audience requirements, and provide an overview
            of contents.

         · Make sure that you use the various types of lists
            wherever appropriate. In particular, use
            numbered vertical lists for sequential steps.

         · Use headings to mark off all the main sections
            and subheadings for subsections. Remember
            that no heading "Introduction" is needed
            between the title and the first paragraph.

         · Use precautionary statements as appropriate.

         · Use graphics to illustrate any key actions or
            objects.

         · Provide additional supplementary explanation of
            the steps as necessary.

         · Remember to create a section listing equipment
            and supplies, if necessary.

8.9 Activity - Sample Technical Instructions
Analysis

Find a set of sample instructions. Look in your junk draw,
under the refrigerator, or wherever those instructions end
up after you have finished setting up the product. As a last
resort you can look online.

      The sample you find should be a set of instructions,
not specifications or a procedure. The main difference
between instructions and specifications is that
specifications are written for experts in a particular field.
Instructions are typically for novices. User manuals are
a separate category that often contain instructions within
them. If you find a manual for this assignment, be sure to
concentrate on the instructions part.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 273

      Use the questions below to analyze the sample
instructions you find. Note that professional instructions
do not always use the same headings as those below. For
example, they almost never use a heading of
"Introduction," but rather include introductory information
under other headings.

Introductory Sections

Analyze the content of the introductory sections. Identify
and explain each of the elements of the introduction (see
above). Are there any left out? Why? Is there anything
in the introduction that does not seem to be covered by
the elements described above? What is their purpose? Are
there any other features that are especially noteworthy?
Who is the audience for these instructions? Include
analysis of any precautionary statements here.

Body Sections

Analyze the body sections. Identify and explain how the
instructions meet (or fail to meet) the requirements for the
body section identified in this book. Do the instructions
contain anything not mentioned in this chapter? What and
why? Are there any other features that are especially
noteworthy?

Conclusion Sections

Analyze the conclusion sections. How do the sample
instructions measure up to what is described above? What
types of information is contained in the conclusion? Is
274 Katrina Peterson

there anything not mentioned here? Any other noteworthy
features?

Graphics and Design

Analyze the design and graphics. (See chapter 5.) Briefly
explain how the instructions measure up to what you
learned in the design chapter. How do they adhere, or how
do they miss the mark? Explain. Do they use a variety
of graphics? Are there enough? Too many? Anything else
noteworthy about graphics or design?

Chapter 9: Proposals

Staci Bettes

Chapter Synopsis

This chapter defines when, where, and how you should use
a proposal. Before drafting, you define some preliminary
qualities, including if the proposal is written for internal or
external audiences, is solicited or unsolicited, and if you
are proposing a known or unknown solution. Next, the
chapter discusses further considerations for your audience,
followed by a breakdown of common sections present in
most proposals. As proposal content can vary depending
on the type and purpose and audience, a section is included
with additional, project-specific sections which could be
included in your proposal, such as client analysis and
implementation. The standard design and format of a
proposal is discussed, with emphasis on adaptability for the
reader. The end of this chapter contains a revision checklist
for proposals.

9.1 Introduction

This chapter focuses on the proposal--a type of document
that gets you or your organization approved or hired to
complete a project, or requests time and resources to study
difficult problems. The proposal is your opportunity to
pitch your idea for change (oftentimes an improvement)
within an organization, or to draft a research plan to

                                     277
278 Katrina Peterson

investigate an issue that is of concern to your institution.
Proposals often demonstrate that a problem or opportunity
exists that needs attention, and addresses a very specific
audience, one with the authority to move your suggestions
forward.

      A proposal is an offer or bid to complete a project
for someone. They may contain other elements--technical
background, recommendations, results of surveys,
information about feasibility, and so on. But what makes
a proposal "a proposal" is it asks the audience to approve,
fund, or grant permission to do the proposed project. It
should contain information that would enable the reader to
decide whether to approve a project, to approve or hire you
to do the work, or both. To write a successful proposal, put
yourself in the place of your audience--the recipient of the
proposal--and think about what sorts of information that
person(s) would need in order to feel confident having you
complete the project.

      It is easy to confuse proposals with other kinds of
documents in technical writing. Imagine that you have a
terrific idea for installing some new technology where you
work, and you write up a document explaining how it
works, showing the benefits and then urging management
to install it. All by itself, this would not be a complete
proposal. This is a feasibility report, which studies the
merits of a project and then recommends for or against
it. However, all it would take to make this document a
proposal would be to add elements that ask management
for approval for you to go ahead with the project. A main
difference between a proposal and other documents is that
a proposal will sell the writer (or the writer's organization)
as the one to complete a future project.

      In a technical writing course, the proposal assignment
is an opportunity for you to present an idea you have
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 279

to improve a certain aspect of a company, organization,
center, or other business. It is written to a specific, known
reader, who has the power to approve or deny your project.
A good proposal often leads to conducting research and
creating a report; therefore, whatever topic you choose,
you must be able to conduct research on it, which will
be integrated into that final report. In addition to primary
research such as interviews and surveys, if your technical
writing course requires that you integrate scholarly
research into your final report, choose a topic for which
you can readily find such material.

      Not all research topics are appropriate for technical
writing. Topics that are based on values and beliefs do not
fall into the category of technical. Historical and literary
topics do not qualify. For example, a proposal on the topic
"Gone with the Wind is the best book ever written" would
not be appropriate, as you cannot prove and verify an
opinion--everyone has their own taste. However, you
could write a proposal to research the feasibility of
declaring Gone with the Wind the "official novel" of
Atlanta, Georgia.

9.2 Types of Proposals

Consider the situations in which proposals occur. A
company may send out a public announcement requesting
proposals for a specific project. This public
announcement--called a request for proposals
(RFP)--could be issued through websites, emails, social
media, newspapers, or trade journals. Firms or individuals
interested in the project would then write proposals in
which they summarize their qualifications, project
schedules and costs, and discuss their approach to the
280 Katrina Peterson

project. The recipient of all these proposals would then
evaluate them, select the best candidate based on the plan
which best suits the company's needs, and then work up a
contract.

      But proposals can also be less formal. Imagine that
you are interested in doing a project at work (for example,
investigating the merits of bringing in new technology to
increase productivity). You met with your supervisor and
tried to convince her of this. She might respond by saying,
"Write me a proposal and I'll present it to upper
management." This is more like the kind of proposal you
will write in a technical writing course.

      There are several aspects of the proposal that you
need to determine before drafting. Identifying these factors
are vital to creating a proposal which will be
accepted--whether the proposal is written for internal or
external readers, the proposal is solicited or unsolicited,
and if the solution is known or unknown.

Figure 1: Types of Proposals
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 281

Internal or External

         · Internal: A proposal written to someone within
            your organization (a business, a government
            agency, etc.). With internal proposals, you may
            not have to include certain sections (such as
            qualifications) or as much information in them.
            For example, if your manager asks for ideas to
            improve the average time it takes to return
            customer inquiries, you would create an internal
            proposal.

         · External: A proposal written from one separate,
            independent organization or individual to
            another such entity. With an external proposal,
            you will need to not only persuade the reader
            that you have a solid plan, but establish your
            credibility with the reader. The typical example
            is an independent consultant proposing to do a
            project for another firm.

Solicited or Unsolicited

         · Solicited: The recipient has requested the
            proposal. If you have been asked to submit a
            proposal, it is considered solicited. The
            solicitation may come in the form of a direct
            verbal or written request, but normally
            solicitations are indirect, open-bid to the public,
            and formally published for everyone to see. A
            request for proposal (RFP), request for quotation
            (RFQ), and invitation for bid (IFB) are common
            ways to solicit business proposals for business,
            industry, and the government.
282 Katrina Peterson

       Proposals can also be solicited on a local level. For
       example, you could be explaining to your boss about
       a new software you think should be installed in the
       office; your boss might get interested and ask you to
       write up a proposal that offered to do a formal study
       of the idea.

         · Unsolicited: The recipient has not requested
            your proposal. With unsolicited proposals, you
            sometimes must convince the recipient that a
            problem or need exists before you can begin the
            main part of the proposal. Unsolicited proposals
            are the "cold calls" of business writing. They
            require a thorough understanding of the market,
            product and/or service, and their presentation is
            typically general rather than customer-specific.
            They can, however, be tailored to specific
            businesses with time and effort, and the
            demonstrated knowledge of specific needs or
            requirement can transform an otherwise generic,
            brochure-like proposal into an effective sales
            message.

       Getting your tailored message to your target
       audience is often a significant challenge if it is
       unsolicited. Unsolicited proposals are often regarded
       as marketing materials, intended more to stimulate
       interest for a follow-up contact than make direct
       sales. A targeted proposal is your most effective
       approach, but you should recognize the importance
       of gaining company, service, or brand awareness as
       well as its limitations.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 283

Known Solution or Unknown Solution

         · Unknown Solution: You can identify a
            problem, but are unsure what the solution is
            without further inquiry. Your proposal will focus
            on describing the problem, showing need for
            improvement, and planning research to discover
            the most effective solution. With an unknown
            solution, you may have a hypothesis--an idea
            that you think will solve the problem. However,
            this "educated guess" needs to be proven or
            disproven through research. The findings and
            recommendations will be included in a future
            report (e.g. recommendation report). For
            example, you notice that the office computers
            are lagging and crashing often, but are unsure
            why. You would propose research on making the
            computers more efficient.

         · Known Solution: Instead of focusing on a
            problem that needs research, your proposal
            focuses on feasibility--i.e. can a specific
            solution resolve the problem, and what is the
            best way to implement the specific action, item,
            or idea? You propose research on areas such as
            cost, effectivity, location, and other factors
            connected to your solution. An example of a
            known solution is proposing your department
            replace a dozen 2016 Dell computers with the
            newest MacBook Pro model in an effort to
            improve computer speed, decrease user
            frustration, and increase employee productivity.

9.3 Proposal Purpose and Audience

Remember that, in a technical writing course, the proposal
assignment serves several purposes:

         · It gives you some experience in writing formal
            requests.

         · It gets you started planning your major
            assignment.

         · It gives your instructor a chance to work with
            you on your project, to make sure you have a
            viable topic.

For the second and third reasons, you need to include
specific elements in your proposal (as noted in your
assignment sheet), some of which may not seem
appropriate in a real-world proposal.

      The proposal is often the beginning of a weeks-long
research and writing process that goes through many stages
until it gets to the end point: the recommendation report.
In this case, you only submit the proposal once during this
process; in a real-world setting, you may have to submit
a proposal multiple times--making corrections, adding
details to your research plan--before you receive approval
to move forward with the project. And even after
submitting the proposal and receiving permission, you
may need to write and submit additional documents along
the way such as: a progress report, an outline, an annotated
bibliography, a graphics draft, a recommendation report
draft, and a final recommendation report. Be careful to use
the term proposal only if you are specifically referring to
the proposal stage of your project.

      Another point to keep in mind relates to the audience
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 285

for different kinds of documents that may be produced
for the same project. Consider the example of a proposal
written to a supervisor at a solar power company
suggesting the creation of a policy manual for residential
installers. The proposal's audience may be an executive,
whose knowledge of the technicalities is very broad. Let us
imagine the executive approves the proposal and requests
completion of the manual, which will be produced
well after the proposal. The manual's audience is the
technicians, who may have more specialized knowledge
than the executive. The content and language used for these
two different audiences will need to be adjusted to fit the
writing situation. (See chapter 2)

      To write for the specific document's audience, it is
a good idea to define your reader and sketch out some
qualities about them before you begin drafting. This
information will help you effectively persuade the reader
to approve your proposed project, and help you stay on
task writing for that reader. It can also help you shape
your proposed research strategy and guide the type of
information you include in your proposal.

      Ask yourself:

       1. Who is your reader? Your reader should be
            someone with decision-making authority over
            your problem. Theoretically, they could
            implement any changes you ultimately suggest.
            They are an action-taker in a corporation,
            organization, business, or agency.

       2. What type of reader are they? Expert,
            technician, executive, gatekeeper, and/or non-
            specialist?

       3. What is their background and knowledge
286 Katrina Peterson

            level on the topic? What are their needs and
            interests? What will likely persuade them to
            approve your proposed idea? Wants? Values?
            For example, if you want to request time and
            resources to investigate whether changing your
            company's workweek schedule from a standard
            five days to four extended work days, you
            would want to frame the idea in terms that
            management would be interested in--increases
            in productivity, savings in building upkeep and
            utilities, and so on.

9.4 Common Proposal Sections

The following provides a review of the sections you will
commonly find in proposals. Do not assume that these
sections must be in every proposal you write, nor that
they have to be in the order they are listed. Refer to the
assignment sheet provided by your instructor (or if on the
job, review all content and submission requirements) and
consider other kinds of information unique to your topic
that should be included in your particular proposal.

      Most proposals include the following sections:
Introduction; Description of the problem, opportunity, or
situation; Background of the problem; Method and
procedure; a Schedule; Cost and required resources;
Benefits and feasibility; Conclusion; and References.
Technical and Professional Writing Genres 287

     Figure 2: Common Proposal Sections

Introduction

Plan the introduction to your proposal carefully. Make sure
it contains all the following rhetorical moves (but not
necessarily in this order) that apply to your particular
proposal:

      A) Define the subject. Make it clear to the reader what
the topic will be.

      B) State the purpose of the document. The purpose
of proposals is typically to request time and resources to
study a problem, develop a new product, or investigate
previously proposed solutions, etc.

      C) State the main point of the document. The main
point is often to convince your reader (usually a supervisor
or client) that the proposed project is deserving of
approval. Be clear and concise about why you wrote the
proposal and what action you want the reader to take.

      D) Stress the importance of studying this problem or
implementing your solution. The importance may relate to
the topic's urgency.

      E) Develop at least one brief motivating statement that
will encourage the recipient to read on and to consider
approving the project (especially if it is an unsolicited or
competitive proposal).

      F) Forecast the organization of the proposal. Give an
overview of the contents in the document.

Description of the Problem, Opportunity, or
Situation

Often occurring just after the introduction, this section
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 289

discusses what has brought about the need for the project--
it introduces, then states and discusses the problem--what
problem, what opportunity exists for improving things,
what the basic situation is. It is helpful to cover the 5 W's
of the problem (who, what, where, when, and why). For
example, management of a chain of day care centers may
need to ensure that all employees know CPR because of
new state mandate. You would explain the mandate, that all
employees are not yet properly trained, and how this can
affect child safety and state licensing.

Background of the Problem

You may also want to include background on the problem.
While a known audience for the proposal may understand
the problem very well, writing the background section is
useful in demonstrating your particular view of the
problem. In these cases, you can give background
information as part of the description of the problem, the
causes of the problem, previous solutions to the problem,
and the consequences--both short and long term--of
leaving the situation unaddressed. On the other hand, if
the proposal is unsolicited, a separate background section
is almost a requirement--you will need to convince the
audience that the problem or opportunity exists, has
urgency, and should be addressed in a timely manner.

Method and Procedure

In most proposals, you will need to explain how you will
go about completing the proposed work. This acts as an
additional persuasive element; it shows the audience you
have a sound, thoughtful approach to the project. Also,
290 Katrina Peterson

it serves to demonstrate that you have the knowledge of
the field to complete it. Often, the method and procedure
section begins with several, tangibly stated research goals
before being divided into three or more individual phases.
For example, you might state that you want to "compare
OSU's dining options to those of other universities" or
"interview at least two professional experts in the field."
The individual phases then outline how research will be
performed as a way of creating a comprehensive approach
to the topic. (See chapter 10 for different types of research)
For each phase, you will identify the type of research you
will perform and any critical details associated with it (e.g.
Why is a certain database or website reliable? Who
aggregates the information, how long have they been doing
so? Do they have an agenda? Or why was a certain person
chosen to be interviewed? What can you disclose about
their professional background that will convince the reader
of your proposal that this is an appropriate person to
interview and a good use of your time?). In addition to
these major and minor details, you will also want to reveal
the deliverables or outcomes expected, and justify your
research decisions.

Schedule

Most proposals contain a section that shows not only the
projected completion date but also key milestones for the
project. If you are doing a large project spreading over
many months, the timeline would also show dates on which
you would deliver progress reports. (See chapter 11 for
Progress Report content and style) It is often helpful to
back plan your schedule--work backwards from your due
date to set important deadlines. If you cannot cite specific
dates, cite amounts of time for each phase of the project.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 291

Costs and Required Resources

Most proposals also contain a section detailing the costs
of the project. With external projects, you may need to list
your hourly rates, projected hours, costs of equipment and
supplies, and so forth, and then calculate the total cost of
the complete project. Internal projects, of course, are not
free, so you should still list the project costs--hours you
will need to complete the project, equipment and supplies
you will be using, assistance from other people in the
organization, and so on. These costs and resources are
based on your needs to complete the research, not for
implementing your solution--that information will appear
in the report.

Benefits and Feasibility of the Proposed Project

Most proposals briefly discuss the advantages or benefits
of completing the proposed project. This acts as a type
of argument in favor of approving the project. There is
little reason why your proposal should be accepted if there
are no meaningful benefits. Thus, be sure to show that
your solution will result in substantial benefits for the
organization. Some proposals discuss the likelihood of the
project's success. In an unsolicited proposal, this section is
especially important--you are trying to sell the audience
on the project, so your stated benefits should appeal to the
reader's wants, needs, and values.

Conclusion

The final paragraph or section of the proposal should bring
readers back to focus on the positive aspects of the project.
292 Katrina Peterson

In the final section, you can urge them to contact you
to work out the details of the project (provide contact
information, even if listed at the beginning of the
document), remind them of the benefits of doing the
project, and maybe make one last argument for you or your
organization as the right choice for the project.

References

The reference page is a separate page where you list any
and all source information used in your proposal, properly
formatted, using a standard format in your field. List
information sources-- citations for specific books, articles,
reference works, and other kinds of sources used in your
report.

Project-Specific Sections

The preceding sections are typical or common in written
proposals, not absolute requirements. Always ask yourself
what else might your audience need to understand the
project, the need for it or the benefits arising from it, your
role in it, and your qualifications to do it. What else do they
need to see in order to approve the project and to approve
you to do it? Some special project-specific sections are
listed in the next section.

9.5 Project-Specific Sections

Depending on the writing situation, your proposal may
need to include other specialized sections. Your supervisor
might ask you to include any of the following sections:
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 293

Audience or client analysis, Solution, Method of operation,
Description of proposed work/Project results, Research,
Implementation, Team management, Risk management,
Legal clauses, and/or Appendices.

Figure 3: Project-Specific Sections Which May Appear in Your
Proposal

Audience/Client Analysis
Describe the audience of the final recommendation report
(which may be different than the audience for the proposal,
especially if the proposal is an internal document
[requesting time and permission from someone within the
organization] but the final report is an external document
[the recommendation can only be put into action by
someone outside the author's organization]). You may need
to discuss for whom the report is designed, their titles
and jobs, their technical background, and their ability to
understand the report.
294 Katrina Peterson

Solution

If you are writing a known-solution proposal, you may
want to include a section which focuses on your solution.
To create this section, you will need to do some research
on topic and use published source information. This section
will not present the solution to your problem. However,
it will discuss similar problems and solutions that have
been attempted in the past. This research will provide
information that may be used to formulate a solution
relative to your specific problem.

Methods of Operation

In known-solution proposals, this section will tell how the
solution will fit into and be used as a functional part of the
day to day operation of the company/business. Detail the
date you expect to launch the solution into the operation the
company, the place from where the solution will operate,
how it will operate, and who will be involved (identify
their responsibilities, duties, and any titles, certifications,
degrees, etc., needed).

Description of the Proposed Work (Results of the
Project)

Many proposals describe the finished product of the
proposed project. In a technical writing course, this means
describing the written document you propose to write
(a.k.a. recommendation report) as well as its audience and
purpose; providing an outline, and discussing items such
as length, use of graphics, binding, and so forth. In this
scenario, there may be other work such as conducting
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 295

training seminars or providing an ongoing service. At this
early stage, you might not know all that it will take to
complete your project, but you should at least have an idea
of some of the steps required.

Research

Provide research on your topic. Your sources should be
current, within the last two (2) or three (3) years if possible.
It may be helpful to focus on research journals or
newspapers for published articles, published interviews,
published speeches, etc. for topics which need then newest
statistics and information. You will need at least three or
four documents that address a problem similar to the one
you have chosen. Although you will not find your exact
situation/problem, you will find documents about similar
problems. These documents should have similar
populations, environments, workforces, etc. For example,
if you propose to implement a shuttle bus service from
the parking lot to your work place for efficiency, you may
find documents from other workplaces, with similar
circumstances, which experienced similar problems and
solved them by providing shuttle bus services. The
research will provide you with information that validates
your topic as a problem and your solution, as well as
validating your proposed implementation, methods of
operation, costs, and benefits as credible.

Implementation

In known-solution proposals, you may describe when, why,
and how the solution will be used for the first time. This
is similar to the Methods of operation section; however, it
296 Katrina Peterson

focuses on a trial period to see if the solution is feasible as
planned. Thus, you will pick a time that does not impact
the normal operation of existing programs/patterns of
operation/etc. In addition, describe the logics: the location,
who will be involved, costs, what is expected to happen,
the date and time, the duration, and so on. Explain why you
chose this time for implementing the solution. Identify how
you will observe and record the progress during this trial.

Team Management

If working in teams, this section addresses four main
points: a) When, where, and how frequently will your group
meet to discuss the ongoing progress of the project? b)
When not meeting in person, what methods and
technologies will the group use to communicate with one
another? c) How will conflicts between group members be
resolved? d) What roles will your group members serve
in the group structure? (See chapter 11 for information on
team roles and management)

Risk Management

This section lists possible issues that could occur during
the implementation of your proposal plan, with means to
overcome these issues. Information will include possible
roadblocks and what you will do to overcome these
setbacks. These can be technical hurdles, research-based
issues, scheduling obstacles, budgetary limits, or even
problems implementing your solution.
               Technical and Professional Writing Genres 297

Legal Clauses

Some proposals include legal clauses which outline any
legal or contractual agreements made for the project. In
the workforce, agreements are often made based on
performance, meeting deadlines, and/or quality of work,
which can affect payment or incur fees. Additionally, your
company may have boilerplate legal clauses to accompany
all written documents. These are common in many private
industries and governmental departments.

Appendices

Appendices contain any information that may be
interesting to the reader, but which are not completely
necessary to the proposal content. They may include full
summaries and responses, a problem analysis, and any
information that is meaningful to the proposal. For
example, a list of potential survey or interview questions
to be asked, common statistical data on the topic, or other
more in-depth information that helped shaped the project.
Appendices are generally usually labeled with letters
(Appendix A, Appendix B, etc.) and are the last
components of the document. (See chapter 11 for more
detail on appendices content)

9.6 Proposal Design and Style

Your proposal should be visibly attractive, but also easy to
read and follow standard format for the type of document
used. The most important part of any proposal is for the
298 Katrina Peterson

reader to easily find the information they need to approve
your project.

      Most proposals follow a standard block format--one
inch margins, single spaced text, skip one space between
paragraphs, with no paragraph indentation. You also need
headings and subheadings to identify and group areas of
content and specific sections. The headings levels should
contrast with one another, while remaining consistent
throughout the document. You may also have graphics in
your report, which should be designed to create a
consistent style with the text. Last, even though most of
your proposal is formatted in block paragraphs, you still
need to consider the major elements of design--contrast,
repetition, alignment, and proximity (CRAP). (See chapter
5 for more information on document design)

      Proposals are written in a professional, but not
bureaucratic, style. Think of this as a plain (non-literary)
style, but with some appeal to emotion (pathos). Make sure
you use terms that are easily understood by the audience
and define terms where necessary. Be as clear and concise
as possible.

      A professional appearance is a basic requirement. If
your document is less than professional, you can count on
its prompt dismissal. There should be no errors in spelling
or grammar, and all information should be concise,
accurate, and clearly referenced when appropriate.
Information that pertains to credibility should be easy to
find and relevant, including contact information. If the
document exists in a hard copy form, it should be printed
on a letterhead. If the document is submitted in an
electronic form, it should be in a file format that presents
your document as you intended. Word processing files may
have their formatting changed or adjusted based on factors
you cannot control--like screen size--and information can
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 299

shift out of place, making it difficult to understand. In
this case, PDF format may be used to preserve content
location and avoid any inadvertent format changes when it
is displayed.

9.7 Revision checklist for proposals

As you draft and revise your proposal, check for the
following:

         · Make preplanning decisions: Identify what
            kind of proposal you will be writing (internal/
            external; solicited/unsolicited; known or
            unknown solution) and identify the audience
            type, skill level, needs, and interests.

         · Use the right format: Often, proposals follow a
            block format, but check with your instructor or
            the proposal submission guidelines to insure you
            are using the format requested. If there are
            samples provided, use them for visual
            comparison.

         · Check submission guidelines: How should the
            proposal be submitted? What types of follow-up
            documents or actions are connected to your
            proposal if accepted? Who will these document
            address, and when are they required?

         · Draft your proposal: Make decisions about the
            type of content/sections to include in your
            proposal to meet the submission requirement,
            the requirements for the type of proposal, and
            the most effective way to present your idea to
            the reader.
300 Katrina Peterson

         · Style and Design: Ensure that the sections of
            your proposal are in a logical, natural order and
            that you use sub-headers and bullets (and any
            other formatting styles) correctly.

         · Revise, revise, revise: A less than professional,
            grammatically-incorrect proposal can be
            rejected. Ensure you have included all content
            necessary, and revise and edit to ensure clarity
            and correct style of the audience.

9.9 The Elevator Pitch

On the job, you may be asked to create smaller, more
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 309

concise proposals, often limited to a single page or, when
spoken, a few minutes. Busy decision-makers may not
have time to read a lengthy report, and want your proposal
parred down to the key points. These reports must focus
on capturing the audience's attention and delivering the
information as concisely as possible. Any extraneous
information is a waste of precious time. Clear and concise
proposals serve the audience well and limit the range of
information to prevent confusion.

      One type of brief report you may need to create is
the elevator pitch. An elevator pitch is a concise, oral
proposal, used to persuade the audience in a short amount
of time--often less than one minute. An elevator pitch
might be used by a salesperson to convince a local business
owner to stock her product, or by a screenwriter trying to
convince a movie executive to fund his film.

      The elevator pitch usually contains the following
information:

       1. Introduce yourself and provide your
            qualifications. People want to work with the
            person, not the idea. Making a good impression
            is key.

       2. If you are pitching to a general audience,
            describe your ideal client. This is not
            necessary if you are speaking to a single person,
            but you can let them know why you are pitching
            the idea to them, specifically.

       3. Grab the reader's attention. Include a good
            story, relevant quotes or epigrams, startling
            statistics, personal anecdotes, and rhetorical
            questions that engage the audience's
            participation or imagination These grab the
310 Katrina Peterson

            reader's attention, but also, people tend to walk
            away from a presentation remembering a story
            more than straight facts. Stories also make the
            audience more emotionally connected to the
            speaker.

       4. Summarize and describe your idea in a single
            sentence. Sometimes this summary might
            include a memorable slogan or motto.

       5. Include three compelling reasons why the
            audience might be interested. Remember to
            think about your audience's needs, wants, and
            values.

       6. Mention how your idea is special or unique.
            Why is your idea superior, more necessary, or
            needed now, as opposed to other ideas? You can
            also include benefits of the idea once
            implemented.

       7. End with a memorable statement about
            yourself. Like in Step 1, creating a personal link
            so the audience will want to work with you in
            the future. If possible, leave them with contact
            information, such as a business card or a
            handout of your pitch's highlights.

(See chapter 12 for tips on public speaking to help you
pitch your idea effectively)

Chapter 10: Research

Staci Bettes

Chapter Synopsis

In this chapter, you will learn how to plan for conducting
different types of research, depending on your research
goals. The chapter starts by giving information on creating
a hypothesis and research questions to guide your research.
After, you will learn about conducting both primary and
secondary research and when to choose one or the other.
Different kinds of primary and secondary research are
discussed, to help you decide which is best for your
specific project and needs. Information for creating your
own survey and interview questions is included, as well as
tips for evaluating secondary sources.

10.1 Introduction

With the abundance of research available today, often the
hardest part of research is deciding on the best type of
research for a specific project, and evaluating its validity
and effectiveness. What does it mean to be information
literate? Simply stated, information literacy is the ability to
locate, evaluate, and implement information efficiently.

      In college, you typically find, evaluate, and use
information to satisfy the requirements of an assignment.
Assignments often specify what kind of information you
need and what tools you should use or avoid in your

                                     313
314 Katrina Peterson

research. For example, your professor may specify that you
need three peer-reviewed academic articles and that you
should not cite Wikipedia in your final paper. However,
in life beyond college--especially the work world--you
may not have that kind of specific guidance. You may
also be asked to create your own data using techniques
such as interviews, surveys, and analysis, instead of using
published sources. Using research in the portions of your
document that require evidence can strengthen your
argument and help answer your research questions. At
other times, even if research is not actually necessary, it can
be persuasive and sharpen the points you want to make.

      Research is much more than doing a simple search
engine query and reviewing the first ten results it
returns--you need to be information literate in order to
plan and perform your own research efficiently, effectively,
and with the needs of your audience in mind. You must
also be able to incorporate unbiased, reliable data for your
projects.

10.2 Hypothesis and Research Questions

In the technical field, you may be asked to complete
research for several reasons. Research can be used to
confirm theories (hypotheses), gather information over a
topic and necessary services, describe a population, find
a solution to a problem, and/or to provide background
information. You will likely perform research for most, if
not all, the documents you create in class or the workplace.
For example, you may do background research on a group
of people to revise a document for that audience, such as
to tailor your résumé for a position at a specific business.
Or, you may research a problem in order to provide a
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 315

solution and present that research in a report. Depending
on the genre, you may need a specific type of research, or
a combination of several types. The type(s) of research you
choose should be based on your purpose, audience, and,
often when completing a research project, your hypothesis
and research questions.

Hypothesis

It can be difficult to decide where to start researching
for your task, especially if you are not given specific
guidelines. Most scientific or medical research begins with
a hypothesis. A hypothesis is tentative, testable answer to
a question. It is based on your current knowledge of the
situation or topic; therefore, it is a "guess" of what the
outcomes will be. For example, a pharmaceutical company
creates a new prescription strength sunscreen for people
with an elevated risk of melanoma. They theorize that daily
use of the sunscreen, applied every three hours with normal
sun exposure, will lower the risk of skin cancer by 75%.
This is a classic example of a hypothesis. You may or may
not be asked to create a hypothesis for a research topic. It
depends on the purpose and topic, or the type(s) of research
you need to produce.

      When you create a hypothesis for your problem or
topic, it is always written as a statement. It is predictive in
nature and typically used when some knowledge already
exists on the topic. In the sunscreen example above,
scientists in the pharmaceutical industry should have
knowledge on how the product and individual compounds
work before it goes to clinical trials. Based on your
hypothesis, you can collect data, analyze it, use it to
support or negate the hypothesis, and (eventually) arrive at
a conclusion at the end of the research.
316 Katrina Peterson

      Hypotheses work to limit the scope of your research.
A complete hypothesis should include the variable, the
population, and the predicted relationship between the
variables. For example, some limits on the sunscreen
example are the number of applications per day and a
"normal" amount of exposure (as opposed to working
outside all day without protective clothing). A hypothesis
also applies to a specific population--in this case, people
with elevated melanoma risk. Once established, a
hypothesis will guide your research for credible outcomes.

Research Questions

Whether or not you create a hypothesis, you will often
create research questions to help direct your research.
These questions need to be answered through your research
for you to thoroughly investigate and analyze a topic. What
are the major questions that need to be answered for you
to create a solid conclusion about your topic? For example,
imagine you are asked to research the effect of final exams
on student academic success. There are many areas you
could choose to focus on--student mental or physical
health, knowledge attainment and/or recall, effectiveness
of timed exams, cumulative exams versus application of
materials, and so on. As there are so many aspects of this
topic, you will most likely not have time to adequately
research all of them. Establishing research questions will
help you focus your research on specific areas of the topic.

      How do you decide which areas are the right areas to
research? Base your decision on factors such as:

       1. What is your area(s) of interest?

       2. What will be most likely to persuade the reader?
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 317

            (Did they ask for a specific type or area of
            research? What is their main goal for the
            research? What do they want to alter, improve,
            or disprove? Which of the audience's needs,
            wants, or values might help guide your
            research?)

       3. What areas can you feasibly research within the
            time frame or any other limitations you have?

       4. Are there any areas where research seems to be
            missing or underdeveloped on the topic?

Once you decide on a few areas of focus, you can construct
research questions to help guide you. Normally, three or
more questions are standard for a topic. They should be
written in the form of a question and must be inquisitive
in nature. A properly written question will be clear and
concise, and contain the topic being studied (purpose), the
variable(s), and the population. If you were doing research
on the final exam example above for a university's Student
Affairs office, your research questions might be:

         · What is the current system for final exams,
            and what are the reason(s) for its structure and
            schedule?

         · How does the current system compare to
            other similar universities, including scheduling,
            exam grades, GPA, and overall graduation rates?

         · Have any connections been proven between
            the final exam system and student academic
            success or failure?

The type of question you choose depends on the best way
you can study your topic and your hypothesis. The
318 Katrina Peterson

following list includes the six main types of research
questions:

         · Comparative questions: look for the
            similarities and differences between multiple
            variables.

         · Causal questions: look for relationships
            between two or more occurrences.

         · Descriptive questions: seek out a description
            and explanation for a specific situation.

         · Exploratory questions: help try to better
            understand something through observation.

         · Predictive questions: determine what will
            happen in the future or if a change happens.

         · Interpretive questions: gather feedback on a
            topic or perception without altering the
            outcome.

After creating your questions, you will need to decide the
best type(s) of research to help you answer them.

      Figure 1: Types of Research Questions Activity

10.3 Choosing Research Types

There are numerous types of research and source types
available to complete your research. The type of research
you choose should be based on the rhetorical situation of
the document, as well as the assumptions you make about
the main audience. For example, for a basic argumentative
essay, you generally use secondary research from
published, peer-reviewed sources. However, with technical
documents, the type of research will often vary. For
instance, if you are creating a proposal on a community
issue, you may incorporate local news sources stories about
the topic and community demographics, in addition to
creating a community survey.

      No source type is better or worse than others. What
matters is that it addresses the following areas for your
specific topic, genre, and audience. Does it:
320 Katrina Peterson

         · Help you learn more background information?

         · Answer your research question?

         · Convince your audience that your answer is
            correct?

         · Describe the situation surrounding your research
            question?

         · Report what others have said about your
            research question(s)?

Source types are generally divided into two main
categories--primary research and secondary research.
Primary Research is research that you collect and create
yourself. This can include activities such as observing your
environment, conducting surveys or interviews, directly
recording measurements in a lab or in the field, or even
receiving electronic data recorded by computers/machines.
Secondary Research is research that uses data and ideas
that have been collected and analyzed by other individuals
and published for others' use.

Data Triangulation

For your research to be considered valid, it is often
recommended that you triangulate your data. By
triangulate, we mean that you include information from
three different kinds of sources. For example, if you were
researching the possible environmental effects of a new
chemical plant built near a local river, you may choose
to interview environmental biologists about the potential
risks of the plant's location, research national incidences of
plant constructions near large bodies of water, and compare
official water quality analytics from before and after the
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 321

chemical plant appeared. Using three types of data is
standard in academic publishing and scientific research;
varied types of information work together to create a
complex, larger argument. This also makes you, the author,
appear more credible and your research more thorough.

      As you begin your research process, keep a few ideas
in mind.

      1. Choose your research type based on what will
yield data for your research question(s).

      2. Ensure you have enough time to feasibly deliver
your research in the time you have to complete a project.

      3. Choose research and data that is ethical. (See
chapter 4 for more information on ethics and research)

10.4 Types of Primary Research

Sometimes, the information you need is not yet written
or published. For example, if you are creating a report
over the feasibility of implementing a food pantry on your
college campus, you will not likely find published data on
how many enrolled students would actively contribute to
the pantry. In these situations, you need to create your own
data to back up your argument or answer your research
question. These sources--where you create your own

data--are known as primary sources. Below are details

on several common types of primary research: interviews,
surveys, polls, observations, and data or map analysis.
322 Katrina Peterson

Interview
     Interviews are one-on-one conversations

between the interviewer and a person who has
unique insight into the topic. Most of us use people
as sources in our private lives, such when we ask a
friend for a restaurant recommendation or whether
a movie is worth watching. While we may ask
people for their input daily, interviews are a formal
way of gathering insider information on a topic
we may otherwise lack. There are several factors
you must consider when doing an interview for
research purposes.

     When choosing an interviewee, think about
what type of information you need. Who can give
you this insight? Who has the details? Can one
person answer, or do you need multiple
interviews? "Experts" are not just researchers with
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 323

PhDs doing academic work. People can speak with
authority for different reasons. They can have
subject expertise (having done scholarship in the
field), societal position (a relevant work title), or
special experience (living or working in a
particular situation). An up-close, firsthand view
of the situation gives them the authority to speak
as an expert on the topic.

     There are several types of interviews to
choose from. Choose the type based on the topic,
the type of person(s) you wish to interview, and
what is convenient for the interviewee. Some
interview types include:

       · Individual face-to-face: The standard
          interview, used for non-shy participants
          willing to share their thoughts on the
          topic.

       · Telephone: A good option when travel is
          not possible, but it can be difficult to
          fully document the conversation.

       · Email: A good option when schedules
          are conflicting; it allows for interviewee
          to respond at their convenience.

       · Focus Group: Useful when a solo
          participant is hesitant or when you want
          to ask the same question(s) to multiple
          people.

In an interview, you want to ask questions to get insider
details, unique observations, and experiences with the topic
or current situation. Encourage the telling of stories and
324 Katrina Peterson

anecdotes. The best way to get insider information and

detailed answers to is ask open-ended questions, or
questions that ask for extensive details as opposed
to single-word answers. (See section 10.5 for tips
on writing open-ended questions) These details
can add depth and insight to your topic, and
sometimes even direct you to other areas you had
not thought to research. Do not be surprised if
an interview takes you off in completely new
directions, one that turns out to be much more
interesting than the direction you were following
before.

     Of course, interview content must be
evaluated just like any other. Like any other source
material, the answers and data you gather could
be biased. Keep that possible bias in mind when
using the information. That is part of exercising
the critical thinking that research assignments are
famous for producing. Potentially biased or not,
sometimes a source's firsthand experience is best,
and recognizing what they offer can help you open
up to diverse ideas and worldviews that you would
otherwise miss. Use good interview techniques,
such as putting the interviewee at ease, using
active listening techniques to encourage them to
talk, asking follow up questions, and thanking
them at the end of the interview.

      Survey

     Paper or electronic surveys provide answers to
questions related to the topic. But be aware that
answers are often limited by the survey author,
meaning the data gathered is only as good as the
questions asked. Surveys are used to learn more
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 325

about a specific group of people (also known as a
sample), and include localized information such as
attitudes, habits, or need for change.

     You must first decide what type of information
you need to know. What is the purpose of the
survey? Who and what do you want to know more
about? Surveys will target a certain group of
people with specific characteristics. For example,
if you wish to research the effectiveness of a new
policy in the workplace, you would want to get
responses from all departments that are affected
by the policy--not just from one department. This
group of people is called a sample. Your sample
may have broad or limited characteristics, but it
is important to target those who have the
characteristics you desire.

     The main categories of surveys are hardcopy
(paper) and electronic. Your choice will depend
on the topic and the sample--where and how are
the best places to target your intended sample of
people? In the above example, if you focus on
employees of the business, you may get more
responses by handing out paper surveys in the
break room or by going desk-to-desk if you have
a fairly mobile or collaborative workplace.
However, if the workplace is more reserved or
work is individual, an emailed electronic survey
may be more effective. More often, people choose
electronic surveys for convenience and distribute
them via listservs, company email lists, and social
media. On the job, your company may provide
access to paid software, but there are many free
326 Katrina Peterson

options available, such as Google Forms,
SurveyMonkey, and SurveyGizmo.

     Unlike an interview, with surveys you want
to mainly ask closed questions--questions where
you offer a limited amount of responses to choose
from. You can use some open questions, but most
often you will provide the answer options (e.g.,
"Do you consider the following statement true or
false?" or "How many times a week do you work
out: a) 1-2 times; b) 3-4 times; c) 5-6 times; d) 7 or
more times?"; e) Never).

     For a successful survey, you will usually need
two types of questions: demographic questions
and content questions. Demographic questions ask
for general characteristics of the respondent, such
as age, location, or gender. The type of
demographic questions you ask will depend on
the sample for the survey. Content questions are
questions about the topic you are researching. (See
section 10.5 for tips on writing closed-ended
questions) These give insight into the respondent's
feelings and knowledge of the topic you are
researching.

      Poll

     Similar to a survey, a poll is a single, closed
question asked of the target sample. The goal of
a poll question is to gauge user's feelings toward
an idea, usually in one simple question--who is
interested? Who has heard of this topic? Would the
audience be interested in implementing a certain
change? For example, perhaps you wish to know
how many people in your workplace would prefer
four day per week work schedule, you could easily
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 327

create a poll question to get this information. You
will not receive in-depth information with a single
poll question; therefore, poll questions should be
used in conjunction with other forms of research
when used for professional research.

      Observation

     Observation is watching and describing an
issue first hand, to create colorful descriptions and
detail. Observation is a good choice when you
want to learn more about the situation as it
naturally occurs. Observe the issue when it is
happening, based on prior knowledge. You will
want to observe the issue more than once
(preferably vary dates and times) to see if any
patterns develop, if the magnitude of the problem
differs from your original assessment, or if the
problem is connected to other areas you may have
not considered.

     Observation should focus on recording details
and creating detailed descriptions of the event.
First-person observation is best, though you can
get some insight from recorded images. The
drawback of prerecorded images is that you only
get information from one perspective, and may
miss out on other observable sensory input;
therefore, it is better to observe and make notes
first hand.

     The data needs to be verifiable--not just
general impressions. Focus on specific incidents
and conversations, describe the setting, and
provide other concrete details that can be verified
or observed via instrumentation. Record and
describe your impressions in the moment; do not
328 Katrina Peterson

rely solely on memories. For example, a common
issue across the university campus is crowding in
the Student Union during lunch. Observing and
recording details during lunch would allow you
to describe the issue, identify different aspects of
the problem, and later provide solutions based on
your observations. However, you must make
observations in a reliable way. If you wanted to
determine whether there was sufficient seating in
the Student Union during the lunch hour, it would
not be enough to simply describe the dining area as
"busy" or "crowded" around lunchtime. Instead,
scientifically determine how busy and crowded the
dining area is, perhaps by counting how many
seats opened up within a given time period, or by
count how many people ate their meal standing or
sitting on the floor.

      Data or Map Analysis

     If your group has a topic that involves
paperwork, data sheets, maps, or other document
types, you may incorporate their analysi into your
primary research. If you are doing research on
specific issues in a building or business (number
of available outlets, renovation or expansion plans,
lack of office space for new employees, etc.), you
could analyze blueprints, maps, or data
spreadsheets. Imagine you are researching outlet
availability in the campus library. You could
consult maps of the library to see the current outlet
locations and wiring accessibility. You could
compare these maps to older versions of the library
setup, or compare to maps of similar libraries to
see how they provide enough outlets for students.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 329

If possible, use at least three similar documents for
analysis to show a trend.

10.5 Creating Interview and Survey
Questions

To prepare for several types of primary research
(mainly interviews, polls, and surveys) you will
need to create questions. The content of the
questions should align with your research goals.
These questions can be divided into two
types--open-ended questions and closed-ended
questions.

     Before you begin drafting your surveys,
interviews, or polls, you should learn as much
about the topic--and your sample--as possible.
Conducting secondary research on the topic and
sample can help you get a solid foundation for
your primary research. This will help you
construct questions that glean solid data and help
you tailor the research to the respondent(s). Then,
construct your interview, survey, and poll
questions to help "fill in the gap" created by
missing or incomplete research on the topic.

      Writing Open-Ended Questions

     Open-ended questions are structured to
encourage detailed responses which focus on the
respondent's experiences or feelings. The point is
to encourage a lengthier answer; these questions
should be asked in a way that requires more than
a "yes/no" response. Open-ended questions are
330 Katrina Peterson

especially important for interviews. For example,
you may ask someone, "What do you think about
the candidates running for mayor?" This is an
open-ended question that encourages a detailed
response. To create open-ended questions, it is
helpful to begin the question with words and
phrases such as explain, describe, tell me about, or
walk me through your experience with....

      Writing Closed-Ended Question

     Closed-ended questions are structured to limit
the available responses, usually to a single word,
number, or phrase option. In the case of survey
and poll questions, you can limit the response even
further by providing answer choices. A closed-
question version of the mayor example above is,
"Which candidate for mayor do you like the
most?" with the candidates' names listed as
answer options. Or "Do you believe the current
campus dining options provide enough variety for
vegetarian diners?"

      Question Types

     When you create closed questions for a survey
or poll, you will also make decisions about the
type of questions you use. There are several types
of common questions types to choose from,
including but not limited to: Ranking Scales,
Agreement Scales, Yes/No Questions, Multiple
Choice, and Check All That Apply.

     The type of question you choose will depend
on the type of information you want to know.
Below are two similar questions and answer
options; however, the type of data gathered will
be different. Imagine you are researching different
types of campus improvements. If you ask
students to "Check all that apply," you can see
which ideas are generally popular or unpopular. If
you ask the students to "Rank" the ideas, you can
use the data to infer which is the most popular,
second most popular, and so forth. It is a slight
distinction, but can make a difference during data
analysis.

Figure 4: Comparing Question for Different Data Results.

Creating Answers
You must give appropriate response choices for all closed

questions. The type of responses will vary
according to what type of info you need to know,
how you can get as much variation/good data as
possible, and also the type of question you ask.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 333

You should include at least one null answer option
for most questions. For example, no answer,
prefer not to answer, or other. This option allows
respondents to answer questions when their option
is not provided and/or continue the survey if a
question makes them uncomfortable.

     Common Issues

      Regardless of whether you create an open or closed

question, you should avoid negatively worded
questions, double-barreled questions, and biased
questions.

         · Negatively worded questions: ask for negative
            data. For example, if you asked, "How many
            times per week are you unable to access the
            door lock after hours?" you are asking for how
            many times something does not occur. This type
            of phrasing can confuse some respondents,
            which could lead to bad data. It is best to revise
            these questions to ask for a positive amount,
            such as "How many times per week are you able
            to access the door lock after hours?"

         · Double-barreled questions: ask about two or
            more ideas, such as, "How many times per week
            do you speak with staff and administration when
            you have a problem?" This question asks about
            two different ideas--speaking with staff and
            speaking with administration. The amount of
            contact per week could vary greatly between
            these two groups. In cases such as these, revise
            the question to address only one topic or split
            into multiple questions.

         · Biased questions: make assumptions about the
334 Katrina Peterson

            respondent or lead the reader to an answer. For
            example, "How many times a week do you
            encounter the terrible seating situation at the
            Student Union?" will encourage your audience
            to view the seating situation as "terrible" even if
            they had not previously considered the situation
            to be problematic. It can be difficult to not
            implant ideas, confuse the participant, or
            compile misleading information. For example,
            imagine you work for an ice cream company,
            and need to prove that chocolate ice cream is the
            most popular flavor. You ask in your survey,
            "Do you like chocolate ice cream?"
            Respondents will probably say "yes." However,
            this is not a complete survey. Just because a
            person likes chocolate ice cream does not mean
            it is the most popular flavor. Instead, you should
            ask several questions, one of which might
            specifically ask respondents to reveal their
            favorite ice cream flavor.

At other times, you may lead the respondent with phrasing
or make assumptions of how the respondent answered
earlier questions. For example, if you are doing research
over extending library hours, you could ask:

         · Do you think the library should extend their
            hours?

       Yes / No / Maybe / NA

         · When should they extend they extend their
            hours?

       4-6am / 12-2am / Open 24 hrs
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 335

         · What technology do you want to improve at the
            library?

       printers / more computers / more outlets
      In the above example, the second question is written
as though the answer to the first question will be Yes, but
that may not be the case. What if the person answered No
or Maybe to the first question? The second question has no
option to allow for dissent or disagreement. Also, question
three assumes that the respondents want to improve
something technology-related (without them saying so),
and the responses limit the answers to only three areas of
technological improvement.
      Once you have decided on the type of information
you need from your surveys or interviews, make sure you
go back and revise your question structure and phrasing
to avoid bad data through negatively-worded questions,
double-barreled questions, and biased phrasing.

10.6 Performing Secondary Research

When conducting primary research, you gather and create
new data. With secondary research, you utilize established,
published data created by another author(s). While it may
seem a bit "simpler" to use secondary research, there are
many aspects to consider when choosing and incorporating
these sources. You must make choices about the source's
validity, biases, author and publication credibility, and
information quality.

      In today's complex information landscape, just about
anything that contains information can be considered a
potential secondary source. For example, most know about
books, websites, journals, and newspapers. However, other
336 Katrina Peterson

possible sources include research reports, conference
papers, field notes, photographs, websites, and television
programs. With so many sources available, the question
usually is not whether sources exist for your project, but
which ones will best meet your information needs?
Categorizing a source helps you understand the kind of
information it contains, which is a clue to whether it might
meet your information needs and where to look for it and
similar sources.

      A source can be categorized by whether it contains
quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (descriptive)
information or both; whether the source is objective
(factual) or persuasive (opinion); whether the source is
a scholarly, professional, or popular publication; and the
source's format. As you may already be able to tell, sources
can be in more than one category at the same time because
the categories are not mutually exclusive.

Figure 5: Secondary Research Categories.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 337

Quantitative or Qualitative

Information from a secondary source can be quantitative
or qualitative, which is a key way to categorize sources.
Some sources contain either quantitative information or
qualitative information, but sources often contain both.
Quantitative information involves a measurable
quantity--numbers are used. Some examples are length,
mass, temperature, and time. Quantitative information is
often called data, but can be things other than numbers.
Qualitative information involves a descriptive judgment
using concept words instead of numbers, such as
descriptions of a situation and interview data. For example,
if you were researching how to improve your local library,
quantitative information could include government
documents with statistics on current usage and
advertisements for library activities at similar libraries.
Qualitative information could be published case studies on
library use or a local newspaper story with interviews of
library patrons.

Fact or Opinion

An author's purpose can influence the kind of information
they choose to include in a source. Think about why the
author produced a source, because that reason dictated the
kind of information they include. Depending on that
purpose, the author may have chosen to include factual,
analytical, and objective information. Or, it may have
suited their purpose to include subjective, and therefore
less factual and analytical, information. The author's
reason for producing the source also determines whether
they included multiple perspectives or just their own. For
338 Katrina Peterson

example, a blogger may review a movie based on personal
opinion (e.g., they liked the action scenes or thought the
main actor was dreamy), while, a professional movie critic
would approach their review differently (e.g., scene
composition, musical score, and other quantifiable
elements).

Popular, Professional, and/or Scholarly

We can also categorize information by the expertise level
of its intended audience. Considering how "expert" one has
to be to understand the information can indicate whether
the source has sufficient credibility and thoroughness.
There are varying degrees of expertise:

         · Popular: Popular newspaper and magazine
            articles (The Washington Post, The Wall Street
            Journal and Rolling Stone) are meant for a large
            general audience, are generally affordable, and
            are easy to purchase or free. They are written by
            staff writers or reporters, and are often about
            news, opinions, background information, and
            entertainment. They are visually attractive with
            catchy titles, artwork, and advertisements, but
            no footnotes or references. They are published
            by commercial publishers and content is
            approved by an editor.

         · Professional: Professional magazine articles
            (Plastic Surgical Nursing and Music Teacher)
            are meant for people in a particular profession.
            Staff writers or other professionals write at a
            level and with language understood by those in
            the profession. They are about trends and news
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 339

            from the targeted field, book reviews, and case
            studies. Articles are often less than 10 pages and
            may contain footnotes and references. These are
            usually published by professional associations
            and commercial publishers, and like popular
            publications, are published after approval from
            an editor.

         · Scholarly: Scholarly journal articles (Plant
            Science and Education and Child Psychology)
            are meant for scholars, students, and the general
            public who want a deeper understanding of a
            topic. Researchers and scholars write these
            articles to present new knowledge and further
            understanding of their field. They contain
            findings of research projects, data and analytics,
            and case studies. They are often long (over 10
            pages) and include footnotes and references, and
            are usually published by universities,
            professional associations, and commercial
            publishers. Content is approved by peer review
            or the journal's editor.

Combined Purposes

Sometimes authors have combined purposes, as when a
marketer decides he can sell more smart phones with an
informative sales video that also entertaining. Authors
often have multiple purposes in most scholarly writing.
For example, scholarly authors want to inform and educate
their audiences, but they also want to persuade the reader
that what they report and/or postulate is a true description
of a situation, event, or phenomenon, or a valid argument
that their audience must take a particular action. In this
340 Katrina Peterson

blend of purposes, the intent to educate and inform is
considered to trump the intent to persuade.

Intent Matters

Author intent matters in how useful their information can
be to your research, depending on which information need
you are trying to meet. For instance, when you look for
sources that will help you answer a research question or
evidence for your answer, you will want the author's main
purpose to be to inform or educate. With that intent, they
are likely to use facts where possible, multiple
perspectives, little subjective information, and seemingly
unbiased, objective language that cites where they got the
information. This kind of source will lend credibility to
your argument.

Common Secondary Research Types

         · Books: usually a substantial amount of
            information, published at one time and requiring
            great effort on the part of the author and a
            publisher

         · Magazines/Journals: published frequently,
            containing articles related to some general or
            specific professional research interest; edited

         · Newspapers: daily or weekly publication of
            events of social, political and lifestyle interest

         · Websites: digital items, each consisting of
            multiple pages produced by someone with
            technical skills (Or have the ability to pay
            someone with technical skills.)
                  Technical and Professional Writing Genres 341

· Articles: distinct, short, written pieces that
   might contain photos and are generally timely
   (Timeliness is when something is of interest to
   readers at the point of publication or something
   the writer is thinking about or researching at a
   given point of time.)

· Conference papers: written form of papers
   delivered at a professional or research-related
   conference (Authors are generally
   practicing professionals or scholars in the field.)

· Blogs: frequently updated websites that do not
   necessarily require extensive technical skills and
   can be published by virtually anyone for no cost
   to themselves other than the time they devote to
   content creation (Usually marked by postings
   that indicate the date they were written.)

· Documentaries: visual works such as a film or
   television program, presenting political, social,
   or historical subject matter in a factual
   and informative manner (Often consists of
   actual news films or interviews accompanied by
   narration.)

· Online videos: short videos produced by
   anybody, with a lot of money or a little money,
   about anything for the world to see
   (Common sites for these are YouTube and
   Vimeo.)

· Podcasts: digital audio files, produced by
   anyone and about anything, and are available for
   downloading (Often by subscription.)

10.7 Evaluating Secondary Sources

Evaluating sources for relevance and credibility is
important to establish the validity of the data and ideas
within. There is never a 100% perfect source. You will
need to make educated guesses about whether the
information is good enough for your purpose. Critical
thinking is a necessary skill your professors and employers
will expect. Learning to evaluate sources can also keep you
from being duped by fake news and taken advantage of by
posts that are ignorant or simply scams.

      To help evaluate the quality of a source, ask yourself
the following questions about each source:

         · Authority:

               Question: Is the person, organization, or
               institution responsible for the intellectual
               content of the information knowledgeable in
               that subject?

                     Indicators: Formal academic degrees;
               years of professional experience; active and
               substantial involvement in a particular area;
               awards and recognition.

         · Accuracy:

               Question: How free from error is this piece of
               information?

                     Indicators: Correct and verifiable
               citations; information is verifiable in other
               sources from different authors/organizations;
               author is authority on subject; information has
                  Technical and Professional Writing Genres 343

      been properly edited to display professional
      care.

· Objectivity:

      Question: How objective (unbiased) is this
      piece of information?

            Indicators: Multiple points of view are
      acknowledged and discussed logically and
      clearly; statements are supported with
      documentation from a variety of reliable
      sources; purpose is clearly stated; the
      organization's "About" statement reveals a
      commitment to truth; the organization's
      readership cannot be easily divided along
      common demographic lines (e.g., gender,
      political affiliation, age, etc).

· Currency:

      Key Question: When was the item of
      information published or produced?

            Indicators: Publication date; assignment
      restrictions (e.g., you can only use articles
      from the last five years); your topic and how
      quickly information changes in your field
      (e.g., technology or health topics will require
      more recent information to reflect rapidly
      changing areas of expertise).

· Audience:

      Question: Who is this information written for
      or this product developed for?
344 Katrina Peterson              Language;  style;  tone;

                     Indicators:
               bibliographies.

10.8 Citing Sources

If you create your own research data using primary
research (interview, survey, etc.), you do not need to
provide a formal citation for that data--because you
created it, you own it. However, you must properly cite any
information you use from all secondary sources.

Direct Quote

Researchers document anything that is directly quoted.
This can be a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or longer section
taken from a source. Make sure to place quotation marks
( " " ) around the borrowed material to show that it is
exact phrasing used in the source. You must also provide
a correct citation at the end of the sentence containing the
borrowed information and create a full reference at the end
of the document on a reference page.

Paraphrase and Summary

Paraphrased or summarized information also needs to be
documented using a citation. Paraphrasing is restating
ideas taken from someone else and putting those ideas into
your own words. The language used needs to be original
and fresh. You cannot simply switch a sentence around
or use a thesaurus to swap out a few words. You must
completely put the source's ideas into the writer's own
word (this is usually done by turning away from the source
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 345

material and rephrasing the author's statements from
memory). Quotation marks are not used, but you must use
a citation to give credit to the original source. It is also
helpful to add attributive tags to the paraphrase.

      If you have difficulty deciding if you should choose a
direct quote, a paraphrase, or a summary in your document,
think about the following rules:

         · Use a direct quotation: if the wording is very
            eloquent or clear, or if changing the wording
            would make the quote lose its impression. You
            can also directly quote an authority on a topic to
            add credibility.

         · Use a paraphrase: if the idea is more important
            than the wording. Also use a paraphrase to
            change the emphasis of an idea, change the style
            of wording, show your understanding of
            complex ideas, condense lengthy ideas into
            more concise explanations, or link together
            ideas that might otherwise be separated by
            lengthy paragraphs or pages of supporting
            documentation.

         · Use a summary: when you need to simplify or
            condense a larger work into the basic points.

Visuals

Any visuals, graphics, and pictures which you did not
create yourself need to be cited. Often, individuals think
they can snag an image from Google and copy and paste
it into a paper or presentation without citing it; this is
plagiarism. Anything that was not created in whole by the
writer needs to be cited. You may also wish to limit image
346 Katrina Peterson

search results to open source images only before selecting
a graphic to use, to avoid copyright issues. (See chapter 4
for instructions to limit your online graphics search)

Overall

Always give credit to another person's ideas or work; never
pass them off as your own. There are numerous format
styles available, such as MLA, APA, CSE, and AMA. If
you are not given a specific format to use in your
document, choose a style used in your field and ensure
you are using it correctly. Guides are available online for
every style, as well as detailed published manuals for when
you need to get more in-depth. A few websites that may
help you with citations include: Reference©ite Quick©ite
(https://www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/2.html), The Owl
(https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html) , Citation
Machine (www.citationmachine.net), and Cite This for Me
(http://www.citethisforme.com/).

      And of course, your university library has many
format and style guides, both electronic and print format,
to help you with basic citations and more specific, stylized
aspects of format. (See chapter 4 for information on ethics
and citation).

Chapter 11: Analytical Reports

Staci Bettes

Chapter Synopsis

The standard components of the typical analytical report
are discussed in this chapter, including preliminary
choices, audience and purpose considerations, common
sections of reports, and format. As you read and use these
guidelines, remember that these are "guidelines," not
commandments. Different companies, professions, and
organizations have their own varied guidelines for
reports--you will need to adapt your practice to those as
well the ones presented here. In addition to the content and
style of a standard report, the end of the chapter included
details on two specific subgenres of reports that you may
need to write during your education and beyond--Progress
Reports and Internship and Co-op Reports.

11.1 Introduction

Analytical reports have specifications as do any other kind
of project. Specifications for reports involve layout,
organization and content, format of headings and lists,
design of the graphics, and so on. The advantage of a
required structure and format for reports is that you or
anyone else can expect them to be designed in a familiar
way--you know what to look for and where to look for
it. Reports are usually read in a hurry. People want to get

                                     349
350 Katrina Peterson

to the information they need--key facts, conclusions, and
other essentials--as quickly as possible.

      For example, you might find reading a journal articles
none too stimulating. Nevertheless, journal articles and
reports are important and carefully crafted. The rigid
format and objective style lend them a universal utility
so readers from various disciplines can readily access and
use the complex information. Your professors will confirm
that busy academics rarely read reports and articles
linearly--many readers cut right to Results and Discussion
or look over the tables and figures before reading anything,
then jump around to those bits of the report that are most
relevant to their needs. Often, their goal is to rapidly
exclude information they do not want or need.

      The same can be said for any type of report. It is
especially important for you to write reports in a fashion
acceptable for your audience and topic, where they can
easily locate the desired information. As you prepare
technical reports for your classes, you have built-in
template in which to put your information, and you can
plug in to a tried and proven template that has evolved
over many years. Understanding and conforming to this
template will help you to organize complex information as
well as meet your reader's specific needs.

      When you write technical reports, notice how
repetitive some sections are. This duplication has to do
with how people read reports. They may start with the
executive summary, skip around, and probably not read
every page. Your challenge is to design reports so that
the readers encounter your key facts and conclusions, no
matter how much of the report they read or in what order
they read it.

11.2 Types of Reports

Reports are a common and important part of
communication in the working world. They can update
readers about progress on a project, inform of some
activity, show research on an item, make recommendations
to the reader, document a problem, request funding, or
submit a call to action. These are only some examples of
what a report can do. There are several types of reports
you may encounter in your classes or in the workforce,
including:

         · Scientific reports: record and explain
            information found through scientific inquiry;
            proposes a hypothesis that is often proved right
            or wrong.

         · Informational reports: carry information from
            one part of the company to another; such as
            finances, employee statistics, etc.

         · Project-completion reports: resolve an issue,
            and often used to evaluate the success of a
            project; created at the end of a project.

         · Research reports: condense and highlight
            research completed on a topic.

         · Recommendation reports: present research to
            recommend a specific action(s) to resolve a
            problem.

         · Feasibility reports: assess and discuss the
            viability of a specific action or change.

The purpose of all report types is the same--to clearly
352 Katrina Peterson

and accurately describe something that has happened or is
happening.

11.3 Report Purpose and Audience

In a technical writing course, the report assignment serves
several purposes: a) it gives you some experience in
writing a report; b) displays your research on a topic; and
c) shows how you came to your conclusions on that topic.
The report is often the conclusion of a weeks-long research
and writing process that goes through many stages until it
gets to the end point.

      Another point to keep in mind relates to the audience
for different kinds of reports. Consider the example of a
report written to a supervisor at a solar power company
over the effectiveness of the solar panels currently used
at a location. The report's primary audience may be an
executive, whose knowledge of the technicalities is very
broad. The executive will read the report and understand
the profits and losses, but will need to consult a technician
to understand the technical aspects of panel usage. The
content and language used for these two different
audiences will need to be adjusted to fit the writing
situation. (See chapter 10 for details on revising for
multiple audiences)

      To help write for the specific document's audience,
it is a good idea to define your reader and sketch out
some qualities about them before you begin drafting. This
information will help you persuade the reader to accept
your research and conclusions, as well as help keep your
own writing on task. It can also help you decide what
research to include or eliminate from the report, how best
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 353

to visually display your data, and other considerations to
get your conclusion and/or recommendations accepted.

      Ask yourself:

       1. Who is your reader? Your reader should be
            someone with decision-making authority over
            your topic. They could implement recommended
            changes or just need the information you
            provide. They are action-takers in a
            corporation, organization, business, or agency.
            In some situations, the reader of a report may
            also be a client--a person who hired you to
            compile the research and write the report.

       2. What type of reader are they? An expert,
            technician, executive, gatekeeper, or non-
            specialist?

       3. What is their background and knowledge
            level on the topic? What are their needs,
            interests, and culture and values? What will
            likely persuade them to implement your idea?
            For example, imagine you researched the merits
            of four-day versus five-day workweeks for
            maximum productivity. Your research led to the
            conclusion that four-day workweeks would
            increase company revenue and employee
            satisfaction in several areas. You will want to
            frame your ideas for improvement in terms that
            management will be interested in, such as
            productivity, savings in building upkeep and
            utilities, and performance. Otherwise, they may
            be unconvinced that your solution will alleviate
            the burden of the problem.

The type of report you create will depend on the purpose
354 Katrina Peterson

of the document and who will read it. For example, you
may wish to create a report to persuade them to make
recommended changes, or perhaps you were asked to
compile a report over current events or statuses at a
company. The level of formality will also be a factor in
your decisions over content and format.

      There is several aspects of the report that you need
to determine before drafting. Identifying these factors is
vital to creating a report that will be accepted by the
reader--whether the report is written for internal or
external readers, and if the report is solicited or
unsolicited. (See chapter 9 for a more details on interval vs
external and solicited vs unsolicited documents. Below is a
brief synopsis)

Internal or External

         · Internal: A report to someone within your
            organization (a business, a government agency,
            etc.). For example, if you submit a report to your
            supervisor that recommends improvements to
            more effectively reply to customer inquiries,
            you would create an internal report.

         · External: A report that is written from one
            separate, independent organization or individual
            to another such entity. With an external report,
            you will need to not only persuade the reader to
            accept your conclusions on the topic, but also
            establish credibility. The typical example is an
            independent consultant writing a report on
            company productivity for another firm.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 355

Solicited or Unsolicited

         · Solicited: The recipient has requested the
            report. The solicitation may come in the form of
            a direct verbal or written request, but it is not
            uncommon for solicitations to be an indirect,
            open-bid to the public, and formally published
            for everyone to see. For example, a city
            government will advertise for an independent
            contractor to reinforce the structural integrity of
            several local bridges. The city may announce the
            project's budget and solicit contractors to submit
            a report outlining what repairs they could make
            in exchange for the advertised budget.

         · Unsolicited: The recipient has not requested
            your report. With unsolicited reports, you must
            convince the recipient that a problem or need
            exists in addition convincing them to accept
            your conclusions and/or implement change.

11.4 Common Report Sections

There are several common sections in a report, including a
submittal letter, cover page, abstract or executive summary,
table of contents, introduction, literature review,
experiment/method/procedure, results, discussion,
recommendations, conclusion, acknowledgments,
references, and appendices. At first glance, these sections
may seem a bit overwhelming. However, you have likely
had some contact with basic reports structure with journal
articles and other assigned class readings. Reports follow
the same basic structure, referred to as IMRaD (Intro,
356 Katrina Peterson

Method, Results, and Discussion). Of course, the length
and locations of these sections will vary, and some sections
may be entirely eliminated, based on the purpose and
audience of the report. In some industries, reports even use
Excel files and other types of untraditional formats. The
sections of a report can be easily categorized into three
major groups--front matter, the report's body, and back
matter.

      Figure 1: Common Report Sections
Front Matter
The front matter is made up of sections that introduce,
provide context, and guide usage of a report. In most cases,
it will include a submittal letter to the reader, an abstract or
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 357

executive summary, a table of contents, and a list of figures
and tables (if your report contains graphics).

Submittal Letter

The submittal letter is either attached to the outside of the
report with a paper clip or is bound within the report. It
is a transmittal document--used to explain the content and
context of the report to the reader. It has a similar function
to the cover letter in your job packet--they both explain
the enclosed content. It is a communication from you--the
report writer--to the recipient--the person for whom you
created the report--who may even be paying you for your
expert consultation.

      Essentially, it says, "Here is the report that we agreed
I'd complete by such-and-such a date. Briefly, it contains
this and that, but does not cover this or that. Please let
me know if it meets your needs." The submittal letter
explains the context--the events that brought the report
about. It contains information about the report that does not
belong in the report itself, and could be viewed as a form
of metadiscourse--a self-referential document that refers
back to the main document to provide context.
358 Katrina Peterson

Figure 2: Submittal Letter Example

Submittal letters often follow standard business letter
format. If you write an internal report, use the
memorandum format instead. In either case, the content
and organization are the same:

         · First paragraph: cites the name of the report,
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 359

            putting it in italics. It also mentions the date of
            the agreement to write the report.

         · Middle paragraph: focuses on the purpose of
            the report and gives a brief overview of the
            report's contents.

         · Final paragraph: encourages the reader to get
            in touch if there are questions, comments, or
            concerns. It closes with a gesture of good will,
            expressing hope that the reader finds the report
            satisfactory.

As with any other element in a report, you may have to
modify the contents of this letter (or memo) for specific
situations. For example, you might want to add another
paragraph, listing questions you would like readers to
consider as they review the report.

Cover Page

Be sure to create a cover page for your report. It is a
step that some writers forget. Without a label, a report
is anonymous and gets ignored. The best way to create
a cover page is to use your word processing software to
design one on a standard page with a graphic box around
the label information. Not much goes on the label: the
report title, your name, your organization's name, a report
tracking number (if any), and a date. There are no standard
requirements for the cover page, although your company or
organization may have its own requirements.

         · Design: The cover page should be clear and
            easy to read, but can have some graphics or
            design interest to attract to the reader. However,
360 Katrina Peterson

            do not go overboard on the "frills," like
            rainbow-colored letters or extraneous clipart. A
            disorganized or overly decorated cover page
            could lessen your credibility as a respectable
            writer.

         · Title: It is necessary to have a highly concrete
            title consisting only of words that contribute
            directly to the report subject. Be sure that the
            title contains no filler and includes few
            abbreviations or acronyms, yet includes enough
            detail so the reader fully understands the
            content. "Sol Gel Method" is clearly incomplete
            compared to "The Synthesis of NZP by the Sol
            Gel Method." Of course, it is possible to overdo
            specificity as well: "The Role of Solid Oxide
            Fuel Cells in the Important Scientific Search for
            Energy Alternatives as Necessitated by the
            Recent Middle East Crisis and America's
            Energy Consumption" is painfully excessive and
            should be reduced to its essential elements.
            However, "The Importance of Solid Oxide Fuel
            Cells Research for Alternative Energies" is
            much more appropriate.

Abstract or Executive Summary
Most technical reports contain at least one
abstract--sometimes two, in which case the abstracts play
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 363

different roles. Abstracts summarize the content of a report,
but the different types do so in different ways.

         · Descriptive abstract: This type provides an
            overview of the purpose and content of the
            report. In some report designs, the descriptive
            abstract is placed at the bottom of the title page.
            In others, it appears on its own page. Descriptive
            abstracts are a concise, specific, and repetitive
            overview of the entire report. They highlight
            important content so that your supervisor or
            other researchers can determine whether the
            report is relevant to their interests and needs.
            The format and length of an abstract can vary
            depending on the business or field, though it is
            often around 100-300 words, depending on
            report length. In general, abstracts should follow
            the same chronological order as the report,
            contain brief but specific information from each
            section, and use phrases and sentences pulled
            directly from the report without changing the
            language. Your abstract may vary somewhat
            from the list below depending on the sections of
            your report. An abstract will generally contain
            the following information:

                      Topic or problem

                      Information on the participants (if
                        any)

                      Brief review of methodology (what
                        you did)

                      Statistical analyses

                      Results of the study
364 Katrina Peterson

                      Implications of the study (the
                        conclusions)

Executive Summary: Another common type is the
executive summary, which also summarizes the key facts
and conclusions contained in the report. Think of this as if
you used a yellow highlighter to mark the key sentences in
the report and then siphoned them all out onto a separate
page and edited them for readability. Typically, executive
summaries are one-tenth to one-twentieth the length of
reports 10 to 50 pages long. For longer reports, ones over
50 pages, the executive summary should not go over two
pages. The point of the executive summary is to provide
a summary of the report--something that can be read
quickly.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 365

Figure 5: Abstract and Executive Summary Examples

If the submittal letter, executive summary or abstract, and
introduction strike you as repetitive, remember that readers
do not necessarily start at the beginning of a report and read
page by page to the end. They skip around--they may scan
the table of contents, and then skim the executive summary
for key facts and conclusions. They may carefully read
366 Katrina Peterson

only a section or two from the body of the report, and then
skip the rest. For these reasons, reports are designed with
some duplication so that readers will be sure to see the
important information no matter where they dip into the
report.

Table of Contents

You are familiar with tables of contents (TOC) but may
never have stopped to look at their design. The TOC shows
readers what topics are covered in the report, how those
topics are discussed (the subtopics), and on which page
numbers those sections and subsections start.

      In creating a TOC, you have a number of design
decisions:

         · Levels of headings: In longer reports, consider
            including only the top two levels of headings.
            This keeps the TOC from becoming long and
            unwieldy.

         · Indentation, spacing, and capitalization:
            Items in each of the three levels of headings
            should be aligned with each other. Page numbers
            are right-aligned with each other. Main chapters
            or sections are all caps; first-level headings use
            initial caps on each main word; lower-level
            sections use initial caps on the first word only.

         · Vertical spacing: First-level sections have extra
            space above and below, which increases
            readability.

         · Leader dots: Leader dots horizontally connect
            the descriptive headings on the left to the page
            numbers on the right.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 367

Make sure the words in the TOC are the same as they are in
the text. As you write and revise, you might change some
of the section headings, so do not forget to change the TOC
accordingly.

List of Figures and Tables

If your document has more than two figures or tables,
create a separate list of figures. The list has many of the
same design considerations as the table of contents.
Readers use the list of figures to quickly find the
illustrations, diagrams, tables, and charts in your report.
Complications arise when you have both tables and figures.
Strictly speaking, figures are illustrations, drawings,
photographs, graphs, and charts. Tables are rows and
columns of words and numbers; they are not considered
figures.

      For longer reports that contain dozens of figures and
tables each, create separate lists. Put them together on the
same page if they fit, as shown in the illustration below.
You can combine the two lists under the heading, "List of
Figures and Tables."
368 Katrina Peterson

Report Body
The report's body contains the report's content. In these
sections, you will introduce your topic, tell us what
research you found and how you obtained the information,
discuss the significance of your findings, and conclude
with your overall assessment of the topic, problem, or
information gathered. It follows the IMRaD format and
should leave the reader with a full understanding of the
issue.
Introduction
An essential element of any report is its introduction. Make
sure you are clear on its real purpose and content. In a
technical report, the introduction prepares the reader to
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 369

read the main body of the report. The introduction should
offer immediate context for the reader by establishing the
importance of the topic and by describing its nature and
scope. You should describe your specific approach to the
problem and establish how your investigative work meshes
with the needs of the field or with other work that has
been done. The "funnel system" of organization--moving
from a broad approach to a gradually narrowed scope--is
recommended. Present tense is preferred. An effective
introduction will usually include the following rhetorical
moves, in any order.

         · Define the subject of the report

         · State the purpose of the report, preferably in one
            sentence

         · State the report's main point

         · Stress the importance of the subject, especially
            to the defined audience(s)

         · Offer background information on the topic

         · Forecast the organization of the report

Depending on which type of report you're writing, the
purpose and main point may vary greatly. For example,
for external analytical reports that propose a solution to an
investigated problem, the purpose is to convince the client
to take some sort of action, and the main point is that the
proposed solution will remedy the problem. In reports that
are persuasive, it's best to think of the main point as the
report's thesis.

      For a non-argumentative research report, however, the
purpose may be to present an organized and coherent
overview of the topic with corresponding graphics, and
370 Katrina Peterson

the main point may simply be to provide others with an
educational resource. (Imagine an encyclopedia entry as a
type of non-argumentative research report.)

      Introductions range from one to several pages in
length, and must always include a clearly worded account
of the report's objective; usually at the end of the
introduction (Some writers even include a short separate
subsection labeled "Objective"). However, the content and
intent of the objective and purpose statement tend to
overlap. It is always important to state your final
conclusion, recommendation(s), or action you want the
reader to take in the introduction, as it is the "main point"
of the report.

      The content of a report's introduction is similar to
the introductions of proposals and other professional
correspondence. The extent of which you incorporate this
content depends on the purpose and the audience. For
example, if your report is internal (written for your own
supervisors), you may spend less space on background
information (they likely know about the situation or
problem), or if the report is solicited (you were asked
for the report), you may not need as much emphasis on
the importance. Conversely, if you write an unsolicited
report advocating for a specific change, you will need to
emphasize both the background information (to explain the
problem) as well as the importance (to show a need for
change). These are all considerations to make based on the
type of report and the audience.

      Your introduction may benefit from the addition of
some data or research. You may want to provide statistics
about the current situation to show importance or to
establish your credibility. If you choose to include research
in the introduction, focus on paraphrases or specific
statistics--you do not want to bog down your introduction
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 371

with heavy quotations or "filler" information. You will
include more extensive research in the body of the report,
so it is not needed here. The introduction should be to-the-
point and revised to have maximum effect on the audience.

Literature Review

A literature review is most often found in published
academic journal articles and scientific reports. It is a
discussion of previously published research on the topic.
It can contain theory, content of similar studies, and/or
studies that led to your current research. In technical
reports, an entire section of your paper may be devoted to a
literature review. Literature reviews range from exhaustive
searches to mere summaries of articles, but the
fundamental objective is always the same--to establish the
history of the problem investigated by summarizing the
what, how, and why of the work that has already been
done. Writing a literature review requires you to establish
relationships among findings from other researchers and
to condense many pages of published material into shorter
segments. Your ability to assimilate material is critical.

      Stylistically, literature reviews are often written in the
past tense, but many authors favor the present tense if the
research is recent. Passive voice may seem tempting to use,
but active voice is preferred, because you can smoothly
place the names of authors into the subject slot of the
sentence: "Yoldas and Lloyd (1999) propose a chemical
polymerization technique for the preparation of NASICON
gels."
372 Katrina Peterson

Figure 7: Literature Review Example (Excerpt)

Experiment / Method / Procedure
Any of the above titles are common names for this section.
The goal is to summarize the what, how, and why behind
your specific experiment or research design, with particular
emphasis on the what and how so that other researchers can
repeat your procedures if they desire. This section includes
a description of the relevant apparatus and materials used.
Photographs and diagrams can be used, sparingly, to help
clarify the procedures. This section often contains the
following information:

         · A short overview of your research goal and
            rationale for why you chose the research type(s)

         · Research goals (What you plan to achieve
            through your research)
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 373

         · Types or phases of research completed (Survey,
            secondary research, poll, etc.)

         · Purpose of the research (What did you want to
            find out?)

         · Information on the participants/subjects, if any
            and why you chosen (Biographical sketches,
            major demographics, numbers, agreements or
            payments, and/or statements of ethical
            principles)

         · Materials, apparatus, or measures used (Physical
            aspects)

         · Procedures followed (The process)

Stylistically, passive voice and past tense verbs are
sometimes used in this section, but be sure that your
sentences are written efficiently and contain simple
subjects and verbs when possible. The basic form of
directly stating "what was done; why it was done that way"
should be used repeatedly in this section.

Results

The Results and Discussion work together to present the
findings of your research. The Results will be directly
related to your Method. However, take care not to include
your experimental methods here--that is the job of the
previous section. Focus on what you found, not how you
found it.

      The main difference between the Results and
Discussion is that the Results contains raw data as it was
reported or discovered. It must be objective, unbiased,
emotionless, and free from judgment. The Discussion
374 Katrina Peterson

interprets and explains the significance of the data, forming
an argument by declaring what you think certain data
means and how it fits together. Imagine your report is a
puzzle. By the end of the report, you want the reader to see
the complete picture. In this scenario, the Results are your
puzzle pieces. The Discussion is where you assemble the
pieces for the reader.

      For most readers, the Results is an important section
of the report--your readers must easily find your data in
order to interpret it. You straightforwardly present the
results of your experiment, usually with minimal
discussion. Naturally, the use of tables, graphs, and figures
is especially important here, as are explanations of how
data were derived. Your Results will likely contain the
following content:

         · Brief introductory summary of you major results

                      At least one detailed paragraph for
                        each of the major findings or ideas

                      Data displayed using charts, graphs,
                        and tables for reference

                      Brief concluding statement of major
                        findings

                      Transition to the Discussion

The Results should include solid data you found through
research. If you are writing an informational report, the
data is crucial for the report's purpose--to give statistics
and other data to the reader. With other types of reports,
such as recommendation or feasibility, your data will
inform the reader, but also lay the groundwork for an
eventual conclusion or recommendation. You may not
necessarily include all the data you found on the topic, but
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 375

you must include all relevant data. Include the information
(or areas of information) that will be of interest and
applicable to the report's audience and purpose. What does
the reader need to know to trust your interpretations or
recommendations later in the report? What was interesting,
surprising, or significant in shaping your analysis or
opinions?

      When drafting and revising this section, your style
should focus on showing that you are reporting the
information, not interpreting it (yet). Avoid terms such as
seems, appears, means, looks as if, indicates, suggests,
we believe, we think, and descriptor words that indicate
positive or negative results such as excellent, worse, better,
great, etc.

      Discussion
      In the Discussion, logical deductions are made, errors
of or ambiguities in the data should be discussed, and
causal relationships must be confirmed. It is important not
to rely on a table or figure to do the work for you--you
must concisely interpret and explain the meaning of your
results. Remember, this is where you put your puzzle
together for the reader. Beware of making sweeping
generalizations or unfounded statements. Do not be afraid
to discuss results and data from different sections together
if doing so helps you develop a stronger argument than
viewing these pieces of information separately. Your
Discussion will likely contain the following content:

         · Brief introductory paragraph with overall
            statement about your content

         · Explanations for the conclusions you have about
            the research (What do they mean? Why do you
            think that is? Explain your reasoning.)
376 Katrina Peterson

         · References to the data in the Results (You will
            not discuss any new data--explain the data you
            have already written about.)

         · Brief summary of the main points and transition
            to the Recommendations or the Conclusion

You may feel like the Discussion is repetitious, as you
refer to information established in other sections of the
report. The key difference is that the Discussion analyzes
the information and displays what it all means for the
reader, which is why the Discussion commonly stands
alone. In your future career, there could be some situations
where you are asked to combine the data and interpretation
into a "Results and Discussion" section, or combine the
"Discussion and Conclusion" (such as with journal
articles). If such combinations occur, it is important not
to minimize or reduce the analysis and critical thinking
components of the Discussion. However, in most
scenarios, a stand-alone Discussion is the most effective
way to present your analysis and interpretation to persuade
the reader.You may also consider referring back to the key
literature of your introduction or literature review, if these
sections are included in your report. You can enlighten
your readers (and elevate your work) by discussing your
data in relation to the published results of others.

      Passive voice may seem tempting, but active voice is
valuable, especially as you make a logical assertions and
claims based on your interpretation of the data. As a rule,
use past tense to summarize your actual results ("Ninety
five percent of respondents stated..."); use present tense
to present established facts or present your interpretations
("The helium sintering data show... ").
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 377

Recommendations

The Recommendations follows the Discussion, if your
report's purpose is to recommend a specific action or
change, or to give an overall assessment of a situation, such
as with feasibility, recommendation, or project-completion
reports. This section should be concise and to the point.
Recommendations should be based on your data, and all
recommendations should link to research found in the
Results and Discussion. Your Recommendations will likely
contain the following content:

         · An obvious transition using signal phrases and
            headings

         · Restatement of the report's main points (What
            did your study show/demonstrate? What did you
            prove/disapprove/not prove?)

         · Statement of recommendations (Identify 2-5
            actions that the reader should follow. Consider
            using bullets to contrast your recommendations
            and make them easy to find on the page.)

The Recommendations and Conclusion can be combined
into one section, or be divided into two separate sections.
The choice depends on the type of document, the purpose,
and the audience.

Conclusion

In most forms of writing, we use the word conclusion to
refer to that last section or paragraph of a document. The
Conclusion should provide the exact conclusions you have
arrived at as they relate to your experimental objectives.
378 Katrina Peterson

Conclusions may be listed and numbered, and it should be
made clear how they contribute to the understanding of the
overall problem. In a sense, you are going back to the big
picture provided by your introduction, incorporating your
conclusions into that picture.

      Like the Recommendations, this section should be
concise and to the point. This section may be short--often
about the same length as the abstract. If the Method looks
legitimate, the Results appear thorough, and the Discussion
does a clear job explaining how it fits together, then your
Conclusion should be well received without extras.

      There are at least four ways to conclude a report: a
summary, a true conclusion, a combination, and nothing.
More often than not, the final section is some combination
of the first two ways of ending the document.

         · Summary: Review and summarize the high
            points. If your report is rather long, complex,
            heavily detailed, and if you want your readers to
            come away with the right perspective, a
            summary is in order. For short reports,
            summaries can seem absurd--the reader thinks
            "You've just told me that!" Summaries need to
            read as if time has passed, things have settled
            down, and the writer is viewing the subject from
            higher ground.

         · "True" Conclusion: A "true" conclusion is
            found in most types of documents. For example,
            in the body of a report, you might present
            conflicting theories and explore the related data.
            Or you might have compared different models
            and brands of some product. In a "true"
            conclusion, you would present your resolution
            of the conflicting theories, your choice of the
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 379

            best model or brand--your final conclusions.
For most reports, you will need to include a final section.
When you plan the final section of your report, think about
the functions it can perform in relation to the rest of the
document. A conclusion does not necessarily just
summarize a report. Instead, use the conclusion to explain
the most significant findings you made in relation to your
report topic.

Figure 8: Summary Conclusion Example
380 Katrina Peterson

Figure 9: "True" Conclusion Example

         · Combination: In practice, the preceding ways
            of ending reports are often combined. You can
            analyze final sections of reports and identify
            elements that summarize, elements that
            conclude, and elements that discuss something
            related but at a general level.

Below are some possible combinations for a mixed
conclusion:

         · Provide a brief, general look to the future;
            speculate on future developments

         · Explore solutions to problems that were
            discussed in the main body of the report (refer to
            the Recommendations, if any)

         · Discuss the operation of a mechanism or
            technology that was described in the main body
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 381

            of the report

         · Provide some cautions, guidelines, tips, or
            preview of advanced functions

         · Explore the economics, social implications,
            short and long-term consequences, problems,
            legal aspects, advantages, disadvantages,
            benefits, or applications of the report subject
            (but only generally and briefly)

         · Nothing (No Conclusion): It is possible to end
            a document with no conclusion (or final section)
            whatsoever. However, in most cases, that is a bit
            like slamming the phone down without saying
            good bye. The nothing conclusion will likely be
            used in cases where you were asked to compile
            the data for another person(s), such as in an
            informational report. The data may be used in
            order for others to make decisions, such as
            managers or other departments within a
            company. For example, if you wrote an
            informational report on a new ionic-polymer
            metal composite on the market, you would write
            about usage, applications, and current research,
            but skip the conclusion, as your manager or the
            physical testing department would make the
            decision whether or not to start using it.

Back Matter

The back matter of your report contains sections that give
additional information about and attributions for the
report's content. It contains acknowledgments and
382 Katrina Peterson

references, as well as appendices with more data to help the
reader fully understand the report's informational basis.

Acknowledgments

If appropriate, briefly recognize any individual or
institution that contributed directly to the completion of the
research through financial support, technical assistance, or
critique. In a thesis, this section may appear just before the
introduction.

References

Documentation styles vary according to professionals and
fields. For a technical writing class, you may be using
either MLA or APA style, while engineers use the IEEE
system.

Figure 10: Reference Page Example.

Document all secondary sources (sources created by other
authors) used in the report, whether you directly quote,
paraphrase, or summarize. Whether it comes from a book,
article, a diagram, a table, a web page, or a product
brochure--it is still borrowed information. If you create
your own data through primary research (conducting your
own interviews or surveys, for example), you do not need
384 Katrina Peterson

to include these on the reference list, but all secondary
sources must be properly cited. (See chapter 4 and 10 for
information on citing sources)

Appendices

An "Appendix" presents supplementary material that was
not included in the main body of the report because it
would have detracted from the efficient or logical
presentation of the text, usually either by sheer bulk or
level of relevance. As with figures and tables, appendices
should be numbered or lettered in sequence; i.e.,
"Appendix A, Appendix B," and so on.

      What do you put in an appendix? Anything that does
not comfortably fit in the main part of the report, but
cannot be left out of the report altogether. The appendix
is commonly used for large tables of data, interview
transcripts, large chunks of sample code, fold-out maps,
background that is too basic or too advanced for the main
text, or large illustrations that do not fit in the body of
the report. It could also contain a list of organizations
relevant to the material of the report, questions for surveys
conducted, or the derivation of an equation that was used
in the text but could not be referenced because it did not
originally appear in a text that could be correctly cited.
Anything you feel is too large or lengthy, or that you think
would be distracting and interrupt the flow of the report, is
a good candidate for an appendix.

11.5 Design and Format

Technical reports (including handbooks and guides) have
various designs depending on the industry, profession, or
organization. This chapter gives an overview of traditional
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 387

design. If you are taking a technical writing course, ask
your instructor for any design specifications they have for
your documents. The same is true if you are writing a
technical report in a science, business, or government
context. Organizations very often have their own
stylesheets on which all organizational document designs
are based, so make sure the design presented in this chapter
is acceptable. This is especially true if you are writing
a report for publication--each journal provides its own
guidelines for submission.

      In general, reports should be typed, double or single
spaced on 8-1/2 x 11 paper on one side of the page only,
and letter-quality print or better is expected. The spacing
and margins are often dictated by the audience and genre.
For example, in technical fields, single spacing is often
preferred, while some classroom instructors may prefer
another size. Refer to your guidelines or examples of
similar reports to ensure you use correct spacing.

      You will likely have several pages of Front and Back
Matter in your document, such as the transmittal letter,
cover page, table of content, and reference page. (See
section 11.4 of this chapter for information on the design
of these specific pages) The information below discusses
design considerations for the main body of the report.

Headings

Use headings to mark off the different topics and subtopics
covered. Headings are the titles and subtitles you see
within the actual text of professional scientific, technical,
and business writing. Headings are like the parts of an
outline that have been pasted into the actual pages of the
document.

      Headings are an important feature of professional
388 Katrina Peterson

technical writing; they alert readers to upcoming topics
and subtopics, help readers find their way around in long
reports and skip what they are not interested in, and break
up long stretches of straight text. They also keep you (the
writer) organized and focused on the topic. The following
are some helpful tips for incorporating headings in a report:

         · Use self-explanatory headings: Instead of
            "Background," make it more specific, such as
            "Physics of Fiber Optics."

         · Make headings indicate the range of topic
            coverage: Do not exclude major section
            concepts or descriptions for brevity.

         · Avoid "stacked" headings: Avoid two
            consecutive headings without intervening text.

         · Avoid pronoun reference to headings: If you
            have a heading "Torque," do not begin the
            sentence following it with something like, "This
            is a physics principle....."

         · Omit articles from the beginning of headings:
            For example, "The Pressurized Water Reactor"
            can easily be changed to "Pressurized Water
            Reactors."

         · Avoid headings as lead-ins to lists or as figure
            titles: Always include text that describes and
            provides context for lists and subtitles.

         · Avoid "widowed" headings: Keep at least two
            lines of body text with the heading, or force it to
            start the new page.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 389

Page Numbering

Page numbering style used in traditional report design
differs from contemporary report design. Check with your
instructor or employer to ensure you are following the
correct format. Below is a list of general page number
requirements:

         · Traditional: Use lowercase Roman numerals in
            front matter (everything before the introduction)
            (i, ii, iii). All pages in the report (within but
            excluding the front and back covers) are
            numbered; unless the format style of the field
            states otherwise.

         · Contemporary: All pages throughout the
            document use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3). On
            special pages, such as the title page and page
            one of the introduction, page numbers are not
            displayed.

Page numbers can be placed in one of several areas on the
page. Usually, the best and easiest choice is to place page
numbers at the bottom center of the page (remember to
hide them on special pages).

Bulleted and Numbered Lists

In the body of a report, use bulleted, numbered, and/or
two-column lists where appropriate. Lists help emphasize
key points, by making information easier to follow, and by
breaking up solid walls of text. Always introduce the list so
that your audience understands the purpose and context of
390 Katrina Peterson

it. Whenever practical, provide a follow-up comment, too.
Below are some tips for using lists in a report:

         · Use lists to highlight or emphasize text or to
            enumerate sequential items

         · Use a lead-in to introduce the items and indicate
            the meaning or purpose of the list

         · Use consistent spacing, indentation,
            punctuation, and caps style for all lists

         · Use parallel phrasing

         · Ensure each item in the list reads grammatically
            with the lead-in

         · Avoid using headings as lead-ins for lists

         · Avoid overusing lists; using too many lists
            destroys their effectiveness

         · Use similar types of lists consistently in the
            same document

         · Following up a list with text helps your reader
            understand context for the information distilled
            into list form

(See chapter 5 for more information on document design)

Graphics

In technical report, you are likely to need drawings,
diagrams, tables, and charts. Display data that is relevant to
your topic and goals, interesting or surprising, or complex
data that can be clarified by a visual. These not only convey
certain kinds of information more efficiently but also give
your report an added look of professionalism and authority.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 391

If you have never put these kinds of graphics into a report,
there are some relatively easy ways to do so--you do not
need to be a professional graphic artist. Common software
such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and Google Docs can
create effective charts and graphics for a report, while
freeware such as Inkscape and Gimp are available online.

      Tables and figures should be numbered consecutively
throughout the text, and, in a thesis or long report, separate
lists of tables and figures are normally included at the
beginning. Tables and figures should always have
descriptive captions, and if they come directly from
sources then the sources must be properly credited. Never
present tables and figures without some useful
interpretation of them in the text. In other words, graphics
should clarify the information in the text, while the text
should explain and support the graphics. Always ensure
your graphics are ethical and display honest data. (See
chapter 4 for information on ethical graphics)

11.6 Revision Checklist for Analytical
Reports

As you review and revise your proposal, check for the
following:

         · Make preplanning decisions: Identify what
            kind of report you will be writing (internal/
            external; solicited/unsolicited), and identify the
            audience type, skill level, needs, and interests.

         · Use the right format: Often, reports follow a
            block format, but check with your instructor or
            proposal submission guidelines to insure you are
392 Katrina Peterson

            using the format requested. If there are samples
            provided, use them for visual comparison.

         · Check submission guidelines: How should the
            report be submitted? What types of follow-up
            documents or actions are connected to your
            proposal if accepted? Who will these document
            address, and when are they required?

         · Draft your report: Make decisions about the
            type of content/sections to include in your report
            to meet the requirements of the submission, the
            requirements for the type of report, and the most
            effective way to present your idea to the reader

         · Check each section's purpose: Report sections
            can seem redundant; however, each section's
            content varies due to its purpose (For example,
            the Results should give data, but the Discussion
            has data and interpretation. The Submittal letter
            provides context while the Abstract has a
            concise summary of the report's content). Check
            each section to see that it fully fulfills its
            purpose.

         · Style and Design: Ensure that the sections of
            your report are in a logical, natural order, you
            include all front and back matter relevant to the
            report's message, and that you use sub-headers
            and bullets (and any other formatting styles)
            correctly.

         · Revise, revise, revise: A less than professional,
            grammatically-incorrect report can be rejected.
            Ensure you have included all content necessary,
            and revise and edit to ensure clarity and correct
            style of the audience.

11.8 Special Report: Progress Reports

Progress reports inform a supervisor, associate, or
customer about progress you have made on a project over
a certain period of time. The project can be the design,
construction, or repair of something, the study or research
of a problem or question, or the gathering of information
on a technical subject. You write progress reports when it
takes several weeks or even months to complete a project.
In the progress report, you explain any or all of the
following:

         · How much of the work is complete
         · What part of the work is currently in progress
         · What work remains to be done
         · What problems or unexpected things, if any,

            have arisen
         · How the project is going in general

Function

Progress reports have several important functions--they
reassure recipients that you are making progress, that the
project is going smoothly, and that it will be complete by
the expected date. They provide recipients with a brief
418 Katrina Peterson

look at some of the findings or work of the project. They
also give recipients a chance to evaluate your work on
the project and to request changes. They can force you to
establish a work schedule so that you will complete the
project on time, and project a sense of professionalism to
your work and your organization. As well, if the project is
not going smoothly, the progress has halted, or the project
is not likely to be completed on deadline, the progress
report can give you a chance to discuss problems in the
project and thus to forewarn recipients. They can be an
opportunity to establish the need to reassess or reevaluate
the scope, methods, or timeline with someone who has the
authority to intervene, revise group hierarchies/roles, and
extend deadlines.

Timing and Format

In a year-long project, there are customarily three progress
reports, one after three, six, and nine months. Depending
on the size of the progress report, the length and
importance of the project, and the recipient, the progress
report can take the following forms:

         · Memo: A short, informal report to someone
            within your organization

         · Letter: A short, informal report sent to someone
            outside your organization

         · Formal Report: A formal report sent to
            someone outside your organization

Organizational Patterns or Sections

The recipient of a progress report wants to see what you
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 419

have accomplished on the project, what you are working on
now, what you plan to work on next, and how the project is
going in general.

      In other words, the following three sections are key
in any progress memo or progress report: a) Work
accomplished in the preceding period(s); b) Work currently
being performed; and c) Work planned for the next
period(s).

      In order to adequately discuss this content, your
progress report should contain the following three main
sections, as well as any of the optional sections below
which are relevant to your project:

      Main sections:

         · Introduction that reviews the purpose and scope
            of the project

         · Detailed description of your project and its
            history

         · Overall appraisal of the project to date, which
            usually acts as the conclusion.

Optional sections:

         · Summary of the project

         · Specific objectives of the project

         · Scope or limitations of the project

         · Research gathered

         · Overall assessment or appraisal of the project at
            this time

When creating a progress report, there are several elements
to keep in mind. Make sure you use the right format. If

this is for a course, check with your instructor; if it is for
a work place, check with your supervisor. Write a clear
opening paragraph reminding your recipient of the project
you are working on and that you are providing progress on
that project. Use headings to mark off the different parts of
your progress report, particularly the different parts of your
summary of work done on the project. Do not be afraid
to use lists as appropriate -in fact, they are helpful so the
reader can easily hit the highlights of your current progress.
Provide specifics--avoid relying on vague, overly general
statements about the work done on the final report project.

11.9 Sub-genre: Internship and Co-op
Reports

Typically, you are required to write a report about your
work at the completion of an internship or co-op. Although
422 Katrina Peterson

an internship or co-op might not be linked directly to a
class, the act of writing the report--which is often achieved
in the final weeks of the experience or in the semester
following the work--is a writing-intensive experience.

Function

The document provides a simple means for you to report
to your faculty supervisor on both the content and value
of your work assignment, and, more importantly, gives you
a chance to reflect on the work you have done in both a
personal and professional manner.

      You should think of your report as both a formal
academic assignment and as a personal opportunity to use
and enhance your skills as a communicator. Just as
successful people thrive by blending their formal education
and experience with critical self-assessment, you can use
your report to review what you have learned, detail what
you have accomplished, and gauge your personal growth.
Also, you might offer your report as a writing sample to a
potential employer.

Timing and Format

Frequently, you will be given guidelines for writing your
report from a faculty supervisor, and it is critical that you
follow these guidelines. It is also important that you treat
these guidelines as starting points rather than ending ones.
For instance, if you are posed with three questions to
consider in a particular section of your report, your
responses to these questions should be thoughtful and
expansive rather than just simple one-sentence answers.
Further, you should see these questions as starting points
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 423

that will lead you to other related questions of your own
design. The bottom line is this: Any report guidelines you
are given should be viewed as a substantive framework that
awaits your interpretation and elaboration, not as a simple
Q-and-A or fill-in-the-blank exercise.

      One important note about your report: Your report
should be reviewed by the employer before turning it in
to your advisor. Your employer's role here is proprietary,
i.e., the employer should be considered the "owner" of the
report's content. You must be certain that your employer
will allow the content of your report to become public,
and the employer's review of your report is standard
practice--just as a project manager reviews and endorses
the written work of his or her team members. As such,
do not include trade secrets, sensitive data, or copyrighted
information in your report.

Report Content

As a complement to any guidelines you are given, the
following sections will aid you in generating detail, making
your report stylish, and treating it as a professional
product. Keep in mind that internship and co-op reports
are typically built around specific majors or programs.
Therefore, advice you find on the web for one program
might not be correct for another, even within the same
school. Always check within your program or department
office to ensure you are following the appropriate, most up-
to-date guidelines.

      The specifics of your report content will vary based
on the guidelines provided by your faculty supervisor.
However, all faculty supervisors will be interested in
reading about three main subjects: your employer, your
duties, and your evaluation of the work experience.
424 Katrina Peterson

Your Employer

Describe the employer you worked for in thorough detail.
As you do so, consider including the following elements:

         · Introduce the employer's connection to you by
            providing an overview of your position,
            including where you worked, for how long, and
            how the position fit into your education.

         · Describe the nature of the position you held in
            relation to the employer--what is the position's
            value to the company? Why does the company
            hire interns?

         · When appropriate, quote key company
            literature--e.g., a brochure, a mission statement,
            a web page--to summarize the company's
            values and culture.

         · Give an overview of the employing
            organization's size, structure, and commitment
            to internship/co-op positions. Use the company
            literature or web page to help you generate
            detail, but avoid simple cut-and-paste
            composing.

         · Detail how the position fit into the overall
            company organization.

         · Outline some of the employer's key goals and
            challenges, highlighting those problems or
            projects with which you were specifically
            charged.
             Technical and Professional Writing Genres 425

Your Duties

Outline your specific responsibilities and tie them into any
larger projects with which you were involved. Detailed
accounts should be given of such issues as the following:

         · Your specific day-to-day responsibilities and
            activities. Turn here to your daily routine
            activities, record keeping methods, and any job
            description provided by the employer.

         · Duties you took on or were assigned beyond the
            standard job description.

         · Activities in coordination with project teams or
            co-workers.

         · Specific technical functions of your position.

         · The academic background necessary for any
            project you worked on.

         · The goals of any project you were involved in.

         · Key data, equations, or software that you
            generated or used.

         · Names and functions of machinery or
            instruments that you operated.

         · Analysis and application of data to your
            particular project.

         · Documents, reports, or presentations that you
            were required to complete.

Your Evaluation of the Work Experience
The evaluation is important not just for your faculty
426 Katrina Peterson

supervisor, but for your academic department, your peers,
and for you personally. As a way to evaluate your
experience, elaborate on areas such as the following:

         · The assessment others made of your work,
            especially if you were given a written
            evaluation.

         · Contributions that the work experience made to
            your career development, goals, and growth.

         · Contributions of the work experience to your
            selection of future coursework, either because
            you foresaw new needs due to the work or
            because a co-worker made recommendations.

         · Assessment of courses you completed that were
            the most or the least applicable to your
            internship/co-op. Note specific courses and
            principles studied in these courses.

         · Noteworthy distinctions between your education
            and on-the-job experience.

         · Whether the internship/co-op made good use of
            your technical background.

         · Your level of personal satisfaction with the
            internship/co-op and whether or not you would
            recommend it to others.

         · Your assessment of how the internship/co-op
            could be improved for others.

Report Style

No one expects you to emulate Shakespeare as you write
your report (in fact, you had better not do so). Instead, your
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 427

readers will expect your information to be clear and your
ideas to be fluid. Therefore, as you compose your report,
employ the following stylistic benchmarks:

         · Pay special attention to subject/verb agreement
            and verb tense, the two most common sentence-
            level problems in technical writing.

         · Favor short paragraphs over long ones.

         · Consciously build your paragraphs around topic
            sentences, even very simple sentences such as
            "My daily activities fell into three categories." It
            will help keep you focused.

         · Selectively use transition words at the
            beginnings of pivotal sentences and paragraphs.
            Transition words provide simple ways for you to
            guide the reader's thinking. Opening a sentence
            with a word such as "Specifically" tells the
            reader that you are about to elaborate, while a
            transition such as "Clearly" implies writer
            contemplation.

         · Use active voice more than passive.

         · Exploit active verbs, especially as you describe
            your accomplishments. As with a résumé, think
            in relation to things you demonstrated,
            performed, defined, improved, mapped,
            programmed, organized, presented, etc.

         · Use an honest, upbeat, sincere tone, especially
            in the conclusion of your report when you assess
            the internship or co-op's value to you personally.

Chapter 12: Oral Reports

Katrina Peterson

Chapter Synopsis

This chapter shares basic principles for the preparation and
delivery of oral reports. It gives an overview of expected
structural conventions: how to set up an introduction, body,
and conclusion. Since presentations often include a visual
component, the chapter offers guidelines for creating an
effective PowerPoint, Prezi, or Keynote. It includes tips
for developing effective slides, while acknowledging the
drawbacks of presentation software. It also offers
suggestions to help speakers prepare well, overcome
anxiety, and consider their speaking context. The chapter
concludes with thoughts on presentation delivery.

12.1 Introduction to Oral Presentations

Increasingly, employers report that they require excellent
communication skills, not just in print but also in person.
Your employer will likely call on you to deliver an oral
report at some point in your career. Whether you are an
engineer or a writer, a professional or a student, a business
person or a scientist, you will need to communicate well
with supervisors, colleagues, clients, and the public. For
most, this includes at least an occasional formal
presentation. Formal presentations in the workplace
usually take one of three forms: 1) informational, 2)

                                     431
432 Katrina Peterson

persuasive, or 3) instructional. Informational presentations
are useful for reporting on research or giving a project
update. Persuasive presentations can be used to make
pitches to clients or supervisors. Instructional or how-to
presentations are formatted to teach, explain, or train. In
each instance, you will have a chance to showcase your
skills, often hybridizing or combining different modes of
communication based on your past training. For example,
a how-to presentation would connect your ability to write
clear technical instructions with your ability to present
well. Your goal as a speaker will differ based on context,
but the best presentations share certain characteristics that
you will want to consider.

      In technical presentations, like most other genres of
technical communication, good visual information design
is essential. (See Chapter 5 on document design for
additional tips and guidelines.) Visual aids are useful for
increasing audience understanding of both the subject and
the organization of a presentation. Presenters should
remember they have an array of options for visuals, from
live demonstrations and interactive activities to old
fashioned white boards; however, presentation software is
the most commonly used option. Of the presentation
software choices, PowerPoint is widely used in the
workplace and in educational settings. Other software like
Prezi or Google Slides are becoming more popular and
present may of the same opportunities and challenges. As
you think through your options, be aware that each choice
has its strengths and weaknesses. For example, PowerPoint
can be a very effective tool for students and professionals
if used appropriately, but effective use of this tool is not as
intuitive as one would think. The following sections will
help you to structure your presentation well and to consider
the pros and cons of each design choice.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 433

12.2 Presentation Structure

A clear presentation structure is an essential aspect of
speech preparation. Similar to the academic essay and
other genres of writing, a speech has three parts: an
introduction, a body, and a conclusion. Each of these three
parts includes certain patterns or rhetorical moves that the
speaker should incorporate.

      When structuring your presentation, it may be helpful
to first draft an outline. This method enables you to
determine essential content and main points, while
excluding information that is not strictly relevant to your
big-picture goals. You have different options to ensure that
all the essentials are included; for example, you can place
your major points on slides and then illustrate with
examples you have prepared. Other options include
carrying notecards or an outline to the podium, depending
on the setup.

      As you make these decisions, always consider who
you are as a speaker, or your unique speaking style and
challenges. If your hands tend to shake a bit, it may be
helpful to hold something to steady them, but if you are
concerned about the possibility of holding multiple
materials (and possibly dropping them), you can confine
memory aids to a single sheet of paper. It may be wise to
carry a brief outline of major points with you to offset the
possibility of omitting important information. This strategy
also helps to avoid losing main points in the case of a
technology malfunction if you will be referencing slides.

      Introduction
Introductions and conclusions are points of emphasis;
psychologically speaking, we tend to remember
information presented first and last more clearly than
434 Katrina Peterson

information that is buried in the middle. The first words
you say will also set the tone for the rest of your speech.
There may not be any one best way to start a speech, but
the following are some helpful guidelines that will make
starting a speech much easier.

      Perhaps most importantly, capture the audience's
attention as you introduce the topic. If you do not engage
the audience at the outset, it will become more difficult
to do so as you continue speaking. Starting a speech with
"Hey everybody. I'm going to talk to you today about
soccer" already sounds boring and will not engage
audience members who are not soccer fans. If your
audience has deemed your speech to be boring, trying to
inform, persuade, or entertain them becomes exponentially
more difficult. Instead, consider utilizing some of the
techniques suggested below.

      When selecting an opener, you want to make sure that
the option you choose is appropriate and relevant to your
specific audience. Different audiences will have different
backgrounds and knowledge, so you should first determine
whether specific information you plan on using would be
appropriate for them. For example, if you are giving a
speech on family units to a group of individuals over the
age of 65, starting your speech with a reference to the
television show Gossip Girl may not be the best idea
because the audience may be unfamiliar with that show.
Also choose an attention-getting device appropriate for
your speech topic. Ideally, your attention-getting device
should have a relevant connection to your speech.

      For easy reference, here are some common devices
used as speech openers:

         · An anecdote or reference to current events
            engages an audience with a brief account or
                  Technical and Professional Writing Genres 435

   story. Notice the emphasis here is on the word
   "brief." A common mistake speakers make
   when telling an anecdote is to make it too long.
   The anecdote should be short and have a clear
   point. For example, consider this attention getter
   for a persuasive speech on frivolous lawsuits:
   "On January 10 of this year, Scott Anthony
   Gomez, Jr., and a fellow inmate escaped from a
   Pueblo, Colorado, jail. During their escape the
   duo attempted to rappel from the roof of the jail
   using a makeshift ladder of bed sheets. During
   Gomez's attempt to scale the building, he
   slipped, fell forty feet, and injured his back.
   Gomez then filed a lawsuit against the jail for
   making it too easy for him to attempt an
   escape." In this case, the speaker is highlighting
   a news event that illustrates what a frivolous
   lawsuit is, setting up the speech topic about a
   need for change in how such lawsuits are
   handled. Your speech topic is the purpose of the
   attention getter, not the other way around, so be
   sure to avoid any material that seems overly
   personal or does not fit the subject.

· A startling statement/statistic/fact can engage
   your audience with relevant information about
   your topic. If your speech is about oil
   conservation, you could start by saying, "A
   Boeing 747 airliner holds 57,285 gallons of
   fuel." A speech on the psychology of dreams
   might begin with this thought: "The average
   person has over 1,460 dreams a year." Although
   startling statements are fun, it is important to use
   them ethically. (See Chapter 4 on ethics for
   more information on ethics and professional
436 Katrina Peterson

            communication.) Make sure that your opening
            statement is factual. The internet is full of
            startling claims that are simply not accurate, so
            when you find a statement you would like to
            use, you have an ethical duty to ascertain its
            truth (and cite it correctly) before you use it.

         · A rhetorical question may be a good way to
            draw your audience into your topic. For
            example, a speaker talking about the history of
            Mother's Day could start by asking the
            audience, "Do you remember the last time you
            told your mom you loved her?" In this case, the
            speaker does not expect the audience to shout
            out an answer, but rather to think about the
            question as the speech continues.

         · A direct reference to your audience may be an
            excellent method to engage them. Your audience
            is the single most important factor is crafting
            your speech, so it makes sense that you might
            acknowledge them in some way. Here is an
            example: "As students at Oklahoma State, you
            and I know the importance of selecting a major.
            In today's competitive world, we need to choose
            a major that will lead to employment and
            provide us with fulfilling careers. That's why I
            want you all to consider majoring in
            communication." In this example, the speaker
            reminds the audience of their shared status as
            Oklahoma State students and uses this common
            ground to acknowledge the importance of
            selecting a major.

         · An opening quotation is another way to
            capture your listeners' attention. Maybe you will
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 437

            find an interesting quotation in one of the
            articles or books you read while researching
            your speech. Quotations may add an element of
            fun to a speech: "As the late actress, fashion
            icon, and social activist Audrey Hepburn once
            noted, `Nothing is impossible. The word itself
            says I'm possible'!" As with this example, be
            sure to credit the source first if you use a
            quotation as your attention getter.

         · Humor can be a great way to engage an
            audience, but it is a double-edged sword. If you
            do not wield the sword carefully, you can lose
            your audience very quickly. One of the biggest
            mistakes a speaker can make is to use some
            form of humor that the audience either does not
            find funny or, worse, finds offensive. Think
            about how incompetent the character of Michael
            Scott seems on the television program The
            Office, in part because of his ineffective use of
            humor. As with other attention-getting devices,
            your humor must be relevant to your topic and
            must respect your audience's sensitivities.

This list of opening devices represents a starting point
for beginning your speech. As indicated, your selection of
attention getter is not only dependent on your audience,
your topic, and the occasion, but also on your preferences
and skills as a speaker.

      Body
As with the other sections of the presentation, keep in
mind the importance of audience engagement. In general,
the more interactive the presentation, the better; the more
you know your audience, the better. Remember that each
person's learning style differs from the next, so do your
438 Katrina Peterson

best to engage your audience in different ways, possibly
by including details that appeal to the five senses (sensory
details). You might also include audio, tactile, and/or
kinesthetic components in addition to your chosen visual.

      With experience, you will learn to gauge your
audience's level of engagement and make small
adjustments that help them to stay involved. Depending on
context, it may be appropriate to include some movement;
perhaps you ask your audience to engage with one another
in small groups, which causes a small spatial shift, or
perhaps you yourself take a few steps closer to a
whiteboard. Integrating props or relevant hand gestures
may achieve a similar effect. Our eyes naturally follow
movement, so something as simple as walking across the
room can serve to include more members of the audience
and help them to re-engage. The techniques you can
employ within the body of a presentation are many and
various, but as above all, know yourself and know your
audience. (See Chapter 2 for additional information on
audience.)

      Conclusion
The conclusion has three specific elements that you will
want to incorporate. Given the nature of these elements and
what they do, these should generally be incorporated into
your conclusion in the order they are presented below.

       1. Signal the end. A good conclusion should
            clearly signal the end of a speech. You may be
            thinking that telling an audience you are about
            to end is a no brainer, but many speakers do not
            prepare their audience for their conclusion.
            When a speaker just suddenly stops speaking,
            the audience is left confused and disappointed.
            Instead, give listeners a clear signal so that they
                    Technical and Professional Writing Genres 439

    can mentally organize and catalog all the points
    you have made for further consideration later.

Generally, the easiest way to forecast the end of your
speech is to include a verbal signal that is meta-
discursive (or self-referential in some sense,
referring back to the speech itself). Within a public
speaking context, periodic meta-discursive
references help an audience to track a speaker's
progress from introduction to conclusion. Common
formulations include phrasings like in conclusion,
in summary, and to conclude. Depending on your
audience, you may choose a more conversational
or creative method of signaling; you will want to
make sure that the framing does not sound too cliché.
You have many options, but it should be clear to
everyone that you are about to conclude. Also be
aware that some of the common formulations (and
saying them more than once) can have an unintended
negative effect. The audience may decide you are
finished and tune out, like how movie-goers get up
and leave during the credits in a movie. If this is a
concern, you can instead go straight to the summary
explained further below.

2. Restate main points. In the introduction of a
    speech you delivered a preview of your main
    points; in the conclusion you will likely deliver
    a review. Repetition is especially important in
    oral communication; include planned
    redundancy, but avoid being overly redundant.
    Just as you discussed and made transitions to
    your main points during the body of the speech,
    be sure to review the main points in the
440 Katrina Peterson

            conclusion. These steps increase the likelihood
            that the audience will retain your main points
            after the speech is over.

       As you review, avoid introducing new material or
       ideas. For example, if you said, "There are several
       other issues related to this topic, such as...but I don't
       have time for them," the audience may wonder why
       you did not address those in the body section. If you
       were giving a persuasive speech on wind energy and
       ended with "wind energy is the energy of the future,
       but there are still a few problems with it, such as
       noise and killing lots of birds," you are bringing up
       a counter-argument that should have been dealt with
       in the body of the speech. The conclusion is not the
       place for new material.

       3. Include a clincher. The third element of your
            conclusion is the clincher, a memorable ending
            sometimes referred to as a concluding device.
            Make these words count, since they are the last
            you will include in the speech. In a sense, you
            could think of your speech as a nice dinner at a
            fancy restaurant: the introduction is the
            appetizer that gets everyone ready for the main
            course, the body section is the "meat and
            vegetables," and the conclusion is like dessert.
            But have you ever had a nice meal that ended
            with an unappetizing dessert? Regardless of how
            good the rest of the meal was, you probably
            walked away with a negative final impression.

       The clincher is like the inverse of the attention-
       getter. You want to start the speech strong, and you
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 441

       want to end the speech strong. There are a number
       of ways you can make your clincher strong and
       memorable. You can conclude with a challenge, or
       a call to action. In a speech on the necessity of
       fund-raising, a speaker could challenge the audience
       to raise 10% more than their original projections.
       In a speech on eating more vegetables, a speaker
       could challenge the audience to increase their current
       intake of vegetables by two portions daily, asking
       audience members to take a specific action or make
       a change. Challenges can be aspirational and they
       can be inspirational, but they should always be
       reasonable; the audience should see the challenge as
       attainable.

12.3 Presentation Options

Quite often, you will have to prepare visual materials to
accompany your talk. You might prepare handouts, but it is
even more probable that you will need to prepare materials
that can be projected on a video screen. The classic version
of these projected materials is the overhead transparency, a
thin sheet of clear plastic that you can run through a laser
printer or write on with special markers; this medium is
quickly disappearing, although it still surfaces. Sometimes,
you might be able to project paper documents to a screen
via a document camera, but doc cams are becoming less
common, and they can only present static images.

      Instead, you will most likely be asked to create a
dynamic presentation using software such as PowerPoint,
Prezi, or Keynote. Many other programs exist, including
what Google has to offer, but these are among the three
most common presentation programs. Each program has
442 Katrina Peterson

its own special abilities and strengths; however, they all
share common basic principles that you can use to create
memorable, effective, and interesting presentations. The
following information will help you with selecting an
effective presentation format.

      Three Major Presentation Formats
For a presentation using PowerPoint, Prezi, or Keynote,
you can choose from three general formatting options: 1)
bullet points, 2) illustrated points, and 3) speaker's prop.
The format you choose should fit your audience and your
presentation's subject.

      Bullet Points. The bullet points format is the default
layout for most PowerPoint users and viewers. Slides
created in this format commonly include a title across the
top and a cascading series of bulleted lines of text inside
a slide's main text box. Here is an example of this kind of
slide:

Figure 1: Slide organized around a cascading series of bulleted
lines of text.
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 443

      Bullet points format presentations have several
benefits. First, they are easy to prepare. (Just type, press
Enter for a new line, and hit Tab to create a smaller bullet
or Shift+Tab to make a larger bullet.) Secondly, they are
useful for highlighting important words or naming
concepts that an audience needs to learn. Finally, they
project a serious tone and sense of professionalism.

      As you consider these options, keep in mind that
bullet points format presentations may be boring unless
precautions are taken to keep the audience engaged; an
overload of words may also make your audience cringe or
lose interest. You have probably endured at least one bad
PowerPoint in your life, and odds are, that bad presentation
used the bullet points format.

      Illustrated Points. The illustrated points format is
similar, but slides created in this type of presentation focus
on pictures, and text appears in a supporting role. An
example of this kind of slide appears below.
444 Katrina Peterson

Figure 2: Slide that utilizes illustrated points format, emphasizing
pictures with text in a supporting role.

Illustrated points format slides have several benefits. They
are excellent for showing conceptual relationships or
demonstrating physical relationships between objects.
People often respond positively to pictures, so illustrated
points format slides also tend to capture viewers' interest
more than all-text presentations do. These slides require
more detailed preparation, however, and they tend to be
more visually busy. If your audience has problems
concentrating, if you need to highlight important words,
or if you need to move quickly through the information
on the slides, you may want a more text-based approach.
Illustrated points format slides can also be combined with
bullet points format slides inside the same presentation.

      Speaker's Prop. The speaker's prop format is similar
to the illustrated points format, but a speaker's prop almost
entirely consists of simple pictures that flash onscreen in
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 445

rapid sequence. Any text that appears is very short, uses
a large font, and only appears for a moment. A speaker's
prop is appropriate for abstract subjects (e.g., the nature
of free will), and if it is done well, it can be fascinating
and will engage an audience. However, this type of
presentation is often more complex and time-consuming to
prepare than a presentation in the other formats, and you
run the risk of making it so entertaining that the audience
may remember the presentation but forget what you said.
An example of a speaker's prop presentation appears in the
YouTube video below:

                    One or more interactive elements has been
                    excluded from this version of the text. You can
                    view them online here:
        https://open.library.okstate.edu/
        technicalandprofessionalwriting/?p=40#oembed-1

      (https://www.youtube.com/
watch?feature=player_embedded&v=RrpajcAgR1E).

      Whichever format you choose, remember that the
presentation software is your servant; do not let it tell
you what to do, and always modify a template to suit
your needs. As an excellent example of what not to do,
consider Peter Norvig's classic Gettysburg PowerPoint:
(https://norvig.com/Gettysburg/).

      It serves as a satirical example of how an excellent
speech--in this case, Abraham Lincoln's famous
Gettysburg Address, widely considered one of the classic
speeches in the English language--can be ruined by using
446 Katrina Peterson

presentation software default settings and following a
built-in template without modifying it.

12.4 Slide Design Tips

The guidelines in the design chapter--CRAP in
particular--will help you create consistent, helpful, and
visually appealing slides. But all the design skill in the
world will not help you if your content is not tightly
focused, smoothly delivered, and visible. Slides overloaded
with text and/or images will strain your audience's capacity
to identify important information. Complex, distracting
transitions or confusing (or boring) graphics that are not
consistent with your content are worse than no graphics at
all. Here are some general tips:

         · Think simplicity. Use a small number of high-
            quality graphics and limit bullet points and text.
            Also avoid thinking of a slide as a page that
            your audience should read; instead, elaborate on
            major points with examples to keep the
            presentation interesting and pare down text as
            much as possible. Remember: even if you are
            presenting a slideshow, you want the audience to
            pay more attention to your words than to the
            slides themselves. Too much text will make the
            audience concentrate on reading slides instead
            of listening carefully to the verbal information.

         · Break up your information. Organize the
            information into small chunks of text--phrases
            rather than complete sentences--to make sure
            your presentation flows well. Some experts
            recommend having no more than five bullet
                  Technical and Professional Writing Genres 447

   points per slide. If you do have more than five,
   you may want to set up the bullet points to
   appear a few at a time (in order, on separate
   slides, or in different columns) to avoid the
   distraction of a longer list.

· Have a consistent visual theme. Some pros
   advise that you avoid using the stock
   PowerPoint templates, but the Repetition and
   Alignment aspects of CRAP are so important
   that the templates may be your best starting
   point.

· Choose a simple color scheme. In general,
   three to six colors should provide variety
   without overloading readers. Be consistent in
   how you use the colors. For example, if you use
   red font for the first 12 slides, you should
   probably not switch to blue font in the last 12
   slides unless there is a clear and logical reason
   for doing so.

· Choose your font carefully. Make sure the text
   is readable from a distance in a darkened room.
   Many guidelines suggest that you use at least a
   24-point font. Contrast is also important; place
   dark font on a light background or vice-versa.

· Practice your presentation. Software is only a
   tool, and the slide projector is not
   presenting--you are in charge. Realizing this is
   half the battle.

· Use graphics. In general, substantive slides
   should present a graphic that illustrates or
   supports your main point. Instead of the typical
   topic and bullet point slide layout, a more
448 Katrina Peterson

            effective strategy for PowerPoint presentations
            slides may involve offering a claim backed by
            visual support in the form of a photo, graph,
            illustration, chart, etc.

         · Be careful not to overload the slide (with
            either too much text or too many graphics).
            There is not necessarily one rule of thumb for
            how much is too much, but be deliberate with
            choices.

12.5 Pitfalls of Presentation Software

Since Microsoft introduced PowerPoint in 1990, the
conference room has never been the same. Millions were
amazed by the speed with which a marketing professional
or an academic could put together a consistent,
professional-looking slide presentation. And then . . .

      At some point, somebody with critical thinking skills
asked a great question: "Do we really need all these slide
shows?" The stock images of arrows, business people in
suits, stick figures scratching their heads, and the glowing,
jewel-toned backgrounds eventually looked tired and failed
to evoke the "wow" reaction presenters desired.

      Microsoft is attempting to refresh the design options
for PowerPoint, and there are dozens of good alternatives,
some of them free (Keynote, Slide Bureau, Prezi,
SlideRocket, Easel.ly, Emaze, Slidedog). But the
fundamental problem remains--text-heavy, unfocused,
long presentations are the problem, not the software. If you
are sure that a visual presentation will provide something
necessary to your audience, keep the number of slides
and the amount of text on each slide to a bare minimum.
Think of a slide presentation as a way of supporting or
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 449

augmenting the content in your talk; the slides should not
replace your content.

      Above all, do not read the slides to your audience,
which is considered one of the single most annoying things
a presenter can do; it also makes the presenter seem
unprepared. Excessively small text and complex visuals
(including distracting animations) are also frequently cited
as annoyances. Instead, make sure that viewers can read
slides easily from the back of the room. Also try to design
your slides so that they contain information that your
viewers might want to write down. For example, good
presentations often contain data points that speakers cannot
just rattle off or quick summaries of key concepts that
viewers will not be able to make up on the fly. If you
cannot explain how the slides add value to your
presentation, it might be best to avoid using them
altogether.

      To get a feel for what may annoy your audience,
try Googling "annoying PowerPoint presentations." Also
consider designing your presentation to allow for audience
participation instead of passive viewing of a slideshow--a
good group activity or a two-way discussion is a far better
way to keep an audience engaged than a stale, repetitive set
of slides.

      In summary, a tool is only as effective as the person
using it. Presentation software like PowerPoint does not
make students stupid and professors boring; rather, poor
use of this tool makes for ineffective presentations and can
lead to laziness in both the audience and the presenter.
Many of the problems with presentations result from
readily accessible tools being used by individuals untrained
in rhetorical and visual design. Fortunately, students of
technical communication can implement a change of
strategy to make presentations more effective.

12.6 Presentation Preparation

Research shows that public speaking rates among people's
top fears; some surveys suggest that it ranks above fear
of surgery, or even death. Why do so many people dislike
public speaking? This is a complex question, and the
answer is tied to factors both personal and psychological,
ranging from past experience and training to culture and
context. The term glossophobia combines the Greek words
for "tongue" and "fear or dread" to reference a severe fear
of public speaking. People who suffer from glossophobia
tend to freeze in front audiences. This fear may surface
in situations such as responding to a professor in class or
having to interact with a stranger, not just giving formal
speeches.

      Here are some strategies to help overcome anxiety as
you prepare for your presentation. In addition to planning
the details of content and delivery, be sure to prepare
physically. Adequate sleep and rest are crucial. You might
be thinking such a thing is impossible in college or in a
demanding full-time job, where sleep deprivation and late
nights come with the territory. However, research shows
the extreme effects a lifestyle of limited sleep can have, far
beyond yawning or dozing off in class. Energy levels (and
your ability to be alert during the speech) will be affected
by lack of sleep.

      As you prepare, you may want to eat something that
is protein-based before speaking. In other words, cheese
or peanut butter on whole grain toast, Greek yogurt, or
eggs for breakfast would be preferable to more sugary
options. Also wear clothes that are comfortable but meet
the context's formality requirements. Wear the same outfit
when you rehearse the presentation so that you will feel
                              Technical and Professional Writing Genres 451

comfortable walking and moving in that attire.
Comfortable, professional shoes will give you a firm base
for your posture. You might consider utilizing some
stretching or relaxation techniques that will loosen your
limbs or throat. Tightening and stretching your hands,
arms, legs, and throat for a few seconds before speaking
can help release some of the tension. Also, bring something
to drink to prevent dry mouth, and take several deep
breaths (to release stress and steady your voice) before
climbing on stage. People tend to speak faster and at a
higher pitch when they are nervous and giving a
presentation. Make an effort to speak at a comfortable
pace and avoid letting your voice rise too high. Do not
apologize before you give your presentation; being nervous
is normal, and although you may feel jittery, chances are
your audience will not mind or will not even notice.

      Contextual Preparation
The more you can know about the venue where you will
be speaking, the better. Whenever possible, check out the
space in advance. For example, if you were required to
give a short talk for a job interview, you would want to
know what the room will be like, if there is equipment for
projection, how large the audience will be, and how seating
will be arranged. Consider practicing your presentation in
a room that is similar to the actual space where you will
deliver it. The best advice for contextual preparation is to
be on time, even early. If you have to rush in at the last
minute, it will be difficult to stay calm and focused for the
speech. If you are early, you may be able to make sure
equipment is working, or even converse with the audience
as they enter. Professional speakers often do this to relax
themselves, build credibility, and gain knowledge to adapt
their presentations to the audience. Being on time will help
452 Katrina Peterson

you create a good first impression and thus enhance your
credibility before the actual speech.

      Procrastination and Preparedness
Procrastination is the great enemy of preparedness. Fluid,
articulate public speaking requires repeated practice before
the actual delivery. The first time that you say the words
should not be when you are in front of your audience.
Practicing is the best way to feel confident and in control
of the words you speak. As you practice, time yourself to
be certain that your speech meets the time limit; speaking
within the expected time is a cardinal rule of public
speaking. Practice aloud, preferably with someone to
listen, while using your visual aids. If you can record
yourself in order to analyze gestures and delivery, you will
be able to fine-tune and adjust elements of your speaking
style. The most effective way to gain a reputation as
someone who does not respect an audience (or someone
who should not be allowed to run meetings) is to talk
longer than the allotted time. Not only will practice help
you to feel comfortable with presentation delivery, but it
will also ensure that you do not upset your audience by
running over the time limit.

      Final Note: If you are an audience member, you can
help speakers to feel more comfortable, at least a little bit.
Be an engaged listener from beginning to end. You can
imagine that a speaker is going to be more nervous if the
audience looks bored from the start. A speaker with less
anxiety will do a better job and be more interesting, so give
the speaker your full attention, nod along to main points,
ask questions where appropriate, and stay off your phone
unless you are using it to take notes.

12.7 Delivery Tips

What follows are some general tips you should keep in
mind, but they all essentially derive from one very straight-
forward premise: practice your speech beforehand, at home
or elsewhere, the way you will give it.

         · Practice your speech aloud. This technique
            enables speakers to learn the words and be
            prepared, but it also lets them know of any
            potential problems. Sentences on paper do not
            always translate when spoken. Practicing out
            loud allows speakers to identify and fix issues
            with pronunciation and delivery before getting
            up in front of the audience.

         · Avoid excessive body movements. This includes
            nervous or unnecessary hand motions,
            unnecessary tapping of feet or hands, etc. But
            also avoid standing stock still; some hand
            gestures can keep the audience engaged.

         · Eliminate filler words such as "uh" and "um."
            Recording yourself, or asking a friend to listen
            to your speech, can help you to identify this
            tendency. In some cases, it may be possible to
            integrate meaningful pauses in the place of filler
            words to reduce their frequency.

         · Project your voice. Soft-spoken speakers may
            have to speak louder to ensure that everyone can
            hear, while avoiding the appearance of shouting
            or reaching an awkwardly squeaky pitch. If you
            will be using a microphone, practice in advance
            how you will hold it and the volume you will
454 Katrina Peterson

            use.

         · Articulate sentences clearly. Again, be aware of
            your own tendencies. If you tend to elide words,
            or if you have a regional accent that differs from
            your audience's, you may need to slow down
            and practice enunciating in a way that sounds
            natural rather than forced.

         · Add inflection and expression. Presenters who
            speak in a monotone will have difficulty
            keeping an audience engaged.

         · Refuse to become flustered. In many cases, an
            apology is unnecessary and will only draw
            undue attention to minor oversights, whether
            perceived or actual. Instead, take a breath, re-
            focus, and move on with the speech.

         · Make eye contact. If it feels awkward to
            maintain direct eye contact, look around the
            room at forehead level, or a point slightly above
            viewers' heads, making sure to include the
            entire audience.

         · Maintain an open body posture. Crossed arms,
            for example, can make a speaker seem closed
            off to the audience. In contrast, open hand
            gestures that are not excessive tend to
            communicate a corresponding openness to
            audience engagement and ideas.

There is no preset pattern for perfect delivery. However,
with practice everyone can improve. For a few additional
tips and suggestions, check out this amusing TedX talk on
YouTube by Will Stephen:

      As you practice your presentation skills, remember
that each speaker is entirely unique, and we each embody
different experiences and interests. This means that all
speakers must find their own most effective style.
