Writing this book made it abundantly clear to me how very un-solitary
the process of writing is. This is not a work by an `individual', but rather
an assemblage of people, ideas, collaborations, support, and love from
both humans and non-humans. Two people who have had a major hand
in shaping this book--Yoni Van Den Eede and Joke Bauwens--were
generous in both their support and criticism, encouraging my diverse
interests while also gently keeping me from veering too far off my own
path. Their critical feedback has been invaluable in keeping my words
and ideas on track. I am also indebted to my colleagues Cathy Adams,
Alberto Romele, Laurence Claeys, and Marc Van Den Bossche for their
insightful feedback and guidance in the shaping of this work.

    I am deeply grateful to my wife, Marieke, who has supported me
emotionally, financially, and academically. From her authentically loving
self to her brilliance as an editor, she has encouraged me throughout this
adventure. I also thank my children, Eli and Georgia, for their support
and encouragement for me to leave the country for four-plus years
in order to pursue my dream of living overseas. As well, I thank my
parents and extended parents (Erlene and Robert, Bill and Charlie, and
Helene and Donald), whose love, upbringing, friendship, and continual
financial support have helped immensely. I am also blessed with two
wonderful siblings, Mark who courageously and creatively also has
leaped into the unknown and followed his entrepreneurial dreams,
and LJ whose own passion for living an authentic life, as well as their
academic brilliance, inspire me and give me confidence to pursue my
own eclectic interests whole-heartedly. I am also indebted to my cousin
Teri and her son Colby for rescuing me with some last minute design
work.

    I thank my wonderful colleagues in several research departments
(CEMESO/ECHO and ETHU) at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel as well
x  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

as the ETHICS group (EA 7446) at the Catholic University of Lille who
have inspired, supported, and challenged me. I want to thank all those
who provided feedback during my many conference presentations, as
well as all the conversations that I have had with colleagues from the
field of philosophy of technology and posthumanism. I am thankful for
the generous financial support of Prescott College, the Communications
Sciences department at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, the Catholic
University of Lille, and the Region Hauts-de-France. My hope is that
through all of this support the ideas developed in this book can help
contribute to making the world a better place by helping us dance with
the technologies in our lives with more intentionality and awareness.

           1. Introduction:

    Problematizing our Relations with

             Media Technologies

We are immersed in a world mediated by information and communication
technologies (ICTs), both hardware (smartphones, smartwatches,
home assistants) and software (algorithms, software programs, and
infrastructures such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat). We
are transformed by these media, whether we have invited them into
our lives or not. We subsequently perceive and engage with the world
through these transformations. However, media literacy for the most
part does not provide clear assistance in helping us become aware of
these effects.

    Thus far, media literacy has focused mainly on developing the
skills to access, analyze, evaluate, and create media messages, and
has not focused sufficiently on the impact of the actual technological
medium, how it enables and constrains both messages and media users.
Additionally, a more fully developed media literacy would situate
media investigations in such a way as to allow for a deeply practical
analysis without losing a holistic, theoretical perspective. In order to
accomplish this, a concise transdisciplinary approach comprised of a
general framework and specific instrument is proposed. This approach
is based on an interdisciplinary study of postphenomenology, media
ecology, philosophical posthumanism, and complexity theory.

2  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    The framework of the approach described in this book uses six
groupings of relations: technological, sociocultural, time, space, mind,
and body, with a main emphasis on technological relations. How
these relations, as well as their interrelational effects, participate in the
constitution of the human subject is explored through an analysis of a
museum selfie, which contributes to the development of a pragmatic
instrument that can be used for media literacy.

    The pragmatic instrument helps bring to the foreground the
contributing influences that are continually constituting human subjects
in everyday media environments, thus allowing people to make more
informed decisions on which media they invite into their lives. The
human subject is understood here as a posthuman subject, as opposed to
the standalone, exceptional being with roots in the Enlightenment. The
posthumanist approach understands the human subject as constantly
becoming through the myriad of constituting relations in their life.
While it is not possible to completely understand the complexity of
all interrelations that constitute us, the more we can become aware of
how we relate with the world through these transformed aspects of
our selves, the greater chance we will have for reclaiming some of our
agency, which arguably is the main goal of media literacy.

    In this chapter I provide an overview of the current trend of an ever-
increasingly media-saturated world and how media literacy currently
responds. I discuss the importance of the technological medium,
the technological relation, and describe the importance of better
understanding the human subject. I share the overall structure of this
book and briefly touch upon the various fields that will be addressed.

                    Situating the Research

My own personal research interest began by focusing specifically
on the effect of ICTs on museum visitor experience. Investigating the
mediating relations between humans and technologies led me to an
approach in philosophy of technology called postphenomenology.
While this helped me to understand the mediating role of technologies,
it also raised unanswered questions as to exactly how the subject was
being transformed in its relation with technology. This then led me
to broaden my focus and attempt to more completely understand the
1. Introduction: Problematizing our Relations with Media Technologies  3

subject as embodied and situated in a complex network of a multiplicity
of relations, one group of these relations being technological. This led
me to develop an approach that reflects this interrelationality and that
can be an effectively used for media literacy.

    It is fairly common for people in the developed Western world to
live in a media-saturated environment. However, far from being new,
this trend began in earnest with Gutenberg's invention of the printing
press,1 which eventually led to an exponential increase in literacy and a
democratization of information, education, and knowledge (Martin &
Cochrane, 1994; Ong, 2012; Postman, 2006; Strate, 2014). The printing
press paved the way for communication through mass replication and
broad dissemination. Today, as we2 enter into the second decade of the
twenty-first century, there is a ubiquity of screened-communication
technologies that allow us, for the most part, to communicate
whenever and wherever the mood strikes. The ubiquity of ICTs such as
smartphones, tablets, and laptops--sometimes referred to as technomedia
(Han, 2008)--is the everyday environment within which we live, and
this has become `normal' and unremarkable for a large part of the
world--simply part of how things are. Unless noted otherwise, the ICTs
I refer to are digitally networked devices that are prevalent in much of
the world today.

    In the United States, `Digital media use has increased considerably,
with the average 12th grader in 2016 spending more than twice as much
time online as in 2006' (Twenge et al., 2019: 329). In the European Union
(EU), while television is still the most commonly used medium--84%
watch it every day or almost every day and 94% watch it at least once per
week--the number of people who use the internet is catching up, with
65% of EU citizens using it daily or almost daily and 77% using it at least
once per week (European Commission, 2018: 4). And throughout the
world, a 2017 Pew Research global survey showed that while smartphone
ownership has remained steady for developed nations--at around 72%--
it is increasing in developing nations, growing from approximately 25%
in 2013/2014 to 42% in 2017 (Poushter et al., 2018: 4).

  1It was not the production of books (since books were already being produced),
        but rather the re-production that printing enabled, making it possible for a large
        number of people to own a copy of a certain book title.

  2Unless otherwise noted, general pronouns such as `we' refer to the majority of
        people living in the contemporary developed Western world.
4  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    This environment of ubiquitous ICTs brings many benefits. With our
GPS-enabled smartphones we rarely become lost. Finding a place to eat
in an unfamiliar town, a place with good reviews and the cuisine of
our choice, is now quite easy. Keeping in touch with a large number
of friends is as simple as checking our social media feed. By allowing
notifications to be sent to us, updates from our `friends' are delivered
directly to our phones, where we can simply glance down to attend to
them. These ICTs enable a robust interconnection with our sociocultural
world.

    In this saturated media environment, the media tend to disappear into
the background of our awareness.3 They become part of the environment
in which we live. This immersion, as Figure 1.1 reflects, is especially
visible with the number of smartphones in use and how often people
are engaged with them. As Galit Wellner (2016) describes, smartphones
have a wall/window trait. They create an inclusive `window' to a
virtual world and community while also creating an alienating `wall'
to whatever and whomever is in the person's immediate surroundings.
This reflects the idea that all technologies are non-neutral and have both
enabling and constraining aspects to them (Ihde, 1990).

While many people embrace the changes and innovations in media
technologies, others are questioning, pointing out the drawbacks and
costs of such changes. The Center for Humane Technology warns, `The
companies that created social media and mobile tech have benefited our

  3See Marshall McLuhan's use of figure/ground in Logan, 2011; McLuhan et al., 1977.
1. Introduction: Problematizing our Relations with Media Technologies  5

lives enormously. But even with the best intentions, they are under intense
pressure to compete for attention, creating invisible harms for society'
(Center for Humane Technology, n.d.). There is increasing concern
about the amount of influence that the dominant GAFAM4 (Google,
Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft) technology companies have
(cf. Harris 2019, 2020; Hill, 2019; Twenge, 2017). Additionally, we should
not only be concerned with these companies and the content of media
messages, but we also should pay attention to the actual technology
itself. While there have been certain fields of media studies that focus
on the technology or medium (media ecology, mediatization,5 medium
theory), the field of media literacy has mostly avoided addressing the
effects of the technological medium in a rigorous manner.

    For all that, our daily lives are interconnected with more than media
technologies. There are sociocultural relations such as normativity,
power, and language. There are both positive and less than positive
issues with our minds and bodies that influence how we relate with
media technologies. In addition, we are always located within a specific
time and place, both of which relate to media technologies (Innis, 2008).
These groups of relations interrelate and inter-influence each other,
contributing to the creation of the ever-changing human subject. Salman
Rushdie (2006) posits, `To understand just one life, you must swallow
the world' (145). I take this to mean that everything is interconnected,
and in order to really know something, we must realize how it is
interconnected with everything.

    To put this another way, in order to understand any one mediating
technology, we must understand all the mediating interrelations that
affect us as human subjects. While achieving this level of comprehension
is implausible, it alludes to the complexity and challenge of fully
understanding the effects of media technologies on a human subject.
The more we can understand about these complex interrelations, the
greater chance we will have for reclaiming some of our agency, which
I believe is one of the primary goals of media literacy. Therefore, in an
age of ubiquitous smartphones and other communication technologies,

  4Microsoft is not always included, making it GAFA.
  5Adolf (2011) states `mediatization research is about the inherent, the structural role

        of the media system as a whole for the way we organize and (re)produce our social
        relations' (154).
6  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

implementing the approach developed in this book can enable media
literacy to identify and situate the complex interrelations, such as the
sociocultural (normativity, power, language) and the technological,
which contribute to the continual constitution of human subjects.

                        Media Literacy

The field of media literacy attempts to help educate people--especially
the young--in order to become more skilled and aware users of media
by primarily looking at `four components: access, analysis, evaluation,
and content creation' (Livingstone, 2004: 5). Sonia Livingstone describes
how these components work together as a dynamic learning process.
She outlines how learning to create content helps one better understand
and analyze professionally produced content, and the `skills in analysis
and evaluation open the doors to new uses of the internet, expanding
access, and so forth' (5).

    Media literacy is vital to our everyday engagement with ICTs because
of their everydayness (Kim, 2015; Onge, 2018). The field of media
literacy attempts to shed light on how we use, and are potentially used
by, media. With media technology everywhere in our lives, it becomes
ordinary; commonplace. These technologies are part of the fabric of
our existence, the ordinary environment within which we exist. For
example, according to a recent Nielsen report, the average adult (over
eighteen years of age) in the U.S. spends around 10 1/2 hours each
day involved with some kind of media6 (Nielsen, 2019: 3). We live in
this mediatized environment and now, more than ever, it is important
to have a comprehensive media literacy program that helps us better
understand the effects of our media-rich environment. With this in
mind, I explore the current approaches in media literacy.

                Four Approaches to Media Literacy

Media literacy focuses on education in order to help people, especially
youth, develop the skills to create (produce) with media technologies,
as well as to critically analyze and evaluate media and media messages.

  6Nielsen (2019) defines media as `TV, TV-connected devices, radio, computers,
        smartphones, and tablets' (3).
1. Introduction: Problematizing our Relations with Media Technologies  7

Rather than creating grand sociological theories, the focus of media
literacy is mostly pragmatic, concerned with helping the user improve
their `ability to access, analyze, evaluate and create messages across
a variety of contexts' (Livingstone, 2004: 3). Douglas Kellner and Jeff
Share (2005; 2007) identify four specific approaches to media literacy:
media arts education, the media literacy movement, a protectionist
approach, and critical media literacy. While these approaches --which
I will briefly describe next--can be perceived as individual approaches,
in practice they can be combined with each other, which offsets some
of the drawbacks inherent in each approach when used independently.

    The approach of media arts education focuses specifically on helping
teach students `to value the aesthetic qualities of media and the arts
while using their creativity for self-expression through creating art and
media' (Kellner & Share, 2007: 7). Here, media is a skill to be learned.
The approach of the media literacy movement has ties to print literacy
and focuses on the competencies needed in order to be perceived as
being `literate'. Kellner and Share (2005) state that media literacy
`attempts to teach students to read, analyze, and decode media texts in
a fashion parallel to the advancement of print literacy' (372). Both of
these approaches tend to perceive media in a neutral manner.

    However, the protectionist approach typically perceives media
technologies in a more determining manner. Some philosophers and
media theorists approach media and technology as something that
people, especially children, should be protected from. There are valid
concerns for a protectionist approach to focus on. Jean Twenge et al.
(2018) find, `Adolescents who spent more time on screen activities were
significantly more likely to have high depressive symptoms or have at
least one suicide-related outcome, and those who spent more time on
nonscreen activities were less likely' (9). Educating people on possible
dangers and negative effects of media falls within this protectionist
approach.

    The approach of critical media literacy has increased the scope of
media literacy by adding the critical study of how messages contain
underlying stereotypes, marginalization, and exploitation. Livingstone
(2004) writes, `to focus solely on questions of skill or ability neglects
the textuality and technology that mediates communication. [...] there
is not only skill involved but also an interpretive relationship with a
8  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

complex, symbolically-encoded, technologically-mediated text' (8).
This addition improves the ability of media literacy to explore and bring
to light important issues that are embedded in media messages (Kellner
& Share, 2005; Lemke, 2006). On the whole, critical media literacy
continues to focus on the symbolic content of the message. While this is
important, I believe that if the borders of media literacy can be expanded
to include the influence of the actual technological medium as well as
the broader context within which the media are used, then a space is
created for media literacy to be even more inclusive and effective.

    These four approaches will be discussed in more detail in Chapter
2. The approaches are representative of what is currently happening in
media literacy. However, this is not meant to imply a comprehensive
reflection of the entire field, which is constantly developing. I will
endeavor to include a few of the voices that are encouraging the
development of the field. I believe that media literacy can benefit by
expanding, and the goal reflected by my research is to create an inclusive
and situating approach to do just that.

               Benefits of Expanding Media Literacy

Supporting the expansion of media literacy, David Morley (as cited in
Krajina et al., 2014) says, `Media questions are important, then, but they
only seem to me to be really significant if they are set in a far wider
frame, rather than focusing just on media technologies themselves'
(684). One way to increase this frame is through domestication theory,7
which parallels aspects of media literacy. Roger Silverstone (1994, 2006)
developed domestication theory. Together with Morley, Silverstone
began researching television `in a broader framework' (Morley &
Silverstone, 1990: 31) in order to understand `the meanings of both texts
and technologies, [...] as emergent properties of contextualized audience
practices' (32). Domestication theory focused beyond simply the text and
analyzed `a whole range of overlapping, determinate and indeterminate
social and cultural practices which together define--for particular

7From domestication theory arose the concept of double articulation, which `provides
      an inclusive move from the semiology to the sociology of media use' (Silverstone et
      al., 1991: 219). Here, the media object (the television set being the one primarily
      studied) is examined as a material object embedded within a broader (domestic)
      context.
1. Introduction: Problematizing our Relations with Media Technologies  9

viewers at particular times in particular places--their relationship to the
medium' (Silverstone, 1989: 108).

    While domestication theory has worked fairly well theoretically, it
has been criticized for the challenge of empirically applying the theory
(Hartmann, 2006). Even with the inclusion of the media-as-object,
domestication theory still lacks a robust way of investigating the effects
of the medium. While domestication concerns itself primarily with
social theory, it focuses less on educating the individual as media literacy
does. What is still missing is a concentrated approach to investigating
the effects of a specific medium on individuals and societies.

    While domestication theory includes attention to media objects such
as television sets, it often does so in an anthropological or ethnographic
approach (cf. Horst, 2012; Lesage, 2013) with an emphasis on the context
within which the object resides. Morley (2009) states, `we need a new
paradigm for the discipline, which attends more closely to its material
as well as its symbolic dimensions' (114).

    The study of media and communications can also have an
interdisciplinary focus. Shaun Moores (2005) explains, `media have to be
understood in their broad social and cultural contexts' (3). He suggests
that it is a common misconception that `media studies are simply about
"studying media" in isolation' (3). Contextualizing ideas from Moores
and domestication theory counters a more narrowly defined approach to
media literacy, and lends support to enhancing media literacy through
a situating approach.

    Beyond media literacy are other media-related fields researching the
impact of ICTs. Some of these are areas that focus on the technological
features of media, but their approach can often be more functional.
Examples of this are digital literacy (Koltay, 2011; Nichols & Stornaiuolo,
2019); data literacy (Koltay, 2015); and the digital detox movement
(Bauwens et al., 2019; Rauch, 2018; Ugur & Koc, 2015).

    Additionally, there are disciplines that can provide insights outside
of media and communications, which focus on the relation between
humans and technologies; these include postphenomenology, actor-
network theory (ANT), and the general field of philosophy of technology.
Also, scholars like Rosi Braidotti, Katherine Hayles, and Donna Haraway
offer viewpoints from within philosophical posthumanism that focus
more on the human side of human-technology relations. They focus on
10  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

concepts such as de-centering the human and making sure marginalized
groups are included in any definition of `human'.

     The Non-neutrality of Technological Relations

In order to investigate the influence of the technological medium I
implement two approaches: a microperceptual and a macroperceptual.
The microperceptual approach focuses on the embodied and embedded
perspective of a human subject. The macroperceptual approach focuses
on the broader sociocultural context that the particular human subject
exists within. Don Ihde (1990) says, `There is no microperception
(sensory-bodily) without its location within a field of macroperception
and no macroperception without its microperceptual foci' (29). Both
the microperceptual and macroperceptual views are entangled and
necessary in order to comprehend overall the effects of media and to
fully become media literate.

    While the four approaches in media literacy (cf. above) are effective
in what they do, there are several concepts from other fields of
study that can help create a more robust approach. In order to better
understand technological objects, and our relations with them, the
fields of postphenomenology and media ecology excel at analyzing
technologies, covering the micro level of the embedded and embodied
human subject, as well as the sociocultural macro level respectively.
Both also stress relationality as a means to understand how we are
constituted and transformed by the technological relations in our lives.

               Technological Mediation as Relation:
                          A Micro Approach

Relationality is one of the foundational concepts of the posthuman
approach that I develop as well as being fundamental to
postphenomenology's concept of technological mediation.
Technological mediation describes how our technological relations are
not neutral, but without succumbing to technological determinism. Jan
Bergen and Peter-Paul Verbeek (2020) say, `technological mediation
aims to take technological artifacts seriously, recognizing the
constitutive role they play in how we experience the world, act in it, and
         1. Introduction: Problematizing our Relations with Media Technologies 11

how we are constituted as (moral) subjects' (1). Postphenomenology
specifically analyzes the technological mediation using the formula:
I-technology-world. As humans, we are never standalone beings but
always in relation; these relations are non-neutral,8 contributing to the
co-constitution of our selves, the specific technology, and the world (cf.
Ihde, 1990; Rosenberger & Verbeek, 2015; Smith, 2015; Van Den Eede,
2016; Verbeek, 2005). The term `constitution' is used to describe the
specific coming together or unique arrangement that takes place in the
process of these relations.

    Postphenomenology describes four types of technological relations:
embodied (where we perceive the world through the technology, such
as with eyeglasses); hermeneutic (where we read the technology to
better understand the world, such as with a thermometer); alterity
(where we interact with the technology as a quasi-other, such as with
an ATM machine); and background (which affect us but mostly go
unnoticed, such as a heating and cooling system for one's house).
Postphenomenology excels at investigating the microperceptions
experienced by people when they interact with the technologies in their
lives. Postphenomenology also acknowledges macroperceptions, what
Ihde (1990) calls cultural hermeneutics. However, the sociocultural
component is not as emphasized in practice as the microperception.
This is where media ecology can contribute to our understanding of
technology as an environment.

            Media Environments: A Macro Approach

Media ecology is a macro approach that describes media environments.
This means that the approach often investigates the broader effects that
media has on cultures and societies. Marshall McLuhan (1994) is the
person most often associated with media ecology. McLuhan consistently
attempted to get society's attention focused on the hidden influence
of the medium that helped shape the media's content. His famous
aphorism, `The medium is the message' (7) was one such attempt. He
often explained it through the figure/ground analogy where one's usual
focus is on the figure (in this case the media's content) and the ground

  8The term non-neutral is used to indicate that a relation is not completely determining
        but also is not completely neutral.
12  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

(in this case the medium) goes unnoticed. While McLuhan popularized
the study of media, the field of media literacy rarely works closely with
his ideas.9 Instead, media literacy was `developed through the work of
Len Masterman in England and Barry Duncan in Canada' (as cited in
Jolls & Wilson, 2014: 68). Duncan (2010) credited the work of McLuhan
for inspiring him in his study of media but still held that the primary
focus of media literacy was to understand and study representation.

    In contrast, media ecologists focus on understanding media as
environments and how those environments affect society. Harold Innis
(2008) writes about the differences that various mediums afford. For
instance, Innis discusses the biases of media relating to time and space.
He describes heavy media such as clay or stone tablets as being more
permanent (able to move through time) but too cumbersome to move
very well through space. Papyrus or radio is just the opposite; easy to
move across space, but less permanent to move very far through time.
This bias affects the type of content that can be `carried' by the medium.
For example, Innis criticizes radio as a medium that `accentuated the
importance of the ephemeral and of the superficial' (82). So, while it is
important to analyze the content of media as critical media literacy does,
it is also fruitful to analyze the medium itself.

    Statements such as the above from Innis have contributed to the
criticism that media ecology is technologically deterministic, with
their focus on how media technologies influence individual and
social behavior. However, before McLuhan popularized looking at the
medium, media studies primarily focused on the content of media
messages, heavily influenced by semiotics. As most people in media
studies were already focused on the content, McLuhan worked to shed
light on what was difficult to perceive, which he did by using dramatic
and sweeping statements such as the already cited `the medium is the
message', or `in all media the user is the content' (as cited in McLuhan
& Zingrone, 1997: 266).

    Most media ecologists have simply been trying to include the
influence of the medium in the discussion and do not claim that the
medium is all determining, only that it is not neutral. Lance Strate (2017:
34) states this quite clearly:

  9Ivan Kalmar (2005) suggests, `if McLuhan's name no longer rings as it once did, it is
        because history has paid his ideas the compliment of making them commonplace'
        (227).
         1. Introduction: Problematizing our Relations with Media Technologies 13

    The term technological determinism, [...] has been linked to the field of
    media ecology. For the most part, it is a label applied by critics, rather
    than a term used, let alone embraced, within the field. As there is no
    doctrine of technological determinism, or arguments that explicitly
    state such a position within our field, its use amounts to a straw man10
    argument used to dismiss media ecological scholarship, rather than
    subject it to serious consideration.

                   Which Human Subject?

While technological relations bring some agency to the technological
object side of the human-technology relation, Tamar Sharon (2014)
points out that disciplines such as postphenomenology focus more on
`breathing life into objects [...] than delving into the implications of
having breathed life out of subjects' (9). Sharon proposes that we take
a closer look at what is going on with the subject. As we focus on the
effects of media on the subject, it is important to identify which human
subject is being discussed. I am not referring to the ideal Enlightenment
subject: autonomous and exceptional in the world, reflecting a subject-
object duality. Instead, the subject is always-in-relation and is continually
being constituted through a complex interrelated network of relations,
what I refer to as a posthuman subject.

    Rather than a humanist way of understanding the subject, I employ
a post-humanist approach, using philosophical posthumanism, which is
quite different from transhumanism. While transhumanism does focus on
the entanglement of technology and the human, it does so from an `ultra-
humanist' (Onishi, 2011: 103) approach. The two fields use the term
posthuman in two very different ways. Transhumanists use the word to
describe an evolutionary shift for the human that they foresee occurring--
primarily through technological means--into vastly more intelligent and
efficient beings. Max More (2013) states that by `thoughtfully, carefully,
and yet boldly applying technology to ourselves, we can become
something no longer accurately described as human--we can become
posthuman. Becoming posthuman means exceeding the limitations that
define the less desirable aspects of the "human condition"' (4).

  10Philosophical strawmen arguments are arguments where the person criticizing a
        concept first defines the concept without providing all of the context or nuances,
        allowing them to easily identify flaws.
14  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    Philosophical posthumanists, however, use the term posthuman as
a way to distance themselves from the traditional idea of the human,
based primarily on Enlightenment and modern ideas of the autonomous,
standalone, and exceptional human individual. In this case, posthuman
refers to a post-humanist, post-anthropocentric, and post-dualist
approach to understanding the human (Ferrando, 2019). Posthumanism
stresses that the subject is constituted through its relations, what Karen
Barad (2007) calls intra-action, and will be explored more deeply in
Chapter 4. The approach I develop is centered on the human subject as
understood by philosophical posthumanism.

     Situating Media Literacy with Intrasubjective

                           Mediation

How can we keep everything straight? On the one hand, it is important
to focus on specific technologies and how they affect the individual. On
the other hand, it is important to focus on how the broader sociocultural
relations--such as power, normativity, or language--affect us. There
are technological and sociocultural environments all entangled and all
contributing to our own constitution. Maren Hartmann (2006) points
out the question that has not yet been solved: `how to adequately
research the complexity of the combination of media content and media
context to paint a picture of the overall whole' (89).

    One important word used throughout this book is `situating'. The
term `situate' means, `To put (something) in a (specified) context; to
describe the circumstances surrounding (something)' (OED online, 4th
definition). The approach developed is precisely dedicated to facilitating
this. It creates a simple structure that can help guide the investigation
into the complex interrelated processes that affect our relations with
media.

    The following research questions helped guide my understanding
of the transforming impact of ICT technologies in our lives and also
to inform the creation of the new approach developed. My research
questions are as follows:

        1. How can we specifically analyze and understand the
            interrelating micro and macro effects of media technologies
            on human subjects? [Chapters 3 and 4]
         1. Introduction: Problematizing our Relations with Media Technologies 15

        2. How do media relations interrelate with other relations--
            such as socio-cultural, time and space, and mind and body--
            in their constitution of the human subject? [Chapter 5]

        3. How can an instrument be developed in order to tether
            our investigations, keeping us grounded to an overarching
            inclusive framework while we delve deeply into the specific
            relations that contribute to our constitution and enhance
            media literacy? [Chapters 5 and 6]

In order to help guide an investigation into the various relations, the
approach developed leverages the concept of intrasubjective mediation,
which is the idea that we are--and continue to be--mediated by the
constituting aspects of all of our relations. The approach investigates
both the current and continuing impact from relations, which in the
case of media technology will help us to become more media literate
by understanding the broader effects of media technologies. The
framework serves to create a situating cartography,11 which captures the
main interrelating groups of relations that contribute to the constitution
of the human subject. This supports Shaun Moores' (2016) call for a
non-media-centric media literacy. By focusing on one aspect of media
literacy, we can easily lose sight of others. By creating a situating
instrument, we can tether our approach to the broader, encompassing
framework while allowing our focus to narrow momentarily into each
specific constituting relation.

             Research Significance and Design

While the ubiquitous smartphone is likely the most common ICT that
comes to mind for those in the Western globalized world, there are plenty
of other technological devices (such as ebook readers and tablets), often
networked, which make up the tapestry of our world today. Looking
around at people, especially when they are in a forced pause--waiting
for a doctor's visit, for a train, etc. (see Fig. 1.1)--often they are looking
down at some technology rather than looking around and engaging
with their immediate environment. They are immersed in technology

  11I use the term cartography as a facilitator of exploration rather than as a prescriptive
        map.
16  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

that virtually transports them elsewhere. Consider the following insight
from Yoni Van Den Eede et al. (2017b: xxv):

    With the onset of mobile communication technology, media are no longer
    `over there'; they are moving toward us, into us. Looking at the history
    of media, one perceives almost the evolution of an organism becoming
    more and more complex, diverse, and ubiquitous.

This technology can be a book, an ebook, smartphone, game console, or
any of the other technologies that permeate our contemporary world. It
is easy to become so distracted by the constant presence of technology
in our lives that we do not recognize how many of our actions are
being mediated in some way by these technologies. Instead, we tend
to focus on posting and sharing, liking and commenting; simply living
our mediated lives. The challenge for media literacy in this ubiquity
and transparency is the fact that these mediating technologies are not
registering in our awareness.

                            Use of Language

Though it is rather obvious to state that language12 plays a key role
in communication throughout this book, I want to take a moment to
acknowledge its importance. Especially as I use words like `human' in
new ways (for instance the difference between what is referred to the
human by humanists, transhumanists, or posthumanists). The specific
words I use greatly affect the success, or lack thereof, of the ability to
transmit ideas to the reader. Each word is a choice that has both benefits
and limitations. Words are limited in their ability to faithfully represent
the intended meaning behind them. In addition, words cut and separate;
they are often thought of as individual carriers of meaning. Words also
have historical use and cultural meanings attached. Different groups of
people embody different ways of viewing the world and its relations,
which affects a reader's understanding of particular words. An example
of the challenge of using words is trying to describe an interconnected
and interrelated individual when the word `individual' has been used to

12Semiotics, the study of words and language--sign and signifier--is mostly outside
      the scope of this book. However, it is quite important, so there is a place for it within
      the framework/instrument I develop.
         1. Introduction: Problematizing our Relations with Media Technologies 17

imply autonomy and separation. Kenneth Gergen (2009: xxvii) describes
this issue quite well:

    The very idea of individual persons is a byproduct of relational process.
    But how can I describe this process without using a language that
    inherently divides the world into bounded entities? To be more specific,
    by relying on common conventions of writing, I will invariably rely on
    nouns and pronouns, both of which designate bounded or identifiable
    units. The very phrase, `I rely on you....' already defines me as separate
    from you. [...] Try as I may to create a sense of process that precedes the
    construction of entities, the conventions of language resist. They virtually
    insist that separate entities exist prior to relationship.

In this book I constantly struggle with words that divide and separate
while I attempt to use them in ways that gather and combine. For instance,
I often use the term `subject' and refer to technological `objects', but
rather than meaning them in a dualist Cartesian split, I mean them to be
constituted in relation to each other and not as standalone. Additionally,
instead of using `myself' or `ourselves' I separate the terms from each
other in order to highlight the self-subject that I am focusing on. My goal
is to highlight, but not separate in any Cartesian sense.

    I have also chosen to use the present tense when citing someone. I
want to stress a current engagement with the concepts and words from
people, even if those people are no longer living. My intention is to keep
my philosophical approach as contemporary as possible, even when
engaging with older philosophical ideas.

    The words `media' and `medium' can also benefit from further
explanation. While media is plural for medium, in today's contemporary
Western world it is often used to refer to mass media, as in `the
media'. However, it is also used to refer to communication devices, as
in technological media. For this book I will specifically use the term
medium (or mediums for plural) to refer to the media technology that
performs media content--examples being television, newspapers, and
smartphones. I will use the term `media' as a more general term and one
primarily directed at content (unless used as `media literacy').

    I recognize that the term posthuman is one that can challenge some
readers and may not be readily understood. However, I view this as
beneficial since the comfort and ease which many find using the word
human is exactly what the posthuman approach is trying to undermine.
18  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

By using posthuman I hope to bring the reader's attention to figuring out
exactly what is meant. This questioning of human or posthuman is one
of the main goals of the approach described in this book.

    And finally, is the approach described best called an approach, a
method, a cartography, a cartographic method, a framework, or an
instrument? Each word carries the sediment of historical use and each
reader will interpret these words through their own understanding.
My goal is to make it as accessible as possible without either putting
on academic airs or making it too specific. Deleuze's cartography is
appropriate, and calling it a posthuman cartography would be fine for
people in the field of posthumanism. However, there are different
ways of using the term `cartography'. One way is a prescriptive
and controlled manner. This is the typical `map', with lines of
demarcation and separation, cutting a representation of reality into
categories of differentiation. This is not the way I am using the term.
Therefore, I ultimately decided to call it a `posthuman approach' to
stress its interrelational focus as well as to connect it with the various
`approaches' used in media literacy.

            Designing Interdisciplinary Research and
                    a Transdisciplinary Solution

My research is an interdisciplinary exploration of media technologies
and how our relation with media contributes to the constitution of
our subjectivity. Marilyn Stember (1991) defines interdisciplinary
as bringing `interdependent parts of knowledge into harmonious
relationships through strategies such as relating part and whole or
the particular and the general' (4). While the research I conducted has
been interdisciplinary, the solution of the posthuman approach can
be considered transdisciplinary. Wendy Austin et al. (2008) describes
how transdisciplinary solutions can often emerge spontaneously from
interdisciplinary research `when discipline-transcending concepts,
terminology, and methods evolve to create a higher level framework'
(557). This reflects the process I experienced in doing this research.

    The need for the original interdisciplinarity arose from my own
research on museum selfies (Lewis, 2017); from this work, I realized
the limitation of using only postphenomenology to investigate how my
         1. Introduction: Problematizing our Relations with Media Technologies 19

museum experience was being affected by the mediating technology that
I was using. I felt that postphenomenology was not completely able to
capture the complexity of constituting relations that I was experiencing,
and there were more relations affecting my experience than the
technological. This limitation led to more deeply exploring the concept
of the human subject in its involvement with technologies than what
postphenomenology provided. I discovered that by investigating several
fields of inquiry, there were useful insights from each field for the overall
development of my culminating approach. The fields I investigated,
all being interdisciplinary themselves, were: postphenomenology,
philosophical posthumanism, complexity, media literacy, and media
ecology. However, as Van Den Eede (2016: 103) notes,

    Notwithstanding much feverish talk about inter- and multi-disciplinarity,
    real and substantial dealings between disciplines remain hard to come
    by. Paradoxically, that even counts for disciplines that are in themselves
    eclectic and composed of elements hailing from many different domains.

My initial research question of how technology affects the human
subject steered me down several different paths, finally depositing
me, in a circular fashion, back to my starting point. In fact, it was my
investigation as to what was happening to me while taking a museum
selfie that drove me to realize that I needed a new approach that did
not seem to exist. An approach that would help me understand all of
the influencing relations that were acting upon one another during my
experience taking museum selfies.

    In order to manage the expectation of the reader, it is important to
note that my research does not reflect either a typical manuscript within
continental philosophy or a typical book in media and communications
studies. For example, many books in continental philosophy focus on a
deep analysis of the writings of a specific philosopher, and in media and
communications studies, at least where I was conducting my research
in Brussels, it is most common to do an empirical study. Instead, my
goal is to engage contemporarily with a variety of philosophers and
philosophical approaches. Using the words of other philosophers and
researchers honors the fact that they wrote the words and that the words
spoke to me, but I take responsibility for using them for my own context
and in my own way. Through this process I create an approach that is
20  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

pragmatic and helpful in learning to understand the daily effects that
media technologies have on us as human subjects.

                 The Layout of the Chapters

This book is divided into two parts. In Part I--Chapters 2 through
4--I develop the background concepts drawing upon media literacy,
postphenomenology, media ecology, and philosophical posthumanism.
However, the book does not need to be read by starting at the beginning.
Some readers may want to skip the initial foundational chapters and
simply get right to Part II--Chapters 5 and 6--where I develop the
posthuman approach, both the overarching general frame, as well as a
pragmatic instrument that shows how to implement the concepts into
media literacy. Instructors who would like to use the approach without
specifically framing it within media literacy can focus on Chapters
3 through 6. One option that I have used with university students is
an hour lecture for each of the Chapters 3 through 6. This builds the
foundation for then having the students use their specific technological
relation in order to experientially engage with the instrument described
in Chapter 6.

    Specifically, Chapter 2 explores the various aspects of media literacy,
from the five core concepts (cf. Fig. 2.1), to the four aspects outlined by
Kellner and Share (2005, 2007). Additionally, I look to domestication
theory, as first identified by Silverstone (2006; see also Haddon, 2007;
Silverstone & Haddon, 1996), which leads to the idea of double and triple
articulation of media technologies (Courtois et al., 2013; Livingstone,
2007). The concept of triple articulation emphasizes the content of the
media, the medium itself, and the context that the media is used in. This
facilitates the move for media literacy to go beyond the traditional four
approaches and connects to the next chapter.

    In Chapter 3, postphenomenology and media ecology emphasize
analyzing the technological relations on micro and macro levels.
I first investigate postphenomenology, which focuses on human-
technology relations. This creates the foundational building block of
my approach: the embodied relation. I explore various concepts that
are articulated in postphenomenology, such as the non-neutrality of
         1. Introduction: Problematizing our Relations with Media Technologies 21

technology, multistability, sedimentation, and technological mediation
as constitutive.

    Secondly, I investigate media ecology, where the focus is specifically
on the medium. I explore the idea of media as environments within
which cultures can grow. Neil Postman (1970) states that media
ecology studies information environments in order to `understand
how technologies and techniques of communication control the form,
quantity, speed, distribution, and direction of information; and how,
in turn, such information configurations or biases affect people's
perceptions, values, and attitudes' (186). However, if media literacy is
often too focused on the content, then media ecology can be accused
of being too often focused on the medium, to the detriment of other
influencing factors. There should be a balance and a manner to include
all of the influencing relations; it is this gap that I intend to eventually
fill through the approach developed.

    In Chapter 4, the investigation focuses on the subject that is being
constituted through the technological relations described in chapter
three. I use philosophical posthumanism, as opposed to a humanist or
transhumanist approach, to situate the post-humanist subject within
a non-anthropocentric and non-dualist frame. Posthumanism also
approaches the human subject as complex and always changing. I
investigate the concept of complexity that is used in posthumanism--
and occasionally used in media ecology--and I demonstrate how this
term is fundamentally different from a mechanistic or causal approach
to understanding the world.

    With the background and fundamental concepts having been firmly
established in the first four Chapters, the new framework is presented
in Chapter 5. This framework allows for a clearer understanding of all
of the relating and interrelating effects of media on the human subject,
situating not only the technological and cultural, but the relations of
time and space, as well as mind and body. I bring all the main concepts
together in order to offer a comprehensive framework for situating
media literacy.

    In Chapter 6, I demonstrate how the framework can be employed
by applying it to analyze a museum selfie. This leads to the
development of a generic instrument for self-inquiry (or one could
say an autoethnographic inquiry) into moments of media use, which
22  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

can be used for enhancing media literacy. As previously mentioned, it
was in trying to understand the constituting effect of museum selfies
that I realized I needed a more inclusive approach in the beginning
of my research. Within Chapter 6, the complex interrelationality of all
of the contributing factors that occur while taking a museum selfie is
demonstrated. The museum selfie is a contemporary phenomenon that
captures many issues investigated in this research. I conclude by creating
an exercise that can be used for teaching media literacy. This exercise can
be downloaded by going to the `Additional Resources' tab at https://doi.
org/10.11647/OBP.0253#resources. This should be considered a starting
point for further exploration into how this posthuman approach might
be implemented for the purpose of media literacy education.

                    Concluding Thoughts

At the convergence of the fourth industrial revolution (Schwab, 2017)
and the sixth mass extinction (Cafaro, 2015), we find our selves at a
crossroads. Being media literate is but one fundamental aspect of life
in a time of complex planetary existence. Being able to situate whatever
we study is critical in order to maintain perspective and not fall prey to
any one specific discipline or way of thinking. While I have attempted
to be broad in scope for understanding media, media literacy, and
communications, there are important ways of using media literacy that
I only examine in a cursory manner, since a more comprehensive study
is beyond the focus of a single book. Language is one such area. Signs
and their ability (and inability) to transfer information, specifically
looking into encoding and decoding, is a large area of research already
established within media and communications; however, it is beyond the
scope of this book. Ethics and normativity, both immensely important,
are also only lightly touched upon because, in my opinion, the first
important step before being able to ethically or morally judge is to have
awareness of the situation. This book describes an approach that can
help develop the awareness necessary that can then allow us to critically
judge.

    John Culkin (1967) concisely sums up the focus of this book with

lives, specifically ICTs. The paradigmatic example of ICTs that I will
often use throughout is the smartphone. These technologies permeate
our existence, especially in the Western world. `It takes less and less
deliberate action on our part to engage with media or ICTs. No longer
do we need to place ourselves behind a computer to go online; we carry
"the online" constantly in our pockets or on our wrists' (Van Den Eede et
al., 2017b: xvii). For many of the people in the Western world, everyday
life is completely entangled with media technologies, so much so that
these technologies are no longer in the forefront of our attention; they
have faded into the background.

    It is vital that media literacy steps in and plays a role in helping
us become aware of the everyday media technologies in our lives and
the influences they have upon our selves and society (cf. Kim, 2015;
McLuhan, 1994; Silverstone 1994; Strate, 2017). As Catherine Adams
and Terrie Lynn Thompson (2016) say, it is about understanding the
digital and `making its effects and affects visible' (2). In order to have a
more comprehensive understanding of media literacy, we need a more
complete understanding of how human subjects are constituted through
all of their relations. We need to develop a right view, an orientation
that allows us to better situate, and therefore more fully understand,
our technological relations in order for us to make better decisions, to
judge what and how to engage with the ubiquitous technologies in our
everyday lives. The posthuman approach I have developed accomplishes
this by situating the complex interrelating and constituting relations of
human subjects and media technologies.

    Literacy, meaning alphabetic literacy, is no longer the keynote of Western
    culture. That is to say that capital-L Literacy is obsolete, having been
    done in when we killed the reading public, the ground of literacy. As
    with the Hydra (once her head was lopped off, new heads sprang up
    in its place), so with Literacy: now we see dozens, nay entire litters of
    (small-`l') little literacies springing up spontaneously here and there
    with evident abandon. (McLuhan, 2009: 9)

It seems that everywhere we look in the modern Western world we see
information and communication technologies being used, mediating
our lives every day. We have become so accustomed to living with these
extraordinary technologies that they have been rendered ordinary.
New devices and technologies, after a brief though sometimes painful
learning curve, begin to disappear from the center of our attention
as we navigate the world through them. While media literacy focuses
on educating people in order for them to become more aware and
adept at consuming, using, and creating media content for specific
outcomes (Aufderheide, 1993), it primarily attends to the content of the
messages--both intended and unintended--especially concerning how
human subjects are represented (Jolls & Wilson, 2014).

    This chapter situates media literacy within the broader fields of
communications and education. I investigate current ways of defining
media literacy and call for an expansion of media literacy in order to
include the medium and the context within which the messages are
enacted. While more than a cursory overview of media literacy, this
chapter will not exhaustively explore the field in its entirety. Rather, I

28  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

give an overview of some of the current and historic aspects of media
literacy and point out important areas that it often does not include.
This provides a setting to bring in a framework and instrument of
transdisciplinary concepts that can be used to enhance the field.

    Focusing on the medium is a first step in broadening the scope of
media literacy to include a broader context. While media literacy has
focused mainly on media skills and representation (Jolls & Wilson, 2014;
Masterman, 1989), this has left the study of the effects of the medium
to outside fields such as medium theory (Meyrowitz, 1994; Qvortrup,
2006); mediatization (Adolf, 2011; Hjarvard, 2013, 2014; Lundby,
2014); media ecology (Anton, 2006, 2016; Logan, 2011; McLuhan, 1994;
Postman, 1974, 2000; Strate, 2017; Van Den Eede, 2012, 2016); and even
the study of the biography of things (Kopytoff, 1988; Lesage, 2013).

    The next step after including the medium is to further expand media
literacy to include the context within which we engage with media. I
use the example of domestication theory in order to do so. By including
the environment, the complexity of our media relations become more
apparent, making the case for expanding our approach to media
literacy to include, as Shaun Moores (2016) says, a non-media-centric
media literacy. My goal is to describe the current field of media literacy,
situating it at the intersection of communications and education. I make
the case that expanding the focus beyond content to include the effects
of the medium and context can help improve our understanding of the
broader effects of media--both the drawbacks and benefits.

   Communication Beyond the Transmission Model

Media literacy is a combination of media (mostly studied within the
field of communications) and literacy (mostly studied within the field of
education). Before delving into the literacy aspect, I explain some of the
background and different approaches in the field of communications.
For much of the second half of the twentieth century, the dominant way
of understanding communication was through the transmission model,
where `communication is a process of sending and receiving messages
or transferring information from one mind to another' (Craig, 1999:
125). Claude Shannon (1948) and Shannon and Warren Weaver (1964)
developed a mathematical model in order to understand communication,
             2. Situating Media Literacy             29

reducing a complex process down into a simple and easily graspable
model, which `is widely accepted as one of the main seeds out of which
Communication Studies has grown. It is a clear example of the process
school, seeing communication as the transmission of messages' (Fiske,
1990: 6). The transmission model is the basis of information theory and
has been a building block for a general understanding of the flow of
information and communication.

    The transmission model (see Fig. 2.1) consists of the producer of
the message (information source); the transmitter that encodes the
message; the conduit or channel through which the message is sent;
the receiver that decodes the message; and the destination where the
message arrives. In the process, there is also noise, which interferes
with the clarity of the message. A common example of this model is a
telephone call. The person initiating the call is the information source;
their phone encodes the message; the telephone line or wireless network
is the conduit; the person's phone receiving the call is the receiver that
decodes the message; and the destination is the person who hears the
message. The noise is any interference: static on the line or network,
noises in the background, etc.

While the transmission model is still frequently used in information and
computer sciences, it has drawn criticism from social sciences (Carey,
2008; Deetz, 1994; Pearce, 1989) as well as from media ecology for being
30  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

too reductive and for approaching communication as something that
occurs between autonomous--already fully established--entities rather
than between relational beings. Robert Craig (1999) states that there
has been much discussion around need and desire for the transmission
model being `supplemented, if not entirely supplanted, by a model that
conceptualizes communication as a constitutive process that produces
and reproduces shared meaning' (125). In other words, there is more
to communication theory than a one-way transmission of a message
from one source to another. There is shared meaning-making occurring.
Craig advocates for the creation of a meta-model (called the constitutive
model) that allows a space for many different models to exist, each
being useful for a particular purpose (127).

    James Carey (2008) also argues against the transmission model, saying
that it is important to retain the connection to community and culture.
He advocates for more of a ritual or cultural view of communication.
Stuart Adam (2008) describes Carey's approach as portraying a more
`developed understanding of communication [involving] both a ritual
and a transmission view' (xviii), both of which are needed for a modern
society to exist. Antonio López (2014: 47-48) builds upon Carey's view
(with somewhat more criticism) and cautions against the transmission
model:

    In terms of media literacy, using mechanistic models of cognition
    and communication will reinforce the paradigm of industrialism,
    remaining stuck in a system of `bad ideas'; the essential bad idea being
    the assumption that communication is a matter of autonomous beings
    transporting ideas between each other as messages, and that such
    communication is disembodied from the thinking system that comprises
    our cultural patterns and embeddedness within living systems.

López continues by describing an ecological intelligence where a person
is `not simply an autonomous self but is part of an interconnected thinking
system that not only includes socially constructed knowledge but
knowledge that is co-produced with the living environment' (48). This
moves from an approach where people construct their own knowledge
of the world to an approach that understands the co-constitution that
occurs during communication.

    Marshall McLuhan (as cited in Eric McLuhan, 2008) calls Shannon
and Weaver's communication model a theory of transportation,
2. Situating Media Literacy    31

not communication. He defines communication as something that
transforms or changes the recipient. Without this transformation, it is
not communication. Marshall McLuhan, as his son Eric McLuhan (2008:
30-31) summarizes, believes that:

    Communication means change. If something is communicated the
    recipient has changed in some manner or degree. Our `common sense'
    idea of communication is merely one of transporting messages from point
    to point. Shannon and Weaver laid the foundation of all Western `theories
    of communication' with their model. [...] But this only is a transportation
    theory, not a theory of communication. They are concerned merely with
    getting a bundle of goodies from one place to another, while keeping
    dreaded Noise to a minimum.

The constitutive model of communication, where the action
of communication changes the recipient, as well as the person
communicating, is how I conceive of communication in this book. The
act of communication is a relational act that co-constitutes (transforms)
the people involved in the communication. This co-constituting
relationality is an integral concept in the development of the posthuman
developed in this book.

                  Media Literacy Overview

The term `literacy' in media literacy reflects the underlying echo of
reading or print literacy. However, media literacy focuses on a person's
competence and knowledge of media. And, with the swift speed of
change in current media trends, it is becoming more and more difficult
to keep abreast of the many new developments. As Lev Manovich
(2013) points out, the world `is now defined not by heavy industrial
machines that change infrequently, but by software that is always in
flux' (1-2). The need for media literacy has never been so important.
I begin by discussing the importance of education and its impact on
agency, after which I offer several definitions of media literacy from
key organizations. Then, the core concepts and competencies of media
literacy are discussed, concluding with an overview of the approaches
currently found in media literacy.
32  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

                  Education, Literacy, and Agency

One of media literacy's core aspects is education (e.g., Alvermann et al.,
2018; Hobbs & Jensen, 2009; Kellner & Share, 2019; Livingstone & Van
der Graaf, 2008; Potter, 2018; and the journal Teaching Media Quarterly).
This focus on education pragmatically elevates the importance of the
user and helps to ground the theoretical concepts concerning media.
While literacy is not a neutral term and comes with its own contradictions
(Luke, 1989; Livingstone, 2004), it also stresses the focus on the user of
media, whether as one whom consumes, produces, or simply uses it. This
general educational aspect is, as John Dewey (1997) posits, critical for a
healthy democracy. McLuhan (1969) says, somewhat hyperbolically, `If
we understand the revolutionary transformations caused by new media,
we can anticipate and control them; but if we continue in our self-induced
subliminal trance, we will be their slaves' (n.p.).

    Media literacy's focus on education is key for developing awareness
and thus agency. Since this educational component is not as heavily
stressed in the other fields of inquiry that I analyze (specifically
postphenomenology and philosophical posthumanism), I draw
inspiration from media literacy in order to create an approach that is
pragmatic and useful as an instrument for education.

    The term literacy in education has its own socio-cultural baggage
and should not be thought of as a neutral term. Carmen Luke (1989)
points out that the basis of public schooling standardized `what and
how all children should be taught; it would provide all children with
basic literacy skills and simultaneously facilitate the mass transmission
of centrally selected and controlled knowledge' (5). Sonia Livingstone
(2004) summarizes Luke's (1989) points by saying, literacy `masks a
complex history of contestation over the power and authority to access,
interpret, and produce printed texts' (4). In other words, who gets to
define and judge the qualities and knowledges that equate with literacy?
And, as the primary medium of print gives way to a diversity of media,
Jay Lemke (2006) suggests, `We need a broader definition of literacy
itself, one that includes all literate practices, regardless of medium' (3).

    At the start of the chapter, I referred to a quote by Eric McLuhan
(2009) which points out that there are many variations of literacy.
Two variations that are close to (and can be considered part of) media
2. Situating Media Literacy    33

literacy are digital literacy (Buckingham, 2006; Gilster, 1997; Van Dijk
& Van Deursen, 2014), and social media literacy (Ahn, 2013; Burnett &
Merchant, 2011; Livingstone, 2014; Vanwynsberghe, 2014). Livingstone
(2004: 5) states,

    [P]eople now engage with a media environment which integrates
    print, audiovisual, telephony, and computer media. Hence, we need a
    conceptual framework that spans these media. Literacy seems to do the
    work required here: It is pan-media in that it covers the interpretation
    of all complex, mediated symbolic texts broadcast or published on
    electronic communications networks; at the same time.

Some of the most recent literacies are artificial intelligence literacy (or
related literacies such as those concerning machine learning or neural
networks) and algorithmic literacy. Petar Jandri (2019) makes the case
for expanding critical media literacy to encompass artificial intelligence
(AI) and the postdigital context. Jussi Okkonen and Sirkku Kotilainen
(2019) describe the potential effects that AI has on youth (and their
parents) and the implications this has for media literacy. Jialei Jiang
and Matthew Vetter (2020) make the case for becoming more literate
concerning the effects of algorithms, specifically analyzing algorithmic
writing bots on Wikipedia. These postdigital challenges point to future
directions that are emerging in media literacy.

    Education can increase a person's awareness, which in turn facilitates
the ability for them to regain agency. An entire issue of the Journal of
Media Literacy (Andersen & Arcus, 2017) is devoted to the concept
of agency in media literacy. In it, Neil Andersen and Carol Arcus
write, `Agency is knowledge in action. In media literacy, agency is the
exercising of awareness through critical thinking skills to effect change
personally, locally and/or globally' (3). While agency of technology is
discussed in more depth in Chapter 3, it is important in media literacy
to understand that there is a shared agency as we interact with media,
and by increasing our awareness (through education) we can increase
our own agency. Tsjalling Swierstra and Katinka Waelbers (2012) say,
`Technologies affect our actions not just by altering the course of action
(like billiard balls act upon each other) but by mediating our reasons or
motives to act in a particular way' (160).

    In support of media users having agency, Douglas Kellner and
Jeff Share (2007) focus on audience theory to point out `the moment
34  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

of reception [is] a contested terrain of cultural struggle where
critical thinking skills offer potential for the audience to negotiate
different readings and openly struggle with dominant discourses'
(13). Additionally, McLuhan scholar Robert Logan (2013) explains
McLuhan's aphorism--the user is the content--means that `each reader
or viewer brings his or her own experience and understanding to a
medium and transforms the content according to his or her own need
and abilities' (76). Logan further explains, `information does not have
an intrinsic meaning independent of the user' (77). Media literacy plays
a key role in helping educate people with regards to their media-rich
lives, facilitating their awareness and thus increasing their own agency.

                       Defining Media Literacy

Bringing media and literacy together has created its own field of study.
However, moving from the single-medium of print to the plurality of
media-types and technologies makes it difficult to reduce media literacy
to a single description. As Tibor Koltay (2011) states, `media literacy is
an umbrella concept. It is characterized by a diversity of perspectives
and a multitude of definitions' (212).

    It is Len Masterman's (1989, 2010) focus on representation that helps
media literacy emerge from media studies. Masterman, from the United
Kingdom, and Barry Duncan (2010), from Canada are often considered
the founders of media literacy (Jolls & Wilson, 2014). According to
Masterman (1989), `The central unifying concept of Media Education
is that of representation. The media mediate. They do not reflect but
re-present the world. The media [...] are symbolic sign systems that must
be decoded' (see Principle 2). This approach emphasizes the encoding
and decoding of media representations and reflects the content-focused
and transportation approach that has been dominant in media literacy.

    As the U.S.-based National Association for Media Literacy
(NAMLE) states, `Media literacy is the ability to encode and decode the
symbols transmitted via media and the ability to synthesize, analyze
and produce mediated messages' (NAMLE, 2019). This definition is
rooted in how the transmission concept of communication re-presents
the sociocultural world. Masterman (2010: 5) differentiates content
from representation:
2. Situating Media Literacy    35

    What we were actually studying was television and not its different
    subject contents. That is, we were not actually studying sport or music
    or news or documentary. We were studying representations of these
    things. We were studying the ways in which these subjects were being
    represented and symbolized and packaged by the medium.

While Masterman (1989) is making the case against a simple content-
centered approach, the conceptual framework he advocates for is still
directed at reading and analyzing (decoding) media content and does
not, for example, include the influence of the specific technological
medium.

    Another definition that comes from the Center for Media Literacy
(CML) (2019) in the U.S., builds upon Masterman's (1980, 1989)
concepts and contributes a more extended definition of media literacy,
stating that it provides,

    [A] framework to access, analyze, evaluate, create and participate with
    messages in a variety of forms--from print to video to the Internet. Media
    literacy builds an understanding of the role of media in society as well as
    essential skills of inquiry and self-expression necessary for citizens of a
    democracy. (2nd expanded definition)

This definition covers many of the standard concepts and approaches
(cf. below) used by many organizations involved with media literacy--
from government agencies to educational organizations. Arguably,
more important than defining media literacy is how organizations have
put into practice the development and implementation of competencies,
core concepts, and questions.

             Competencies, Concepts, and Questions

Several people and organizations have created lists of competencies
in order to better articulate how a person might judge their own
media literacy. This moves media literacy from being defined to being
implemented, focusing on the abilities of a media literate person. Renee
Hobbs1 (2010: 19) describes five essential competencies of digital and
media literacy as:

  1Founder and director of the Media Education Lab: https://mediaeducationlab.
        com/
36  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    1. Access: Finding and using media and technology tools
        skillfully and sharing appropriate and relevant information
        with others.

    2. Analyze & Evaluate: Comprehending messages and using
        critical thinking to analyze message quality, veracity,
        credibility, and point of view, while considering potential
        effects or consequences of messages.

    3. Create: Composing or generating content using creativity and
        confidence in self-expression, with awareness of purpose,
        audience, and composition techniques

    4. Reflect: Applying social responsibility and ethical principles
        to one's own identity and lived experience, communication
        behavior and conduct.

    5. Act: Working individually and collaboratively to share
        knowledge and solve problems in the family, the workplace
        and the community, and participating as a member of a
        community at local, regional, national and international levels.

Similarly, Ben Bachmair and Cary Bazalgette (2007: 84) describe the
claim from the European Charter for Media Literacy that a media literate
person should be able to:

    · Use media technologies effectively to access, store, retrieve
        and share content to meet their individual and community
        needs and interests;

    · Gain access to, and make informed choices about, a wide
        range of media forms and content from different cultural and
        institutional sources;

    · Understand how and why media content is produced;

    · Analyze critically the techniques, languages and conventions
        used by the media, and the messages they convey;

    · Use media creatively to express and communicate ideas,
        information and opinions;

    · Identify, and avoid or challenge, media content and services
        that may be unsolicited, offensive or harmful;
2. Situating Media Literacy    37

    · Make effective use of media in the exercise of their democratic
        rights and civic responsibilities.

These core competencies are additionally reflected in the CML's
handout (see Fig. 2.2), which is an effective example of bringing the
concepts for media literacy into one useful document. In addition to the
five core concepts, CML also has created questions for students to ask
themselves since the core concepts can be somewhat theoretical. The
questions can help guide students in their investigations into specific
media. The document also helpfully differentiates between consumers
and producers of media.

    The development of media literacy questions has also been
implemented by organizations such as the Association of Media Literacy
(AML) in Canada and NAMLE (namle.net) in the U.S. In addition to
the development of various definitions, competencies, and concepts--
all of which help to pragmatically implement media literacy skills--
there have also been different approaches to media literacy identified.
These approaches are a helpful way of narrowing the `umbrella concept'
(Koltay, 2011) of media literacy.

                           Four Approaches

Kellner and Share (2005, 2007) identify four differing approaches to
media literacy. These different models focus on developing skills for
the media literate person. They articulate the four approaches as: media
arts-based, a media literacy movement, protectionist, and critical media
literacy.

                              Media Arts-Based

In a media arts-based approach to media literacy, the focus is on
developing the ability and skills to use new forms of media, often for
creative self-expression. The primary focus is on the individual's ability
to learn the skills in order to help find and creatively express their own
voice through the media (Kellner & Share, 2007). While this contributes
towards the literacy and empowerment of the individual, the approach
tends to view the media in an instrumental or neutral manner--as a tool

to learn in order to accomplish something. These programs can range in
their level of emphasis on criticism, the danger being that if they only
teach self-expression without also including a critical component, the
students might be prone to `reproduce hegemonic representations or
express their voice without the awareness of ideological implications or
any type of social critique' (7). Teaching the skills of working with the
media technologies is very important, but it is important to teach the
concept that the mediums worked with are not neutral, as well as the
importance of critical analysis.

                         Media Literacy Movement

For the second approach, Kellner and Share (2005) situate a media
literacy movement within broader literacies, building upon the tradition
of print literacy. They primarily focus on the relatively young media
literacy movement in the U.S. Here, the approach is to `teach students
to read, analyze, and decode media texts in a fashion parallel to the
advancement of print literacy' (372). In the current landscape of fake
news (cf. Jolls & Johnsen, 2017; Livingstone, 2018), the ability to decode
and analyze what is being portrayed in the media is an important skill,
critical for educating the population. As Livingstone (2018: para. 5,
italics in original) warns,

    The more that the media mediate everything in society--work, education,
    information, civic participation, social relationships and more--the more
    vital it is that people are informed about and critically able to judge
    what's useful or misleading, how they are regulated, when media can be
    trusted, and what commercial or political interests are at stake. In short,
    media literacy is needed not only to engage with the media but to engage
    with society through the media.

Media literacy can often become an umbrella term for more specific
literacies such as: digital literacy, internet literacy, computer literacy,
and even potentially AI literacy. While Kellner and Share (2007)
commend the media literacy movement, they believe that too often
media educators `express the myth that education can and should be
politically neutral, and that their job is to objectively expose students to
media content without questioning ideology and issues of power' (8).
Literacy has its own socio-cultural baggage and should not be thought
40  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

of as a neutral term. Citing Luke (1989), Livingstone (2004) states that
literacy `masks a complex history of contestation over the power and
authority to access, interpret, and produce printed texts' (4). These last
points are addressed by the fourth approach (cf. below).

                                Protectionist

A third approach in media literacy is the protectionist approach. This
investigates the ways media can be harmful--especially for young
people--with repercussions like reducing attention spans, inciting
violence, or promoting capitalist propaganda, particularly in advertising
(Francis, 2016; Giroux, 2002; Kellner & Share, 2007). Friedrich Kittler
(1999) begins one of his books by stating, `Media determine our situation'
(xxxix). This determinist view is often foundational for the protectionists,
who posit that certain media technologies are inherently harmful or
destructive to human flourishing. Neil Postman (2006) and Lance Strate
(2014) detail the drawbacks of electronic media like television, especially
compared with print media. Kellner and Share (2007) point out that
`Some conservatives blame the media for causing teen pregnancies and
the destruction of family values while some on the left criticize the media
for rampant consumerism and making children materialistic' (6).

    Some researchers within this approach also address the ways
newer digital media are inferior for supporting a well-read society in
comparison to traditional print media (Postman, 2006; Strate, 2014).
This focus raises the issue of the effects of a particular medium on
society. For example, Sherry Turkle (2011) warns that new information
and communication technologies are driving us apart while giving
us the semblance of being together through virtual communication.
Kellner and Share (2007) describe this as a fear of media with an aim to
`protect or inoculate people against the dangers of media manipulation
and addiction. This protectionist approach posits media audiences as
somewhat passive victims and values traditional print culture over
media culture' (6).

    Stuart Hall (1980) challenges the view of audiences being passive
victims through his work in encoding/decoding of media messages.
Hall articulates that audiences are more than passive receivers of media
texts and they have the ability to read the messages produced outside
2. Situating Media Literacy    41

of a dominant-hegemonic position--preferred by the producers--in
negotiated or even oppositional ways (1980). This raises the question
of the role of agency. Though there is a wide variety of focus within
the protectionist approach, it tends toward technological determinism,
which is the opposite of the skills-based (instrumentalist) approach. The
protectionist approach is inclined to consider media and technology as
something harmful to humans. In general, the first two approaches tend
to consider the technological medium as neutral, not focusing on any
influence that the medium may have. For the protectionist approach,
the content and medium become more determining, potentially
endangering the user and suppressing much of the user's agency.

                           Critical Media Literacy

The fourth approach is called critical media literacy and builds on the
previous three approaches. It then adds the analysis of `media culture
as products of social production and struggle [...] teaching students to
be critical of media representations and discourses, but also stressing
the importance of learning to use the media as modes of self-expression
and social activism' (Kellner & Share, 2005: 372). According to Kellner
and Share (2007: 8-9),

    Critical media literacy thus constitutes a critique of mainstream
    approaches to literacy and a political project for democratic social change.
    This involves a multiperspectival critical inquiry of media culture and the
    cultural industries that address issues of class, race, gender, sexuality, and
    power and also promotes the production of alternative counter-hegemonic
    media. Media and information communication technology can be tools
    for empowerment when people who are most often marginalized or
    misrepresented in the mainstream media receive the opportunity to use
    these tools to tell their stories and express their concerns.

Critical media literacy strives to understand the underlying cultural
influences and meanings that are embedded within media messages and
how they often negatively affect already marginalized people. Kellner
and Share (2007) state `The analysis of different models of representation
of women or people of color makes clear the constructedness of gender
and race representations and that dominant negative representations
further subordination and make it look natural' (13). They summarize
42  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

by saying, `critical media literacy offers the tools and framework to help
students become subjects in the process of deconstructing injustices,
expressing their own voices, and struggling to create a better society'
(2005: 382). This reflects how media literacy can be used to regain user
agency while navigating a mediated world. Lemke (2006) states, `More
than ever we need a critical multimedia literacy to engage intelligently
with their potential effects on our social attitudes and beliefs' (4).

    Supporting critical media literacy, John Hartley (2002) states,
`Literacy is not and never has been a personal attribute or ideologically
inert "skill" simply to be "acquired" by individual persons' (135).
Hartley continues by saying, `It is ideologically and politically charged--
it can be used as a means of social control or regulation, but also as a
progressive weapon in the struggle for emancipation' (136). This reflects
the non-neutrality of media and emphasizes the importance of learning
how media affects our lives. While these four approaches cover much of
the current state of media literacy, I believe that there is still more that
should be covered by the field.

                 Expanding Media Literacy

With the ubiquity of ICTs and the speed with which they evolve and
change, it is critical for media literacy to help us learn how to quickly
situate and guide our own investigation into understanding the media
we not only invite into our lives, but the inescapable media that
surrounds us daily as well. Joshua Meyrowitz (1994: 50, italics added)
provides an apt summary of media literacy:

    Most of the questions that engage media researchers and popular
    observers of the media focus only on one dimension of our media
    environment: the content of media messages. Typical concerns centre
    on how people (often children) react to what they are exposed to
    through various media; how institutional, economic, and political factors
    influence what is and is not conveyed through media; whether media
    messages accurately reflect various dimensions of reality; how different
    audiences interpret the same content differently; and so on. These are
    all very significant concerns, but content issues do not exhaust the universe of
    questions that could, and should, be asked about the media.
2. Situating Media Literacy    43

While carving out an important niche for itself, media literacy has
become an established area of study with its own supporting literature.
However, in the process it has lost some of its original interdisciplinarity
(cf. Moores, 2012; Morley, 2009), focusing mainly on issues of
representation, skill development, analysis, and social construction
through media content. As Tessa Jolls and Carolyn Wilson (2014) point
out, `the pioneering work of communications expert Marshall McLuhan
[...] created a foundation upon which many of our current ideas about
media literacy are built' (69). That said, McLuhan's focus on the effects
of the medium has largely dropped off the radar for most iterations of
media literacy.2

    While media literacy brings several pedagogical tools that help people
better understand not only how to use media effectively but also how to
understand it critically (cf. Van Dijck & Van Deursen, 2014), there are
those who believe it should not be too narrowly focused. Moores (2012)
says, `I have a longstanding interest in studying everyday media uses
[...], yet I firmly believe that these uses are best investigated in context,
alongside other everyday practices and within wider social processes'
(11). While critical media literacy is one of the steps in expanding media
literacy in order to include critically analyzing the social context of
biased representations, there is room to expand it further.

    I use a two-step approach that focuses on the context. The first
step is to include a focus on the technological medium being used.
The second is similar to the call of Moores (2016) and Morley (2007;
see also Krajina et al., 2014) for a non-media-centric media literacy
that goes beyond a focus on representation and skills. Morley suggest
de-centering media from media studies so we can `understand better
the ways in which media processes and everyday life are interwoven
with each other' (200). Investigating the aspect of the medium itself
is a first step that moves beyond a focus on media representation and
skills. Following this, I create an approach using fields outside of media
literacy in order to bring together concepts that help situate media
literacy in a broader context, which I call a posthuman approach, and
can be considered a fifth approach to media literacy.

      on the medium.
44  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

            The Medium as Non-neutral Environment

The first step in enhancing media literacy is to extend beyond the
primary concern with media content to begin exploring how the content
is entangled with the specific medium itself. Currently, when a medium
is discussed, the discussion generally focuses on ways to categorize the
content mediated by that particular medium. For instance, in Figure 2.2
the second concept is format. The core concept states, `Media messages
are constructed using a creative language with its own rules', the emphasis
being on language rather than the medium itself. This reflects media
literacy's primary focus on representation and its lack of attention on
the medium. Not only is it beneficial to focus on the content and social
context of media messages (i.e., critical media literacy), but we should
also pay attention to the effects of the actual technology itself.

    Marshall McLuhan's focus on the medium can be credited for
drawing a focus to and interest in media education. Jolls and Wilson
(2014: 69) write,

    In Canada, the pioneering work of communications expert Marshall
    McLuhan in the 1940s through the 1960s created a foundation upon
    which many of our current ideas about media literacy are built. McLuhan
    was aware of the profound impact of communications technologies on
    our lives, our societies and our future. His famous idea, that the `medium
    is the message' taught us to recognize that the form through which a
    message is conveyed is as important as the content of the message. [...]
    McLuhan's theory was based on the idea that each medium has its own
    technological `grammar' or bias that shapes and creates a message in
    a unique way. Different media may report the same event, but each
    medium will create different impressions and convey different messages.

One of the few media literacy organizations that does include a focus
on the medium is Canada's AML. Their Eight Key Concepts of media
literacy3 includes three where the medium is pointed out (bold was
added):

    1. Media construct reality

    2. Media construct versions of reality (biases of medium and
        creator)

  3Canada's Association of Media Literacy (https://aml.ca/resources/essential-
        framework/)
2. Situating Media Literacy    45

    3. Audiences negotiate meaning

    4. Media have economic implications

    5. Media communicate values messages

    6. Media communicate political and social messages

    7. Form and content are closely related in each medium

    8. Each medium has a unique aesthetic form

However, the aspect of the medium is not mentioned in their Triangled
Questions document,4 which they describe as a tool for teaching media
literacy. This misses an opportunity to include a focus on the medium,
which--at least implicitly--tends to view the objects of ICTs in an
instrumental manner, as neutral carriers (Mason, 2016).

    The issue of neutrality brings up how media has been judged in the
past. Often, there is a binary approach, where media is perceived as
either neutral (it has no effect) or determining (it has great effect). This
way of perceiving media can be used to analyze both the content of
the media or the medium itself. The protectionist approach and critical
media literacy approach (cf. above) are generally concerned with the
determining aspects of the media, while the media arts-based education
and media literacy movement are more neutral.

    One way to move beyond the binary approach of either neutral
or determining is through the idea of non-neutrality. This stance
acknowledges media's effect on human subjects (and can be applied to
both content and medium), but refrains from an absolute determining
stance. According to Melvin Kranzberg (1986), `Technology is neither
good nor bad; nor is it neutral' (545). However, the non-neutrality
acknowledged by Kellner and Share (2007) focuses on the content rather
than the material technology: `Media are thus not neutral disseminators
of information because the nature of the construction and interpretation
processes entails bias and social influence' (12).

    One of the gaps in media literacy that I am addressing is the non-
neutrality of the material technology: the medium. Two media-related
fields of study that I include in order to demonstrate this are media
ecology and the philosophical approach of postphenomenology.

  4h ttps://aml.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/triangleq.pdf
46  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

Researchers in these fields are not the only advocates supporting a
non-neutral view of technology (cf. Feenberg, 1999, 2017; Latour, 1999;
Puech, 2016; Williams, 2004), but they provide two approaches that
help to create an inclusive understanding of the non-neutrality of media
technologies. My stance is that a balanced approach, combining content
analysis and technological mediation, can help media literacy be more
effective.

    One way to help keep this balanced approach in mind is through the
analogy McLuhan often used, that of figure and ground (McLuhan et al.,
1977). `Simply stated, figure is what one notices within an environment,
whereas ground consists of the things one ignores' (Mason, 2019: 4). In
the case of Masterman's (1980) work on television, it is the content or
message that is the figure. However, the medium of the television is the
ground for the content. The medium plays an important role in shaping
the content, and it should be one of the foci of media literacy, along with
the content. McLuhan (McLuhan et al., 1977) uses the figure/ground
analogy in order to help us retrain our perception so that we become
aware of the effects that the `ground' has on us.

    At one point McLuhan (McLuhan et al., 1977) explains that, `[...]
in your own experience, you are always the figure, as long as you are
conscious. The ground is always the setting in which you exist and act.
The ground is never static; it is always changing. The interplay between
you and this changing ground changes you' (10). Being conscious
and aware of media's effects are in accord with the goals of media
literacy. Lance Mason (2016) states, `because McLuhan more fully
conceptualizes the non-neutrality of technologies, he provides a broader
conceptualization of user agency that transcends media messages and
also considers media as form or environments for engagement' (93).
Mason continues (2016: 93-94):

    While critical media literacy advocates are right to insist that audiences
    are active appropriators of media content, ignoring the structuring role
    of media technologies leads them to ignore or discount the insight that
    the medium influences the environmental conditions within which a
    user transacts with the world. [...] From this perspective, McLuhan's
    conception of media agency could bolster the conception of critical
    media literacy by affording a consideration of the material environments
    that mediate experiences for students in particular contexts.
2. Situating Media Literacy    47

The technological medium contributes to the shaping of media
messages and deserves to be included in a broader approach to media
literacy. Lars Qvortrup (2006) states that successful communication is
not a `natural' but a highly improbable phenomenon, and `the effect of
communication [medium] is to limit the improbability of communication
success, and the qualities of media can be measured by their impact on
communication success' (351). McLuhan (1994) described the medium
as an environment, and this environment makes up part of the context
that contains media messages.

            Adding Context via Domestication Theory

While domestication theory5 is outside the realm of media literacy--as it
has a sociological and ethnographic focus rather than one on educating
people to become media literate--it demonstrates how media studies in
general can broaden its scope to include both object and context. This
highlights the importance of understanding the context of where the
media object exists, how it is used, and how it changes the behaviors of
people who adapt to it. This example reflects what I wish to bring to media
literacy through the development of an inclusive approach that situates
ICTs in our everyday world in order for media users to understand the
complexity of interrelations of content, technological medium, and
context.

    Domestication theory examines media as it is used within
its environment. Silverstone (2006) created this theory--further
developing it with David Morley (Morley & Silverstone, 1990), Leslie
Haddon (2007), and others--through investigating how television was
assimilated into homes in the U.K. The process focuses on the context,
or environment, where the media is used and how that environment
plays a role in understanding media. Edgar Morin (2007) describes,
`The need for contextualization is extremely important. I would even
say that it is a principle of knowledge' (15; see also Engel, 1999). Yoni
Van Den Eede (2015b) also makes the case for context saying, `No thing
is ever perceived in isolation. One may focus on it, but it is always there

  5For clarity, I will only use the term domestication theory. However, there has
        also been research in describing double (cf. Livingstone, 2007) and triple (cf.
        Courtois et al., 2012, 2013; Hartmann, 2006) articulation that is usually included in
        domestication theory discussions.
48  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

in relation to a ground or field. We can, however, try to get that broader
context in view' (145).

    Maren Hartmann (2006) describes how domestication theory began
by analyzing the consumption of media, specifically television, and
critiqued existing television research that was not `accounting for the
complexity of culture and the social' (83). Hartmann continues (2006:
84) by describing how, in domestication theory,

    both the material and the symbolic values present in media use are
    researched. The most general framework was thus the contextualized
    processes of the integration of technologies into everyday life. This
    context is both complex and contingent--and this context was also still
    meant to include content.

Morley and Silverstone (1990) write, `our main objective is to
recontextualize the study of television in a broader framework' (31), with
an approach that `defines television as an essentially domestic medium,
to be understood both within the context of household and family, and
within the wider context of social, political and economic realities' (32).
They conclude by stating, `within this formulation television's meanings,
that is the meanings of both texts and technologies, have to be understood
as emergent properties of contextualized audience practices' (31, italics
in original).

    Domestication stresses the attention on the everyday aspect of
media and how it becomes integrated into our daily routines. Merete
Lie and Knut Sørensen (1996) broaden the scope of domestication by
investigating media outside of the home. They find that everywhere we
go, we `consume technologies--or, more precisely, technical artefacts--
by integrating and using them. We are also consumed by the artefacts
when they gain our attention and have us react to them and become
occupied by their abilities, functions, and forms' (8).

    How domestication theory engages with complexity is also an
important concept, one that is expanded upon in Chapter 4. Thomas
Berker et al. (2006: 1) describe what happens when we study media
relations in context:

    The emergence of the domestication concept represented a shift away
    from models which assumed the adoption of new innovations to be
    rational, linear, monocausal and technologically determined. Rather,
    it presented a theoretical framework and research approach, which
2. Situating Media Literacy    49

    considered the complexity of everyday life and technology's place within
    its dynamics, rituals, rules, routines and patterns.

This complexity has created problems for domestication theory. While
it has been well developed as a theory, Hartmann (2006) notes that
it `was then lost in the "application" of the domestication concept in
actual research' (81). According to Hartmann, the `question that keeps
reappearing and that has not yet been solved is how to adequately
research the complexity of the combination of media content and media
context to paint a picture of the overall whole' (89). What is needed is a
way to situate and contextualize the complexity of our media-saturated,
everyday lives.

                    Concluding Thoughts

Today, much of media literacy focuses on fake news and the challenge
this trend presents to democracy (cf. Jolls & Johnsen, 2017; Livingstone,
2018). People are mediated by technologies of all sorts,6 one of the most
prevalent being the smartphone. The news is not only mediated; it is
re-mediated into smaller and smaller bits, which are typically cut and
re-cut, decontextualized and then re-contextualized with different
meanings (cf. Chouliaraki, 2013, 2017). The many different mediums
disseminate these bits in their own unique way. Ubiquitous ICTs have
transformed the way most people live, especially in the developed
Western world. However, people are not only mediated by ICTs in
general, but also by cultural relations through power structures, social
norms, language, gender, race, and many other groupings of relations.
This is where critical media literacy comes into play and where there is
much overlap with critical posthumanism (cf. Chapter 4).

    I am not the only researcher calling for expanding the field of media
literacy. There has been a push from within the field for broadening its
scope, returning to a more interdisciplinary approach. Morley (2009)
writes of the need to `develop a model for the integrated analysis of
communications, which places current technological changes in

  6Livingstone (2009) writes on the mediation of everything, stating, `distinct aspects
        of the concept of mediation invite communication scholars to attend to the specific
        empirical, historical and political implication of the claim that "everything is
        mediated"' (1).
50  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

historical perspective' (114). To do so means avoiding the simplified
and `overdrawn binary divides between the worlds of the "old" and
the "new" media' (115). It is critical for media literacy to develop a
framework in order to keep an overarching perspective on the constant
onslaught of new ICTs. In the words of Eric McLuhan (2009: 12),

    When change is relatively slow, the need for training awareness is not so
    pressing. But when major new media appear every three or four years,
    the need becomes a matter of survival. Each new medium is a new
    culture and each demands a new spin on identity; each takes root in one
    or another group in society, and as these flow in and out of each other the
    abrasive interfaces generate much violence. It is urgent that we begin to
    study all of the forms of knowing, now called literacies.

My approach follows several amodern--not modern but not
postmodern--philosophies (postphenomenology, philosophical
posthumanism, complexity theory, etc.). I balance the binaries of
technological determinism and technological neutrality. One of the
most effective ways to reduce technological determinism--following
Michel Foucault (1988), Michel Puech (2016), and others--is to become
aware of the systems that have influence on us, and this is where media
literacy can excel. John Culkin (1967: 51) stresses the importance of
being media literate:

    The environments set up by different media are not just containers
    for people; they are processes which shape people. Such influence is
    deterministic only if it is ignored. There is no inevitability as long as there
    is a willingness to contemplate what is happening.

As critical media literacy helps to fill the critical social theory gap within
media literacy, my aim is to create an approach that can be used by
media literacy in order to situate the wider range of effects of media
that a mediate literate person should be aware of: content, medium,
and context. As Lemke (2006) states, `We need conceptual frameworks
to help us cope with the complexity and the novelty of these new
multimedia constellations' (5).

    The first step towards an expansion of media literacy is developing an
understanding of the co-constituting effects of technological relations,
especially embodied relations, which I investigate in the next chapter.
Both media ecology and postphenomenology help us keep in mind the
2. Situating Media Literacy    51

way media and technologies enable and constrain our abilities, allowing
us to have more realistic expectations for complex media environments.
This aspect of co-constitution is the focus of the next two chapters. First,
I look at the medium/technology side (Chapter 3) and then focus on
which subject we are discussing that is being constituted by media
relations (Chapter 4). This is not the subject of the transmission model of
communication, but the subject of the constitutive model (Craig, 1999)
and the transformation model (McLuhan, 2008). We are not standalone
entities simply transporting discreet messages back and forth through
various media; rather, we are being constituted within a complexity of
mediated relations.

  3. Understanding the Medium
    Through the Technological
              Relation

Human subjects are inundated with new mediums of technology, both
of the hardware variety (smartphones, smartwatches, digital home
assistants) and software infrastructures (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
Snapchat). What elements go into our decisions to invite any of the
plethora of choices we have into our lives? How can we go beyond the
promised benefits of the technologies and become more aware of the
possible downsides--the constraints--that these technologies always
bring with them?

    In order to begin developing a more inclusive and situating approach
for media literacy, the first step is to better understand the effects that
the technological medium plays in the constitution of not only media
messages but also the constitution of the human subject. To be clear,
my intent is to complement media literacy, not to replace what media
literacy already does so well (cf. the four approaches in the previous
chapter). Media literacy should continue with its varied approaches
towards media messages and skills-based media literacy. However,
attending to the effects of the medium can help make media literacy a
more robust and effective field of inquiry.

    In this chapter I explore the effects of the technological medium
through two aspects. The first uses postphenomenology to better

54  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

understand technological mediation--how our specific relations with
technologies transform not only the media messages, but our own
selves. The second uses media ecology to understand the technological
medium as an environment of complex relations. The first aspect is a
micro approach and the second a macro approach. Concepts from each
of the two fields are brought together to help create a way to understand
the posthuman subject that is developed later in Chapter 4. This chapter
is not meant to be an extensive review of either postphenomenology or
media ecology, as there are many excellent resources that do this already.1
Rather, I extract concepts from them to begin a holistic investigation of
the technological medium, which is not sufficiently developed in media
literacy.

                        In Medias Res2

To better understand the human subject that is transformed by media
relations, it is beneficial to begin by explaining the relations with
technologies that contribute to the subject's constitution. I therefore
begin in the middle, in medias res. This is apropos when discussing
the in-between of mediation--how media technologies constitute our
selves by being in between the world and us. However, in order to
refrain from falling into a Cartesian subject/object duality, the relation
is not something that comes in between two already established entities
(cf. Lemmens, 2017; Smith, 2015; Van Den Eede, 2012; Verbeek, 2005),
but rather the relation and entities are constituted through the act of
relating. The subject is not the standalone humanist subject from the
Enlightenment and modernity but a posthuman subject (cf. Chapter
4) that experiences ongoing constitution through its ever-changing
relations. It is this constituting relationality that is the foundational
building block for the approach I develop. These relations mediate and
co-constitute the world and our selves, and as Sonia Livingstone (2009)
posited, `everything is mediated' (4).

1A good starting point for media ecology is: Anton, 2016; McLuhan, 1994; Postman
      1974, 2006; Strate 2014, 2017. And, for postphenomenology, see: Ihde, 1990, 2002,
      2009, 2012; Rosenberger & Verbeek, 2015; Verbeek, 2005.

3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  55

                   Micro and Macro Approaches

The focus of this chapter is on understanding the mediums3 of media
technologies. While not all mediums of media communications are
technological,4 the focus of my research is directed toward the ones
that are, especially the digitally networked variety that are currently
so prevalent. In order to understand these technological mediums, it is
helpful to have a firm grasp of the concept of perception. According to
Maurice Merleau-Ponty (2002: 373),

    The thing is inseparable from a person perceiving it, and can never be
    actually in itself because its articulations are those of our very existence,
    and because it stands at the other end of our gaze or at the terminus of a
    sensory exploration which invests it with humanity.

Perception is never passive; rather, it is active and constructive. It is
an embodied process, as Merleau-Ponty (2002) describes: `a theory
of the body is already a theory of perception' (235). It is not the body
alone, but the entanglement of our bodily sense with our sociocultural
situatedness, what Don Ihde (1990, 2002) calls macroperception. Ihde
(1990) devotes the second half of his seminal work, Technology and the
Lifeworld, to this concept of macroperception, which he also refers to
as cultural hermeneutics. He further develops the concept of cultural
hermeneutics in Bodies in Technology (2002) through the concept of
`body two'. This idea is similar to Michel Foucault's (1995) concept of

3While the plural of medium is media, I am using media to refer mainly to the
      content-focused media studies definition of media. When I want to indicate the
      specific media technology that is the `channel' (in the traditional language of
      communication) I will attempt to use the singular medium. However, this tends to
      become a bit challenging when trying to discuss the many types of mediums, so I
      will use the plural mediums.

4John Peters (2015) wrote an excellent book on Elemental Media that is directed
      at some of the non-technical mediums--water and air primarily--and how they
      also influence how humans and non-humans communicate. For instance, air is
      the medium for oral communication (see Innis, 2008; Ong, 2012). Its properties
      greatly contribute to how far our voices travel, limiting how far apart we can
      communicate without technologies to extend our range. At the same time, air
      allows us to see quite far. Peters makes the case that more of our brains are
      consumed with visual rather than auditory perception because of this. Water, on
      the other hand, allows sound to travel quite far and sight to be more limited. This
      has likely been a factor in the development of whale and dolphin brains to devote
      more area to auditory rather than to visual perception (Peters, 2015: ch. 2).
56  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

a culturally constructed body, as opposed to `body one', which is `the
located, perceiving active body' (Ihde, 2002: xviii). Ihde continues by
saying, `Traversing both body one and body two is a third dimension,
the dimension of the technological' (xi). Researchers within the field
of postphenomenology investigate how technologies mediate and
constitute bodies one and two.

    Body two--or the macroperceptual--is used to understand how
cultural relations influence our technological relations. For instance,
different cultures have different approaches towards time. The clock in
China was invented (circa 1077), `not for telling hours but for setting
the astrological calendar for an Imperial need' (Ihde, 1990: 130). Ihde
explains (1990: 29),

    There is no microperception (sensory-bodily) without its location
    within a field of macroperception and no macroperception without its
    microperceptual foci. The relation between micro- and macroperception
    is not one of derivation; rather, it is more like that of figure-to-ground
    in that microperception occurs within its hermeneutic-cultural context;
    but all such contexts find their fulfillment only within the range of
    microperceptual possibility.

While postphenomenology does discuss macroperception, it most often
stays grounded in an embedded and embodied perspective, analyzing
the enabling and constraining aspects of mediating technologies. Unlike
media ecology, postphenomenology generally stays clear of making
sweeping statements concerning the effects and biases of technologies.
For the most part, researchers in the field avoid criticizing technologies,
which has caused some to criticize or challenge postphenomenology to
be more critical (cf. Borgmann, 2015; Feenberg, 1999; Lemmens, 2017;
Michelfelder, 2015; Scharff, 2006; Smith, 2015). Technologies are viewed
as being multistable, meaning they are never just one thing; they are always
able to be used in multiple ways, which is why postphenomenology
usually keeps to describing technological relations instead of judging
them.

    Media ecology, on the other hand, most often looks with a macro
lens at the broad influences that the mediums of media have on
individuals and cultures. Lynn Clark (2009) describes how `the role
of media in social change is a primary concern in media ecology'
(12). Media ecologists tend not to shy away from making sweeping
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  57

statements concerning the effects and biases of a medium's influence on
individuals and cultures. This does not mean that researchers in media
ecology do not pay attention to the micro level, especially when they
focus on media education. Marshall McLuhan et al. (1977) demonstrate
this micro approach in City as Classroom. However, on the whole media
ecology is an effective field of study for looking broadly at the effects of
media technologies. While there has not been much interaction between
the media ecology and postphenomenology (Van Den Eede, 2016), there
has recently been a tentative bridge developing between the two (Irwin,
2016; Ralón, 2016; Van Den Eede, 2016), where scholars are exploring
their conceptual commonalities.

    Ihde (1990) points out that the micro and macro are not discrete
or exclusively binary positions. They can both be used in order
to contribute important ways of considering the effects of media
technology. Looking into specific technologies, such as speed bumps,
hammers, smartphones, or typewriters, we should keep both micro
and macro perspectives in mind. A smartphone is multistable, with
various--but not infinite--possible ways of being used in particular
situations. At the same time, we can look through a macro lens
and see how the smartphone, widely speaking, has transformed
both individuals and cultures. Both perspectives together offer an
inclusive understanding of the impact of media technologies. I begin
by discussing concepts from postphenomenology and then discuss
concepts from media ecology.

  Postphenomenology and the Technological Relation

    Postphenomenology is the practical study of the relations between
    humans and technologies, from which human subjectivities emerge,
    as well as meaningful worlds. As a result of this practical and material
    orientation, postphenomenology always takes the study of human-
    technology relations as its starting point. (Rosenberger & Verbeek, 2015:
    12-13)

Like much of media literacy, postphenomenology is pragmatic and
often grounded (embedded and embodied) in the user's experience.
Arising from philosophy of technology, postphenomenology uses
several concepts that can be beneficially applied to media literacy,
58  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

specifically: 1) non-neutral technological mediation; 2) sedimentation;
and 3) multistability. I first situate postphenomenology and its concept
of the non-neutral, co-constituting technological relation. As the
co-constituting relation is the foundational component from which
I formulate the posthuman approach, I discuss it in detail. I then
introduce the concept of sedimentation and how it relates to time and
transparency. Finally, I discuss the concept of multistability, which
is a key concept that pushes back against an essentialist approach to
understanding technology.

     Situating Non-neutral Human-Technology Relations

Postphenomenology has grown out of the empirical turn, which shifts
`away from' transcendental and reifying approaches to technology5
and moves instead toward an empirical approach (see Achterhuis,
2001; Kroes & Meijers, 2001; Smith, 2015, 2018). In order to create
postphenomenology, founder Ihde (1990, 2012) builds on the concept
of phenomenology and adds pragmatism, which helps to empirically
ground research on technology and avoid making sweeping claims
(mostly negative) in an essentialist manner. This is in contrast to
Martin Heidegger (1977), Jacques Ellul (1964), and others, who have
tended to approach technology in a more reified and deterministic way.
Postphenomenologists6 often explore the specific constituting relations
that occur between subjects and technological objects, such as ICTs,
helping to dissolve a strict duality between the two and working to
describe how technologies co-constitute both subjects and the world.

                   Neutrality, Determination, and Agency

    [I]n each set of human technology relations, the model is that of an
    interrelational ontology. This style of ontology carries with it a number

  5However, Smith (2018) writes, `there is no reason why this turning towards the
        empirical has to occur at the price of a turning away from "transcendental" concerns
        regarding conditions' (78). Smith advocates for keeping both transcendental and
        empirical.

  6For some examples, see: Boltin, 2017; Ihde, 1990, 2002, 2012; Ihde & Selinger, 2003;
        Irwin 2014, 2017; Kiran, 2012, 2015; Lewis, 2018; Rosenberger, 2012, 2014, 2017;
        Rosenberger & Verbeek, 2015; Selinger, 2012; Smith, 2015; Van Den Eede, 2011, 2016;
        Van Den Eede et al., 2017a; Verbeek, 2005, 2008, 2011; Wellner, 2016, 2017a, 2017b.
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  59

    of implications, including the one that there is a co-constitution of
    humans and their technologies. Technologies transform our experience
    of the world and our perceptions and interpretations of our world, and
    we in turn become transformed in this process. Transformations are
    non-neutral. (Ihde, 2009: 44)

This quote from Ihde (2009) refers to an interrelational ontology, meaning
that humans are relational; we are always being constituted through our
relations. Furthermore, these relations are non-neutral; they influence
us and contribute to constituting our subjectivity, although they are
not completely determining. Because our relations constitute us, when
our relations change, we change. This change is always non-neutral,
meaning it transforms the way we perceive and interact with the world
(cf. Lewis, 2020). Both Bruno Latour (1999) and Ihde (2003) describe
this concept by referencing the gun debate in the U.S. and the attitude
reflected by the slogan of the National Rifle Association (NRA), guns
don't kill people, people kill people. This slogan represents a neutral view of
technology, one where the technology does not affect any change in the
individual subject. The complete opposite (deterministic) view places
all the blame on the guns.

    The non-neutral approach suggests the understanding that once
I have a gun, I am transformed. Neither I, nor the world around me,
are the same. The gun does not completely determine my actions (as
technological determinists might contend) nor is the gun a completely
neutral object (as the NRA might contend). This holds true for ICTs
such as a smartphone. I am a different traveler if I have a networked
smartphone than if I travel without one. My actions are not determined
by the smartphone, but they are influenced.

    One way of understanding the non-neutrality of technologies is
through the concept of shared agency. In a neutral view of technology, the
user has complete agency. In a determined understanding of technology,
the user has little to no agency. The non-neutral approach to technology
represents the middle ground of a shared agency between humans and
technologies (Ihde, 1990; Latour, 1999; Pickering, 1995; Puech, 2016;
Verbeek, 2005). As Robert Rosenberger and Peter-Paul Verbeek (2015)
offer, `Agency, then, is not an exclusively human property anymore: it
takes shape in complicated interactions between human and nonhuman
entities' (20). Andrew Pickering (1995, 2005) refers to this as the dance
of agency.
60  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    One of the strengths of postphenomenology is how its approach helps
researchers to analyze relations with specific technological objects and
describe what is enabled and what is constrained (cf. Ihde, 1990; Kiran,
2015; Rosenberger, 2012; Van Den Eede, 2012; Verbeek 2005; Wellner,
2016). Postphenomenology helps to shed light on effects that might be
hidden or have become transparent through habitual use of technologies
and to understand how we, and our lifeworlds, are transformed by those
technologies. As Ihde (1990) notes, `There is no "thing-in-itself". There
are only things in contexts, and contexts are multiple' (69). In other
words, objects are always situated objects-in-relation.

                       The Relation as Building Block

In order to create an approach to help media literacy become more
effective, I begin with a foundational component: the relation. In this
chapter I will specifically focus on the technological relation. There are
three interconnected aspects that comprise a relation. In Chapter 5 I
will expand this to include five other groupings of relations beyond the
technological. Though I discuss them one at a time, it is important to note
that they become part of a whole as the relation occurs. This is similar to
Karen Barad's (2007) use of the concept of phenomena: `phenomena are
the ontological inseparability of agentially intra-acting components [...
which are] basic units of reality' (33). In other words, the basic unit of
the phenomenon is comprised of (at least) two things in relation, which
are intra-acting (or co-constituting in postphenomenological terms).
Barad points out, `the "distinct" agencies are only distinct in a relational,
not an absolute, sense, that is, agencies are only distinct in relation to their
mutual entanglement; they don't exist as individual elements' (33, italics in
original).

    Because this co-constituting relation is the core concept upon which
I design the approach, I have designed a symbol to demonstrate, in one
holistic view, the significant components (see Fig. 3.1). This loosely
builds on the idea of entangled particles and waves that are explored
in quantum mechanics (Barad, 2007). I equate the `particles' with the
human and technology, and I equate the `wave' with relationality that
connects and (at least in part) constitutes the two. The Deltas (the
triangles), used in mathematics to represent change, represent the
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  61

change that occurs for both the subject and technological object, as a
specific relation (represented by the wave) between them is enacted.

     Fig. 3.1 Symbolizing the Co-constituting Relation. Image by author (2021), CC BY 4.0.

While postphenomenology uses a hyphen to signify the relation
between the human and technology (human-technology), this leaves
more chance to potentially misinterpret the relation as a subject-object
duality, especially from outside of the field. The relation demonstrated
in Figure 3.1 is the actual irreducible building block from which our
lifeworlds and our selves are constructed. From this relation we can
begin investigating the mediating relations.

                    Technological Mediation: Four Types

In postphenomenology the fundamental concept of technological
mediation is represented by the formula, I-technology-world (Ihde, 1990;
Rosenberger & Verbeek, 2015). While the term `mediation' highlights
the in-between role that technology performs between a person and the
world (Van Den Eede, 2011), several postphenomenologists point out
that the term can erroneously imply that the person and the world are
already independently established before the mediation takes place.
Instead, it is more appropriate to understand that both subject and
world (as well as the specific technology) are constituted through the
mediating role of the technology (cf. Fig. 3.2). There is a transformation
of subject and world that takes place when relation occurs, what Barad
(2007) calls intra-action. As Peter-Paul Verbeek (2005) states, `When
analyzing the mediating role of artifacts, therefore, this mediation
cannot be regarded as a mediation "between" subject and object.
Mediation consists in a mutual constitution of subject and object' (130).
This constituting role of technological mediation is how I define the
word mediation throughout this book.
62  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

With the building block of the relation explained, I will now discuss
the types of relations described by postphenomenology. Ihde (1990)
specifies four types of technological relations (embodied, hermeneutic,
alterity, and background) in order to more specifically describe the
general I-technology-world formula.

    Embodied Relation. The first relation, embodied, describes the
mediating relation where we perceive, or interact with, the world through
the technology. The classic example is a pair of eyeglasses. Our focus is
not on the glasses (unless there is something wrong with them), but
the view through them. By wearing glasses, our perception of the world
is mediated and transformed, both in an enabling way (things become
clearer) and a constraining way (they are a weight on our face; we need
to take care of them and keep them clean; and they are breakable). In
this relation, the technology has the tendency of becoming transparent
(cf. below), as our intention moves through the technology towards
something else. This relation is revisited in chapter five, as it is a key
component of the framework developed.

    Hermeneutic Relation. The second relation is a hermeneutic
relation. This is where we read the technology in order to get a new
understanding of the world. Robert Rosenberger and Verbeek (2015)
describe how `the user experiences a transformed encounter with the
world via the direct experience and interpretation of the technology
itself' (17). The common example for the hermeneutic relation is the
thermometer. We read the technology in order to gain an understanding
of the world (how cold or warm it is). The thermometer mediates our
understanding of the world and we gain insight without necessarily
feeling or sensing the temperature directly.

    Alterity Relation. The third type of relation is called alterity, where
the technology becomes a quasi-other. Evan Selinger (2012: 6) describes
alterity relations as,
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  63

    when we enter into practices with artifacts that display the feature of
    `otherness' (i.e., an evocative quality that transcends mere objecthood
    but resonates with less animateness than actual living beings such as
    people or animals). Unlike embodiment relations and hermeneutic
    relations, alterity relations focus attention upon the technology itself.

Examples of this relation include video games and ATM machines. This
is the one relation where the intentional focus is on the technology itself.

    Background Relation. The final relation is described as background
relations. These are relations that affect us but we are mostly unaware
of them, such as the heating and cooling system in our house. We set
the thermostat, and as long as the system operates properly, we do not
pay much attention to it. These are the four traditional types of relations
described in postphenomenology. Occasionally, researchers suggest
new relations, such as Verbeek's (2008) cyborg relation or Galit Wellner's
(2017a) writing relation. Verbeek (2015) also describes immersion
relations which describe smart interactive background technologies and
augmentation relations which cover augmented reality, such as Google
Glass.

                 Sedimentation and Multistability

There are two concepts that are important for the development of the
posthuman approach: sedimentation and multistability, both of which
concern perception. Sedimentation brings in an aspect of time, referring
to how our past experiences with technologies affect the way we interact
with those technologies. This often leads towards a type of transparency
that occurs, where we simply use the technologies without needing to
focus on them. Multistability refers to the way technologies are never
simply one thing; they can be used and perceived in multiple stable
ways.

                  Sedimentation's Impact on Transparency

The concept of sedimentation comes from phenomenology.
Sedimentation is the idea that our past experiences with a phenomenon
influence our current experiences of the same phenomenon (Husserl,
64  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

1973; Merleau-Ponty, 2002). Merleau-Ponty (2002: 149-50) states that
our previous experiences offer,

    a `world of thoughts', or a sediment left by our mental processes, which
    enables us to rely on our concepts and acquired judgments as we might
    on the things there in front of us [...] without there being any need for
    us to resynthesize them. [...] But the word `sediment' should not lead us
    astray: this acquired knowledge is not an inert mass in the depths of our
    consciousness.

Rosenberger (2012) uses sedimentation `to refer to the particular level of
habit, the particular degree to which the past provides meaning to the
present, in a given human-technological relation' (85). Sedimentation
also `provides the pre-perceptive context that enables our current
perceptions to occur with immediate meaningfulness' (Rosenberger
& Verbeek, 2015: 25). Sedimentation brings into the conversation
the concept of time and how our past experiences contribute to the
way mediating technologies currently constitute us. This temporal
component is developed in more detail in chapter five.

    Our experiences with technologies become sedimented within us
the more we use them, eventually causing a technological object that
we are using to recede into the background, becoming at least partially
transparent. Transparency7 is a term used in philosophy of technology
to describe,

    the degree to which a device (or an aspect of that device) fades into
    the background of a user's awareness as it is used. As a user grows
    accustomed to the embodiment of a device, [...] the device itself takes on
    a degree of transparency. (Rosenberger & Verbeek, 2015: 14)

Merleau-Ponty (2002), along with several other scholars (Dreyfus &
Dreyfus, 1986; Heidegger, 2010; Ihde, 1990; Van Den Eede, 2011; Verbeek,
2012), use various examples to describe the different ways technologies
can become transparent. Merleau-Ponty describes the blind man's stick
and how it is not an object that is perceived by the blind person using it;
rather, the person uses it as an extension of their self. The stick becomes
ever more transparent as an object as it is used to sense the world.

7For a more thorough discussion into various approaches to transparency, see Van
      Den Eede (2011).
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  65

    Heidegger (2010) refers to this transparency when he describes the
hammer as being ready-to-hand (zuhanden), where a person simply uses
it for their purpose and does not attend to the tool itself. For Heidegger,
`the tool or equipment in use becomes the means, not the object, of the
experience' (Ihde, 1990: 32). This changes only if the tool is broken or in
some way disrupts a person's use of it, thereby changing to a presence-
at-hand (vorhanden).

    While Ihde (1990) concurs with Heidegger's assessment, he believes
that there are more nuanced ways of describing our technological
relations. His four relations (cf. above) back this up. His embodied
and hermeneutic relations can be considered similarly to Heidegger's
zuhanden, where a person engages with the world through the
technology and the technology is mostly transparent. However, Ihde
describes alterity relations with technology as a way of engaging with
technology itself, even when it isn't broken.

    A common example of sedimentation and transparency is the first
time we drive a car; our concentration is almost completely focused
on the car as we attempt to operate it. However, as we become more
and more habituated through experience, the car begins to become
`transparent', receding into the background of our awareness and
transforming into an extension of our selves while we use it to move
from one place to another (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986; Merleau-Ponty,
2002; Verbeek, 2012). This transparency contributes to the difficulty of
being aware of the effects of how media technologies affect us.

                        Multistability of Technology

Perception is the cornerstone to phenomenology (cf. Merleau-Ponty's,
2002) as well as postphenomenology (cf. Ihde, 1990, 2002). Ihde
(1990) uses the Necker cube (see Figure 3.3) to begin his explanation
of the multistability of perception, which leads to his concept of the
multistability of technology.

    As Ihde (1990: 145) explains,

    The Necker cube is an ambiguous perceptual object, essentially bi-stable,
    in which (a) the uppermost part of the figure is seen as the far corner
    of its top face; but, through a `spontaneous' gestalt switch, (b) the
    uppermost part is seen as the near corner of its top face, with a second
66  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    three-dimensional stability. These two variations may switch with each
    other in the viewer's gaze, in a set of alternations distinct from one
    another, exclusive but related as three-dimensional appearances of a
    cube.

Ihde continues to go beyond the two variations of perception (bi-stability)
that are the most common to the Necker cube and describes a way of
perceiving the cube as an insect as well as two variations of a weirdly
cut gem (145-46).

    Ihde's point is that we have the ability to perceive things--specifically,
technologies--in multiple stable ways. We can perceive something in a
stable way, but then we can change our perception and see it in a different
stable way. Multistability is a core concept in postphenomenology and
the main idea that is used to counter essentialist or normative claims
concerning technologies. Ihde (2002) states, `No technology is one thing,
nor is it incapable of belonging to multiple contexts' (106). Ihde makes a
point of the gestalt switch of perception8 when it comes to multistability.
We get used to perceiving technology in one or two ways, but it can
be transformed into something completely different through a `simple'
gestalt switch in our own perception.

    While the object's physical attributes influence how they are
perceived in multistable ways, objects do not have multistabilities; this is
not an `essential' quality of the object itself. Rather, through the object's
affordances and material attributes, a subject can perceive an object in

  8McLuhan et al. (1977) also point this out in their explanation of figure and ground.
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  67

multistable ways. According to Ihde (2002), all structures and patterns
`display multistable sets of limited possibilities' (33). This view counters
essentialist ideas of technologies, which can lead toward normative
values being placed on technologies. Technological objects have multiple,
though not infinite, stabilities. A hammer can be perceived as a tool used
to pound and pull nails, but it can also be used as a paperweight, a
doorstop, or even as a weapon.

                 Summary of Postphenomenology

Any new technology mediates our relation with the world and is
transformative. Postphenomenology does not perceive technology
as neutral or completely determining, nor does it attempt to describe
an essence of technology. Rather, a postphenomenological approach
views mediating technologies as non-neutral, which are able to become
transparent through sedimentation and are multistable. I incorporate
these three postphenomenological concepts later into the posthuman
approach in order to better understand how technological relations
co-constitute the subject, technology, and the world.

                        Media Ecology

The field of media ecology has a particular way of approaching media
studies. This section investigates the effects of media technologies
through the lens of media ecology, which views media as environments.
These environments play a role in shaping message, sender, and receiver.

    Corey Anton (2016) describes how, `The particular expression,
"media ecology" grew out of a conversation in 1967 between Neil
Postman, Marshall McLuhan and Eric McLuhan, and, within a year,
Postman was using it in public talks' (126). Anton continues by
describing Walter Ong, Marshall McLuhan, and Postman, the primary
thinkers (along with several others, such as Harold Innis) who laid the
foundation for what would become known as media ecology (127).
Lance Mason (2016: 86) describes how,

    To McLuhan, a medium is an environment that structures interactions
    among and between humans and the rest of the world. This can be
68  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    contrasted with the traditional understanding of media as a conduit
    for information transfer, which I identify as a neutral conception of
    media employed by those that emphasize media content analysis, while
    ignoring media forms as objects of study.

I explore these ideas in order to demonstrate the importance of how
media technologies and ICTs affect not only individuals but cultures
and societies. Media ecology's concept of media as environments
complements postphenomenology's emphasis on the embodied
microperception and media literacy's focus on the message. This
complementarity demonstrates the benefit of using an interdisciplinary
approach to build an inclusive method for studying media.

                              Background

Media ecology approaches media in a very broad and medium-
focused manner. Researchers within the field often do not shy away
from making sweeping statements concerning the effects of specific
mediums, even broadening their scope to analyze the larger paradigms
of communication and how they affect individuals and society; an
example being Ong's (2012) seminal work, Orality and Literacy. One
of the tenets of media ecology is that media environments are mostly
invisible to us. We exist within them and are affected by them, but we
often do not realize the effects they have on us. Only by becoming aware
of them can we begin to retain some agency. This is further discussed in
the `Figure/Ground' section below.

    Media ecology takes a systems--or complexity--approach towards
understanding media and communications in order to understand the
differences each medium affords (Logan, 2015). Anthony Giddens
(1990) says that the mechanized `technologies of communication
have dramatically influenced all aspects of globalization since the
first introduction of mechanical printing into Europe' (77). Media
ecology investigates and probes these influences of specific mediums
in order to understand how each are different, uniquely enabling and
constraining individuals, societies, and cultures.

                     Media Ecology as a Field of Inquiry

Media ecology is better conceived of as a field of inquiry rather than
an established discipline or subject (Postman, 1970; Strate, 2017). Lance
Strate (2017), a student of Postman and one of the key voices in media
ecology, contrasts the field of inquiry concept to the disciplines found
in contemporary academics. Disciplines are considered well-established
subjects with `a widely accepted cannon, introductory curriculum,
theories, methods, etc.' (10). However, an established body of knowledge
does not usually define a field. Instead, a field is held together through a
mutual interest in a particular topic and is generally interdisciplinary in
nature. Strate continues by indicating `media ecology may be described
as interdisciplinary, drawing upon not only all of the social sciences and
humanities, but the fine arts and hard sciences as well' (10).

    Media ecology contrasts with media literacy in that it is less interested
in the content of each medium and more interested in the unique effects
of each medium. Postman (1974: 76-77) describes media ecologists as
researchers who,

    want to know what kind of environment we enter when we talk on
    the telephone or watch television or read a book. We want to know the
    answers to such questions as, at what level of abstraction does a medium
    operate? What aspects of reality does it isolate and amplify? What
    aspects of reality does it exclude? What is the nature of the information
    it gives? What are its spatial biases? Its temporal biases? What does a
    particular medium require us to do with our bodies and our senses? In
    what directions does it encourage us to think? And how do such biases
    determine our relations with others and ourselves?

Media ecology is a loose group of interdisciplinary scholars who
approach studying the effects of media technologies through various
avenues. In the following sections, I explain their approach to
understanding media and how specific media have specific biases. While
this leads some to make claims that media ecologists are technological
determinists, I counter that accusation. Finally, I use the concept of
the Gutenberg Parenthesis (Pettitt, 2007) to demonstrate how media
ecologists can use a macro view to investigate the effects and biases of
broad communication paradigms, specifically focusing on a comparison
of print photographs and digital images.

                      Defining Media as Environments

The cornerstone of media ecology's contribution to media literacy is
in how the field defines the term media. Rather than narrowly defining
the term, media ecology expands the term and equates it with the idea
of environments. John Naughton (2012: § After Gutenberg, What Next?)
defines the term as follows:

    The word `media' is the plural of `medium' [...] The conventional--
    journalistic--interpretation holds that a medium is a carrier of something.
    But in science, the word has another, more interesting, connotation. To a
    biologist, for example, a medium is a mixture of nutrients needed for
    cell growth [...and which] are used to grow tissue cultures--living
    organisms. [...] It seems to me that this is a useful metaphor for thinking
    about human society; it portrays our social system as a living organism
    that depends on a media environment for the nutrients it needs to survive
    and develop. Any change in the environment--in the media that support
    social and cultural life--will have corresponding effects on the organism.
    Some things will wither; others may grow; new, unexpected species may
    appear. The key point of the metaphor is simple: change the environment,
    and you change the organism; change the media environment and you
    change society.

This definition of the medium as an environment emphasizes that the
media environment is primary, the thing through which our culture
grows. This contrasts with a media literacy view `where media are
situated within culture, and are seen as a product of a culture' (Strate,
2017: 26, italics added). Since media are approached as environments,
we are able to try to understand how each specific media can,

    affect human perception, understanding, feelings, and value [...]. In the
    case of media environments (e.g., books, radio, film, television, etc.), the
    specifications are more often implicit and informal, half concealed by
    our assumption that what we are dealing with is not an environment,
    but merely a machine. Media ecology tries to make these specifications
    explicit. It tries to find out what roles media force us to play, how media
    structure what we are seeing, why media make us feel and act as we do.
    (Postman, 1970: 161)

Though complexity is dealt with more fully in the next chapter, it is worth
a brief mention here since it is a commonly acknowledged component of
ecology and environmental studies (cf. Hirsch et al., 2011). Therefore,
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  71

when viewing media as environments, it is not surprising that there
is also an element of complexity, and this element is a useful way of
understanding the effects a medium-as-environment has. Complexity
helps to manage expectations when we interact with such systems.
Edgar Morin (2007) discusses an ecology of action, suggesting that once
any action enters an environment, it leaves the control and intention of
whoever or whatever created the action. It `enters a set of interactions
and multiple feedbacks and then it will find itself derived from its
finalities, and sometimes to even go in the opposite sense' (21). These
complex environments behave in non-linear ways, where simple cause
and effect can no longer be counted on.

                            Figure/Ground

Marshall McLuhan (in McLuhan et al., 1977) points out that a quality
of one's environment is that it is usually not in the foreground of our
awareness. McLuhan uses the idea of figure/ground to describe this. He
credits Edgar Rubin for introducing this concept in 1915. `Rubin adopted
the terms figure and ground to assist the study of structure in visible
phenomena' (9). For McLuhan, `figure and ground are not categories:
they are tools that will help you discover the structure and properties
of situations' (31). And, as a tool, it can be leveraged in media literacy.
For example, McLuhan et al. (1977) discuss how it can provide `a useful
method of finding meaning in advertising' (27).

    In describing how environments tend to be invisible, McLuhan
(1970) was fond of saying, `Fish don't know water exists till beached'
(191). The water, in this case, is the environment or ground for the fish,
which is so immersed within the environment that it has no perspective
to perceive the water. McLuhan (McLuhan et al., 1977) points out that
it is the media messages that are the figure and capture our attention,
and the medium is the environment or ground that people rarely focus
on. However, it is the medium that exerts a significant influence on the
creation of the messages, the messages themselves, and the receivers of
the message.

    While the technology fades from our focus--moving from figure to
ground--it continues to transform our abilities, a transformation we
typically do not pay attention to. Strate (2017) explains that anything
72  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

can become routine and taken for granted, causing it to recede from our
awareness and effectively become invisible to us. At this point it can be
considered environmental. Often, the only times we actually perceive
mediums on their own terms is when a medium is new to us, when
it breaks down, when we exert an active control over its operation, or
when people use it creatively or artistically.

    This is an important concept in the everyday aspect of media
literacy. Our focus tends to steer away from the medium that is
being used to communicate the message. However, Strate continues,
`an older medium may serve as what McLuhan [...] termed an anti-
environment or counter-environment, an alternate environment that,
by its unfamiliarity, brings our current environment into conscious
awareness and visibility' (112-13). For example, I recently have been
collecting old manual typewriters. When I type on them, I experience
a counter-environment to using a word processing program on
my laptop, allowing me insights to how each technology enables
and constrains differently. The danger of media receding into the
background (such as using word processing programs to write with)
is that we become less likely to notice its effect on us or on our culture.
This is where the concept of media bias can be leveraged. By becoming
aware of media bias, we have the potential to regain some agency in
our engagement with media.

                               Media Bias

I now look into how these environments have a bias that affects
individuals and cultures, which often is not explicitly recognized by
the users of the medium. While identifying a bias of communication
mediums has caused some to accuse McLuhan and media ecology
of technological determinism (cf. Moores, 2012; Smith & Marx, 1994;
Williams, 2004), I explain why I believe claims of determinism are in
error. Finally, I use the example of the Gutenberg Parenthesis (Pettitt,
2007, 2012) to demonstrate how the communication eras of orality, print,
and digital can be understood through the different affordances of print
photography and digital images.

    Harold Innis (2008) describes cultures as having a certain bias due
to the dominant communication medium. He discusses the effects of
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  73

heavy media (such as stone) and light media (such as papyrus or the air
for speech or radio waves) (33):

    A medium of communication has an important influence on the
    dissemination of knowledge over space and time and it becomes
    necessary to study its characteristics in order to appraise its influence in
    its cultural setting. According to its characteristics it may be better suited
    to the dissemination of knowledge over time than over space, particularly
    if the medium is heavy and durable and not suited to transportation, or
    to the dissemination of knowledge over space than over time, particularly
    if the medium is light and easily transported. The relative emphasis on
    time or space will imply a bias of significance to the culture in which it
    is embedded.

Looking at what is afforded by each broad paradigm of communication
is a way to understand the fundamental influences that each can have
on a culture. For instance, oral traditions rely on and value memory. A
person's memory is then likely to be more developed in an oral culture
than a print culture, where print acts as an extended memory (Ong,
2012).

    When writing was being developed, there were people who were
skeptical of this new medium. In Phaedrus, Plato lamented that writing
would give us the semblance of knowledge without the knowledge
itself (Phaedrus, 274-77). While people would have the written word,
Plato questioned how much actual meaning and knowledge would be
transmitted by the words alone, especially if the written words traveled
far from the author and were read by people who might not be ready
for them. The initial use of writing was as an external memory device.
For example, early religious texts did not have punctuation or spaces as
they were simply meant to jog the reader's memory in order to be read
out loud. The performance was up to the reader and experienced orally
by the audience (Martin & Cochrane, 1994).

    Writing and print still contain aspects of orality. As McLuhan (1994)
states, `the "content" of any medium is always another medium' (8).
Robert Logan (2000) points out that Innis and McLuhan often speak
of three ages, or eras, of communication: oral, written, and electric.
It is acknowledged that not every culture goes through, or has gone
through, all of these ages--let alone at the same time. However, by
looking at the macro perspective concerning the paradigms of human
74  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

communication and the effect each has on individuals, societies, and
cultures, we can gain insight into how these specific communication
media have influenced us.

                   Technological Determinism and Agency

The focus of media ecology on the way media technologies affect
individuals and cultures is often criticized--mostly from those outside
the field--as being technological determinist. In other words, media
ecologists are criticized for believing that technology determines
people's actions, taking away most, if not all, human agency. Raymond
Williams (2004) responds to McLuhan's approach by saying, `For if the
medium--whether print or television--is the cause, all other causes, all
that men ordinarily see as history, are at once reduced to effects' (130).

    Claims of technological determinism are sometimes well founded.
For example, consider the words of Edmund Carpenter (1973), who
worked with Marshall McLuhan:

    I think media are so powerful they swallow cultures. I think of them as
    invisible environments which surround and destroy old environments.
    Sensitivity to problems of culture conflict and conquest becomes
    meaningless here, for media play no favorites: they conquer all cultures.
    One may pretend that media preserve and present the old by recording
    it on film and tape, but that is mere distraction, a sleight-of-hand possible
    when people keep their eyes focused on content. (191)

This statement, that media `conquer all cultures', comes across as quite
deterministic. It also represents a pattern in media ecology, likely
influenced by McLuhan himself, who was known for possessing a
rather dramatic style of writing. Clark (2009) mentions, `Metaphorical
allusions, poetic flourishes, and theories on a grand scale have remained
some of the hallmarks of style within the field of media ecology itself'
(11). It may be that McLuhan writes this way in order to effectively
shock society's attention into noticing the influence of the medium that
is all but invisible, even to many academics. In addition, because media
ecology is a varied field with many voices, it is natural to have some
scholars who might lean more towards technological determinism than
others.
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  75

    Ong (1977) defends his own work against being perceived as
deterministic by saying that his analysis of orality, print, and digital
mediums of communication do not explain everything about culture
and human consciousness. Instead, he claims that there is a relation
between the major developments in culture and human consciousness
and the evolution of the word from a primarily oral state to its present
state. However, the relationships are `varied and complex, with cause
and effect often difficult to distinguish' (10).

    Strate (2017) claims that technological determinism is, for the
most part, `a label applied by critics, rather than a term used, let alone
embraced, within the field' (34) of media ecology. He explains, `A bias
does not represent absolute command over us, however, but rather
a path of least resistance. [...] The concern within the field of media
ecology, then, is the degree to which we cede control to the biases of
technology' (36). This is similar to postphenomenology's concept of the
non-neutrality of technology. Just because a technology is not neutral
does not mean that it is completely determining.

    To guard against the determining aspects of the technological
medium, education can help bring about awareness of these effects.
Developing this awareness is invaluable, allowing us greater agency,
without which we risk living as beings determined by the technologies in
our lives. Michel Puech (2016) explains, `The lack of awareness implies
here the absence of self-construction: living as an object in commercial
and societal networks, not as a self' (173). This is where media literacy
has a role to play. Education is a key way of helping people pay attention
to the effects of media (McLuhan et al., 1977). By bringing the effects of
a specific medium to a person's awareness, that person then has a better
chance of retaining some of their agency in their relationship with the
medium. Rather than a binary between neutral and determining views
of technology there is a continuum; where one is on that continuum at
any moment depends in part upon our awareness of the multiplicity of
relations that are influencing us at any moment.

     Media Ecology in Action: The Gutenberg Parenthesis

In sum, we can understand media bias by looking at how the
dominant medium of communication for an age has specific effects on
76  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

individuals, cultures, and societies. By understanding the current media
environment through a broad historical context, we can bring more
awareness to the affordances of specific media. In this section, I explore
the print and digital mediums through the concept of the Gutenberg
Parenthesis, using it to compare the different media biases between a
print photograph and a digital image.

    Thomas Pettitt (2007, 2012) explores three different communication
paradigms: 1) the pre-print age before Gutenberg's printing press
allowed for the dissemination of easily acquired printed materials; 2)
the age of print dominance, where the primary way of communicating
was through the printed word; and 3) the current age of digital and
electronic media. Pettitt (2007: 3) describes this middle age, where
print was the dominant means of communication, as the Gutenberg
Parenthesis:

    Since the Renaissance, the communication of Western culture has
    been dominated and in many ways determined by mechanically mass-
    produced texts, symbolized by (but not restricted to) the printed book,
    but this is now discernible as merely a phase, discernibly coming to an
    end under the pressure of developments in relation to the electronic
    media, the internet and digital technology.

When Gutenberg's printing press popularized the ability to make
copies of texts, print-based literacy became democratized, moving
reading and writing out of the hands of the elite, and into the lives of
the masses. This was a major disruption, at least in the Western world,
especially for the Christian church and in politics (Postman, 2006). It
was estimated that `between 1640 and 1700, the literacy rate for (white)
men in Massachusetts and Connecticut was somewhere between 89
percent and 95 percent' (Postman, 2006: 31). As one example of the
socio-cultural impact, this literacy rate, combined with the printed
news stories, was integral for the United States' revolution against Great
Britain (Humphrey, 2013).

    Western culture is now just emerging from the print-dominated
era, but our mindset is still heavily influenced by the print paradigm.
Ong (2012) provides an in-depth study on the differences that orality
and print have on societies and cultures. While orality is heavily reliant
on, and limited by, memory, the shift to print allows for externalized
memory. Books become repositories for knowledge and information.
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  77

    We are now entering an age dominated by a digital medium. While it
might be assumed that as we move forward, we have more in common
with the recent past than the distant pass, this is not always true. By
looking at the affordances of an oral, print, and digital communication
paradigm, we begin to notice, somewhat surprisingly, that digital
communication has a lot in common with oral tradition, often more so
than with the era of print communication. This is why Pettitt (2012)
refers to the age of print as a parenthesis. According to Pettitt, the
inception of a parenthesis in a sentence `interrupts an earlier phase,
which resumes when it concludes, if inevitably with modifications
resulting from what has happened in the meantime' (96). In other
words, the era of print communication has interrupted and changed our
oral means of communication. Ong (2012) describes this new digital/
electronic age as a secondary orality that, `has striking resemblances to
the old in its participatory mystique, its fostering of a communal sense,
its concentration on the present moment, and even its use of formulas'
(133-34). As we move fully into the digital age it will not be surprising to
find specifically print-based affordances like copyright being challenged
by the affordances of the new digital medium.

                       Investigating Print Affordances

How exactly did the era of print as a dominant communication paradigm
change individuals and culture? Ong (1977) posits, `The tendency to
closure had to do with a state of mind encouraged by print and its way
of suggesting that knowledge, and thus indirectly actuality itself, could
somehow be packaged' (330). In other words, print packaged ideas into
a beginning, middle, and end, and this influenced the thinking process
for print-based cultures. Print is static and materially bound. As Pettitt
(2012) describes, `A work in a book is self-contained, and resists any
textual intrusion or extraction that would compromise this integrity.
The technology places not merely physical but psychological boundaries
around the text' (102). The print medium adds a sense of stability, a
static nature to knowledge, even lending a sense of permanence.

    Writing enables us to externalize our thoughts, which helps us
develop more complicated ideas. Writing functions as an extended
mind (Clark & Chalmers, 1998), helping to advance not only science
78  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

and technology but also critical thought and social theory. By writing
down what we know and turning this information into an object, the
words are lent an air of objective truth, which has both benefits and
drawbacks. This process allows knowledge to become an externalized
thing; a thing that can be copyrighted and owned. The thingness of print
is quite important, affording different abilities than the ephemerality of
oral communication. Text is also linear, a straight path through time and
space. It is read in one direction and is meant to be read in a sequential
order, one word following another. And finally, there is a sense of
authorship, of ownership, which leads to copyright and the ownership
of knowledge, something that is not found in oral traditions.9

    However, the externalized, static print model can be understood as
an anomaly in how we have historically communicated. As Pettitt (2007)
explains, `the post-parenthetical period after and the pre-parenthetical
period before may have more in common with each other than either
has with the parenthetical phase that came in between' (3) Since we are
directly evolving out of an age dominated by print, much of our media
literacy is still greatly influenced by print. In order to exemplify this, I
look next at the differences between print and digital photography.

                   Print Photographs and Digital Images

Since the investigation I use to develop an instrument in chapter six
involves a specific digital image of a museum selfie, I use an example
of the Gutenberg Parenthesis in order to explore the differences in
medium-affordances between print photographs and digital images.
Building upon Pettitt's (2007) original language,10 I have updated the
terminology--which I will explain--in order to compare the traits in

9However, oral traditions will often have certain people whose role is to be a keeper
      of knowledge.

10The table below illustrates Pettitt's (2007: 2) original terminology:

terms of ICTs (see Fig. 3.4). These are considered on a meta level; they
have a general influence on the society as a whole but are not meant to
be prescriptive for every individual case in every situation. This is what
media ecology describes as the bias of the medium, which then leads to
cultural biases (Innis, 2008). Again, these biases have influence on us,
but through media literacy education we have the ability to regain some
of our agency.

Photography battles with the fantasy that it captures a neutral view of
reality without modifying it. Susan Sontag (1973) refers to a judiciary
use of the printed photograph that `passes for incontrovertible proof
that a given thing happened' (3). However, she states her opinion that
`photographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and
drawings' (4). Additionally, the art of dodging and burning11 during the
transfer from negative to print was well established before Photoshop
and digital photography. Ansel Adams is known for spending many
hours in the darkroom developing a single print and said, `dodging
and burning are steps to take care of mistakes God made in establishing
tonal relationships' (as cited in Li et al., 2015: 131). However, digital
images tend to be one more step removed from reality. While the
negative in print photography is still an image, the file of a digital image

  11Dodging and burning are used to lighten or darken specific parts of the rendered
        print photograph.
80  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

is comprised of bits--computerized 1's and 0's--that are not an image
until interpreted and displayed by a combination of software and an
electronic display device.

    Additionally, a print photograph is a tangible artifact, a physical object
with unique qualities. Though it is possible to replicate photographs, a
photographer can have a reasonable amount of control12 over how many
copies are produced and how they are printed (size and quality, as well
as original framing). The print photograph is not necessarily one specific
thing or another, but it is rather as a vehicle, a medium, which can portray
and achieve various designations (art, document, snapshot, mnemonic
device, etc.). Joanna Zylinska (2017) describes the act of photography
as `cutting reality into small pieces [...where] we enact separation and
relationality as the two dominant aspects of material locatedness in
time' (43). The materiality of the photograph adds concreteness and
limits its spatial existence. Using the qualities in Figure 3.4 under `print'
and `digital' we can compare a print photograph with a digital image. I
italicize the words from this figure that I am referring to when making
the comparisons.

    Print Photographs. The affordances of the print photograph are that
it is a stable medium; it is light, transportable, and somewhat fragile, but
under the right conditions can be still quite recognizable after 50-100
years. Print is an external memory device, able to invoke memories,
especially of the people immediately concerned with the subject of
the photograph. It is linear, a snapshot in time, occurring after some
events and before others. It is an artifact, a material object. It is authored.
Someone took the photograph, and they are the creators of the object,
legally acknowledged (unless they work for a company or a government
agency that is paying them to take the photo) as the copyright owners.
Finally, being a material object that re-presents an image of reality, there
is a semblance of objective truth. This is reflected in the ability to use
photographs in court as evidence.

    Digital Images. In comparison with print photographs, a digital
image is temporary. It is a computer file, represented by 0's and
1's, which is only able to be displayed (performed) through its
contextualizing metadata. It can be saved onto many different types of
physical mediums (e.g., thumb drives, hard drives, and DVD/CDs).

  12They had more control before the invention of high-definition color copiers.
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  81

While saving something to `the cloud' sounds immaterial, the actual
file is stored on at least one material server/storage device. If it is not
rewritten after a period of time (around 10-15 years, depending upon
the specific medium), there are several issues that can threaten the
integrity of the stored information:13

        1. The deterioration of the medium itself (DVD's have a 15-20-
            year lifespan or up to 50 years for the archival variety).

        2. The file format can become unreadable as software
            programs and formats continue to advance. Twenty-five
            years ago, WordStar was a very popular word processing
            program, but trying to get a computer to display a WordStar
            file now would be quite difficult. Eventually, the file format
            needs to be `saved as' a newer version.

        3. The memory storage device eventually becomes
            unsupported due to the physical structure. 5 ¼ inch disks
            gave way to 3 ½ inch disks, which gave way to CD-ROMs,
            then DVDs then USB drives, etc.

The digital image also has a networked memory, meaning that it affords
the ability to be accessed in a networked manner. This allows many
people simultaneous access to the same file, unlimited by proximity if
the digital image is connected to the internet (where a print photograph
is more limited by proximity and space). This also relates to hypertext,
where the image can be linked non-linearly. With a shared link, the
image can be embedded into most digital documents, accessible either
by being embedded or by clicking on a link.

    The digital image is greatly affected by what is performing the image
(the printed photograph is also a performance of the negative but has

  13While it is true that some of these possible futures can be remedied through
        automated processes, there is a parallel between traits from an oral tradition
        and the need for each generation to decide what information is `saved' in order
        to be transmitted to future generations. Decisions of what to transmit and what
        not to transmit are important as knowledge is passed down through generations.
        Inherently, information will be lost. It is also not possible to know what information
        and knowledge will be relevant or significant for future generations with shifts
        in culture, language, lifestyle, relationship with technology, etc. Even with the
        intention of transmitting something, the most proven medium devised with the
        longest and most successful means of archiving is still microfilm. Its estimated
        longevity is 500 years and can be read with a strong magnifying glass.

more fixity and materiality than the digital image). The type of screen
and software interpreting and performing the digital bits has an impact
on how the image looks. The exact same file can be a grainy thumbnail
displayed on an old cellphone, or it can be viewed on a very large high-
definition widescreen display. While a print photograph is `performed'
in an analog process using chemicals, light, and special paper, a digital
image is performed by both hardware and software that mediate its
appearance, whether on a smartphone, a website, a laptop, or a large
screen television display. A single digital file of an image depends upon
the technological mediation of the software and hardware to display
the file. However, as Figure 3.5 demonstrates, the actual image is built
upon code--binary bits and bytes--which are then interpreted and
performed through many technological steps.

     Fig. 3.5 Partial Display of a Digital Image File as Performed in Hexadecimal. Image by
                                               author (2021), CC BY 4.0.

Much more so than a static object, the authorship of a digital image is
open to appropriation. It is very easy to take a screenshot of somebody's
digital image, potentially modifying it, and portraying it as your own.
Due to the ease of copying or pirating digital content, there has been
much effort to create digital rights management policies in order to
protect original authors. However, it is the ease of the digital format that
creates this need, as it both enables and constrains.

    Coming to the final word in Figure 3.4, the digital image lends
itself to post-truth rather than the semblance of objective truth of print
photographs. This is because of the ease of modifying the original
photo, making the `reality' of its original capture appear quite different
yet still realistic. Software such as Adobe Photoshop can dramatically
alter the original image in a way that is very hard to detect (Hanson,
2004; Manovich, 2013). For instance, the ability to remove or add people
3. Understanding the Medium Through the Technological Relation  83

from the image is quite simple. Because this is possible, digital images
need to be (or at least should be) professionally analyzed to detect any
modification if they are going to be used as evidence in court cases.
Mark Hansen (2004) writes, `Following its digitization, the image can
no longer be understood as a fixed and objective viewpoint on "reality"
[...] since it is now defined precisely through its almost complete
flexibility and addressibility [sic], its numerical basis, and its constitutive
"virtuality"' (7-8). He continues by describing the digital image as no
longer being `restricted to the level of surface appearance, but must be
extended to encompass the entire process by which information is made
perceivable through embodied experience' (10). The digital image,
therefore, needs to be understood not only by how it looks, but also
through interpretation by software and hardware.

    These examples demonstrate the need for unlearning the previous
construct of the print photograph as we are now primarily dealing with
digital images. By deterritorializing (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987) the
photograph from the print paradigm and reterritorializing it within
the affordances of the digital, we can let go of our previous concepts of
`the print photograph' and develop more realistic expectations afforded
by digital images. The communication paradigms--orality, print, and
digital--are transformative, enabling some things while constraining
others. Becoming aware of these details can allow us to modify both our
own expectations and help us to decide what is important (or not) to
fight for once something we value becomes constrained.

    Copyright issues are a useful example of the affordances of specific
communication mediums. Copyright does not exist in a strictly oral
society. It only comes about with the externalization of knowledge into
an object--the written word. This allows for the ability of ownership, of
authorship. What should we do now that the digital paradigm makes
it much easier to break copyright laws? Do we still value copyright
and believe it should be retained? If so, what are the policies and
technological developments that need to happen to continue enabling
and respecting copyright? Investigating this further is beyond the scope
of my research (cf. Chen, 2017, for further discussion on copyright and
the link to print), but this brief overview demonstrates the importance
of understanding the broader communication paradigms, and these
issues warrant further study and discussion.
84  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

                    Concluding Thoughts

While there have traditionally been two sides of the `media coin', the
message and the medium, this book focuses on changing this binary
to an assemblage of medium, content, and context. I have approached
understanding the effects of the medium through a micro and a
macro lens. Postphenomenology and media ecology help improve our
awareness of the impact of technology on the constitution of the subject,
understanding that the subject is constituted through technological
relations.

    Postphenomenology contributes to our understanding of the non-
neutrality of technological mediation. It helps us become aware of how
media technologies can become sedimented through our experiences,
causing them to fade from our awareness and become transparent.
Postphenomenology also adds the concept of multistability of media
technologies, keeping us from falling into essentializing claims. Media
ecology can help us understand media as complex environments that
have unique biases, which influence us. Media ecology also emphasizes
the use of a figure/ground approach, a tool that can help us identify
the media biases that are often backgrounded and not part of our
awareness. Both of these fields of study can be used to construct an
inclusive, holistic approach to enhance media literacy.

    While we now have a solid foundation in understanding technological
mediation, the focus until now has been directed toward the media
technologies themselves. These technologies can be understood as
having a shared agency with human subjects, as we relate to the media
in our daily lives. However, as some of the agency moves away from
the subject and into technological objects, Tamar Sharon (2014) points
out that disciplines such as postphenomenology seem to focus more
on `breathing life into objects [...] than delving into the implications of
having breathed life out of subjects' (9). She proposes that we take a
closer look at what is going on with the subject. In the next chapter, I
take on Sharon's challenge in order to understand the transformational
effects of technologies that occur within the subject. I also explore what
is meant by the posthuman subject.

         4. The Posthuman:

           Situating the Subject in
           Human-Tech Relations

    I take the posthuman predicament as an opportunity to empower
    the pursuit of alternative schemes of thought, knowledge and self-
    representation. The posthuman condition urges us to think critically
    and creatively about who and what we are actually in the process of
    becoming. (Braidotti, 2013: 12)

After focusing on the technological relations in the previous chapter, I
now bring the discussion to the human side of the human-technology
relation, trying to better understand what makes up the human subject
under discussion. I first give a brief historical account of the humanist
subject, consider the transhumanist subject, and discuss how they each
are involved with the human enhancement debate. I then make the case
for a philosophical posthuman subject that is complex and emergent.
Through a contemporary approach to the human, I use complexity to
understand our selves not as standalone individuals but as complex and
interrelational beings who are always becoming through the relations
in our lives. This chapter will finalize the background and theoretical
underpinnings for the framework developed in Chapter 5.

    It is difficult, if not impossible, to fully comprehend the effect of
information and communication technologies (ICTs) without first
having an accurate understanding of the human subject. While we
have made great advances in developing technologies, it is surprising

88  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

how challenging it remains to answer the question, what are we? While
it may be simple to ask the question, contriving an answer is much
more complicated. Finding the answer to this question has been one of
the primary concerns of philosophers (and humankind) throughout
recorded history.

    In order to understand how the technological relation discussed
in chapter three constitutes us, it is helpful to understand what is this
`us' we are talking about. While understanding the human subject has
changed throughout history, it is further complicated by the wide range
of cultures with radically different ways of interpreting the human. My
main focus remains on the contemporary, Westernized world. This is
not to discount other cultures that have beneficial contributions and
perspectives, but simply to limit the scope and stay embedded within
my own situated knowledge so as to avoid `appropriating the vision of
the less powerful while claiming to see from their positions' (Haraway,
1988: 584).

        Humanists and Transhumanists Debating

                         Enhancement

As ICTs encroach more and more into our lives, questions of the
convergence of humans and technology are raised. The majority of people
in the developed world now have a constant connection with the digital
world through smartphones--roughly 72%--and the undeveloped
world has reached almost half who have a constant connection (Poushter
et al., 2018: 4). This connection provides instant information retrieval via
a browser search (often Google) and an ever-present network of friends
via social media. At one's fingertips are answers to almost any question,
from restaurant reviews, to directions, to definitions. Translation apps
can use augmented reality by using the phone's camera to change an
image's words into one's preferred language (Fragoso et al., 2011).
Wearable technology is taking advantage of being located on one's body
and provides a person with health-related information and insights
(Van Den Eede, 2015b). Technologies are indeed `moving towards us,
into us' (Van Den Eede, 2017: xxv).

    Recent advances in nano, biological, and information technologies,
along with cognitive sciences (collectively referred to as NBIC
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  89

technologies), have sparked a passionate `human enhancement' debate
concerning what it means to be human (Roco & Bainbridge, 2003).
On one side are transhumanists, who cite our long history of using
technology to survive and improve our lives; from fire, to shelter, to
cross-breeding plants for better agricultural yields. In the transhumanist
view, gene splicing and nano technologies are simply next steps in this
long history. On the other side of the spectrum are the bioconservatives,
or traditional humanists, who believe that human enhancement can
lead to the potential loss of something essentially human.

    First, there is no one humanism or one transhumanism. Both have
evolved over time, and both are comprised of many people with
differing opinions. My ultimate goal is not to disprove either of these
approaches, but to create a contemporary understanding of the human
subject in order to more fully realize how relations with technologies
contribute towards constituting the human subject. I attempt to limit
making sweeping statements. I also restrain from spending too much
time defining myself against other approaches, saving the bulk of my
argument for an affirmative building of my position.

            Convergence of Humans and Technologies

As ICTs come ever more entangled with our lives, one question might
be raised concerning how much longer it will be before we move from
wearable to wide spread embedded technology? This brings about the
question of NBIC technologies and human-technology convergence.
Already there are advances to neural interfaces, where the goal is to
`seamlessly integrate the interface between neurobiology and engineered
technology to record from and modulate neurons' (Wellman et al., 2018:
1; cf. Neely et al., 2018). Brain-to-machine interfaces are being developed
for assistive technologies (Donati et al., 2016) but also more generally for
`interaction between a person and a machine via thought' (Sargent et al.,
2017: 1). There are now even brain-to-brain interfaces being developed
(Zhang et al., 2019).

    In addition to this convergence between humans and technological
artifacts, the door is now open to inexpensive manipulation of the human
genetic code; for example, through CRISPR-Cas9 process (Doudna &
Sternberg, 2017; Ran et al., 2013), which makes it relatively easy and
90  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

inexpensive to cut out unwanted genes and replace them with different
genes, even genes from non-humans. Technologies and humans are
converging on many different fronts. Possibilities that a few years ago
seemed like science fiction appear to have credible potential in the near
future. The situation has caused a polarized debate concerning human
enhancement. On one side of the debate are the exciting possibilities of
eradicating chronic diseases and improving the quality and longevity of
human lives. On the other side, there are concerns over losing something
essentially human (Fukuyama, 2004) through the convergence with
technology.

    There is also concern over equity and the increasing division
between the haves and have-nots. It is possible that the more affluent
will be able to give their children improvements with enhanced minds
and bodies while the less affluent remain `behind'. This could even lead
to some humans becoming so enhanced that they become post-humans,
taking an evolutionary step beyond what we consider as Homo sapiens.
This situation highlights the need to address how we define `human' in
relation to converging technologies. We now are starting to possess the
technological ability to be able to play a more active role in the evolution
of humanity, causing some to question our ability to understand the
long- and short-term ramifications of playing the role of Homo deus
(Harari, 2016). This leads to questions like: What is the most helpful
approach to understanding the convergence of technology and the
human? How can the human be separate from technology at the same
time it is converging with it? Is there a more relevant representation of
the human individual than the centuries old humanist ideal as captured
by Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man?

    Humanism and the Enlightenment: An Old Foundation

Today, the humanist mantel is interpreted differently by bioconservatives
(or conservative humanists) on one side (e.g., Fukuyama, 2002, 2004;
Habermas, 2003; McKibben, 2004) and transhumanists on the other
(e.g., Bostrom, 2005, 2013; Kurzweil, 2005; Moravec, 1988; More, 2013).
However, both sides of the debate have foundations in humanism and
the Enlightenment. Because the foundation of the human enhancement
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  91

debate rests on rational humanism and the Enlightenment, I begin with
an overview.

    As Sharon (2014) points out, both bioconservatives and
transhumanists are founded upon humanist ideals. The rational
humanist subject, stemming from the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries and closely connected to the Enlightenment, is an empowered
subject, able to think for itself and not necessarily depend upon religion
for answers. Rationalism and the age of reason led European society (and
beyond) toward great advances, including the industrial revolution.
The autonomous individual became the norm. Beatrice Han-Pile (2010)
states that in the English-speaking world humanism is:

    often associated with an optimistic and secular view of the world which
    asserts the privilege of human beings over non-organic (or organic but
    nonhuman) entities, defending the rights of human beings to happiness
    and to the development of their individual potential (118).

Humanism helped move humanity out of the `Dark Ages' and into
an age of reason and control, elevating and empowering the human
individual. While humanism and modernism have contributed to
reducing famine, plagues, and deaths due to wars (Harari, 2016), it has
also led to humanity consuming the Earth's resources1 at an alarming
rate. This has contributed to bringing us into the sixth mass extinction
(Cafaro, 2015) at the same time as the fourth industrial (technological)
revolution (Schwab, 2017).

    Humanism was not always so singularly (and narrowly) defined
(Braidotti, 2013; Han-Pile, 2010; Hayles, 2008; and additionally,2 Hughes,
2010a). However, with the backlash against positivism and the outcry
from the French poststructuralists and postmodernists, humanism
has been shaped into a discipline that has lost some of its previous
diversity and is now seen in a more singular manner; as valuing the
rational, autonomous, and exceptional self, where the natural world is
a Heideggerian (1977) reserve of resources available for our use and

  1Humanism's merger with capitalism has teamed up to provide us with an
        industrialized and global economy that churns out profits and supplies us with a
        seemingly unlimited number of gadgets. While we have never been so entertained,
        with access to so much fantastical variety of fetishes, fantasies, and spectacle, the
        question remains: at what price and what happened to the promised enlightenment?

  2In relation to divisions within the Enlightenment.
92  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

exploitation. And yet, the embrace of `the human' obscures those who
remain un-embraced; marginalized groups who are too slowly being
accepted as equal or even included, and who are still far from counting
as fully human in the eyes of too many (Latour, 1993). As Braidotti
(2013: 1) points out,

    Not all of us can say, with any degree of certainty, that we have always been
    human, or that we are only that. Some of us are not even considered fully
    human now, let alone at previous moments of Western social, political
    and scientific history. Not if by `human' we mean that creature familiar
    to us from the Enlightenment [...]. And yet the term enjoys widespread
    consensus and it maintains the re-assuring familiarity of common sense.
    We assert our attachment to the species as if it were a matter of fact,
    a given. So much so that we construct a fundamental notion of Rights
    around the Human. But is it so?

A very troubling aspect of humanism is the shift toward eugenics and
the genocide of Jews, LGBTQs, people with abilities that were perceived
outside of a socially-constructed norm, and various marginalized
groups in the name of perfecting the human `race'. Even now, women
are not paid a wage equal to men in nearly all places around the globe,
LGBTQ rights are not accepted worldwide, and racism3 continues to
be widespread. While the humanist concept of the human has helped
some become empowered, it has left other humans outside of what is
accepted, or desired. Another part of the criticism of humanists is that
they adopt an anthropocentric perspective, considering the human as
exceptional and placing people above any other species in the world.

            Transhumanism: Reasonable or Extreme?

Rather than focusing on the humanist past, transhumanists tend to
be futurists. For instance, one of the main voices in the transhumanist
movement is Nick Bostrom, who is the founding director of the Future
for Humanity Institute in Oxford. In this section, I consider two types
of approaches that transhumanists concern themselves with. The first
is the near future and the idea of making incremental improvements

  3As I write this in June 2020, there are massive global protests in support of the
        Black Lives Matter movement, sparked by continual killings of mostly black men by
        police in the U.S.
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  93

to humans. I then consider the more distant future ideas such as mind
uploading, which I believe distract more than help the transhumanist
cause. However, the most troublesome aspect of much of transhumanism
is the foundational idea of the standalone individual that is rooted in the
Enlightenment. While I believe this critical flaw needs to be remedied,
there are also positive aspects of transhumanism.

    My intention here is to not provide a sweeping criticism of
transhumanism per se, but to critically engage with some of its
fundamental concepts and attempt to tease apart concepts and ideas
that can be beneficial from others that I believe are flawed. Rather than
focusing on its strong libertarian past, I am encouraged by the increased
focus on social democratic ideals from James Hughes (2010a, 2010b,
2012). While I don't believe all of the problem issues have completely
disappeared from transhumanist dialogues, I do believe there is an
increased focus on social equity and the acknowledgement of the
complexity of human consciousness and cognition. For example, Max
More (2013: 10) writes,

    The search for absolute foundations for reason, for instance, has given
    way to a more sophisticated, uncertain, and self-critical form of critical
    rationalism. The simple, unified self has been replaced by the far more
    complex and puzzling self revealed by the neurosciences. The utterly
    unique status of human beings has been superseded by an understanding
    that we are part of a spectrum of biological organisms and possible non-
    biological species of the future.

A common idea within the transhumanist field is, `within certain
limits, [...] it is desirable to use emerging technologies to enhance
human physical and cognitive capacities and to make other beneficial
alterations to human traits' (Blackford, 2011). Stephen Sorgner (2019)
explains, `expanding the human health span is a central goal of most
transhumanists' (17). More (2013: 5) coined the term extropy, which
concerns

    perpetual progress, self-transformation, practical optimism, intelligent
    technology, open society, self-direction, and rational thinking. Perpetual
    progress is a strong statement of the transhumanist commitment to seek
    `more intelligence, wisdom, and effectiveness, an open-ended lifespan,
    and the removal of political, cultural, biological, and psychological limits
    to continuing development. Perpetually overcoming constraints on
94  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    our progress and possibilities as individuals, as organizations, and as
    a species.' [...] The implementation of transhumanism [is] a continual
    process and not about seeking a state of perfection.4

More's statement refutes the claim that transhumanists are utopians
striving to become perfect. The immediate goal of transhumanism is
not necessarily a complete convergence with technology; rather, it is to
improve the lives of humans, primarily through the use of technology.

    While the transhumanist movement began in the 1980s (Lewis,
2018) with a fair amount of unabashed exuberance, it has since matured
and looks more closely at, for instance, the risks5 involved with new
technologies. For example, Bostrom's Future of Humanity Institute in
Oxford (and others) has begun focusing on existential risks (Bostrom,
2013). Additionally, there has been more attention to the societal issues,
expanding beyond the focus on the individual (Hughes, 2004, 2012;
Wood, 2017). Hughes (2012) states, `Much transhumanist politics has
been shaped by the libertarian leanings of its affluent, educated, male,
and American base. But in the last decade transhumanists have become
far more culturally and politically diverse' (758), moving more toward
a liberal democratic focus.

    Looking over the Transhumanist Declaration (More & Vita-More, 2013)
and the recommitment to the Technoprogressive Declaration (Wood,
2017), I have attempted to distill a vision statement in order to capture the
fundamental goals of transhumanism and to make sure that the changes
to the philosophical foundations that I later suggest will only further
support, and not take away from, this vision. This vision disconnects any
necessary link to Enlightenment ideals. The vision of transhumanism I
propose is as follows: To reduce suffering, inequality, and premature death--
or more positively: to increase access to health, happiness, and longevity of all
humans and their environment--through the strategic use (including non-
use) of technology. I include the `environment' as an extension to some
of the more anthropocentric leanings of the declarations since, without
an environment there will be no human flourishing. I do not claim that
this vision would be unanimously agreeable to transhumanists, but I do
believe it captures much of the current positive intention behind the field.

        org/wiki/Extropian_principles).

4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  95

    Transhumanist discussions concerning near-term goals of improving
the human condition through technology can still be understood by many
outside the movement as being potentially beneficial. However, there are
also transhumanist discussions concerning more fantastical scenarios, such
as whole brain emulation, also referred to as mind uploading (Bostrom
2014; Kurzweil 2005, 2012; Moravec, 1988; Sandberg, 2013). This is the
concept that the brain could possibly be digitized, replacing the biological
neurons that are in an on or off state with a computerized/mechanical
replacement. The idea is that this process could possibly capture the
`mind' and consciousness of a person, making them no longer reliant
on a biological body. This potentially would allow their consciousness
to live almost indefinitely, or at least greatly enhance their lifespan, and
would qualify--at least in the minds of many--as a post-human. This also
ties into allowing for easier interstellar travel, allowing for humanity (or
post-humanity) to more easily move beyond the confines of the Earth and
reducing the existential risk for humans (Bostrom, 2013).

    There are others--like myself--who believe that there is no way
to separate the brain and the body; the mind exists in both entities
(Hayles, 1999; Varela et al., 1992). This concept of mind challenges the
transhumanists' desire to upload our minds into machines by scanning
our brains, and at the very least, would indicate the need to upload more
than just the brain (maybe a full body upload?). While there are other
extreme potentialities entertained by transhumanists, such as variations
on a singularity due to super intelligence that may or may not include
humans (Kurzweil, 2005), I keep my focus on the more practical near-
term goals and the relevancy to understanding the human subject.

                    Reactions to Transhumanism

As Francis Fukuyama says, `It is tempting to dismiss transhumanists
as some sort of odd cult, nothing more than science fiction taken too
seriously' (2004: 42). I, myself, have found it difficult at times not to
paint transhumanists in a reductive manner, one based more on the
early beginnings of transhumanism than on some of the current, more
reflective, dialogues that are taking place within the discipline. And yet,
96  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

as Fukuyama asks,6 `is the fundamental tenet of transhumanism--that
we will someday use biotechnology to make ourselves stronger, smarter,
less prone to violence, and longer-lived--really so outlandish?' (42).

    Transhumanists often claim to have to defend themselves against
strawman7 attacks. One can see this in various articles and rebuttals
throughout Gregory Hansell and William Grassie's (2011) book
on transhumanism and its critics. I myself have struggled with
reactionary tendencies while listening to some exuberant self-
described transhumanist discuss their--in my opinion--nearly
religious belief in the virtues of technological possibilities for human
enhancement. However, I have also had the pleasure of having
dialogues with transhumanists such as James Hughes, who I find to
be intelligent and articulate. In my opinion, Hughes gives many very
reasonable arguments for transhumanism, and he, too, has pointed
out internal conflicts within transhumanism connected with its ties to
the Enlightenment (2010a; 2010b).

    I believe that there are several reasons why people react against or
misunderstand ideas from transhumanists. Transhumanism's exuberance
towards technology and willingness to embrace long-term possibilities
like whole brain emulation can get in the way of some of its more
feasible goals and objectives. For some, the focus on mind uploading is
a distraction or red herring8 (Sorgner, 2019), and they believe the focus
should stay on the immediate future, working towards improving human
health, both mental and physical, and extending human lifespans.

    Another aspect that I believe works against transhumanism is the
tendency to present technology in a glossy, high-tech, marketing manner9
rather than grounded and situated, demonstrating both benefits and
constraints and highlighting the complexity involved with manipulating
living systems. Additionally, there is a tendency to be too focused on the
individual, which might be the most difficult to overcome. This focus on

  6Fukuyama's response to transhumanism was resoundingly negative, claiming the
        goals fundamentally threaten our human essence.

  7Philosophical strawmen arguments are arguments where the person criticizing a
        concept first defines the concept without providing all of the context or nuances,
        allowing them to easily identify flaws.

the exceptional individual has led some to indicate that transhumanism
is really `ultra-humanist' (Onishi, 2011: 103).

    Ihde (1990: 75-76) describes the concept of `technofantasy', where:

    I want the transformation that the technology allows, but I want it in such
    a way that I am basically unaware of its presence. I want it in such a way
    that it becomes me. Such a desire both secretly rejects what technologies
    are and overlooks the transformational effects, which are necessarily tied
    to human-technology relations.

Don Ihde (2011) links transhumanists with technofantasy and equates
the technofantasy to magic in the sense that new human enhancing
technologies are often portrayed without `ambiguous or unintended or
contingent consequences' (57). He also worries about the unpredictability
of these consequences `and the introduction of disruptions into an ever-
growing and more complex system' (60). Ihde's point is that we cannot
simply add technology to our lives without experiencing a transformative
change--one that enables and constrains (cf. Lewis, 2018). However, I
believe that the most fundamental flaw with certain transhumanists is the
focus on, and the near sanctity of, the standalone individual.

             A New Foundation for Transhumanism

Since the Enlightenment and rational humanism, the de facto basic
building block of our existence in the Western world has been the
individual, which literally means indivisible (OED online, 4th edition).
One way for transhumanists to `win' the human enhancement debate
against the bioconservatives is to stop trying to fit into the humanist
ideology. In a way, the human enhancement debate is a red herring,
as both sides come from a humanist standpoint. There is a need to
deterritorialize the human from the standalone individual humanist
subject. Figure 4.1 represents the move from a humanist view of the
autonomous individual to the relational foundation developed in chapter
three. In the humanist representation, Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man is inside
a bold circle, anchoring it to the Enlightenment view of the subject
who is self-sufficient, exceptional, and able to achieve enlightenment or
self-sustainability purely by `his' own abilities. Instead, my proposed
approach builds upon the idea of the subject as constituted through
relations.

The underlying issue is that, while transhumanism is a forward-looking
discipline, it is still tied to and hampered by its foundation in rational
humanist and Enlightenment concepts, dating back to the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries (Hughes, 2010a; More, 2013). While its goals
center on improving the human condition through contemporary and
future technologies, transhumanism would benefit by taking a critical
look into the philosophy it is built upon. As a discipline, it generally
views the world and the human condition as complicated but solvable,
allowing for an engineering approach to solve many of humanity's
issues (cf. Allenby & Sarewitz, 2011). While transhumanists have
had a more liberal (Sharon, 2014) attitude when it comes to using
technology to enhance our biological selves, they have still based their
approach on the sanctity of the individual. As Hughes (2010b) points
out, `transhumanists need to understand how the ideological conflicts
within transhumanism today are the product of these 300-year-old
conflicts within the Enlightenment' (para. 4).

    Transhumanism's best chance at improving the human population
globally is to move away from traditional humanism and begin to
embrace the complex posthumanist subject, which is based on the
contemporary amodern philosophies of philosophical posthumanism,
postphenomenology, and complexity theory. As Barad (2007: ix) states,

    To be entangled is not simply to be intertwined with another, as in the
    joining of separate entities, but to lack an independent, self-contained
    existence. Existence is not an individual affair. Individuals do not preexist
    their interactions; rather, individuals emerge through and as part of their
    entangled intra-relating.

Transhumanists represent the desire to go beyond any conservative
view of the human, to challenge who we are and explore avenues of
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  99

becoming something better. Transhumanism can leave humanism to
the bioconservatives and embrace more contemporary disciplines that
are better positioned to help fulfill transhumanist's goals. As Hughes
(2010a) points out, `Most transhumanists argue the Enlightenment case
for Reason without awaren­ ess of its self-undermining nature' (624).
Transhumanists would be better served by evolving their thinking,
adapting ideas from philosophical posthumanism, complexity, and
postphenomenology, moving from technological exuberance to a
reflexive and critical (though still affirmative) view on improving
humanity through the intentional and critical use of technologies.

    According to Samantha Frost (2016: 1),

    The characteristics, qualities, and capacities that heretofore have been
    taken to define and distinguish a human, humanity--the human--have
    been so profoundly discredited through historical, social, and scientific
    analysis that the notion itself seems to be bankrupt, with very little left
    to recommend it.

At the same time that we find it difficult to find a concise definition
of the human, we are also noting the effects humans have made on
the planet. We are, amongst other things, a force of nature as we are
beginning to take note, as indicated by naming our current geologic
age the Anthropocene (Lewis, 2018; Steffen et al., 2007, 2011).

    For transhumanists, the post-human is an evolutionary development
that will occur as we, through the use of technology, evolve into a
species that essentially is no longer human. This is radically different
from what the field of philosophical posthumanism defines it as. I use
posthuman to refer to a way of defining our selves as we are now (and
as we have been). It is an attempt to undermine the prevalent use of
the term `human' that is tenaciously linked to the Enlightenment and
rational humanist thinking: the concept of the human as a standalone,
exceptional individual. The time has come to decisively turn our backs
on the idealization of a perfect human speci-man and make the move
for inclusivity, diversity, and plurality. It is a posthumanist approach
that I will use in developing a way for understanding the effects of new

media technologies.
100  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

                   The Posthuman Subject

In this section, I describe the posthuman subject, one that is interrelational,
emergent, and complex. This is the co-constituted subject from Chapter 3,
and it is the foundational concept upon which the framework in Chapter
5 is constructed. The exploration of the posthuman subject has involved
many thinkers (cf. Adams & Thompson, 2016; Badmington, 2011; Barad,
2007; Braidotti, 2002, 2011, 2013, 2016a, 2016b; Ferrando, 2019; Gergen,
2009; Haraway, 1985, 2016; Hayles, 1999; Puech, 2016; Roden, 2014;
Wolfe, 2010), not all of whom use, or are comfortable using, the term
`posthuman'. While the previous section focused on what the human
subject is not (countering a humanist version), this section examines
what the posthuman is, and affirmatively embraces the concept as a way
to reterritorialize the human subject. Braidotti (2013) summarizes the
need for this new imagining of the subject by saying `we need to devise
new social, ethical and discursive schemes of subject formation to match
the profound transformation we are undergoing' (12).

       Historically Situating and Defining Posthumanism

In Cyborg Manifesto, Donna Haraway (1985) challenges the boundaries
of separation (animal/human, machine/human, male/female) and
instead petitions for hybridity by using the concept of the cyborg. This
is one of the foundational texts for posthumanism. Another significant
contribution to the field is N. Katherine Hayles (1999), How We Became
Posthuman. In this book, Hayles specifically takes on transhumanism's
desire of mind uploading and traces the movement back through to its
cybernetic roots, explaining how the disembodiment of information has
led transhumanists to believe that a separation of the mind and body is
possible. Karen Barad (2007: 136) explains posthumanism in opposition
to the traditional humanist approach:

    Posthumanism, as I intend it here, is not calibrated to the human; on
    the contrary, it is about taking issue with human exceptionalism while
    being accountable for the role we play in the differential constitution
    and differential positioning of the human among other creatures (both
    living and nonliving). [...] Posthumanism eschews both humanist and
    structuralist accounts of the subject that position the human as either pure
    cause or pure effect, and the body as the natural and fixed dividing line
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  101

    between interiority and exteriority. Posthumanism doesn't presume the
    separateness of any-`thing,' let alone the alleged spatial, ontological, and
    epistemological distinction that sets humans apart. The posthumanist
    subject eschews binaries such as human/nature, nature/culture. It also
    resists the concept of an exceptional and essential self.

Rosi Braidotti (2002, 2011, 2013) has been highly influential in the field
of posthumanism with her Metamorphoses, Nomadic Theory, and what is
now the classic text of posthumanism, The Posthuman. Braidotti (2013)
states, `I find [posthuman] useful as a term to explore ways of engaging
affirmatively with the present, accounting for some of its features in
a manner that is empirically grounded without being reductive and
remains critical while avoiding negativity' (5). This affirmative criticism,
one that does not fall into postmodernism or nihilism, looks for positive
ways of becoming. `The strength of posthuman critical thought [...]
is in providing a frame for affirmative ethics and politics' (Braidotti,
2016a: 23). Michel Foucault's (1970) `death of man'10 (­373) offers the
opportunity for a new approach for human becomings and is seen as an
opportunity rather than a loss.

    Employing an affirmative critical outlook allows one to acknowledge
the very real current inequities and problems and then to implement
creative and positive potential responses. `The selection of the affective
forces that propel the process of becoming posthuman is regulated by an
ethics of joy and affirmation that functions through the transformation of
negative into positive passions' (Braidotti, 2016a: 26). Francis Ferrando
(2019: 187) neatly summarizes posthumanism as,

    the philosophy of our age. The posthumanization of society is happening.
    Even if anthropocentric and dichotomic tendencies are still regarded as
    the norm, a growing number of beings are becoming aware for the need
    of a paradigm shift, and are thus revisiting old concepts and new values
    from a different perspective, bringing together post-humanist, post-
    anthropocentric, and post-dualistic insights.

Postphenomenology and posthumanism have many similarities. They
are anti-essentialist and relational, concentrating on situated and
embodied beings-in-the-world. Both are amodern, avoiding Cartesian
dualism and the idea of an autonomous and independent individual.

  10See also Han-Pile (2010).
102  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

The subject is perceived not as static but a process, constantly being
constituted through its relations. And in general, while both conceive
of the entanglement and co-constitutionality of subjects and objects,
postphenomenology directs its focus primarily on technologies while
posthumanism concentrates more on understanding the subject. As
many amodern--neither modern nor postmodern--schools of thought11
believe, the individual is never an autonomous, standalone entity, but
one that is always in, and being constituted by, relations. Kenneth Gergen
(2009) states, `there is no isolated self or fully private experience. Rather,
we exist in a world of co-constitution' (xv).

    Braidotti (2016a) writes about the `posthuman turn' in philosophy
and describes `an explosion of scholarship on nonhuman, inhuman and
posthuman issues' (13). Ferrando (2013) identifies various types of
posthumanism: critical, cultural, and philosophical.12 Recently, Ferrando
discusses philosophical posthumanism (2019), which is the posthuman
area most attuned with my focus. While there is no agreement on a
single definition for the term `posthuman', I follow Ferrando's (2019)
description for philosophical posthumanism, which is post-humanist,
post-anthropocentric, and post-dualist. According to Ferrando, `these
three aspects should be addressed in conjunction, which means an
account based on a philosophical posthumanist approach shall have a
posthumanist sensitivity as well as a post-anthropocentric and a post-
dualistic one' (54). This inclusive definition with the three aspects is
how I use the terms posthuman or posthumanism throughout the book.

    Looking more closely at the three aspects, a post-humanist approach
(one that is beyond or after a humanist approach) should be fairly
clear after covering the humanist ideas in the previous section. The
second aspect, a post-anthropocentric approach, discusses the human
as removed from the center of all things and the exceptionalism that

  11For example: complexity theory, actor-network theory, or postphenomenology.
  12Ferrando (2013) states, `(T)he posthuman turn was fully enacted by feminist

        theorists in the Nineties, within the field of literary criticism--what will later be
        defined as critical posthumanism. Simultaneously, cultural studies also embraced
        it, producing a specific take which has been referred to as cultural posthumanism.
        By the end of the 1990s (critical and cultural) posthumanism developed into a more
        philosophically focused inquiry (now referred to as philosophical posthumanism),
        in a comprehensive attempt to re-access each field of philosophical investigation
        through a newly gained awareness of the limits of previous anthropocentric and
        humanistic assumptions' (29).
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  103

has surrounded this idea since the Enlightenment. There is some
irony in discussing the human in a post-anthropocentric way when we
so recently have claimed to be now in a new geologic age called the
Anthropocene (Lewis, 2018). However, the Anthropocene focuses on
the effects we have had on the planet, not our place in it.

    And the third aspect, post-binary, refutes a modernist, mechanistic,
reductivist, or positivist worldview, which often approach the world
in terms of dualisms or binaries: nature/culture, humans/others,
agency/determinism, mind/body, etc. Instead of an either/or mentality,
Braidotti (2016b) describes using `and ... and' as a more inclusive choice
(31). Ferrando (2019) further explains, `The posthuman destabilizes the
limits and symbolic borders posed by the notion of the human. Dualisms
such as human/animal, human/machine, and more in general, human/
nonhuman are re-investigated through a perception which does not
work on oppositional schemata' (5; cf. Haraway, 1985).

    Braidotti's (2013) research is strongly connected with Gilles Deleuze
and Félix Guattari (1988) and builds upon feminist and post-colonialist
work, specifically focusing on the interrelatedness of all life--including
the human--within a vast living network. Posthumanism calls for a
move away from the reductive, atomistic, rational-science mentality
that attempts to understand the whole by breaking things down to
its parts, and towards a productive and generative philosophy, which
includes building relations and interdependencies that actually reflect
the complexities of life.

    In general, posthumanists are affirmative of life, believe in the
importance of de-centering the human, and approach the world with
a holistic and interrelated perspective. We are situated and embodied
beings, taking ownership by acknowledging our own background and
being honestly open to others. This involves the larger situatedness of
being a part of the sixth mass extinction on the planet (Cafaro, 2015)
and understanding that it is in our own best interest to attempt to have
a positive effect on this situation. We are also situated in the fourth
industrial revolution (Schwab, 2017), where technologies for most, but
not all, of the humans in the world have a dramatically increased role to
play. And while not all of us may be directly affected by this technological
revolution, we are all affected by the current mass extinction that is
happening.
104  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

                         The Dance of Agency

Reconceptualizing the individual involves reconceptualizing agency.
As discussed in Chapter 3, postphenomenology13 makes the case that
our relations with technological objects are non-neutral and share in a
portion of agency. Even before any physical convergence of technology
and human, relational disciplines within philosophy of technology have
been describing how agency, which primarily remained in the domain
of the modern humanist subject, is actually shared with technological
objects. The most elegant phrasing I found for the concept of shared
agency--which is similar to postphenomenology's concept of non-
neutrality--is Andrew Pickering's (2005) dance of agency. Pickering
describes how there is a `temporal emergence' (35, italics in original),
where the posthuman object,

    does not display the atemporal regularities that physics, ecology or
    sociology like to look for [...]. This shift exposes a genuine posthuman
    object which lies [...] along at least two axes: it is a unity that spans what
    are usually held apart -- the human and the non-human--and this unity
    is essentially temporal: the coupling of the human and the non-human is
    situated in time, in the dance of agency.

Posthumanism attempts to unlearn the gestalt of the individual.
However, an either/or mentality might assume that if we are not
individuals, then we may lose our free will, potentially becoming
Borg-like,14 determined beings (Liberati, 2018). Throughout this book
I attempt to avoid the binary choice of either/or, preferring to use an
`and ... and' approach (cf. Braidotti, 2016b: 31), which allows us to be
positioned between determinism and agency (cf. Fig. 4.2). The fictional
`Borg' are interrelational, but--for the `drones'--with little to no agency.
We our selves are made up of thousands upon thousands of relations,
yet we still retain some agency. Relations are dynamic, coming into
existence as we move through both space and time and increase or
decrease in influence, depending upon the interplay of other relations
(cf. Chapter 5).

  13Others also make this case, for example, Bruno Latour (1987) and actor-network
        theorists.

  14The Borg are a fictional alien race--from the Star Trek series--where all the `drones'
        are connected to the collective mind and have no individual agency (Consalvo,
        2004).
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  105

             Fig. 4.2 The Middle Path of Agency. Image by author (2020), CC BY 4.0.

As Gergen (2009) notes, `The attempt in this case is to reconfigure
agency in such a way that we [...] bring relationship into the center
of our concerns. By viewing agency as an action within relationship,
we move in exactly this direction' (82). Through awareness we can
increase our agency and affect the different relations we are in.15 As
Foucault (Foucault et al., 1987) points out, `these relationships of
power are changeable relations, i.e., they can modify themselves, they
are not given once and for all' (123). We cannot choose not to be in
certain relations, such as the power of discipline in society (Foucault,
1995), but we do have a certain amount of agency in how we interact
with that power. And, the more we are aware of the relationships that
affect us, the more likely it is to increase our agency. Christian Ehret
and Daniella D'Amico (2019) sum this up nicely stating, `Agency is
therefore not a matter of human power over the world, but of nonhuman
and human bodies' emergent capacities to affect and to be affected as
becoming part of the world' (148).

        Individual to Interdividual to Human Becomings

While the idea of being an individual is compelling and, for some, self-
evident, this view is becoming more problematic. Bruno Latour (1993)
makes the case that we have never been a modern standalone person
and, `So long as humanism is constructed through contrast with the
object that has been abandoned to epistemology, neither the human nor
the nonhuman can be understood' (136). Here Latour is deriding the
practice of perceiving objects as only epistemological `things' that do not
play an agential role. Instead, Latour (1987, 1993) seeks to understand

  15See Chapter 2, section `Education, Literacy, Agency' and Chapter 3, section
        `Technological Determinism and Agency'.
106  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

the human in a symmetrical way with the other non-human `actants' in
the world all possessing a certain degree of agency.

    What is needed is a gestalt change in our conception of our selves
as individuals. Braidotti (2013) states, `Individualism is not an intrinsic
part of "human nature", as liberal thinkers are prone to believe, but
rather a historically and culturally specific discursive formation, one
which, moreover, is becoming increasingly problematic' (24). The
specific language we use is important in how the understanding of the
human subject is conceived. Terms such as `human' and `individual'
carry a historicity that is entangled with hundreds, if not thousands, of
years (Han-Pile, 2010).

    One approach is to use new terms or neologisms in order to bypass
this issue, though this also is not ideal, especially if the new term is
not easily understood and resists adoption into the lexicon of the
society it aims to improve. For instance, René Girard (1978) uses the
term `interdividual'. We are not individuals with various relations, but
rather it is the relations that constitute us as `interdividuals'. Chris
Fleming (2004), describes Girard's concept of the interdividual as being
`constituted, at base, by its interactions with others. "Individuality" then,
strictly speaking, doesn't exist -- it is always already "interdividuality"'
(36). However, so far there is not much widespread usage of the term.

    The dance of agency and co-constitution of the subject through its
relations can be brought together in what Pickering (2010) calls an
`ontology of becoming'16 (30). Describing our selves thus moves away
from the static implication of a `human being', and some researchers
are now using the term `human becomings' (cf. Ingold, 2013; Zylinska,
2009) in order to enact a gestalt shift on how we perceive our selves. For
Braidotti (2002), `the point is not to know who we are, but rather what,
at last, we want to become, how to represent mutations, changes and
transformations, rather than Being in its classical modes' (2).

    Braidotti's (2011) concept of nomadic subjectivity also pushes against
the concept of an essential and static subject. In her Nomadic Theory,
Braidotti investigates the structure of subjectivity (2011: 66), exploring
ideas such as becoming animal, becoming earth, or becoming machine.
We are always emergent, changing, a process of continual becoming.

  16Ihde (2009: 44) similarly discusses an interrelational ontology where humans and
        their technologies are co-constituted.
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  107

Our relations are never static and vary highly in their influence upon us,
each changing as we our selves change.

    Barad (2007: 139, italics in original) approaches the idea of becoming
through her concept of intra-action:

    The notion of intra-action (in contrast to the usual `interaction,' which
    presumes the prior existence of independent entities or relata)
    represents a profound conceptual shift. It is through specific agential
    intra-actions that the boundaries and properties of the components of
    phenomena become determinate and that particular concepts (that is,
    particular material articulations of the world) become meaningful...
    rather, phenomena are the ontological inseparability/entanglement of intra-
    acting `agencies'.

In other words, subjects and objects emerge--become--through their
relation as discussed in Chapter 3 (see Fig. 3.1).

    Continuing in the interdisciplinary17 spirit, certain researchers in
contemporary anthropology have also begun using the concept of
becoming; specifically, Tim Ingold and Gísli Pálsson's (2013) book on
Biosocial Becomings. In that book, Ingold (2013: 20) writes that we need to

    think of humanity not as a fixed and given condition but as a relational
    achievement. It requires us to think of evolution not as change along lines
    of descent but as the developmental unfolding of the entire matrix of
    relations within which forms of life (human and non-human) emerge
    and are held in place. And it requires us to think of these forms as neither
    genetically nor culturally configured but as emergent outcomes of the
    dynamic self-organization of developmental systems.

In summary, `there is the shift away from an epistemological theory
or representation to an ontology of becoming' (Braidotti, 2011: 214).
Another way of framing this is by using the concept of multistability

  17Other philosophers have also stressed the aspect of becoming, as can be understood
        through Henri Bergson's (1965) understanding of time as duration (flow) rather
        than a fixity or instant. It also is similar to Heidegger's (as cited in Sheehan,
        2014) notion of thrown-openness of ex-sistence, `the always-already-operative
        "unfolding" (Zeitigung)' or emergence of being (266). And, `The characteristic
        property of a duration is termed "unison of becoming"' (Whitehead, 1978: 126).
        Stengers (2008) explains, `What Whitehead calls a subject is the very process of
        the becoming together, of becoming one and being enjoyed as one, of a many that
        are initially given as stemming from elsewhere' (103). This continual process of
        becoming for the subject fits within posthumanism's concept of exploring an ethics
        of becoming (Braidotti, 2013).
108  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

from postphenomenology. However, rather than the multistability of an
object, we can use it to conceptualize the multistability of the subject.
This fits nicely into the idea that we are not one stable thing. On the
contrary, we are always becoming, changing moment to moment. We
nurture a way of perceiving the self in multiple ways, moving beyond
any single understanding. By undermining the idea of a stable subject,
we open up space, allowing the posthuman subject room to become.

                          Complexity:

     The Key to Understanding Human Becomings

The key to reterritorializing the human subject to the posthuman
subject is through the concept of complexity. Complexity is an inclusive
approach that focuses on a system's interrelationality rather than
trying to understand a system by reducing it to its components. The
section in Chapter 3 on media ecology briefly introduced complexity. In
this section I discuss complexity in more depth, highlighting concepts
that are fundamental to creating the framework in Chapter 5, thereby
helping to situate the complex interrelationality of media.

    There are various overlapping terms that describe or use complexity
theory, some of which include: chaos theory, cybernetics, non-linear
dynamics, general systems theory, quantum mechanics, and non-linear
(or complex) adaptive systems. The approach to complexity that I use is
a continental approach, similar to Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers'
works (1984, 1997), rather than the more analytic approach of the Santa
Fe Institute (Mitchell, 2009)--or what Edgar Morin (2007) calls restricted
complexity. The continental view approaches complexity more critically.
`This view argues that complexity theory does not provide us with exact
tools to solve our complex problems, but shows us (in a rigorous way)
exactly why these problems are so difficult' (Cilliers, 2005: 257).

    Posthumanist researchers often bring up issues of complexity.
Braidotti (2013) states, `Nomadic subjectivity is the social branch of
complexity theory' (87). Her concept of the nomadic subject equates
with the posthuman subject, one that is not constrained by geographies
(physical or mental), but rather is constantly becoming and interrelated
with the world. This interrelation with the world is at the forefront of
the question Hayles (1995) poses: `What happens if we begin from
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  109

the premise not that we know reality because we are separate from it
(traditional objectivity), but that we can know the world because we
are connected with it?' (48). Complexity theory describes open systems
that are fluid and autopoietic (self-organizing and generative). They are
in a state of tension between chaos and stasis, described as being in non-
linear equilibrium. They do not always respond in a linear cause and
effect manner, which makes future states of being almost impossible to
predict. However, in complex systems, the more diverse relations there
are in the system, the more resilient the system often is.

                        Situating Complexity

Complexity is a critical shift in comprehending the nature of
interrelationality and opposes some of the main assumptions of
modernity. While complexity is a common thread that runs through
media ecology and posthumanism, it is generally not articulated
specifically in a way that foregrounds its traits (some exceptions in
media ecology are Logan, 2015; Qvortrup, 2006; and in posthumanism
Barad, 2007; Hayles, 1999; Roden, 2014). Complexity has roots in
quantum mechanics, directly challenging the classical Newtonian
mechanics, which focused on objective truth, linear causality, and clear
divisions between humans and their world.

    Hayles (1990, 1991) has written about chaos and complexity. Hayles
(2014: 204-5) uses complexity with regard to human subjectivity in the
following:

    The same faculty that makes us aware of ourselves as selves also partially
    blinds us to the complexity of the biological, social, and technological
    systems in which we are embedded, tending to make us think we are the
    most important actors and that we can control the consequences of our
    actions and those of other agents.

Braidotti (2002: 8) employs complexity in the concept of nomadic
becomings, where she has sought `a style of thinking that adequately
reflects the complexities of the process itself'. And Barad (2007)
suggests that complexity fundamentally alters our perception from
being autonomous, humanist subjects to beings constituted in our intra-
relations. According to Barad, `Intentionality might better be understood
as attributable to a complex network of human and nonhuman agents,
110  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

including historically specific sets of material conditions that exceed the
traditional notion of the individual' (23).

                          Complex or Complicated?

The social sciences are now occasionally using complexity in order to
analyze societies and social relations (Byrne & Callaghan, 2014; Turner
& Baker, 2019; Urry, 2003, 2005a, 2005b, 2007). While in some research
there is a very rigorous definition of complexity that is adhered to, in
others the term `complexity' is used in a manner that leaves it ambiguous
and loosely defined (if it is defined at all). Sometimes it is used in a way
that would better be served by the adjective `complicated'.

    For example, in postphenomenology Ihde (1990) uses complexity as
it is meant in complexity theory when he states `multistability also may
be seen in human-technology relations and even more strongly in the
complexities of technology-culture gestalts' (146). However, in the same
book, Technology and the Lifeworld, he occasionally uses complex when
referring to complicated technologies. For instance, he refers to kidney
dialysis machines as `large, complex, very expensive to operate, and of
limited quantity' (178).

    Roberto Poli (2013: 142) succinctly describes the difference between
complicated and complex systems thus:

    Complicated problems originate from causes that can be individually
    distinguished; they can be addressed piece by piece; for each input to
    the system there is a proportionate output; the relevant systems can be
    controlled and the problems they present admit permanent solutions.
    On the other hand, complex problems and systems result from networks
    of multiple interacting causes that cannot be individually distinguished;
    must be addressed as entire systems, that is they cannot be addressed
    in a piecemeal way; they are such that small inputs may result in
    disproportionate effects; the problems they present cannot be solved once
    and for ever, but require to be systematically managed and typically any
    intervention merges into new problems as a result of the interventions
    dealing with them; and the relevant systems cannot be controlled.

To put this another way, complicated systems are closed systems that
can be engineered and (mostly) controlled in situations where there is
a good possibility of accurately predicting causal outcomes. Sending a
rover to Mars is an example of a complicated system that responds very
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  111

well to controlled engineering. However, living systems, such as the
human subject, are complex systems, which are open systems comprised
of interrelating and constituting parts that are in a state of non-linear
equilibrium, causing constant and irreversible emergence while nested
within--and nesting their own--complex systems. While we have a
significant amount of control in complicated systems, we have far less
ability to control complex systems. Ecological and biological sciences
now often embrace complexity in how they model living systems (Smith
& Jenks, 2006).

                         Connections, not Divisions

Complexity focuses on connections rather than divisions. Morin
(2007) points out, `Since we have been domesticated by our education
which taught us much more to separate than to connect, our aptitude
for connecting is underdeveloped and our aptitude for separating
is overdeveloped' (21). The concept of complexity helps provide a
posthuman lens for media literacy, where constituting media relations
are situated within the complexity of interrelations in our lives.
Complexity aids our ability to focus on both the whole system and the
parts that make up the system, without losing sight of either. Rather
than approaching situations by reducing and dividing in order to gain
understanding, Barad (2007) argues for using a diffractive approach, one
that is, `attuned to the entanglement of the apparatuses of production,
one that enables genealogical analyses of how boundaries are produced
rather than presuming sets of well-worn binaries in advance' (29-30; see
also Mazzei, 2014).

    Understanding complexity helps realign assumptions concerning
both what we can know and how things are. This brings together both
ontology and epistemology. Barad (2007) supports this combining,
saying:

    We don't obtain knowledge by standing outside the world; we
    know because we are of the world. We are part of the world in its
    differential becoming. The separation of epistemology from ontology
    is a reverberation of a metaphysics that assumes an inherent difference
    between human and nonhuman, subject and object, mind and body,
    matter and discourse. Onto-epistem-ology--the study of practices of
    knowing in being--is probably a better way to think about the kind of
112  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    understandings that we need to come to terms with how specific intra-
    actions matter. (185)

Rather than using complexity as a theory, I am using it as an onto-
epistemological (practice of knowing in being) foundation in order to
create the posthuman approach. Using complexity is a way of perceiving
the interconnections of things, rather than a separating or reducing
systems down in order to find invariants or essences. It is about seeking
the constituting linkages of relationality instead of reducing in order
to identify. This helps gather the constitutive relations of the human
subject into a useful framework that allows us to situate, illuminate, and
reflect upon our human becoming-ness, primarily with regard to media
technology relations.

                Complex Concepts for Framework

Complexity itself is difficult to reduce down into clear and separate
concepts, as the various aspects of complexity interact and affect each
other. However, I identify three main interconnected concepts from
complexity theory that are used to reframe the human subject: open
systems, non-linearity, and emergence. These three concepts are useful
for understanding the framework I develop.

                          Open and Nested Systems

Understanding complexity is facilitated through the understanding
of two types of systems: open and closed. Open systems are complex
and closed systems are complicated (or simple). Fritjof Capra (2002)
explains, `At all scales of nature, we find living systems nesting within
other living systems--networks within networks' (231). These complex
open systems are nested within larger complex environments, where
they exchange matter and energy. While complex systems are bounded
in some manner, their boundaries are permeable, and they `are not
boundaries of separation but boundaries of identity. All living systems
communicate with one another and share resources across their
boundaries' (Capra, 2002: 231).

    Understanding that complex systems can be nested within other
complex systems helps to provide context. According to Capra (1996: 37),
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  113

    The properties of the parts are not intrinsic properties but can be
    understood only within the context of the larger whole. Thus systems
    thinking is `contextual' thinking; and since explaining things in terms of
    their context means explaining them in terms of their environment, we
    can also say that all systems thinking is environmental thinking.

This is similar to the aspect of domestication theory I discussed in
Chapter 2, where Maren Hartmann (2006) points out how the complex
context makes the actual application of the domestication theory very
difficult. I develop the framework in order to specifically help in this
regard.

                          Non-Linear Equilibrium

One of the founding voices in complexity theory, Nobel Laureate
Ilya Prigogine (Prigogine & Stengers, 1984, 1997), calls complex
systems `dissipative structures'. The traits of these structures are the
irreversibility of time (complex systems change and can never be
returned to an original condition) and probability (unpredictability).
The irreversibility of time counters the classical Newtonian model that
upholds the idea that time is reversible.

    This notion counters the classic linear cause and effect idea stemming
from Newtonian mechanics (Barad, 2007; Hayles, 1991). Rather than
rational causality (cause and effect being relatively equal), complexity
places relations in non-linear equilibrium where predictability no longer
applies, replaced by probabilities. Non-linear equilibrium enables the
possibility of small changes having large effects.18 Yet, the reverse is also
true: large changes can have very little effect on a system. Complexity is
not unstructured chaos where no relations exist, but rather a tremendous
number of relations all interrelating.

    Complex systems are in a state of non-linear equilibrium, kept there
through the input of energy and material from outside the system, as well
as `waste' that leaves the system. Capra (2005) states, `A living organism
is an open system that maintains itself in a state far from equilibrium,
and yet is stable: the same overall structure is maintained in spite of an

  18This is often referred to as the butterfly effect, where under specific initial conditions,
        the air movement from a butterfly's wing can potentially cause a tornado a great
        distance away (Lorenz, 1972).
114  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

ongoing flow and change of components' (37). This interrelational non-
linearity leads systems to be self-generating.

                   Emergence, Resilience, and Sympoiesis

Because these open systems are in an interrelational state of non-linear
equilibrium, they self-organize without a guiding organizer. This is
most commonly known as autopoiesis, which is a quality of all living
complex systems (Capra, 1996). Citing Humberto Maturana and
Francisco Varela's (1972) essay that first defined autopoiesis, Capra
(1996) explains that auto `means "self" and refers to the autonomy of
self-organizing systems; and poiesis--which shares the same Greek root
as the word "poetry"--means "making." So autopoiesis means "self-
making"' (97). Melanie Mitchell (2009) describes `systems in which
organized behavior arises without an internal or external controller
or leader are sometimes called self-organizing. Since simple rules
produce complex behavior in hard-to-predict ways, the macroscopic
behavior of such systems is sometimes called emergent' (13). Other
ways to describe this aspect that have been used are `generative' and
`adaptable'.

    Haraway (2016), however, prefers using the term `sympoiesis'
rather than autopoiesis. According to Haraway, `Sympoiesis is a simple
word; it means "making-with." Nothing makes itself; nothing is really
autopoietic or self-organizing. [...] Sympoiesis enfolds autopoiesis and
generatively unfurls and extends it' (58). Ferrando (2019) concurs,
saying of autopoiesis that it `does not seem to take enough into account
[of] all the necessary relations and exchanges that occur between the
organism and the environment' (141).

    While complex systems are not organized from outside the
system (being self-organized), they do respond to outside influences.
The resilience of a system is how it is able to adapt to these outside
disturbances and still retain its identity. In complex ecosystems, it has
been shown that the more diversity that a complex system has, the more
likely it is to be able to be resilient in the face of perturbations (Folke,
2006; Levin, 1998). Discussing the principles of ecology, Capra (2002)
states, `Ecosystems achieve stability and resilience through the richness
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  115

and complexity of their ecological webs. The greater their biodiversity,
the more resilient they will be' (231).

    Paul Cilliers (2005) explains, `Complex systems are not balanced
on a knife's edge between chaos and order. They have mostly robust
structures, which change over time and enable the system to respond
to different circumstances' (264). These important concepts of open
and non-linear emergent systems are part of the foundation for creating
the framework in Chapter 5. However, before moving to the actual
framework there are a couple aspects to note concerning technology and
complexity.

                    Complexity and Technology

There are two aspects of technology that intersect with complexity. The
first aspect is that traditional technologies can be primarily perceived as
closed systems, which can be complicated but do not often count as being
complex. These are technological artifacts, bounded and engineered.
But once these technologies are nested or merged within complex
systems--such as embedding a technology within the human body--
we lose an aspect of control, reducing predictability to probability as
to the effects those technologies cause. For example, the printing press
itself is a closed technological system. However, when implementing it
within sociocultural environments, it affects them in complex ways.

    The second aspect is that there are some types of technologies that
are moving away from being closed, complicated systems and qualifying
as new complex systems (see Fig. 4.3). AI (artificial intelligence) and
machine learning exemplify this idea; we no longer control and write
specific code but rather let machine learning do it sympoietically. We are
developing true black box technology, where in some cases we can no
longer pinpoint how a specific decision or answer is reached. This goes
in the opposite direction of the transhumanists who want to upload
their consciousness into machines. Their desire can be understood as
a desire to have more control over the complexities of biological living
systems by housing a person's consciousness in a more controllable
`closed' mechanical system (see Fig. 4.3).
116  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

Quantum computing is also another move away from complicated
closed systems and into the realm of complex open systems. The
standard computer `bit' is replaced in quantum computing with
quantum bits--or `qubits', which `can assume multiple states
simultaneously, rather than simply representi­ng a 0 or 1, as bits do in
classical computing' (Castelvecchi, 2017: 59). Google recently claimed
to have reached `quantum supremacy' using a quantum computer with
53 qubits (Arute et al., 2019). Frank Arute et al. ran an experiment that
complete a calculation in 200 seconds, where a `state-of-the-art classical
supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years' (505). At the
time of writing, quantum computing has not fully arrived, but it appears
to be just over the horizon (Gyongyosi & Imre, 2019).

               Summarizing the Complex Posthuman Subject

As Braidotti (2013) notes, humanist ideas are tenacious and not easily
moved away from (cf. 26-30). The concept of the ideal, exceptional,
autonomous individual human is deeply rooted in the minds of many
individuals in the Western world. Even if we ontologically understand
how we are relational beings, entangled and co-constituted by the
things and the world around us, we still inherently have a sense of our
individuality or separateness from the world of things (Van Den Eede,
2015a).

    Hayles (1991) explains that the greatest implication of understanding
complexity is `not in how the world actually is [...] but how it is seen' (8).
This change in perception helps to re-envision the human subject from an
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  117

autonomous individual to a continually becoming interrelational being
through co-constituting relations (cf. Fig. 4.3). The idea of complexity
as a foundation for how we exist in the world undermines the modern
mindset of an individual being living in a linearly causal world, replacing
it with the concept of a complex and interrelated becoming. As Pickering
(2011) states, `The self, as revealed here, turns out to be inexhaustibly
emergent, just like the world--the antithesis of the given human essence
of the Enlightenment and cybernetic immortality' (86).

    The concept of complexity shifts the gestalt from the individual
subject to the complex and multistable posthuman subject. We are
always and already in relation, not only with other humans but also with
technologies and the world. My mind does not solely exist in isolation
in my body; my mind is in relation with the world around me. These
relations are complex, situated, dynamic, and emergent. How these
relations influence me continually changes. Even the ability to bring my
awareness to a particular relation can affect the amount of influence the
relation has on me.

                    Concluding Thoughts

Posthumanism, complexity theory, and postphenomenology all
­f­­ocus on the interrelatedness of existence, the notion that there is no
standalone individual. This is a powerful concept that helps steer our
understanding away from reductionist thinking toward thinking in
terms of inclusive and interrelated systems. This mindset is not only
helpful when thinking about using technologies to improve or `fix'
something, including our selves, but also when we invite new types of
media into our lives. According to Sharon (2014: 135),

    The human being is conceptualized here not as an independent and
    autonomous entity with clear cut boundaries but as a heterogeneous
    subject whose self-definition is continuously shifting, and that exists in a
    complex network of human and non-human agents and the technologies
    that mediate between them.

A common issue in research is a too-narrow focus on a limited number of
influencing relations. Instead, we exist within a complexity of relations,
most of which exist in the background of our awareness (where they
still have an effect upon us). Rather than one or two determining
118  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

factors in our lives there is a complexity of influencing relations: social,
technological, temporal, and spatial. This network of relations is a living
web in that it is dynamic and ever changing. Each relation increasing or
decreasing its influence depends upon a multitude of factors, not least,
our own awareness of the relation. While we are mostly, but not always,
in a stable equilibrium, this equilibrium is not static, but is constantly
evolving as we move through time.

    We are complex systems (ecosystems), greater than the sum of
our parts. We exist, or are nested, within greater complex systems, not
discreetly, but as entangled and co-constituting. This chapter has moved
the focus from media and technology towards the concept of the human
subject, and in order to understand how media and technology affect
`us', we need an understanding of who and what the `us' actually is.

    The approach for most transhumanists is to perceive technology--
and our selves--as complicated but understandable and `engineerable'.
Their primary desire is to use technology to enhance and improve the
human condition, pushing back against old age and disease, in order
to bootstrap the individual into an enhanced version of their idealized
self. Their desire is for the human-technology convergence to bring
the understandability and controllability into the realm of life itself.
Unfortunately, we are not complicated, but complex beings. And, to quote
an acute insight from businessman Dave Gray (2009), `When you make
the complicated simple, you make it better. When you make the complex
simple, you make it wrong' (n.p.). In order to create a more accurate
understanding of how technology and living systems relate, we need
to reframe the foundation of the human subject from the standalone
autonomous individual to an inter-related and complex post-humanist
subject.

    The term of `technofantasy', as defined by Ihde (2011), refers to the
idea that we want the benefits of technology without being changed.
This ignores the non-neutral aspect of technologies, which bring
both benefits and drawbacks. Since we are fundamentally relational,
we change any time one of our relations change. By overcoming this
technofantasy attitude, we become more realistic in our expectations
of our relations with technologies. Every technological relation is
transformative, both enabling and constraining. Invited or not, every
time a technology enters our lives we are irreversibly changed. The idea
4. The Posthuman: Situating the Subject in Human-Tech Relations  119

of the irreversibility of time, coming from complexity theory, also helps
in our understanding by removing the idea that we can undo some
experiment that did not work out. While we might be able to undo some
aspects of the experiment, we cannot completely return to the way we
were.

    The idea of the complex posthuman subject helps bring a relational
and inclusive perspective rather than one that is individual and reductive;
an understanding that living systems are complex systems that do not
necessarily respond in a predictive manner; and a more realistic and
grounded understanding of non-neutrality of technology. We can and
should use technology to help improve our lives, but we should go
about it in an inclusive, interrelated, and pragmatic manner. Given this
post-humanist, non-dualist, non-anthropocentric, and complex human
becoming, I offer a situating and comprehensive framework in the next
chapter in order to understand the interrelational constitution of such a
human subject. I suggest a cartography, not to prescribe or dissect the
relations into separate and discrete categories, but as a way to take a
particular situation--say a media-related event--and probe the various
groupings of relations in order to uncover and foreground some of the
complex interrelations that contribute to the human subject's becoming.

5. Developing the Intrasubjective
      Mediating Framework

Simply put, before we can truly achieve media literacy, we need to be
self-literate. This involves moving beyond the `content' of who we are
and becoming knowledgeable as to what and how we are as a complex
system. The `what' can be understood as the structure or cartography of
relations that constitute our selves and the `how' is the complex process
of our mediated constitution. Both give rise to a system of becoming that
is continually emergent and complex. Media technologies are a part of
this process and are also affected by--and affect--the other constituting
relations in our lives. In order to comprehensively understand and
situate media literacy, I develop a two-part posthuman approach that
consists of 1) an intrasubjective mediating framework developed in
this chapter1 along with 2) a pragmatic instrument that leverages the
framework in Chapter 6.

    This process of situating is a means of providing context, and as
Anthony Wilden (1980) states, `if there is one constantly recurring
question for a critical and ecosystemic viewpoint, it is the real and
material question of context' (xxix). I first describe the process of how
we intra-relate with the world through the transformations caused by
the various relations in our lives. I then create a simple structure that
brings these constituting relations into six groupings: technological,

  1Parts of this chapter overlap with the chapter I wrote (Lewis, 2020) for the book

124  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

sociocultural, mind, body, space, and time. And finally, I describe how
both structure and process are involved in an interrelating dance of
complexity.

    The co-constituting technological relation from postphenomenology
--described as I-technology-world (Ihde, 1990)--is leveraged in this
chapter to also include groups of relations beyond the technological.
The focus is on the continual transformation of the human subject
through all of the relations that influence the subject and the subject's
experiences in its lifeworld. Because the focus is on the constitution of the
`I' component, the constitution of the `world' component of the equation
is only indirectly addressed, not because it is not important, but only
because a primary focus on how the world is constituted through this
process is outside the scope of this book.

    Discussing the complexity of structures and processes, Tim Ingold
(2013; see also Grishakova, 2019; Rubin, 1988) points out that there are
two different approaches. One approach is to have a complex structure
and a simple process. In this scenario, the complex structure determines
the process of the system, and the process simply follows the rules
dictated by the structure. This creates a situation with little to no free
will and follows the structuralist and determinist schools of thought.
Instead, I follow Ingold's recommendation and use a simple structure
that relies on complex processes, leading to the emergence of the human
becoming.

    We are not simply aggregates of all of our relations added together.
Instead, our constituting relations interrelate in an emergent dance
of complexity. These relations enable and constrain each other in
unpredictable ways. By understanding our selves as these complex
systems of becoming, we are better able to situate specific relations--
such as with media technologies--into the broader whole.

  Situating the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework

One way to position an argument in philosophy is by using difference,
a negative approach showing what something is by illustrating how it is
not like something else. This often follows a reductive approach that uses
binary oppositions. Rather than using this negative approach, I use a
positive and inclusive approach, looking for similarities to what already
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   125

exists in various research fields and then bringing them together in a
comprehensive and situating framework. The bringing together of many
fields of research into one framework helps to leverage what has already
been--and is continuing to be--studied in order to better understand
the human subject.

    For example, Michel Foucault's (1995) power discourse, Donna
Haraway's (1985) cyborg manifesto, Michel Callon and Bruno Latour's
(1981) actor-network theory, Don Ihde's (1990) postphenomenology,
Rosi Braidotti's (2013) posthumanism, Martin Heidegger's (2010) being-
in-the-world (Dasein), Karen Barad's (2007) agential realism, and so on;
all of these amodern (as in not modern), relational thinkers have made
profound contributions to an understanding of our selves and our place
in the world. They have helped overcome much of the subject/object
dichotomy and helped describe the human subject in a more relational
manner. However, like the proverbial group of blind people describing
an elephant by touching different places on its body, they all are correct,
but in a limited way, missing a unifying perspective. By approaching
the subject through an interdisciplinary lens, there is a better chance
of coming to a transdisciplinary understanding of the human subject
by creating an inclusive framework that can accommodate many of
the ideas that come from various relational disciplines dedicated to
understanding the human subject.

    While the main fields I have used so far--postphenomenology,
media literacy, media ecology, complexity, and posthumanism--bring
certain benefits to understanding the human subject, each has certain
limitations concerning the creation of a unified framework that can help
maintain an inclusive perspective. For instance, postphenomenology
contributes well to our pragmatic understanding of the constituting
nature of technological relations, but it is technocentric and lacks an
approach to leverage the concepts of a culturally constructed `body two'
(cf. Ihde, 2002) and sedimentation. Postphenomenology has also been
criticized for not being critical enough on the normative and ethical issues
surrounding technology (cf. Lemmens, 2017; Scharff, 2006; Thompson,
2006). As for media literacy, it has various approaches that contribute
in many beneficial ways, including critical media literacy that brings
the influence of critical cultural theory into the dialogue. However,
media literacy lacks a focus on the impact of the technological medium.
126  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

It also lacks an effective approach for understanding the impact of the
broader context that the media are used within, as domestication theory
demonstrates.

    Media ecology, which effectively investigates the impact of the
medium itself on the human subject and society. However, media
ecology is less able to provide a way to pragmatically understand
specific technological relations and how sociocultural aspects such as
representation, power, and gender also co-influence the effects of the
technological media. And finally, philosophical posthumanism helpfully
provides a focus on the complex transformations of the human subject
in a non-humanist, non-dualist, and non-anthropocentric manner, but
it lacks a pragmatic way of investigating specific relations, including
technological, which contribute to the constitution of the human subject.

    The posthuman approach I propose creates a solution for these
problems without losing the valuable contributions of each field.
Holistically, this provides a way to situate media literacy investigations
into an all-encompassing framework. By so doing, this allows
investigators to keep a broad perspective while facilitating a deep
analysis into any of the specific areas.

    Critical media literacy opens the field of media literacy to influencing
relations beyond media technologies by including the effects of
structures of power and privilege embedded within media messages
(Kellner & Share, 2005, 2007). My point in this chapter is to demonstrate
how media literacy can expand even further by including the effects
that time and space as well as body and mind have on our selves and
our media relations. Adopting a more inclusive framework for media
literacy can help us understand how our media relations affect all
the other relations in our lives and vice versa. We are immersed in an
environment of complex relations, most of which are in the background
of our awareness. The literacy aspect of my framework is the effort to
foreground these relations in order for us to become aware of them so
we can choose how we might engage with them.

    I begin this chapter by discussing the process in which we continue
to be affected by the non-neutral transformations that we experience
through our relations. I then propose a structure in order to include
all of the relations that contribute to our constitution. This helps bring
attention beyond the technological to the other groups of relations that
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   127

also contribute to our constitution. My goal is to help us become more
literate about our selves, not necessarily to answer `who' are we--as that
is akin to a content question--but rather `what' are we? This approach
is similar to Marshall McLuhan's (1994) aphorism, the medium is the
message. How does what we are affect who we are? And, how do our
processes and engagement with the world--the how we are--affect how
we exist and become in this world? Only by better understanding the what
and how of our existence will we then be able to situate media literacy
and the various relations that contribute to constituting the human
subject, thus enabling the development of a comprehensive perspective.
This reduces the tendency towards deterministic claims that focus on
only one or two specific factors. By establishing this framework, we can
become more aware of what contributes to the constitution of our selves
in a holistic and encompassing manner.

                  Intrasubjective Mediation

To more deeply explore what it means to be constituted--or
transformed--by our relations, I introduce the concept of intrasubjective
mediation. While constitution and transformation can have slightly
different meanings, I will use them both to describe the process of
becoming. The concept of intrasubjective mediation helps to identify
how the transformations that take place due to our relations both affect
and continue to affect how we perceive and engage with the world. As
Ihde (2009) points out, `Technologies transform our experience of the
world and our perceptions and interpretations of our world, and we
in turn become transformed in this process. Transformations are non-
neutral' (44). The first sentence in this quote describes the constituting
effects of the six groups of relations, and the second sentence gets to the
core of intrasubjective mediation.

    I define intrasubjective mediation as the process of how the
transformations that occur in the human subject through technological,
sociocultural, mind, body, time, and space relations mediate--and continue
to mediate--how the subject perceives and engages with the world. What
intrasubjective mediation enables is the ability to understand how
all of our relations continue to contribute to our constitution through
the transformations that originally took place. How this relates to
128  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

the technological relations described by postphenomenology is that
every technological relation--be it embodied, hermeneutic, alterity,
or background--leaves an intrasubjective transformation that we then
perceive and experience the world through.

    For example, a GPS enabled mapping app on our smartphone
allows us to explore a new city differently than if we did not have this
technology. After we become familiar with using the GPS app and
have had positive experiences navigating new areas with the app, our
confidence in exploring new places can increase. In addition, as we
become less concerned with getting lost, we become different travelers.
We are travelers transformed. Enabling and constraining still occurs,
and we will likely have new concerns, such as our phone's battery level
and finding cellular access spots.

    We interact with every relation in our life through an assemblage
of our current relations and the accumulation of our transformations
caused by the relations we have already experienced. I build upon
postphenomenology's embodied relation in order to conceptualize this
process. Intrasubjective mediation creates a language for investigation
and a method of inquiry to explore the transformations that happen
within the subject due to specific constituting relations and how we
continue to engage and perceive the world through these transformations.
This moves our initial focus on an individual relation experienced in the
present moment and expands our attention and awareness in order to
perceive the current interrelating relations as well as the accumulation
of all our experiences gathered together.

                               Why Intra?

At first, the idea of intra-subjective mediation may seem somewhat
confusing. After all, what does it mean to be mediated by an aspect
within our selves? Why use `intra' instead of simply using `subjective
mediation?' I do so because `subject' is often conceived of as singular,
equating to the entirety of our selves. `Intrasubjective' points to a more
specific internal aspect that contributes to our overall constitution. Our
subjective self is not a unified subject, but a multiplicity through which
we intra-relate (Lamagna, 2011). Therefore, in order to know our selves
more fully, it is helpful to understand these relations and how they
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   129

contribute to our continually constituted subjectivity. Additionally, the
way a subject perceives the world through the intrasubjective relations
can vary, depending upon the context of the situation; how the subject
is feeling: whether they are stressed or relaxed; what is currently
motivating them; their particular upbringing; etc.

    The intrasubjective mediating framework developed below creates a
way to investigate both the current and continuing impact from relations,
which in the case of media technology will help us to become more media
literate by understanding the broader effects of media technologies.
While my primary focus will continue to be on technological relations, I
will situate them within a framework that includes five other groupings
of relations. Before describing the specifics of how intrasubjective
mediation works through a type of embodied relation, I will first
describe all six groupings of relations that make up the framework.

       The Intrasubjective Mediating Framework

In order to leverage the concept of intrasubjective mediation, I first
develop a general framework before then creating a pragmatic instrument
that can be used for media literacy (Chapter 6). To begin discussing the
framework, I start with the foundation of our existence--one with no
hard boundaries of separation that is instead interrelated and emergent.
I gather all of our constituting relations into six groups, which enables
us to look deeply into the particular qualities and aspects of each group
while remaining cognizant of the other groups.

    This chapter builds on the concept that we are multi-relational, that
there is never just one relation involved with anything we do in any
single moment. There is a tendency to perceive technology and media
in a gestalt-like manner--all at once and often as one thing. This can
erroneously translate into thinking of media technology as a single
relation, instead of multiple relations happening at the same time. For
example, I can analyze my relationship with my smartphone. At first,
it can feel like one relation, as the object being one `thing'. However,
the smartphone is not only functionally more than one artifact--camera,
phone, GPS, web browser, social media site, etc.--but it is also an
assemblage of relations. It is, amongst many other things, a cultural
status symbol, a way to reduce distance by creating a virtual space, and
130  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

an extension of my mind, used for storing memories and information
externally. The framework I develop is a way to keep this broader
perspective in mind when analyzing specific media and technological
relations.

    The framework builds upon the I-technology-world formula used
to describe technological mediation, which is very effective in analysis
on a microperceptual level. However, this formula does not portray the
entirety of what is happening to the subject in the constituting moment.
There are more than just technological relations that are happening,
and postphenomenology acknowledges this by describing a culturally
constructed body two (Ihde, 2002). However, postphenomenology
has made little progress in creating a method or an instrument to
easily implement the sociocultural component in a similar way to
the I-technology-world formula that focuses on the microperceptual,
let alone investigating the effect of other groupings of relations. The
following framework serves this purpose by situating all of our mediating
relations into groups for the goal of identification and discovery.

                         Framework Caveats

George Box (1979) offers a helpful perspective to keep in mind as
I begin to describe the framework: `All models are wrong but some
models are helpful' (202). Representations are not reality, but they
can help provide ways for us to interact and understand reality. The
framework is useful as a situating anchor, helping to keep research
tethered to the overarching perspective of what comprises the human
subject. And yet, there is a tension between creating an inclusive
framework and striving not to be reductive. Paul Cilliers (2005)
says that the limitations of a framework make `it possible to have
knowledge (in finite time and space). At the same time, having limits
means something is excluded, and we cannot predict the effects of that
exclusion' (264). Keeping this in mind can help us pay attention to not
only how we may be enabled, but also how we might be constrained
when using this framework. For instance, by portraying the framework
as inclusive, I create an expectation of completeness, which ultimately
is impossible. To counteract this expectation, I include the group
`unknown/unknowable' (cf. Fig. 5.1). It is also possible that there is
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   131

a better way to organize or name the groups. The publication of this
book captures the framework at a certain point in time, and it is quite
likely that it will continue to change in the future.

    An additional caveat is that the intrasubjective mediating framework
(Fig. 5.1) looks anthropocentric. It has the mind/body at the center and
is all about identifying the human subject's relations and even risks
reflecting a mind-body split. However, this is absolutely not the intention
behind the framework. Instead, it is a starting point to help enable us
to understand our entangled interconnectedness and interrelatedness
with the world. The framework demonstrates our embedded and
embodied reality, our immanent beingness. We start from here in
order to understand our interconnectedness and interrelatedness. This
is not the view from above approach, nor a way to explore objective
beingness. This is our subjectiveness with which we interrelate and are
interconnected with the world. By using this framework as a starting
point, we can increase our awareness of how we are constituted by the
entirety of our relations. Only then will we be in a good place to critically
judge the specific relations in our lives and decide how we may want to
engage with them.

                   The Framework's Cartography

Before going into the details of each group, I explain the structural
configuration of Figure 5.1. First, I identify the six groups:
technological, sociocultural, mind, body, space, and time. This
framework is dedicated to understanding the human subject, and
places the mind and body in the middle, reflecting the central role
they play. They are placed together with the co-constituting symbol
to indicate the continual becoming of the human subject. Often these
two groupings are considered the fundamental aspect of what we
simply `are'. The lower portion of the configuration captures time and
space, which in physics are the first four dimensions of reality. This
foundational pair is like the warp of a weaving, the structure upon
which our reality--and the human subject itself--is constituted. The
upper portion contains the technological and sociocultural relations
that are human constructions.

The figure represents a way to look for and identify various groupings
of relations, all of which contribute to constituting the subject. The
boundaries between the groupings are porous, as the relations are
entangled. These groupings simply gather relations with shared
similarities. All relations within each group can interact directly or
indirectly with relations from other groups. The subject is not so much
constructed by these relations, but constituted through their totality
in a dynamic manner; a constant becoming. These relations interrelate
and influence each other, like waves that sometimes cancel each other
and sometimes increase each other's effects. The focus for now is on
the structure rather than the specific content, though I will attempt to
explore examples within each group. I create a placeholder for `unknown
and unknowable' relations in order to build into the framework the idea
that we do not, and cannot, know all of the relations that are affecting us.
Later, in Chapter 6, I will leverage this `simple' structure into a pragmatic
instrument.

                   Technology and Sociocultural

I begin by grouping the relations that can arguably be called the most
human-constructed: technological and sociocultural relations. I place
them on the top of Fig. 5.1 since they are not too difficult to foreground.
For all of the groups I frame them in the I-___-world formula in order to
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   133

emphasize how each grouping of relations mediates and co-constructs
our selves and the world.

               Technological Relations: I-Technology-World

The concept of technological mediation from postphenomenology--
the I-technology-world relation--is the primary building block for the
framework. In chapter three, I described in detail the aspects of the
technological relations, including the four types of relations identified
in postphenomenology. Rather than restate all of the details concerning
technological relations--such as non-neutrality, multistability, and
sedimentation--I will add to those ideas by describing a way to group
technologies into three different genres: simple, complicated, and
complex. Doing so can help us understand that all technologies are not
the same, that the three groups have unique qualities that differentiate
them and their broader effects on society and people.

    Simple and complicated technologies have been a subject of Ursula
Franklin (2004), though she describes them as holistic and prescriptive
respectively. Franklin focuses on the cultural aspects of technology,
describing technology as a system. She states that it `entails far more than
its individual material components. Technology involves organization,
procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset'
(1). Franklin discusses technologies as a practice, focusing on how
the technological process is being done more than what the process is
actually creating.

    Holistic technologies are often `associated with the notion of craft.
Artisans, be they potters, weavers, metal-smiths, or cooks, control
the process of their own work from beginning to finish' (6). In these
relations, the technology is fairly simple, and the skill in creating or
producing or using the technology is mostly dependent upon the user.
Franklin focuses closely on the interconnection between culture and
technologies, how the craft process of creating technologies influences
the type of culture that develops around it.

    The second type of technology uses a prescriptive process, which
Franklin (2004) describes as `based on a quite different division of
labour. Here, the making or doing of something is broken down into
clearly identifiable steps' (7). There is a division of labor, where different
134  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

people take on specific and controlled roles. While the industrial
revolution exemplifies this process, Franklin describes how the process
was already being used in China in 1200 BC for casting bronze. The
division of labor moves the overall control from the worker to the person
in charge. The worker must follow a prescribed plan in order for the
technological production to work properly. `Prescriptive technologies
constitute a major social invention. In political terms, prescriptive
technologies are designs for compliance [...where] external control and
internal compliance are seen as normal and necessary' (7-8).

    While prescriptive technologies are exceedingly effective and
efficient, they have a dramatic impact upon the culture, where `we are
ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept
that there is only one way of doing "it"' (8). This type of technology
can be considered complicated, especially when compared with holistic
craft technologies. This is where most contemporary ICTs can be found,
though some aspects of ICTs are now moving into a third type: complex
technologies.

    Complex technologies can be understood as another paradigmatic
shift. While prescriptive technologies move the control and responsibility
from a single person in holistic technologies to an external control,
complex technologies move much of that control more to the technology
itself. These are technologies such as machine learning, where humans
no longer control the specific inner workings of algorithms and
predictability gives way to probability. The technology programs itself,
and we can no longer pinpoint exactly how a specific output is reached.

    Each of these subgroupings of technology brings different benefits
and constraints to both individuals and cultures through their mediation.
Their differences can be linked to different constituting effects on
the human subject. All three retain the qualities of the technological
relations discussed in Chapter 3: non-neutrality, multistability, and
sedimentation. Having already covered these, I now move on to the
second foregrounded group of relations: sociocultural.

              Sociocultural Relations: I-Sociocultural-World

Some of the co-constituting sociocultural relations that mediate
between our selves and the world have already been discussed:
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   135

postphenomenology's concept of body two; critical media literacy;
and critical posthumanism. This group consists of the sociocultural
relations that influence human subjects. Creating a place for these types
of relations allows them to be analyzed and acknowledged as having
an effect on how we are constituted moment by moment. This group
is messy, wide-ranging, and very difficult to reign in to a neat tidy
`category'. However, I am not looking to categorize. My goal is to simply
encourage investigation in order to reveal the sociocultural relations
that have a constituting effect on us. Subgroups, such as power, gender,
race, and language, that are a part of the sociocultural group tend to be
entangled, and I do not believe it is necessary to fully separate them. I do
not go into a great deal of specificity expanding on the many potential
subgroups because I believe that the social science and cultural studies
fields have already made a lot of progress in this regard. This grouping
simply allows a place in the framework for these fields of study to be
included. To exemplify this group briefly, I discuss postphenomenology's
sociocultural concepts, as well as those from critical cultural studies.

    Sociocultural Concepts in Postphenomenology. Postphenomenology
has two concepts for cultural influences: macroperception and body two.
However, it does not leverage these concepts into a method or instrument
for exploring their influence on the human subject in a similar way to
how it instrumentalizes technological relations through its I-technology-
world formula. Additionally, the use of macroperception is focused on
`the ways in which cultures embed technologies' (Ihde, 1990: 124), but
not on how cultures mediate human subjects microperceptively.

    Microperception is focused on the embodied and embedded
perspective of the human, which gives rise to the four types of
I-technology-world relations in postphenomenology. However, as I
have pointed out, Ihde (1990) states that there is no `microperception
(sensory-bodily) without its location within a field of macroperception
and no macroperception without its microperceptual foci' (29). Ihde
devotes a significant section of his Lifeworld book to the concept of
macroperception (1990, cf. chapter 6), describing how technologies
and our microperceptions are necessarily entangled within the broader
sociocultural landscape. In practice, however, it is challenging to
pragmatically incorporate the concept of macroperception into specific
research on technologies. While microperception is tightly linked with
136  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

the I-technology-world mediation theory, macroperception and body
two have more often been used as general concepts.

    Robert Scharff (2006) criticizes Ihde's usual separation of micro
and macroperception, saying, `from what sort of perspective does he
[Ihde] make the distinction between perceptual "embodiment" and
cultural "context," put their discussions in separate chapters, and often
discuss one without reference to the other?' (137). Lasse Blond and
Kasper Schiølin (2018) `suggest that postphenomenology has placed
too much emphasis on technology, leaving the mediated human "I"
and the world in the dark' (152). The framework developed here is an
attempt to include how the sociocultural relations contribute to our own
constitution.

    Leveraging co-constituting sociocultural relations helps us to
understand the transformative effects of culture on our microperceptions.
This is a solution for the criticisms just discussed from Scharff and as well
Blond and Schiølin. It is a way to bring body one (the microperceptual
body) and body two (the culturally constructed body) from
postphenomenology together and focus on how sociocultural relations
constitute the human subject in a similar manner to technological
relations. In Chapter 6 I will demonstrate the constituting effects of
sociocultural relations that I experienced while taking a museum
selfie. This sociocultural component is a strong influencing force on
the individual, one that is sedimented over a lifetime. Developing this
specific relation can help us better analyze its influence on the human
subject. We can modify Ihde's (1990) original technological mediating
formula in order to identify these constituting sociocultural relations:
I-sociocultural-world. Like technological relations, sociocultural relations
are co-constituting and multistable. How the sociocultural relations
constitute the individual is not only unique to each individual, but is
changeable (multistable) within the individual.

    Sociocultural Concepts in Cultural Studies. Sociocultural elements
influence people's practices and experiences. Tony Bennett (1998) offers
elements of a definition for cultural studies, describing how there are
diverse forms of power in relation to culture that should be examined,
including gender, class, race, colonialism and imperialism. According
to Bennett, `The ambition of cultural studies is to develop ways of
theorizing relations of culture and power that will prove capable of
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   137

being utilized by relevant social agents to bring about changes within
the operation of those relations of culture and power' (28).

    Building upon Bennett's (1998) work, Chris Barker and Emma
Jane (2016) review some of the key concepts within cultural studies,
creating a list that includes, in part, language, representation,
materialism, political economy, power, subjectivity and identity, class,
and race. Barker and Jane stress that cultural studies is non-reductionist,
meaning situations cannot be reduced down to a single causal category
or concept. Emily Grabham et al. (2009) describe one of the ways in
which cultural studies leverages the concept of non-reductionism
through intersectionality, which focuses on the intersection of several
inequalities people experience `that are rooted through one another, and
which cannot be untangled to reveal a single cause' (1). Additionally,
Leslie McCall (2009) points out that complexity, `arises when the subject
of analysis expands to include multiple dimensions of social life and
categories of analysis' (49).

    The framework I develop can lead to an increased awareness of this
complexity and intersectionality of constituting relations. From the
many potential subgroups available within sociocultural relations, I will
briefly highlight normativity as an example of identifying sociocultural
constituting relations. In Chapter 6, I use two other subgroups as
examples in my exploration of analyzing my experience taking a
museum selfie--language and politics.

    Using normative relations, we can analyze how sociocultural
relations influence by both enabling and constraining us. The concept
of normativity can be understood by looking at two different scenarios
where I would be different when taking museums selfies. In the first
scenario, other people are also taking selfies and the museum itself
encourages, or at least does not restrict, the taking of selfies with the
museum objects. In this situation, I feel fairly comfortable taking a
museum selfie. In the second scenario, nobody else is taking selfies.
When I do try to take one, people in the area give me what I perceive to
be unpleasant looks. Without explicitly asking if this was their intention,
these reactions from the people around me are a way of communicating
that taking selfies is not acceptable museum behavior. In this second
scenario, I perceive my proximal social group as negatively judging me,
and this has an inhibiting effect on my desire to take any further selfies.
138  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    These two scenarios demonstrate the importance of going beyond
only the technological relation, as the constituting effects in the scenario
have very little to do with any technological relation. I am being mediated
and constituted culturally before I get to the point of the technological
relation. Within these sociocultural relations, we can investigate the
various ways that our culture mediates us as we relate with and through
technology. This can include studying power dynamics, economics,
language, ethics, and the normative values that arise when we look
into sociocultural issues. I will now move on to explain Body and Mind
relations.

                            Body and Mind

Both the body and mind can be considered core groupings of relations
that comprise our human subjectivity. Often, these two groups are
considered who or what we are, not necessarily as relations, but simply
as `us'. However, by considering the body and mind as part of a larger
framework of constituting relations, we can analyze their relations using
the mediating formula. The primary goal is not to answer the question
of what the mind and body are specifically, but to create a structural
approach that includes and organizes all the relations that constitute
both body and mind in order to better understand the human becoming.

                       Body Relations: I-Body-World

We--each individual human subject--are greatly mediated by our
bodies. The body provides the condition of possibility for relations
by materially being-in-the-world. The materiality of our bodies--the
chemistry and bodily systems--contributes to constituting our human
becomingness. The physical bodily aspect--that many transhumanists
would like to enhance and even one day overcome--is a major component
of our subjectivity. Physical changes, such as taking psychological
enhancing medication, sickness, hunger, or the loss or change of certain
physical abilities, can dramatically change how we exist in our lifeworld.

    To illustrate how my body can affect my relating to the world through
technology, I use a simplified example of attempting to take a photograph
of a bird out in nature. Under normal circumstances it is advantageous
for a bird photographer to be patient and slow in their movements.
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   139

However, if my body desperately needs to empty its bladder, this
biological imperative changes my ability to be patient, and my body's
mediation begins to dominate and supersede the technological relation
that I have with my camera and my attempt at taking a photograph. I
am a much different photographer in this scenario than I am in a similar
scenario where I do not need to use the bathroom.

    The concept of being mediated by our bodies is not new. Mark
Coeckelbergh (2019) writes `we project ourselves towards things through
the body and its movement. The moving body is a medium' (17). He
continues by expanding postphenomenology's use of embodiment by
stating that it `is not just a particular human-technology relation (Ihde,
1990; Verbeek, 2005); it is the very way we exist in the world' (18). Lance
Strate (2017) points out that even `face-to-face communication is simply
a differently mediated form of communication, and the body is the
medium through which much of nonverbal communication takes place'
(103). Strate continues discussing the mediation of the body by saying
(2017: 102):

    The differences between the structure and functioning of human eyes
    and the ears are differences that make a difference [...]. When we
    include all of the senses, not just vision, hearing, touch, smell and taste,
    but also the bodily senses, the kinetic, vestibular, and proprioceptive, it
    becomes clear that the nervous system, the brain, and the body in its
    entirety can be included under the category of media, characterized by
    specific structures that impose certain constraints and provide certain
    affordances.

Understanding the body as a medium--as something that we are
mediated by--allows us to perceive it in a relational, co-constituting
manner.

    We are embodied beings, and our bodies make a difference in how
we think and interact with the world. Bodies are foundational when it
comes to many sociocultural relations such as race, gender, and sexuality.
Our bodies also make a difference in how other people engage with us
(Butler, 1993). Appearance, ability, and perceptual astuteness all have
dramatic effects on a subject's engagement with the world. These aspects
exemplify an entanglement of bodily and sociocultural relations.

    Another entanglement is the body and mind groupings. While I
identify these relations as two different groups, they are only separate
140  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

in order to identify and gather together specific relations. Strate (2017)
countermands the traditional opposition of body and mind: `The mind
is not the body, but it emerges out of the body, is contained within the
body, is dependent upon the body, but may also affect and alter the
body' (114). Research and debate continue on the brain/mind/body
entanglement. The physical brain has a tremendous influence on our
minds, or the mind can be understood as emerging from the brain and
body (Varela et al., 1992).

                       Mind Relations: I-Mind-World

The human subject is not an isolated, singular being, but always and
already in relations, constantly being constituted by the shifting current
state of all the relations that affect it. As with the sociocultural relation
subgroups, the mind subgroups are not new but are groupings of already
existing areas of study. My goal is not to bring new content to these
groups and subgroups, but rather to include them in a cartography that
can help guide our investigations into our own constituting relations,
keeping a perspective of the whole subject as we do.

    We `cut' reality into a specific relation by doing and by deciding, using
our mind's imagination, awareness, consciousness, and perception.
The ability of our mind to mediate our experience with the lifeworld
is exemplified by the well-known experiment of Daniel Simons and
Christopher Chabris (1999), who conducted a study where people
watched a video and were told to count how many times the team in
white passed the basketball. As the team was passing around the ball, a
woman in a dark gorilla suit walked between the players, turned to the
camera, beat her chest, and then continued out of the screen. Only about
50% of the viewers who were concentrating on the number of passes
noticed the gorilla. This demonstrates that even though our eyes receive
information, our mind's attention and intention play a significant role in
what we actually perceive.

    Some of the subgroups of the mind that I note are imagination,
awareness or consciousness, and identity. The concept of identity here,
while heavily influenced by the sociocultural, focuses on our mind's role
in our agency of creating our self-identity. Not all identity issues are
contained within this subgroup, as the sociocultural also contains many
of the identity relations. This will be further explained below (see the
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   141

section `Awareness, Agency, and Identity'). Our mind helps us choose
what we focus on, and is where we interpret what our bodily senses
detect. It is the mind, through awareness, that helps us regain some of
the agency lost to the various other relations and structures in our lives.

    The following subcategories of the mind are an attempt to show some
of the nuances of this aspect of the human subject. These subcategories
are not separate from each other, and even their definitions remain
contested. Several areas of study are still trying to figure out exactly
what constitutes the mind (fields such as cognitive science, psychology,
and the philosophy of mind). However, I use `the mind' as a general
grouping that contains mind-related relations, of which I will use the
concepts of imagination, awareness/consciousness, and identity as
subgroups.

    Imagination and Technology. Imagination is one of the relational
subgroups of the mind. It is a non-neutral relation, dynamic even within
an individual, influencing more at certain times and less at other times.
By formulating imagination as a relation, it is possible to use the concept
to understand how humans are mediated by this element of our selves,
allowing us to become more aware of the enabling and constraining
effects on both the individual and broader sociological levels. To
demonstrate, I will explore how the imagination affects our relations
with technologies.

    The concept of the multistability of technology discussed in Chapter
3 is only possible through our ability to imagine. It is our imagination
that allows us to perceive technologies in multiple stable ways.2 It is also
our imagination that allows us--and hundreds of other species--to
both identify and create technologies in the first place. Without being
able to identify technology, we would not recognize any object in a tool-
based or technological manner. Therefore, whoever (or whatever) does
not have an ability to imagine technology will not have or be able to
perceive technologies. Through imagination, a rock can be perceived
as a hammer or a weapon, and a stick can extend the body to reach
something. This first aspect of imagination is the condition for the
possibility of perceiving an object in such a way as to accomplish a

      he names one imaginative multistability (and the other practical multistability).
142  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

desired task in a technological manner. It also enables the ability to
perceive things in multistable ways.

    The second aspect of imagination allows for the design and creation
of new tools and technologies. Humans are not the only species that
have this ability (cf. Beck, 1980). Vicki Bentley-Condit and E. O. Smith
(2010) identify 284 species that have demonstrated a clear ability to
identify tools; a portion of those species has also clearly demonstrated an
ability to create tools. Benjamin Beck (1980) identifies four categories of
how certain species actively create tools: detaching, subtracting, adding/
combining, and reshaping. This goes beyond the mere identification of
an object for tool use, as in picking up a stick.3

    Imagination has its own enabling and constraining qualities. By
conceiving of this concept as a relation, we can investigate what is
enabled when we have a well-developed imagination. More importantly,
we can consider what is constrained, since often what is constrained is
backgrounded. Our imagination helps us create technological solutions.
However, the danger here, as Heidegger points out (1977: 27-28) is
that the enframing aspect of technology contributes to obscuring our
ability for non-technological solutions to be revealed to us. Thus, our
perception becomes obscured and we tend only to envision technological
solutions rather than holding a space for non-technological solutions to
be revealed.

    For instance, in the contemporary Western world,4 solutions for
climate change are predominantly technology based (Preston, 2018). By
being aware that we have a strong inclination to use our imagination for
technological purposes, we can become aware of our predisposition and
then actively search for possible non-technological solutions. Michel
Puech (2016) points out that technology can nurture a command-
and-control attitude, which is helpful for complicated and closed
systems--systems that are engineerable--but not as useful for complex
living systems. According to Peter Hershock (2003), `The better we
get at controlling our circumstances, the more we will find ourselves
in circumstances open to and requiring control' (595). This can lead

  3For examples of using postphenomenology to discuss animal tool use, see Ihde and
        Malafouris (2018) and Wellner (2017b).

  4This refers to the specific macroperception of a culture. Our cultures have an
        influence on how much we use our technological imagination (cf. Ihde, 1990).
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   143

to a runaway use of technology, which reflects what much of Western
culture seems now to be experiencing.

    Awareness, Agency, and Identity. In addition to imagination, other
subgroups of the mind are awareness, agency, and identity--however,
these subgroups do not easily stay separate from each other. As we
investigate all of these various constituting relations, we might ask if we
are simply a self-emergent system reacting to both external and internal
relations? If we are on `auto pilot', we are in an autopoietic mode,
mindlessly self-becoming without agential intervention from the aware
`self'. This is where determinist and structuralist arguments seem to be
reasonable.

    However, through awareness and agency, a human subject does have
some influence over their own constitution, but it requires an enactive
approach, a participation of the aware self in how we choose to engage
within an intricately complex dance. Our attention and intention towards
any specific relation engages our agency; allowing us to influence the
relation. What we do not pay attention to can become increasingly
determining in our lives (i.e., influencing without our being aware). Our
awareness acts as our own internal panopticon, a central aspect that can
be directed towards any of our many relations, though it is impossible
to be aware of all our relations at once.

    Without the entanglement of agency and awareness, we would simply
be determined systems, not (at least partially) self-governed through
our agency, but rather constructed by an assemblage of constituting
relations. Our lives are truly a dance of agency (Pickering, 1995, 2005),
one where we can be continually led by the assemblages of our relations,
or choose to participate in the dance through our own agency. Barad
(2007) describes agency as `a matter of intra-acting; it is an enactment,
not something that someone or something has' (178).

    Another subgroup of the mind is identity, which, as mentioned, is
heavily influenced by culture. However, the basic concept of having an
identity--a `self' and a `me'-- is the part of the subject that is referred
to here, the ability to identify as a subject. However, as Stuart Hall
(2013) notes, `Though they seem to invoke an origin in a historical past
with which they continue to correspond, actually identities are about
questions of using the resources of history, language and culture in the
144  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

process of becoming rather than being' (4). In other words, identity is
comprised of an aspect of the mind that is deeply entangled with culture.

    The relational group `mind' can help us focus on specific constituting
relations of the mind and investigate how they enable and constrain us
through the I-mind-world mediation formula. For instance, I can look
into how my relational identities--as a practicing naturalist and as a
nature photographer--can compete with each other. As a naturalist
I might not want to disturb the behavior of the birds I am trying to
photograph, especially if it is mating season and the bird in front of
me is an endangered species. However, as a nature photographer my
photos can help bring awareness to protecting this endangered species.
These senses of identity compete with each other, and my awareness
is split between them, attempting to find an acceptable compromise.
Identifying the various relations of the mind and paying attention to
how we are constituted by them increases our agency and ability to
interact in a more informed way with our lifeworlds.

                            Space and Time

Having now described the more human-created relations of sociocultural
and technological relations, as well as the core relations of mind and
body, I now come to the more infrastructural relations of space and time.
In physics these are understood as the first four dimension of reality.
Space and time are the ultimate background, the tapestry upon which our
universe exists. They are contextualizing relations. As John Urry (2005a)
suggest, they are `"internal" to the processes by which the physical and
social worlds themselves operate, helping to constitute their powers'
(4). Both space and time can be considered mediums through which we
relate, and I investigate how we are constituted through those relations.

    In Chapter 3 I discuss how Harold Innis (2008) studies the space-
time bias of mediums of communication. Shaun Moores (2005) also
develops an entire book on media studies around time and space,
claiming `it is necessary to appreciate the complex ways in which media
of communication are bound up with wider institutional, technological
and political processes in the modern world' (3). He advocates for
understanding `media as operating in the wider temporal and spatial
arrangements of society, but also as contributing, reciprocally, to the
creation, maintenance or transformation of social time and space' (4).
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   145

Anthony Giddens (1979) argues the need to realize `the time-space
relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction' (3). In this
chapter, I am also advocating that space and time can and should be
understood as relations, which impact the human subject's continual
constitution. By naming them, we can analyze the specificity of those
relations and bring to the foreground how they contribute to our own
constitution in our everyday5 lives.

                       Space Relations: I-Space-World

We can think of space as a medium within which we exist and to which
we relate. Space defines the physical location, the embeddedness and
situatedness of our location in the world. This section investigates the
proximal effect of our physical surroundings. Space includes the natural
world, as well as the human-made world. Space includes the Earth, air,
clouds, atmosphere, and the vastness of outer space. Space is a medium
and contributes to our own constitution through our relations with it.
John Peters (2015) describes how these elements can be understood as
mediums, affecting the species that exist within them. However, space is
resistant to being understood singularly. It is easily entangled with other
groups of relations such as technology and culture.

    Using space as a relation tethers us to the physical world.
While our minds and imaginations can get overly immersed in
exploring the intricacies of sociocultural relations of power or issues
surrounding representation and misrepresentation through the lens
of social justice, it is the materiality and tangibility of our immediate
surrounding that helps ground us in the here and now. The effects of
the different mediums of space are clearly evident in communications.
For instance, communicating underwater is vastly different than
communicating through air (cf. Peters, 2015), which is vastly different
than communication in outer space, in the absence of air. All of these
particular elemental mediums are gathered in the general grouping of
`space'. This creates a way to locate and bring spatial relations to the

5Alfred Schütz (cf.; Schütz & Luckmann, 1973) uses spatial arrangements as the
      foundation to his structure of everyday life, followed by temporal and then social
      arrangements. See also Laurence Claeys (2007, chapter 6) for a helpful schematic
      and description of Schütz's conceptual framework.
146  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

foreground in order to analyze and recognize their influence on our
own constitutionality.

    Spatial Entanglements with Other Groups. Rather than discussing
subgroups of space, I will present several ways that space can combine
with some of the other relational groups. The first is the combination of
space and mind, where I investigate the spatial effects on perspective.
Space can have a profound effect on a person's mental state. An example
of this is what Frank White (2014: 2) refers to as the Overview Effect:

    The Overview Effect is a cognitive shift in awareness reported by some
    astronauts and cosmonauts during spaceflight, often while viewing the
    Earth from orbit, in transit between the Earth and the moon, or from the
    lunar surface. It refers to the experience of seeing firsthand the reality
    that the Earth is in space, a tiny, fragile ball of life, `hanging in the void',
    shielded and nourished by a paper-thin atmosphere. The experience
    often transforms astronauts' perspective on the planet and humanity's
    place in the universe. Some common aspects of it are a feeling of awe for
    the planet, a profound understanding of the interconnection of all life,
    and a renewed sense of responsibility for taking care of the environment.

White also posits, `mental processes and views of life cannot be separated
from physical location. Our "worldview" as a conceptual framework
depends quite literally on our view of the world from a physical place in
the universe' (1). Space and mind are thus entangled. What is physically
surrounding us can profoundly affect our mind and our perception of
the world.6

    Media and technology have historically had a profound effect on
our understanding of space. Technology has a way of reducing space.
For instance, it would take a moderately healthy person 2 ½ days to
cover the space between Brussels and Paris by walking, while the
train can travel the distance between the two cities in about 1 ½ hours,
effectively shrinking our perception of the space since it takes less time
to travel between them. Technology has also created virtual space,
shaking up the idea of space. Current ICTs are changing aspects of
proximity by allowing a virtual proximity. For the most part, the most
common virtual space uses two of the five traditional senses (vision
and hearing). Video conferencing and video calls are quite common.

  6For another excellent study on the impact of the visual image of Earth from space,
        see Sheila Jasanoff (2001).
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   147

However, though our other senses of smell, touch, and taste have not
entered mainstream usage, there are development attempts underway
(cf. Harley et al., 2018).

    Being limited to the two senses, virtual proximity is not as engaging
as actual proximity, where all of our senses can participate. However,
virtual space still dramatically influences our contemporary world, and
there are many authors who have investigated how this impacts our
lifeworld (see Adams & Thompson, 2016; Lewis, 2020; Meyrowitz, 1985;
Rauch, 2018; Turkle, 2011; Van Dijck, 2013; Wellner, 2016). However,
virtual proximity tends to disembody a subject, which `messes with
whereness. In cyberspace you are everywhere and somewhere and
nowhere, but almost never here in the positivist sense' (Stone, 1994: 180,
italics in original). Virtual space demonstrates how two of the relational
groups can combine together into a seemingly singular relation.

    While space comprises the human-made (technological) world,
it also comprises the natural world. However, the concept of nature is
a social construction (Cronon, 1995). It is not possible to experience
nature outside of the socioculturally sedimented values and experiences
that have built up in our lifetimes. This does not mean that there is not
a `natural world', we simply experience this natural world through a
sociocultural filter rather than directly. That said, the natural world does
mediate and contribute to our constitution. For instance, researchers
are exploring the benefits of spending time in nature and how it can
increase both our physical and mental health (Faber Taylor & Kuo, 2006;
Louv, 2008; Vitalia, 2013).

    Spatial and bodily relations are also entangled. We are always
somewhere, embedded and embodied physically. Coeckelbergh (2019)
draws attention toward how the body moves through space, pointing
out that the embodied relation within postphenomenology `does not
move enough' (19). A moving body is necessarily moving through both
space and time. And, Maurice Merleau-Ponty (2002) explores how a
`bodily space can be differentiated from an external space' (115).

    Space is also entangled with sociocultural relations. The idea of
personal space--the distance between me and another person in a
crowded room--can vary by culture. I am affected by how close someone
is to me, not only because of the amount of personal space I prefer,
but also because of my sociocultural upbringing. Additionally, Erving
148  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

Goffman (1956) explores the interaction between the performance
of self and space, looking into how these issues of public and private
spaces affect our behavior. These are all examples of the entanglement
of spatial and sociocultural relations.

    Recent Foregrounding of Space Relations. I am writing this
during the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, which has caused
spatial relations between people to become globally foregrounded. The
main response to halt the spread of the virus has been through social
distancing: working from home, massively reducing global travel,
staying around two meters away from other people, and shutting
many national borders. All of these measures involve shifting the use
of space in order to stop the transmission of the virus until a vaccine
(a technological response) can be first created and then disseminated
throughout the global population. This is one of the rare times that
proximity moves from the background to the foreground. It is likely
that this pandemic has shifted nearly every person's personal awareness
and experience of space on the planet.

                       Time Relations: I-Time-World

Time is the final group of relations. Time brings unique characteristics
and can be challenging to pin down and define.7 We are forever in the
present, but both the past and future have mediating affects. Up until
now I have discussed the groups of relations as they primarily mediate
us in the present moment. I-technology-world, I-sociocultural-world,
I-mind-world, I-body-world, and I-space-world all represent mediations
in the moment of being mediated. But the present moment is affected by
both the past and the future. As Barad (2007: 181) describes:

    The past matters and so does the future, but the past is never left behind,
    never finished once and for all, and the future is not what will come to be
    in an unfolding of the present moment; rather the past and the future are
    enfolded participants in matter's iterative becoming.

In this section I investigate time as a relation in order to understand how
the past and future transform the way we presently perceive the world.

  7See Canales (2016) for a discussion on the debate between Einstein and Bergson
        concerning time.
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   149

Time is the relation that brings movement to life. Time is a flow--a
process or an action--that affords the becomingness of humans. This flow
is one directional. Complexity theory views time as being irreversible,8
an arrow of time. As we are transformed by our experiences, we cannot
go back to the way we were. We are always in the present, but we are
simultaneously mediated by both past and future. Graham Harman
(2007) suggests that for Heidegger, `time is the ultimate concealed layer
of everything' (48). In Being and Time, Heidegger (2010) counters the
concept of presence,9 which is predicated on the Aristotelian concept
of time and which situates the present as separate from the historical
past and the future that has not yet come to pass (§6 and §26). Instead,
Heidegger believes that a more authentic understanding of time is as a
unity of past, present, and future, an `ecstatic openness' (Sheehan 2014:
266).

    My sense of time, which is influenced by sociocultural relations,
influences my interaction with the world in that moment. For instance,
I am late leaving for work in the morning, causing me to rush and do
everything quickly. I am affected by both the past (maybe I have been
late already twice this week and my boss has let her displeasure known)
and the future (I am imagining what will happen if I arrive late again).
These are direct relations that I am experiencing with the past-present-
future duration of time.

    Relating to the Future through Potentiality. Asle Kiran's (2012)
investigates one type of direct relation with a future orientation
through the concept of potentiality, which he develops with regard
to technological relations. Kiran describes how the future potential
of technologies mediates our present experiences, stating that we
are `directed towards the future, and any kind of planning [...is]
performed because we presuppose that we have certain possibilities
to do something with our lives' (88). He looks beyond `technologies
in-use' (78) and broadens the mediating influence of technology,
stating: `technological shaping of the lifeworld happens in terms of
possible technical mediations, not just actual technical mediations'
(79). This potentiality adds a way of leveraging the future as a relation.

  8This concept of time rejects the part of Newtonian mechanics that views time as
        being reversible.

  9See also Derrida (1982).
150  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    Relating to the Past through Sedimentation. Another way of
describing relations with time relates less directly to time and instead
relates more because of time. This aspect expands upon the concept
of sedimentation, which is the idea that our past experiences with
a phenomenon influence each subsequent experience of the same
phenomenon (Husserl, 1973; Merleau-Ponty, 2002). For example, our
experiences with technologies become sedimented within us the more
we use them, eventually causing the object to recede into the background
of our attention. Sedimentation is often described by focusing on the use
of actual technologies, such as using a hammer, driving a car, or a blind
person using a cane to detect things while they are walking. However,
sedimentation does not have to be an experience with the actual
technology. As soon as awareness of a technology enters a person's
lifeworld, sedimentation begins to be developed within the subject.
For instance, consumer marketing advertises the latest technological
gadget with the hope of transforming people into wanting to buy and
incorporate the object into their lives. If the advertising is successful, the
consumer will imagine owning the new technological device, already
incorporating the idea of the device into their lifeworld.

    We interact with the world in the present, but without past and future
there would only be the here-and-now relations mediating the subject
and world. Even given this predilection, this is not how our lifeworld
works. In any present moment, we are connected with both our history
and our future. While in some ways the past and future might not exist
in the present, they do exist through their connection within our selves
and their transformational abilities. Or, as Braidotti (2017) states, `To do
justice to the complexity of our times, we need to think of the posthuman
present as both the record of what we are ceasing to be (the actual) and
the seed of what we are in the process of becoming (the virtual)' (10). This
entanglement of past and future acting upon someone in the present is
more thoroughly described by intrasubjective mediation.

     Adding Intrasubjective Mediation to the Framework

Having described the grouped relations within the framework, I now
bring in the concept of intrasubjective mediation. One way to understand
intrasubjective mediation (ISM) is by using postphenomenology's
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   151

concept of the embodied relation. This is because intrasubjective
mediation reflects the non-neutrality of the transformations from our
relations that have taken place within the subject, which thus mediate
our perceptions of the world as we engage with the world through them.
Portraying the intrasubjective mediating relation using the embodied
relation formula looks like the following:

                             (I-ISM)  world

We perceive through our relational transformations as a type of embodied
relation. We are mediated through our sedimented transformations and
perceive the world (and our current relations) differently because of this
perception. Therefore, looking specifically at technological mediation
discussed in Chapter 3, the equation can be updated from I-technology-
world to: (I-ISM)-technology-world. However, intrasubjective mediation
represents the transformations from all of the relations identified by
the framework, not just the technological. Figure 5.2 reflects a way to
visualize the expanded technological mediation formula that includes
intrasubjective mediation.

     Fig. 5.2 T he Formula for Intrasubjective Mediation with Technology. Image by author
                                                    (2019), CC BY 4.0.

Intrasubjective mediation does not discount or ignore all of the other
mediating relations, but rather is an additional mediating layer to
whatever relations we are in at the present moment. A technological
example of this is when I use a camera to take nature photographs.
The more I use the camera, the more the camera becomes transparent,
receding into the background as my sedimentation grows with use.
The more that I use the camera, the more my relation with the camera
influences my own constitution, transforming my perception of, and
152  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

relation with, the world. However, even when I am out in nature without
my camera, I notice that I perceive and frame nature through the filter
of what would make a good photograph. This can be thought of as a
`technological gaze' (Lewis, 2020), which both enables me to be more
aware of my surroundings--specifically looking for owls, raptors, and
other wildlife, as well as noticing the light and interplay of shadows--
but it also limits how I perceive the natural world around me. I end
up looking for things, not just looking. I do not experience the natural
world around me immediately; rather, I experience the natural world as
intrasubjectively mediated through a residual aspect of the photograph
based upon my previous experiences.

                     Intrasubjective Mediation versus `I'

Intrasubjective mediation acknowledges how all of our relations both
constitute us in the moment and continue to transform us, continuously
changing how we perceive and engage with the world. These
transformations are not separate from the subject; they are the subject.
They are the multiplicity of the human becoming. All relations are
mediated through intrasubjective mediation. This enables us to better
understand the human subject as an assemblage of the transformations
that have occurred through their relational experiences, as well as all
of the relations they are experiencing in the present moment. This begs
the question, Are humans anything besides intrasubjective mediation?
What is the `I' that is still preceding the intrasubjective mediation in the
above formula?

    My belief is that the `I' includes (and is mediated by) the constituting
relations in the person's life and all the relations that the person has
experienced, as well as the potentiality that the person can imagine. The
consciousness that is `I' is still part of the mind, which is a part of the
mediating whole. Therefore, instead of trying to reductively locate some
essential aspect of the subject that we can identify, we can move in the
opposite direction and open the idea of the subject as inclusive of all of
our relations, current and past.10 Human subjects are greater and more
connected than the idea of the standalone human. We can therefore

  10The future is also included in the present through the concept of potentiality
        discussed previously.
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   153

unite the `I' with intrasubjective mediation, referring to our selves as
intrasubjectively mediated subjects.

    One more step in visually demonstrating a comprehensive
framework is to take Figure 5.2 and add the other groups of relations
to the technological. This is shown in Figure 5.3, which includes all six
relational groups plus the concept of intrasubjective mediation. There is
no relation of the human subject that is not intended to be a part of the
groupings of relations in Figure 5.3, though there might be relations that
I have unintentionally missed (or that have not yet been discovered). It is
also important to keep in mind that there are unknown and unknowable
relations that also affect us. For example, there could be an unknown
toxin near the physical location of your home, which detrimentally
affects both your body and mind. While this is potentially knowable if
identified, you could live with it for many years without ever knowing.
There are also the theoretically unknown and unknowable relations.

     Fig. 5.3 The Formula for an Inclusive Intrasubjective Mediation. Image by author
                                                    (2019), CC BY 4.0.

The intrasubjective mediating framework helps demonstrate that these
groups of relations mediate our perception and engagement with the
world, moving us beyond focusing on a single group of relations in
isolation. By understanding intrasubjective mediation as an embodied
relation through which we relate to the world, we can visually
demonstrate how intrasubjective mediation mediates the relations we
have in our lifeworld.

    Even if our focus is on the effects of any one particular group of
relations, the framework reminds us that those relations are situated
and entangled with multiple other groups of concurrent relations. No
one group is privileged in its effect on our own becoming at any one
154  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

moment in time. The framework describes both the present constituting
relations, as well as the aspect of how the transformations from those
relations continue to mediate all of our relations as we move through
time.

    However, Figure 5.3 is clearly still built upon postphenomenology's
I-technology-world formula. While I have expanded the first two parts
of the formula, the `world' has not received much attention by me,11 or,
indeed, by most postphenomenologists. I believe the formula is helpful
in analyzing specific relations and how they mediate and constitute us.
However, this process is a teasing apart of reality, or the world, as a whole.
By keeping a larger perspective, we can approach understanding our
own worlds as being made up of all of our relations and interrelations,
which I will describe in more detail in the next chapter. This leaves less
reason to retain a world `placeholder' after the list of relations. And
yet dropping it removes it as an effective formula for understanding
our constitution through our interrelations. Therefore, the next step is
integrating the framework into a complex interrelational system of the
human becoming.

   Intrasubjective Mediation: A Dance of Complexity

    To understand just one life, you have to swallow the world. (Rushdie,
    2006: 145)

The final part of the human becoming process involves the system of our
complex interrelationality. It is this interrelational complexity that gives
the sense that in order to understand anything, you must understand
everything (see Rushdie quote above). Up until now I have looked at
either singular or a combination of mediating relations, showing how
the subject is transformed by any of the various groups of relations, as
well as intrasubjective mediation. However, human subjects cannot be
boiled down to a linear causal algorithm, where all that is needed is to
add up the various enabling and constraining relations and end up with
a predictive model for the human becoming. In order to understand
`who and what we are actually in the process of becoming' (Braidotti,
2013: 12), we need to understand how we are becoming. The relational

  11I thank Alberto Romele for first pointing this out to me.
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   155

transformations described by intrasubjective mediation are not discrete
transformations that can be added together to create a composite of
the human subject. Instead, these transformations are entangled and
interrelational, producing an emergent human becoming through a
complex process.

            The Complexity of Interrelating Relations

We are not simply relational or even multi-relational. Rather, we are a
system of complex interrelationality, continually being transformed. Each
of our relations is open to being influenced (enabled or constrained) by
each of our other relations. These interrelations co-constitute each other.
Mapping this complex interrelationality helps us to better understand
and situate any one constituting relation within this broader, emergent
system. This is an effort to re-envision the subject through a cartography-
in-progress and should not be thought of as dogmatic. On the contrary,
it is a partially new topic introduced into a conversation that has been
going on for centuries, modifying the question, `who are we?' to `what
are we and how are we becoming?' Complexity theory provides three
insights: 1) we are open systems; 2) we are in a state of non-linear
equilibrium; and 3) we are emergent.

    Complex systems are open systems. Being complex, humans are
open systems as well. We bring in matter and energy and also produce
waste that leaves our `system' (Capra, 2005). We are connected with, and
constituted by, all of the relations in our lives, making us interconnected
beings with no hard boundaries of separation. We are not singularly
complex, but are assemblages of nested complex systems (Capra, 1996),
from our biological bodies to our complex extended minds.

    Complexity theory highlights the near impossibility of predicting
how any particular relation will influence the overall constitution of
a subject. This is because we are in a state of non-linear equilibrium.
While we are in a continual state of being constituted, we are often in
a generally stable, if non-linear, equilibrium. However, occasionally
we experience major life-changing moments (called bifurcations in
complexity theory), which can be caused by a very small nudge from
any one of our multitude of relations. This continually changing state
can be understood through probabilities but eludes any predictability.
156  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

Because of the interrelationality between all the groups of relations, any
relation can affect any other relation. Therefore, rather than perceiving
relations as summative (adding up all relations to get a final sum of
influence), they should be thought of as being interrelated in a complex
evolving web.

    The final concept that aids our understanding of our selves as
systems is the idea of emergence. In complexity theory, this is generally
referred to as autopoiesis. However, as mentioned, Haraway (2016) has
a more succinct way of referring to this process: sympoiesis. This term
means making-with rather than the self-making concept of autopoiesis.
This way of referring to the process of emergence moves away from the
idea of the autonomous self and more accurately reflects how we are
mutually being constituted with everything around us. This complex
entanglement increases our resilience as no one relation determines us.
Each relation's effect on us is enabled and constrained by many of our
other relations, all happening in a sympoietic moment that emerges
through time. While I began this chapter by introducing the groups of
relations separately, the groupings are not meant to keep relations apart,
but rather to allow the analysis of similarities and the ability to identify
aspects of what contributes to our constitution.

   Agency, Education, and Literacy: Understanding Degrees of Influence

Relating back to media literacy, how can the framework enhance our
awareness concerning the effects of our media relations? Increasing our
awareness allows us greater agency, without which we risk living as
beings determined by the technologies in our lives (Puech, 2016: 173).
One goal in philosophy of technology is in enhancing our awareness of
the effects of technology. As Yoni Van Den Eede (2016) argues, `From
McLuhan to Heidegger to Ihde to Latour to Feenberg, [...] a thread can
be said to run, uniting them in one great perceptual project: the spotting
of blind spots, and the accompanying attempt of remedying them'
(108). In order to become media-literate, we need to better understand
our own complex interrelational becoming, which allows us to situate
how our media relations interrelate with our other relations. In other
words, this framework provides a cartography that enables us to become
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   157

self-literate, becoming aware of all of our interrelationality, which then
allows us to become more media literate.

    What contributes to the amount of influence a particular relation has
at any particular moment? While we are being constituted through a
complex ecosystem of relations, all influencing each other in small and
large ways, they also can be affected by our agency and our awareness,
giving us the ability to--at least partially--manipulate the process of
our own becoming. We are dynamic assemblages of relations, most of
which we pay little or no attention to. However, many of these relations
are available to us to become aware of, which allows us the opportunity
to have some influence upon them.

    Some relations in our lives have a great impact upon us, while
others do not. This is often identified only in hindsight, though we
cannot be certain that we ever truly know the full extent of the impact
of any relation. For example, a person's ability to earn money derives
from many possible influences: the situation they were born into, their
upbringing, their immediate location, their level of education, their
culture, race, gender, or simply being in the right place at the right time.
Some relations are more difficult to change by a subject's agency. This
does not mean, however, that a subject is completely determined. The
subject has agency in how they interpret or understand this less flexible
relation. This is Foucault's (Foucault et al., 1987) point about awareness
of power: we cannot do much to change the fact that there is a power
relation, but we can change how we perceive and relate to the power
relation.

    Ideally, this new framework will help us better understand and utilize
our own agency, similar to the later Foucault. Tamar Sharon (2014: 168)
summarizes some of Foucault's ideas:

    Rather, freedom here is the possibility of modifying the impact of power
    on one's subjectivity, it is a practice of actively engaging with one's
    relationship to power and so a practice of subject constitution. Freedom
    is not about escaping structures of power but of interacting with them.
    Because there is no authentic or natural self that can be liberated, freedom
    lies in the dynamic, aesthetic and experimental self-creation undertaken
    in the practices of the self.

Sharon's take on Foucault situates the subject between being completely
independent and autonomous in relation to the world and being
158  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

completely determined by the structures of power that make up that
world. This is a very constructive starting point from which to think
about how humans can relate to the technological--as well as other--
relations that constitute them. This interrelating framework enables us
to create a perspective in order to better understand the relations of
influence. I prefer to use `relations of influence' rather than `relations
of power', as I feel it is a more inclusive and descriptive way to portray
these relations and their effects on us. These relations of influence are
not just between the thing of influence and the subject, there are also
interactions between the various relations.

    For example, in my role as a nature photographer I can look for the
interrelations that affect my photography: the physical place where I am
(the landscape, the weather, the lighting, etc.), as well as my sense of
identity (both mind-related and sociocultural). Also, my body (hunger
level, brain chemistry, physical ability to manipulate the camera
technology, etc.), and my historical experience with both the technology
and the place (have I been there before, do I know where I am going
or what I am trying to find) all influence me. Additionally, the future
intention of what I am trying to accomplish--my imagined potentiality
for the final image and my plans for that image, such as selling it,
sharing it with my social network, entering it for a competition, etc.--all
influence the photograph that I take. This is a very brief list of some
of the relations that comprise the interrelationality of my experience
taking nature photographs. In the next chapter I will use the framework
to analyze the relations and interrelations that I experienced in the
moment of taking a museum selfie, developing an instrument in the
process that can be generalized and used for media literacy.

                    Concluding Thoughts

Leveraging the concept of technological mediation and turning the
concept into a more inclusive and situating framework helps us to
circumvent our attachment to a specific group of relations, such
as focusing solely on the technological or the sociocultural. The
intrasubjective mediating framework helps deterritorialize the concept
of the individual, reterritorializing it into an interrelated human
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   159

becoming. In summary, there are three parts that make up the systemic
intrasubjective mediating framework:

        1. The transformations that occur from the relations in our
            lives are not neutral, and they continue to mediate us as we
            perceive and engage with the world through them. This is
            intrasubjective mediation.

        2. All of the relations in our lives can be gathered into six
            groups: technology, sociocultural, mind, body, space, and
            time.

        3. Human subjects can be understood as open and complex
            systems whose constituting relations are constantly
            interrelating in non-linear and emergent ways.

There can be a tendency to view how a specific technology influences
us in a singular manner. Even with the concept of multistability, we may
consider that only one variant is acting upon us at a time, co-constituting
our selves and our lifeworlds. This framework enables us to reflexively
comprehend specific effects that technologies have, allowing us to
more intentionally decide which technologies we invite into our lives
and how we use them. We are an inter- and intra-connected complex
assemblage moving through space and time, constantly becoming.
This framework helps to broaden our understanding that there is a
complexity of entangled relations, which constitute us. We experience
our being-in-the world as a complex, entangled experience of relations,
all influencing us whether we pay attention to them or not. Foregrounded
or backgrounded, a multitude of relations exist, and it is impossible to
disentangle them.

    This new framework enables the ability to identify the multiplicity
of relations that all contribute to our human experience of becoming.
We can think of the six groups as different mediums through which we
become. The framework can help us better understand the constituting
factors that contribute to our human becoming across cultures and
across time, aiding research in the social sciences by providing a
situating cartography. The framework helps researchers move beyond a
deterministic view, where subjectivity is determined by a single group
or subgroup (be it power, economy, class, gender, nature, nurture, etc.)
160  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

and beyond an `agency' view, where the subject has full agency and
other things like technology and culture are simply neutral.

                       Variations on Relations

While the framework includes what I consider to be an inclusive and
comprehensive organization of the differing relations that affect us, I
leave room for the unknown and even unknowable (cf. Fig. 5.1). One
of the main goals of postphenomenology and media ecology, as well
as several media literacy approaches, is to help us become aware of
the `ground' in the figure/ground concept. In other words, to help
us to perceive things that influence us but of which we are typically
unaware. Adding a placeholder for the unknown/unknowable keeps
our awareness open to the limits of what we know and helps compel us
to continue seeking new influencing relations.

    Additionally, I have been discussing the relations in our lives through
a positive lens, meaning relations that we are engaged with. However,
not having a relation is, in effect, a relation as well. Judith Butler (1993)
critiques Foucault's notions of discourse and materiality by saying they
`fail to account for not only what is excluded from the economies of
discursive intelligibility that he describes, but what has to be excluded
for those economies to function as self-sustaining systems' (35). In other
words, both our relations and our lack of relations--relations we may
not have access to for a myriad of reasons--constitute us. We therefore
can consider the absence of a relation as still a relation.

    What does it mean to be `human' in this age of ubiquitous digital
communication? How can we contextualize and situate both the benefits
and drawbacks of the transformative effects that ICTs have on humans as
subjects? Our communication mediums are transforming more quickly
than we as subjects and societies can completely adjust to. These changes
transform us in important ways that need to be evaluated alongside
of the changing media technologies. In other words, to fully become
media literate we need an ability to be self-literate--to understand that
a change in media technology causes a transformation in both our selves
and our lifeworlds. By better understanding how we are interrelatedly
constituted, we will be better able to judge new media and be better
equipped to decide if and how we invite them into our lives.
5. Developing the Intrasubjective Mediating Framework   161

    This is the agency that media literacy and this intrasubjective
mediating framework can enhance. However, how exactly can media
literacy leverage this framework? An instrument is needed to assist
with the pragmatic use of the framework in order to better situate the
effects of media technologies. In order to develop such an instrument, in
Chapter 6 I return to my experience taking a museum selfie and use it to
engage with the framework.

 6. Developing an Instrument to

     Leverage the Framework

With the intrasubjective mediating framework now explained, the next
step is to develop it into a practical instrument that can be used to facilitate
critical reflection and engagement with media. In order to do so, I return
to a museum selfie that I took while conducting a postphenomenological
study (Lewis, 2017). It was this experience that inspired my desire to
find a more inclusive framework beyond postphenomenology's focus
on technological relations. I begin this chapter with a description of this
event and then investigate the museum selfie through the development
of an instrument that helps identify the broad range of influencing
relations that contributed to both my own and the selfie's constitution. I
then generalize the instrument into an exercise1 that can be used to teach
media literacy.

    It was January 2017, and I was at the Art and History Museum2 in
Brussels to experience the fourth annual Museum Selfie Day, an event
started by London blogger and museum advocate, Mar Dixon.3 This
event occurs annually around the third week in January. Museum goers
are encouraged to upload their selfies to Twitter, Instagram, or other
social media sites and tag the images with the hashtags #MuseumSelfie

or #MuseumSelfieDay. From Mar Dixon's blog she describes it as `a
FUN DAY to encourage people to visit museums and participate a bit with
art or collections'.4 This event now spans the globe, taking place mostly
on Instagram and Twitter. There are increasing numbers of museums
that participate. In January, 2019, Turkey made it legal for people to take
museum selfies in more than 300 sites because of the museum selfie day.

    I became involved with museum selfie day because I had been
studying the effects of technology on museum visitor's experiences,
specifically using a philosophical style of analysis within philosophy
of technology called postphenomenology, which emphasizes how to
(pragmatically) understand the way technologies co-constitute both
our selves and our world (cf. Chapter 3). I decided to participate in the
event in order to experience how the selfie would contribute to both
my constitution as well as the museum's. While postphenomenology
helped me understand the technological relations of my museum selfie
experience, I also felt that there was something missing. The technological
mediation of taking and viewing selfies seemed to be only one aspect of
a larger complexity of mediating relations. I felt that I needed a more
comprehensive framework to fully understand what I was experiencing,
both technologically and otherwise, as I took my museum selfies. This
led to the framework I presented in the previous chapter.

                   Creating the Instrument

One challenge with theoretical ideas, even ones that are described as
`frameworks', is the ability to implement them in a practical and usable
manner.5 In this chapter I translate the framework into a concrete
instrument by using a museum selfie as a way to situate media literacy.
Specifically, I use the general groupings from the framework in order
to identify the specific relations and their effects that existed when I
created a museum selfie. This is done through a two-stage spreadsheet.
The first stage enables me to identify the multiple relations in each
group or subgroup that were involved when taking the museum selfie.

  4h ttp://mardixon.com/
  5Postphenomenology has a history of creating philosophical case studies in order

        to ground their investigations in the `real world'. This pragmatism has inspired my
        desire to create a practical instrument.
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   167

The second stage helps me to identify what I perceive to be the amount
that each of the identified relations was influenced by the other groups
and subgroups. By doing this, the phenomenon of the museum selfie
in Figure 6.1 is uncovered to reveal the complex interrelationality
that occurred--as analyzed autoethnographically--at a particular
moment in time. Even though the instrument uses numbers that can
have a semblance of objectivity, it is important to understand that these
numbers all reflect a subjective analysis.

         Identifying the Multiplicity of Relations

Rather than primarily focusing on the technological thing (the selfie) or
the constitution of the subject (myself), the framework stresses how the
relations and interrelations constitute both. I refer to this phenomenon
as the selfie-subject constitution, what Karen Barad (2007) identifies as
intra-action and postphenomenology calls co-constitution. While there
168  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

can be a tendency to view the subject-selfie phenomenon in a singular or
gestalt manner, the framework affords the ability to tease apart (but not
separate) the phenomenon in order to reveal the complex interrelations.
To begin with, every relation is a multi-relation. There is no `technological
relation' without a multiplicity of sociocultural, bodily, mind, temporal,
and spatial relations. The gestalt of a technological relation is actually a
unity of many relations as the example in Figure 6.2 demonstrates. This
figure updates the original co-constituting relation from Figure 3.1. We
perceive these multiple relations all at once, in a mostly singular/gestalt
manner. Figure 6.2 demonstrates a way of visualizing the unpacking of
this `singularity' into the different groups of relations that occur during
the museum selfie.

            Fig. 6.2 Multi-relationality of the Museum Selfie. Image by author (2020),
                                                 CC BY-NC 4.0.

The first questions for the instrument to help answer are: What are the
relations that were involved in this subject-selfie constitution; and How
much influence did they have? I use a spreadsheet (Table 6.1) in order to
brainstorm as many specific relations in each grouping that I can think
of that were influencing me at the moment when I took the museum
selfie. This step identifies the multiplicity of relations that contribute in
the `singular' moment of taking a selfie. The spreadsheet is organized to
use the framework as a facilitating cartography for self-inquiry, with the
groups and subgroups helping me to focus on a narrower portion of the
entirety of relations that could be contributing at the specific moment.

    After listing the relations in Table 6.1, I then provide a rating for how
much the relation influenced the subject-selfie constitution. I use a very
basic scale to do so. The numbers in the light blue cells represent this
influence as interpreted by me at a specific point in time, giving a three
                                   6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework                                                    169

for the most influencing and going down to a zero for relations with
no discernable influence. This interpretation is specific and changeable
over time (emphasizing why time is also a group of relations), as I
discovered when I went through the numbers months later. Totaling the
average influences for each group offers a general comparative sense
of how much each group impacts the subject-selfie constitution--again,
not in an objective sense--but in a subjectively interpretive sense as a
way to ask, How do I think and feel each of these groups influenced me
at the moment I took this museum selfie?

     Table 6.1 Relational Influences on Subject-selfie Constitution. Table by author (2020).

For the purpose of this research, I briefly analyze the groups and
subgroups that had an effect on the subject-selfie constitution. I do not
170  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

go into depth as to why I have given certain ratings and why I have
identified these specific relations. Instead, the emphasis is to develop
an instrument that can be used to encourage critical awareness of what
happens when I engage with a specific media technology. I believe that
this critical self-awareness is the key to helping people increase their
media literacy. The instrument provides an autoethnographic process
that people can use to investigate more deeply their relations with
technologies. I now examine the various groups and subgroups and
explain my thinking process for each in regards to the subject-selfie
constitution.

                                  Mind

I begin discussing the instrument by inquiring about the relations that
are connected with the mind. I identify subgroups of imagination,
identity, and awareness/perception to help narrow the focus and
facilitate uncovering influencing relations. While these are not the only
three subgroups that can make up the mind, I find them to be useful in
identifying relations that I experienced while taking the museum selfie.
After filling out Table 6.1, it is clear that the mind had the largest impact
upon the subject-selfie constitution according to my evaluation.

                                 Imagination

My imagination is the key relation that enables me to perceive the
possibility of taking the selfie with the bust. The creative ability of
my imagination is essential, a word not used lightly, especially in
postphenomenological circles.6 First, I use my imagination in order
to notice a potential selfie that combines both the museum object and
myself. I also have the desire to create a selfie with some aesthetics; a
certain amount of artistic quality. My imagination is assimilating many
variables in order to combine what I am seeing in order to create an
artistic selfie worthy (in my mind) of representing me, one that I want

  6Postphenomenology is avidly anti-essentialist, primarily using the concept of
        multistability to resist considering that technologies have any essential aspect to
        them. Additionally, it is the imagination that is the source for our ability to recognize
        technology (see Chapter 5).
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   171

to share with my social group (which is middle-income, predominantly
white, from U.S. or Europe, politically liberal, and educated).

                                   Identity

I next discuss the subgroup of identity. The construction of one's own
identity is, as John Falk (2009) notes, the main reason that visitors go to
museums. The selfie is a very effective tool for identity construction (cf.
Kozinets et al., 2017; Rettberg, 2014). Some questions of identity for me
include: Am I being, or constructing, an academic self? Do I want to be
funny or amusing for my friends? Am I trying to learn and follow the
curatorial framing of the museum objects? For me, for this particular
selfie, I am primarily being affected by my self-image as a photographer,
and I am attempting to create a selfie that has artistic merit. In part, I
want the selfie to demonstrate to an academic audience that selfies are
not necessarily superficial or narcissistic, but rather a vehicle for identity
construction.

    Another identity-influencing factor for this specific selfie comes from
my own experience. I studied Buddhism in Nepal for several months
and this particular bust of a meditating Buddha connects with my own
practice of meditation. This connection inspires me to compare myself
with the bust. I take the selfie to juxtapose my own path to enlightenment
while being present in the moment of taking a selfie, something that I
have conflicting feelings about. This conflict is likely why my own face
does not reflect the same peaceful state as that of the Buddha.

                            Perception/Awareness

The last subgroup of the mind that I use to analyze the selfie is that of
perception or awareness. My mind's directed perception (awareness)
is on creating artistic selfies. This excludes, or diminishes, my ability
to perceive other things or other aspects of my surroundings in the
museum. I am not paying close attention to the curatorial signage,
except occasionally when an object especially strikes my interest, or
when I want the name and title of the object because I have taken a selfie
with it. While my goal is primarily to make an artistic and aesthetically
pleasing selfie, my awareness is also directed toward my own experience.
172  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

I attempt to watch and take note of my experiences using the selfie-as-
technology, in a phenomenological manner.

    However, my awareness is usurped by the other museum visitors
because I am sensitive to how others might be perceiving me if they see
me taking a selfie. I have the sense that I am alienating the people in
my immediate proximity by what Galit Wellner (2016) calls the wall/
window aspect of smartphones. These phones can open a window to
a virtual social group but also create a wall for the surrounding people
in the area. I am concerned with alienating those around me, and this
focuses my attention on watching for other visitors while also looking
for possible selfies. The impact of the people around me is the most
unexpected aspect of my experience in the museum. This in part might
have to do with being in a different culture (Belgium instead of the U.S.)
and not wanting to draw attention to myself or make a cultural faux pas.

                                   Body

While I evaluate my mind's relations as the most influencing group,
my body's relations were the least influencing. This was likely because
my body, though just over fifty years old at the time of the selfie, was
still in decent shape and had no major physical impediments. The most
significant bodily challenge I experienced was my need for reading
glasses and the fact that my smartphone screen was quite small. My
eyes were no longer able to focus well on things that were close to
my face, causing me to rely on using reading glasses in order to see
things in detail that are near to me. I experienced this in the darkened
museum while attempting to take selfies. For the most part I chose
not to keep taking my reading glasses out of my coat pocket, even
though my compromised vision kept the technology from receding
into the background as I strained to see what was on the screen. This
also dissuaded me from doing any editing or using any filters or even
sending out any of the selfies that I took while in the museum.

    By the time I took the selfie with the bust I had been in the museum
for several hours. I was getting hungry and my feet were beginning
to ache. I broke my heel many years before, and after several hours of
walking I develop a significant amount of pain. Both the hunger and the
pain contributed to a desire to leave the museum. Therefore, at the point
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   173

where I took the bust selfie, I was beginning to hurry, bypassing some
museum objects that could potentially make for good selfies. However,
the opportunity with the bust and my imaginative ability to see the
potential of the selfie was able to overcome my bodily desire to keep
walking to the exit.

                                  Time

Temporal relations include the direct past and future relations. An
example of the direct past relation in my experience of taking a museum
selfie is my consideration of the head of the Buddha being from the
seventeenth century and wonder at how it had come through all of the
years to wind up at the museum. Much of what is in museums is geared
toward objects and cultures from the past.

    The future-directedness is also an influence. My desire to create a
selfie is one of the most influential aspects in how I perceive and relate
with the museum as I walk around. I am less focused on the objects for
what they are and more focused on how they can make an interesting
and artistic selfie. One of my goals is to share the selfie online with the
hashtag #museumselfieday. This inspires me to take a selfie that I can be
proud of, one that has artistic merit in my eyes and hopefully the eyes of
others. I am also using the experience as an academic investigation for
my research. Therefore, I am being self-reflexive, as I am analyzing my
own experience as I experience it.

    The future also affects the present because I have something to do after
the museum visit, and by the time I arrive at the Buddha sculpture I am
`running out of time'. This, along with my bodily fatigue, contributes to
my sense of rushing through the last part of the museum. Alternatively,
if I had no plans and was using the museum to `pass time', then I would
experience the opposite effect. I would likely linger longer at objects that
seemed interesting.

                                  Space

One of the main influencing relations regarding proximity that affected
taking the museum selfie was how close I could get to the museum
artifact. Many of the objects in the temporary Ukiyo-E exhibit were
174  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

encased in glass or separated from the public by ropes. I found that,
especially with the dim lighting, I needed to get quite close to the objects
in order to create a good selfie. For this particular selfie (see Fig. 6.1)
the object was simply on a pedestal, and I was able to get quite close
and therefore able to juxtapose my head with the statue. The other
proximity factor, which I have already alluded to, was the proximity of
other people (cf. above and below).

    Though nature did not play an active role in the creation of the
museum selfie, it often plays a significant role in many other situations.
However, the role it played in the museum selfie constitution was one
of absence. The lack of nature and natural light can also be a significant,
if subtle, relation. Our disconnection with nature affects us. After being
inside a completely constructed and controlled environment for many
hours it was a pleasure to leave and enter the park surrounding the
museum.

                             Sociocultural

This grouping of relations contains many relevant subgroups. If I am
performing a primarily critical media literacy investigation, this group
would be one of the most extensive sections in my analysis. There are
various normative relations that can be identified. I ask myself the
predominant question: Who is judging me? As a foreigner living in
Brussels, there is the question of belonging. Even though Brussels is a
very international city and the majority of people are not native to the
city, as a non-European citizen there is a part of me that does not quite
feel like I belong. This is a much smaller element of self that arises than
if I lived in another city such as Paris, where there is a stronger sense
of cultural identity, which leads those who are not originally from the
culture to feel othered by those who are. Also, if other people are taking
selfies, I potentially feel less uncomfortable. Or, if I am a person who is
an active selfie taker, I likely would feel less self-imposed judgment.

                        Sociocultural - Normativity

My biggest surprise was my own feeling of self-consciousness for taking
selfies. While this was `museum selfie day', there were no other people
that I came across who were taking selfies. For this particular museum,
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   175

the day was not being promoted, so I did not feel any official approval
for taking selfies. While there was no demonstrable hostility towards
me, I did my best not to be noticed taking selfies. This was not a small
concern but an intrusive feeling that greatly impeded my selfie taking.
The influence of this particular relation was more determining than
any other relation that day, and one that came as a surprise as I was
expecting to mainly be concentrating on how the technological relations
were influencing me. This demonstrated my own too-narrow approach
when I went to engage with my research.

                          Sociocultural - Language

Language plays a significant role in how we are constituted and is deeply
connected with our sociocultural relations. As a native English speaker
and a person who has a passable amount of French, I can understand
most of the museum signage and explanations. Most of the other visitors
do not speak English and, if they do speak French, I do not attend to what
they are saying. There are times when language, or lack of language,
can play a more influential role. There is also a way of using language
as a dominant approach to understanding how we are constituted (cf.
Coeckelbergh, 2017 for a study on language and technology). However,
in an attempt to limit the scope of my investigation, I create a placeholder
for this topic but I do not fully engage with it here.

                       Sociocultural - Power/Politics

I have visited many museums over the course of my life, so I feel quite
comfortable in the role of a museum visitor. I do not feel out of place,
except for while I am taking selfies. This can be a combination of two
cultural aspects. The first I describe above under normativity. The second
is more along the lines of Foucault's perspective of power relations
and the control of institutions like museums upon the society. I have
been brought up (and this relates to my own sedimented experience
with museums) with the idea that museums are the epitome of culture
and they hold a certain reverence for me. Analyzing the research, it is
clear that selfies are not just one thing; they can be both powerful and
significant vehicles to construct or share one's identity (Abidin, 2016;
176  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

Dinhopl & Gretzel, 2016; Hess, 2015; Kozinets et al., 2017; Rettberg,
2014; Risam, 2018; Senft & Baym, 2015). There are now many genres of
selfies, some of which include: refugee, political, gender-diverse, and
other genres that help bring marginalized groups a way to be seen.

    While selfies enable identity construction, they also reflect a
disruption in the museum experience (Clines, 2017; Kozinets et al.,
2017; Lewis, 2017; Russo et al., 2008). As Mar Dixon's definition of
museum selfie day demonstrates, selfies have a bias towards fun
and entertainment, which does not mean they cannot be used for
serious matters, only that one of their primary uses has been geared
toward amusement. This can conflict with the traditional approach to
museums, which has had a more serious and austere presence, one
directed more towards education than entertainment. Even though
education and entertainment need not be mutually exclusive, one of
the challenges is the expectation of museum visitors. People wanting
a quiet and reflective moment with an object may likely object to
other `less serious' visitors who simply want to capture an interesting
selfie to share with their friends. I experience a conflicting, or at
least ambiguous, feeling while taking museum selfies. I recognize an
internal judgment and question if I am being disrespectful towards
these cultural objects, wondering if I am belittling their cultural past
and their present cultural role within the museum.

                       Sociocultural - Museum Effect

There is a sociocultural phenomenon called the museum effect. Valerie
Casey (2003) is one of several researchers who analyzes museum
visitor-object relationships and describes the museum itself as having
an effect on everything, both people and objects, which enter through
its doors. Museums re-contextualize objects from their origins through
specific narratives, proximity to other objects, the use of labels, and
through contextualizing meta-language. However, Casey (2003) and
others (cf. Malraux, 1967; Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, 1998; Henning, 2006;
and Alpers, 1991) point out that objects also become meaningful just by
entering through the doors of the museum. They become identified as
culturally important by virtue of being chosen by a museum. Again, the
idea of enabling and constraining is raised. The importance of the object
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   177

might be enabled, but seeing the object for its original purpose--or even
in new ways by the visitor without the filter of the museum--is now
constrained (Lewis, 2017: 95).

                              Technology

There are both simple and complicated technologies that contribute to
the subject-selfie constitution. However, if artificial intelligence (AI)
software is developed for smartphone cameras, then it may not be too
long before complex technologies can also play a role in museum selfies.
Until then, I can integrate AI through Google's Deep Dream Generator7
to manipulate photos. Figure 6.3 is an example of this hybrid human-AI
collaboration. While I supply the original photo (see Fig. 6.1), the Deep
Dream Generator uses its own AI algorithm in order to manipulate the
original. I still have some control in deciding which type of manipulation
I want and how much I want it manipulated, but otherwise the AI
accomplishes the actual process.

    The smartphone is a very complicated device with many functions.
For selfies, I see through the smartphone screen, meaning there is an
embodied relation happening. And, while I could be using the phone's
black and white filter (the final selfie is in black and white), I take
the selfie in color, knowing I can alter it with software on my home
computer at a later time. As I situate myself next to the bust that I want
my selfie to be with, I look through the iPhone screen, which shows me
how my selfie will turn out thanks to the front-facing camera. While this
enables me to compose the selfie, it also constrains my depth perception
and the wider area around me, cutting out a visual chunk of reality.
This constraint has, unfortunately, contributed to the damage of several
museum objects such as a statue of St. Michael in Lisbon (Lewis, 2017).

    While I could take advantage of the digital image, which affords
the possibility--unlike a print photograph--to immediately upload
the selfie to social networks, allowing my friends to more temporally
share in the actual moment with me, I choose to wait until later to do so.
This is in part due to my difficulty focusing on the small screen of my
phone, but it also allows me to take my time in making adjustments to
the images using the software and larger screen on my laptop.

In my experience taking a museum selfie, there are also many simple
technologies at work. For instance, the bust sits upon a pedestal, which
is lucky for me as it allows me to get close. In contrast, other museum
objects have ropes keeping visitors from approaching too close to the
museum objects. If we think of technology as a continuum, moving
from simple to complicated to complex, my clothes might be considered
as being between simple and complicated technology; they influence
my movement, what I can carry in pockets, and if I am warm or cool
in temperature. Museum lighting also influences taking the selfie and
can be considered on the continuum between simple and complicated.
Other simple aspects related to technological relations concern things
like my glasses and the phone's camera lens being clean or needing to
be cleaned.
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   179

     Intrasubjective Mediation and the Relational Groups

Besides the direct relations just explained, I experience a lot of
intrasubjective mediation (ISM) related to previous experiences. This is
captured by the question, How do my past experiences mediate the selfie-
subject constitution? To demonstrate the influence of intrasubjective
mediation, I briefly review how my past experiences with each group of
relations influence the subject-selfie constitution intrasubjectively.

                                Mind and ISM

Before going to the museum, I conducted research on museums, selfies,
and museum selfies in particular. There were many different types of
selfies, and exploring the range of some of what had come before gave
me ideas of how I could potentially frame myself with the museum
object. These possible framings allowed me to overlay them with the
museum objects I was coming across. In addition, my experience as a
semi-professional photographer influenced my ability to imagine and
compose the selfies that I was taking.

                                Body and ISM

The primary temporal effect on my bodily relations was the sedimented
action of taking selfies with my smartphone, which involved physically
manipulating not only the settings of the camera phone, but also
situating my body in relation to the camera, myself, and the museum
object--holding the camera in such a way that I could then take the
selfie when everything was aligned. This was awkward to do at first, but
eventually the action became more embodied and the manipulation of
the technology became more transparent.

                               Space and ISM

While I had been in many museums throughout my life, I had never
been in the Art and History Museum. This made me unsure of the
layout of the museum and somewhat hesitant as I explored. I did not
know what there was to see or even how much there was to see. This
lack of experience made me unsure and a bit unsettled in my mind as
180  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

I attempted to navigate beyond the main Ukiyo-e exhibit and enter the
permanent collection area.

                           Sociocultural and ISM

Because I have had many experiences in European museums, I felt
comfortable being there. And, because of my limited amount of
experience taking selfies in public, I did not feel comfortable doing that.
Part of this stemmed from my own upbringing. As a child, I was taught
not to disturb others when in public and to not draw undue attention to
my self. I have also run across U.S. citizens in Europe who, unfortunately,
fell into a stereotype of being loud and seemingly oblivious to the culture
around them. Not behaving in that way has always been a goal of mine,
especially when in another culture.

                            Technology and ISM

Part of this relation was explained with the body-ISM section above. My
use of taking photos with my smartphone, not just selfies, contributed
to my ability to manipulate the technology in order to take the museum
selfie. My past experience with social media also gave me ideas about
how I might want to use filters or hashtags when I uploaded the selfie
to social media.

    This concludes the overview of the first step in using the instrument
to identify and evaluate some of the relevant relations that exist when I
take a selfie (see Fig. 6.1). However, the experience is more complex than
simply a multiplicity of these primary relations. The term `primary' is
used here to indicate the direct relation between a subject and whatever
they are relating with, no matter what relational grouping is involved.
However, there are secondary interrelations that affect these primary
relations. These are discussed next.

                           Interrelationality

The direct relations discussed above are both enhanced or constrained
by other relations. There are no standalone relations. While all relations
and interrelations happen in one moment of co-constitution, we can
gently pull apart the phenomenon of this interrelating moment in order
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   181

to identify some of the complex entanglement. Therefore, the next
step consists of analyzing how relations from other groups affect the
relations listed previously. The instrument is one way to engage with the
framework in order to provide clarity without removing the complexity
altogether. The goal of the instrument is to create a practical way to
leverage the framework for a specific situation. The framework itself
should be viewed in an open way, available for creative interpretation
by whomever is using it.

    While Table 6.1 demonstrates each specific relation's influence on the
subject-selfie constitution, it is Table 6.2 that captures the interrelations
that occur. This table shows the relations in Table 6.1 and then adds
how I felt (at the time) each group or subgroup of relations influenced
each specific relation. This table reflects the entanglement of the
interrelations that contribute to the constitution of the subject-selfie. As
with most quantifiable representations of reality, the numbers should
only be considered a snapshot in time and are embedded with bias and
interpretation. However, my intent is less to show the specific detail of
exactly how each group interrelates and influences each other than to
portray the broader effect of interrelationality in order to emphasize the
fact that any situation is comprised of not just one relation, even though
we experience an event in a gestalt manner.

    The right-hand columns should be read in a downward direction,
reflecting how the relations in that group or subgroup influence the
direct relations listed on the left. For example, the far-right column
`Technology' is listed as affecting the first direct relation: `See museum
object and imagine possible selfie' with a moderate influence (value=2).
By filling out this spreadsheet, the media user can be guided to reflexively
identify many underlying relations that they may not have noticed
and also analyze the interrelating influences from a variety of sources.
The spreadsheet is a way to realize how media are situated within an
entanglement of relations, all interrelating and influencing each other.

    After assigning a value for each interrelating relation, I create an
average for the group or subgroup for each section. I then take this
average (or the largest subgroup average) and create Table 6.3. This
table reflects the significant interrelating impact of one group on another
group. This table should be read left to right. For instance, the first line
shows that relations from the mind group have a significant impact of

2.2 upon the direct relations in the body group. The averages allow us
to reflect on the asymmetry involved between the groups, meaning one
group might affect another group significantly but is not significantly
affected in return. For example, reversing the mind to body example just
used, the body only has a slight influence of 1.1 upon the direct relations
involving the mind. Reviewing the table also is a chance to question the
results. For instance, the table reflects that technology greatly influences
spatial relations (2.9). At the same time, spatial relations only slightly
influence technological relations (.5). Is this true? Can I analyze this
result to bring up counter relations that disprove this outcome?

                                          by author (2020).

The summary of averages in Table 6.3 is not to be used to indicate
general truisms between groups, but rather it reflects the media user's
specific experience of interrelations concerning a specific selfie at a
specific time. Since the table is filled out on the micro level of specific
relations, the averages enable me to check the results on a macro level.
This can help facilitate a deeper investigation and help me potentially
think of relations that I did not at first consider. I present this table in
order to demonstrate various ways researchers can use the framework
and instrument in order to engage with interrelational influences for
specific research investigations.

                              Complexity

Interrelationality rests upon a foundation of complexity (cf. Chapter
4). It is not actually possible to come up with an objective number
that represents the influence of any one relation. While this subjective
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   185

analysis might rankle a reader looking for objective truth, that is not the
goal of this framework or instrument. The goal is to better understand
the human subject. An important aspect of complexity relating to
the evaluation of this instrument is that, as complex systems, we are
emergent, non-linear, and open systems.

    Complexity can be understood historically, but it is unable to predict
the impact of future relations. When we rate our relations, we are doing
so after that fact, meaning that we are rating our perception of the
actual effect that the relation caused. For example, before I went to the
museum it did not even occur to me that the proximity of other people
would affect me. However, this relation was the most significant of all
influences. An interesting experiment would be to complete a version
of the instrument before actually participating in an event, and then
complete another one after the event in order to compare expectations
and the actual experience. I explore various ways of generalizing the
framework and instrument in the next section.

    The culminating spreadsheet (Table 6.2) was, in a way, an endpoint
to my beginning. I began investigating technological relations by
experiencing taking museum selfies and comparing that experience to
the postphenomenological approach that I was studying. However, what
I experienced was not completely captured by postphenomenology, and
so I began to expand my search in an attempt to more fully connect
theory and practice. This led to asking about the `I' that was experiencing
and gathering concepts from various fields of study in order to bring
them altogether. Looking back shows a clear path, but when I was going
forward through this experience it was an open process without the
intention of creating a framework or tool that could help with media
literacy. This reflected the complex process that was emergent and not
predictable.

    Even if they happen to be virtual interactions, our interactions
with media and media technologies happen in `real life'. In order to
understand the complexity that is involved, it is helpful to investigate
some of the specific interrelations involved in order to then have a
better understanding of how the media relations are situated and
interconnected within our own lifeworld. While domestication theory
(cf. Chapter 2) makes the important step to include the context of the
media use, the intrasubjective mediating framework attempts to situate
186  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

our media use even further. The next section continues implementing
the theory by investigating how the theory and instrument discussed in
this section might be pragmatically used for enhancing media literacy.

      Generalizing the Framework and Instrument
                      for Media Literacy

Now that the intrasubjective mediating framework and instrument
have been developed through the analysis of a museum selfie, I begin
exploring how they could be generalized for media education. I do this
by imagining the instrument being used in a university-level media
studies or media literacy course. I am not presenting a fully formed
curriculum, but simply a possible way to practically implement this
posthuman approach. Though it can be used in other ways, for example
with younger students, I believe starting with the university level is a
good initial choice as younger students would likely need the instrument
to be re-worked and simplified.

    I had the good fortune to be able to lead a small group of Master's
level students through a course designed around this posthuman
approach. This allowed me to perform a small initial usability study
for the framework and instrument, which provided valuable feedback
and a chance to generalize the instrument and create an exercise just
before the publication of this book. The instructions for the exercise are
below. Updated instructions, as well as a generalized and simplified
spreadsheet, are available on the listing for this book on Open Book
Publishers' website.8

    It is through the process of doing the exercise that students will more
fully grasp the academic ideas discussed so far. Through my work at
Prescott College in the U. S., I have found that experiential education
is one of the strongest pedagogical tools that a teacher can employ.
The exercise below can allow students to experience the concepts for
themselves, allowing the learning to become more deeply embodied.

    My hope is that many teachers will find a seed of inspiration in this
approach to media literacy and will continue developing unique ways

to leverage the framework as a pedagogical instrument. Douglas Kellner
and Jeff Share (2005) note, `Computer and multimedia technologies
demand novel skills and competencies and if education is to be relevant
to the problems and challenges of contemporary life, engaged teachers
must expand the concept of literacy and develop new curricula and
pedagogies' (369-70).

    This autoethnographic approach can specifically help people reflect
on the influences involved when they engage with media in order to
become more aware of how media is situated within a complexity of
interrelations. The media affect and are affected by these interrelations.
As Kellner and Share (2005) also point out, `Individuals are often
not aware that they are being educated and constructed by media
culture, as its pedagogy is frequently invisible and unconscious' (372).
The posthuman approach acts as a cartography to help reveal these
influences.

       Posthuman Approach Exercise: Learning by Doing

How can we critically evaluate the effects of technologies in order to decide if
and how to engage with them?

The goal of this exercise is to help students reflect on the complexity
of influences involved when they engage with technologies in order
to become more aware of how they are situated within a complexity
of interrelations. All technologies affect and are affected by these
interrelations. This exercise is used to reveal (foreground) the many
relations that are simultaneously happening when we engage with
technologies. This posthuman approach acts as a cartography to help
reveal these hidden influences, bringing us to the point of being able to
critically decide how we want to engage with them.

    The term `engagement' refers to the student's phenomenological
experience with a specific innovative technology. The student here
puts aside their judgement and strives to become aware of the various
relations that are occurring at the time of their experience with the
technology. The first step of deciding which technology to engage with
(and exactly how) is critical, as some types of technologies may work
well and others may not. Modification and improvements, in discussion
with the instructor, are welcomed.
188  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    A conceptual review:

    · The relations in our lifeworld transform us through a continual
        interrelating process, enabling and constraining our selves
        and each other.

    · The relations can be gathered into loose groupings, though
        not all relations can be known or are knowable.

    · These relations interrelate--enhancing and constraining each
        other--in complex (potentially non predictive) ways.

Through awareness of these points, we have the ability to increase our
agency.

Step One: Identify

Identify a technology that you want to engage with. Be specific in what
you will experience. This will be an autoethnographic investigation,
as you will be analyzing yourself engaging with a specific technology
in a specific way during a specific time. For instance, instead of
investigating `how Instagram affects teenage youths', narrow it down
to investigating `Recording and sharing my exercise workout through
fitness selfies on Instagram'. It would also be possible to compare two
similar experiences, one using a recent technology and another using a
technology it replaced. For example, compare the exploration of a new
city through a GPS based smartphone app to experiencing a new city
with a paper map.

    The instructor should approve the idea before continuing. The
instructor may also want the student to do some background research
about the technology. This can help the student become more familiar
and understand what preceding technologies transformed into the
one they are studying. For instance, the smartphone evolved from the
phone, the camera, the GPS navigation system, and the computer (to
name a few). The student will describe the specific engagement chosen
on the spreadsheet (cf. Table 6.4), recording: Date, time, and duration of
engagement. Also, include the location and conditions (busy, rainy, etc.)
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   189

Step Two: Framework

Review the framework (Fig. 5.1), understanding the six interconnected
groups and the concept of intrasubjective mediation. To review,
intrasubjective mediation is the idea that every relation transforms us
in some manner, and that these transformations continue to affect the
way we perceive and engage with the world (these transformations can
be thought of as embodied relations). If there is a need or compelling
reason, identify specific subgroups, or even a specific group for extra
attention. Most students will likely use the framework as is. The
framework is the foundation for the instrument.

Step Three: Pre-assessment

This is a general inquiry as to what the student believes will be the most
influencing relations when they engage with the technology. The student
should identify at least two or three possible relations (or questions to
ask themselves) in each group in order to begin thinking about the
different relations and specific relations. This allows the student to begin
exploring the identification of relations.

Step Four: Engage

Intentionally engage with the event. Focus on being aware of the
various relations involved. Approach the event as a phenomenological
experience, attempting to bracket your own biases and judgement to
become aware of all of the various relations that are involved. In other
words, you will be engaging with the technology and, at the same time,
opening your awareness to the often-hidden background relations.
Think about the groups and subgroups to help guide your awareness to
these background relations.

    Depending upon the event, it could be helpful to have a field journal
to take notes and write down the specific relations. This will depend
upon the event and how it is orchestrated. Writing down the relations
helps acknowledge them without needing try and remember them.
Patiently stay with the event, giving it time for new relations to surface.
It is likely helpful to focus on one grouping of relations at a time and
keep asking yourself what types of relations are happening that relate
to that particular group.
Table 6.4 Example of Posthuman Spreadsheet. Table by author (2021), CC BY 4.0.
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   191

Step Five: Identifying and Evaluating Direct Relations

Now it is time to fill in the relations on the spreadsheet. Brainstorm
all the relations that you can think of, taking advantage of the groups
and subgroups to focus your inquiry. Write them down in column
B. Remember that you can use, or modify, any of the pre-assessment
relations you had written down in Step Three. You can write these as
questions (how did the rain affect me?) or statements (I was affected
by the rain). Ask yourself, what are all the possible relations within this
group/subgroup that had an influence on the constitution of my self or
the event being analyzed? These can be thought of as `direct' relations.
Analyze how they had influence upon the co-constitution of you and the
technological event you engaged with. Use a 3 for highly influencing;
2 for moderately influencing; 1 for slightly influencing; and 0 for no
discernable influence. It is not necessary to overthink these evaluations
(unless you have a compelling reason to do so).

    A note about the `PH Instrument' spreadsheet: The spreadsheet (see
Table 6.4) has formulas built into it which automatically average the
ratings you will enter in Steps Five and Six. It also contains an `Analysis'
worksheet that incorporates the averages of the interrelations for Step
Seven. Therefore, be careful to not delete these cells. They will show
`###' until you enter numbers into the cells above them. If you have lost
one of the cells that averages, you can copy an adjacent cell that has the
formula and try pasting. Or, you can download a new spreadsheet and
start over. If you would like to modify the spreadsheet in some way (for
instance, adding subgroups), check with the instructor.

    Come up with 8-10 relations for each main group. Consider if there
are any subgroups that you want to focus on specifically. If you are
not finding enough relations, you might look at a general relation you
listed and see if you can break it into more specific parts. For example,
instead of listing that `the physical museum affected my experience',
I could break that into how the museum's lighting affected me, how
the rope barriers between me and the art affected me, how the glass
cases housing museum artefacts affected me, etc. Some groups will be
easier than others to come up with 8-10 relations, but stick with it. You
should also look for slightly influencing relations, not just ones that had
a significant influence.
192  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    Some possible questions for each group that you can ask yourself in
order to uncover more relations are:

Mind:
    · What are your intentions?
    · How is your mind directing your awareness/perception?
    · What is the state of your mind (relaxed, stressed, etc.)?
    · Which senses are you focusing on?
    · How is your imagination engaged?

Body:
    · What is the current state of your body (tired, hungry,
        temperature, any pains, etc.)?
    · How are your bodily abilities enabling/constraining you?
    · What bodily skills are you engaged with?
    · How are your bodily sense organs being affected: sounds,
        smells, tastes, feelings, vision?

Space:
    · What is immediately surrounding you, and how is it affecting
        you?
    · What attributes of the physical space are enabling and
        constraining?
    · How is the space around you specifically affecting your
        engagement with the media?
    · What is the composite of the space between `natural' and
        `human made'?
    · If you are outside, what is the weather and how is it affecting
        you?

Time:
    · What is the history of the media you are engaged with?
    · Have your own experiences with the specific media changed
        how you interact with it? If so, how?
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   193

    · What future plans are involved, and how do they affect your
        use?

    · What other past experiences have contributed to the current
        engagement?

Sociocultural:
    · What normative influences are you experiencing?
    · Are you feeling judged or judging yourself?
    · How is language playing a role?
    · Are there any gender, class, power, or racial influences?
    · Are you feeling empowered or marginalized?

Technological:
    · What are the basic technologies that are affecting you (such as
        glasses, clothes, etc.)?
    · What different technological relations are you experiencing
        (embodied, hermeneutic, alterity, or background)?
    · How are the various technological mediums influencing you?
    · What are the technological infrastructures in place for you
        to experience the media (wireless technology, servers,
        corporations, electricity/batteries...)?

Draft Due: Before proceeding to Step Six, the instructor should review
the student's work up until this point. This is a chance to make sure the
student understands how to identify and describe the various relations
that are occurring. Are the relations in the proper groups? Are the
relations clearly articulated? Are there also relations listed with low
influence? Do all the relations fit under the specific engagement or are
there some unrelated relations mentioned? The student should revise
their work before going onto the next step.

Step Six: Evaluating Interrelations

The next step is to evaluate the interrelations that affected the direct
relations noted above. The right-most columns (E through J) on the
spreadsheet provide you the space to evaluate how the other relations
194  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

influenced each direct relation listed in Step Five. Keep the specific
relation listed in column B in your mind and then ask if it was affected
in any way by relations within the interrelational group you are
evaluating. Use the most influential relation you can think of for each
group and rate it from 3 to 0. The general purpose here is to identify and
demonstrate the interconnections that occur, reflecting the complexity
of interrelationality.

    For instance, if my direct relation was `See museum object and
imagine a possible selfie' then I would ask myself how much the Mind
relations affected this relation. Clearly, they had a lot of influence, so
I put a 3 under the Mind group. How about Body relations? At the
current time my body was beginning to get tired, so I would put down
a 2. However, if there was something more significantly wrong with me,
either my eyesight was failing, or I had another condition going on, this
could have been a 3. How about Time relations? Well, my experiences
seeing other museum selfies did affect me a bit, but the future potential
relation really affected my engagement, so I would list a 3 under Time.
Space was also a 3 since I was being mediated by the museum setup
in how close I could get and how well lit the object was. Sociocultural
relations were affecting me either as a 2 or 3 depending upon how many
people were around me. And the technology itself was also affecting me
as a 2 or 3 as I had to manipulate my smartphone in order to take the
selfie.

    What we are trying to do is to quantify complex relations. While this
is ultimately impossible in any objective sense, we are simply trying to
give approximate numbers to an interpretation of an interrelation at a
particular point in time, and our evaluation will be influenced by many
things. Do not worry about getting things exactly right. Instead, it is okay
to simply give a subjective number that is `good enough' to represent the
particular scenario you have in your mind at that moment. There will be
many ways that each group will interrelate with the specific relation
you are looking at. Simply choose the most influential one that you can
think of.

Step Seven: Analyze

After finishing step 6, take a step back from the details you have
recorded and reflect if they make sense in a broader perspective. At the
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   195

bottom of each group's column are the averages, showing summative
data. Looking at the tabs on the bottom of the worksheet (Fig. 6.4), you
will notice that you have been working in the `PH Instrument' tab. There
is also an `Analysis' tab. Click on this tab and you will be able to see in
Table 1 (see Fig. 6.5) the averages for each group's direct relations (total
averages for each group from column C) as well as Table 2 that shows
the interrelational averages (see Fig. 6.5).

     Fig. 6.4 Worksheet tabs for switching between PH Instrument and Analysis. Image by
                                          author (2021), CC BY 4.0

The first step is to analyze the average numbers for each group's direct
influence on your engagement with the technology in Table 1. The total
averages allow for a quick glance and a chance to analyze the numbers
to see if they make sense to you. This is an opportunity for questioning
and critique. Look especially at the highest and lowest averages. Does
this seem to reflect your overall sense of your engagement with the
technology? These results reflect how we are perceiving the situation
at the moment we record the numbers. Can we change our perception?
How are our own biases influencing these results? If there are things
that do not seem right, can you think of either additional relations or
ways of modifying the direct relations you evaluated in order for the
average to better represent your experience?

    Now, look at Table 2. This table is read from left to right. This reflects
how influential the groups on the left were in co-influencing the direct
relational groups on the right. This directionality can be interesting.
To help explore the table, find the group that is most different from its
reverse. For example, the Sociocultural group on the left might show a
2.5 influence over the Time group on the right, but the Time group on
the left might only have a 1.0 influence over the Sociocultural group on
the right. Do the results make sense? Are you surprised by any of the
results?

    We can also perform a general evaluation of the entire process. Are
there other influences not captured by this worksheet, and if so, do they
Fig. 6.5 Tables 1 and 2 for analysis. Image by author (2021), CC BY 4.0.
6. Developing an Instrument to Leverage the Framework   197

fit somewhere or is another group or subgroup needed? For the lowest-
rated groups, might there be relations that have not been considered
within the group? Or, might it be necessary to enter a disclaimer stating
that a particular group or subgroup was not focused on, acknowledging
that there could be significant relations that had influence but lay
outside the scope of the specific analysis? And finally, acknowledge the
fact that we cannot know all of the relations that affect us. Not only
are there some that are unknown, but there are those that are simply
unknowable. Being aware that there are unknowable relations helps us
keep a more realistic perspective on our own becomingness.

Step Eight: Critical Assessment

The first seven steps are all about increasing our own awareness of a
relation we have with a specific technology. We did this by attempting to
set aside our judgement in order to simply become aware of how we were
engaging with technology. Now is the time to bring the judgement back
and critically (and affirmatively) evaluate your relation with the media
technology you engaged with. Your agency and empowerment reside
in taking the `uncovered' relational affects and deciding what you want
to do about this new awareness. What kind of lifeworld do you want
to co-create? Describe both positive and negative aspects of engaging
with this specific technology. Do this for both your own perspective
(how it is for you), and then more broadly for society as a whole. What
are some of the broader ramifications of this technology? What would
you recommend people keep in mind when engaging with it? What are
ways to mitigate its negative effects and hang onto its positive effects?

                    Concluding Thoughts

The museum selfie is an entanglement of culture (power, normativity,
and language), history, space, time (both past and future), the mind
(identity, imagination, memory), and technology. While I created
a quantitative instrument to better understand this entanglement, I
also thought about how I could represent the underlying complexity
in a gestalt manner, visually displaying the general complexity of
interrelations that have an effect upon taking the museum selfie. To
do so, I used a program called Circos (http://circos.ca/) to create a
198  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

background for the museum selfie. I took the data in Table 6.2 and, after
many hours of experimenting, created the visual gestalt of Figure 6.6.
While this visually displays the complexity of interrelationality behind
the museum selfie, it of course loses much of the specific details.

                             using Circos. Image by author (2019), CC BY-NC 4.0.

Something similar could be added to the exercise above. For students, it
would be an interesting task to creatively represent their own experience,
something beyond the spreadsheet. This would allow them to engage
with their experience in a more creative manner, giving them another
chance to think about the complexity of relations that are involved when
they engage with technology.

    The benefit of the instrument developed in this chapter is how it
can help us become aware by foregrounding the many relations that
are occurring at any given moment. For media literacy, this allows us
to better situate any media or media event that we are interested in
investigating, interconnecting the event with the broad spectrum of
constituting relations. The framework and instrument together can act
as a facilitating cartography, helping to direct our inquiry both broadly
and specifically in a posthuman approach.

7. Conclusion

The primary aim of this study was to create a way to situate and
contextualize media literacy in order to better understand how we are
affected by the ubiquitous media technologies that comprise our daily
existence. This study first investigated the current state of media literacy
and then took an interdisciplinary approach in order to leverage useful
concepts from the fields of postphenomenology, media ecology, and
philosophical posthumanism. The intent was to create a posthuman
approach consisting of a framework and instrument that could be used
by media literacy to facilitate our understanding of how the human
subject is influenced by media technologies, thereby increasing our
agency and helping us decide which media technologies we want in
our lives.

    This results in a facilitating cartography for both students and
researchers to retain a broad perspective while investigating the unique
relations that contribute to a subject's continual constitution as they
move through their life. In this conclusion, I summarize my findings
concerning how to expand media literacy. I then reflect on strengths and
weaknesses of the study. I conclude with further recommendations for
how the posthuman approach could be used outside of media literacy.

Summary of Main Findings

My main findings involve understanding how media literacy should be
expanded to include a focus on the medium, as well as on the broader
context within which media relations are situated. I found that it was

202  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

first necessary to clarify a contemporary understanding of what a
human subject is and how it is continually being constituted through its
relations. Following this, I developed the concept of an intrasubjective
mediating framework and instrument that can then help us explore our
use of specific media through identifying the interrelated constituting
relations that are concurrently involved.

                     Expanding Media Literacy

The first main finding reveals that while media literacy is helpful in
many of its various approaches, it in general has a couple limitations
that could be improved in order to make it more effective in helping
people understand the effects of our daily use of ICTs. The first limitation
is that most media literacy approaches do not focus on the biases of
the medium itself. Each communication medium--be it newspaper,
television, or smartphone--has its own biases, enabling some things
while constraining others. Making sure that the medium is included in
media literacy investigations helps keep the focus from solely being on
issues of content and representation (which are still important).

    In addition, media literacy can benefit by including the broader
environment within which the media use takes place. This is supported
by the non-media-centric approach to media literacy advocated by
Shaun Moores (2016) and David Morley (2007). This contextualizing
move de-centers the focus on media and attends to the broader lifeworld
where media happens. This is a critical component upon which I build,
creating a practical approach that helps situate and identify the various
relations that affect and are affected by our relations with specific media
technologies.

                        The Human Becoming

In order to understand the effects of media literacy on the human
subject, we need to have a contemporary understanding of the human
subject, one that counters a traditionally humanist understanding of an
idealized autonomous and standalone individual--a concept with roots
in the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. Instead, we are relational, and
it is through our relations that we are constituted. Rather than viewing
7. Conclusion    203

our selves as human beings, it is more appropriate to call our selves
human becomings. We are in a state of constant becoming in a complex
and sympoietic manner, evolving and transforming through the myriad
of relations that are also constantly changing in our lives.

    The concept of complexity is key to understanding the human
becoming as it shifts the gestalt from an individual subject to a complex
posthuman subject. We are always and already in relations, not only
with other humans but also with technologies and the world. These
relations are complex, situated, dynamic, and emergent. How these
relations influence a subject continually changes, and the ability to
bring one's awareness to a particular relation can affect the amount of
influence the relation has.

    Intrasubjective Mediation: Framework and Instrument

The key to creating a new framework in order to situate media literacy
and the human becoming is to build upon postphenomenology's
formula of technological mediation: I-technology-world. This helps us to
(pragmatically) understand how we, as human subjects, are constituted
through our relations. However, focusing only on technological relations
limits our ability to understand and situate the broader relations that
affect and are affected by media technologies. Therefore, in order to
gain a more comprehensive understanding, we can include the other
relations that are constituting our selves as well as influencing (enabling
and constraining) the effects of the technological relations. This is where
the intrasubjective mediating framework comes into play.

    Intrasubjective mediation describes the process of how the
transformations that occur to the human subject through technological,
sociocultural, mind, body, time, and space relations mediate--and
continue to mediate through time--how the subject perceives and
engages with the world. Intrasubjective mediation enables the ability to
understand how all of our relations continue to mediate our experiences
with our lifeworld, creating a way to investigate both the current and
continuing impact from relations. In the case of ICTs, this helps us
to become more media literate by understanding their broader and
ongoing effects.
204  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

    The intrasubjective mediating framework and instrument is designed
to enable a media user to better understand how media technologies
are situated within a complexity of interrelations, all of which affect the
user on an intrasubjective level. This framework and instrument provide
a facilitating cartography for the human subject to become more aware
through an autoethnographic process, guiding the investigator to analyze
six groupings of relations. Additionally, the investigator then identifies
and rates the effects of interrelations that influence the direct relations,
leading to a clearer understanding of the complexity of interrelating
factors that occur during any engagement with media. Through this
broader understanding, the investigator enhances their own agency,
empowering them to make better-informed choices concerning which
media they invite into their lives.

         Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study

Roger Silverstone (2006) points out, `All concepts are metaphors.
They stand in place of the world. And in so doing they mask as well
as reveal it' (229). This holds true for the framework and instrument
described in this book. On the one hand, the approach can help facilitate
the investigation into identifying the interrelating effects of media
technologies within the broader frame of all constituting relations. The
approach has been designed with the media user in mind--either as a
consumer, user, or producer of media. The goal of the approach is to
enable a broader perspective on how we are--in part--constituted by
the media technologies in our lives. However, it is impossible to identify
all of the mediating relations that influence us. While the framework
and instrument can help broaden our perspective, they can only
facilitate our own inquiry into revealing a portion of the complexity of
interrelations that affect us. And, attempting to create a comprehensive
approach can give a person using it the false sense that they are actually
being completely comprehensive. I first comment on the significance of
the findings and then discuss some of their limitations.
7. Conclusion    205

            Significance and Implications of Findings

These findings are significant because they provide media literacy
a practical way for situating the effects of specific media use in a
broader context, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding
of the complexity and interrelationally of our media relations. The
findings balance broad interdisciplinary theories concerning humans
and technology and then connect them to a practical framework and
instrument that can be used for media education. Not only are these
findings based on solid, contemporary philosophical thought; they
are also--most importantly--used to build a practical instrument for
media literacy. I say importantly because while academic scholarship is
often helpful for the academic world, in order to improve the everyday
lives of people using media technologies, it is critical to do more than
create academic theories. Through developing the theory into a usable
instrument, there is an increased likelihood that there can be some
positive effect on individuals and society. The framework and instrument
are beneficial for researchers and educators of media literacy as well as
users who engage with media.

                       Limitations of the Study

The limitations of this study stem, in part, from the intrasubjective
framework and instrument not yet being fully tested. While I have used
the intrasubjective framework and instrument to analyze a museum
selfie, as well as using it with a small group of students, further
application and field research is necessary in order to ascertain possible
limitations and make further revisions.

    How the instrument will work in other settings and contexts is
still left to be seen. In addition, while I have validated many aspects
through interaction with my peers (through discussions, papers, and
conference presentations), I have not yet reached out to very many
media literacy teachers and researchers who work in the field. I believe
that further usability testing is necessary in order to generate feedback
by students and instructors as they use the instrument to conduct their
own investigations into specific media relations.
206  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

                       Critical Considerations

When should criticism enter into the dialogue? Throughout this book I
have kept from focusing too much on how to critically evaluate our media
relations. Before being able to pass judgement on a technology and its
effects on our lives, I believe we should have a credible understanding of
the complexity of the situated technology. This is what the posthuman
approach supplies, allowing us to be in a better position for us to judge
whether we should or should not invite specific technologies into our
lives, and how we should engage with the technologies that are already
in our lives. This critical assessment is absolutely necessary. It is also
easier to accomplish on the personal/micro level rather than on a
societal/macro level. However, it is the second part of the process, and
the primary focus of this book is in exploring the first part.

                      Recommendations

In Chapter 6, I demonstrated how the framework could be employed
to investigate and reveal the interrelations that I experienced taking a
museum selfie. Additionally, I created a generic exercise that can be used
for media literacy, which is now ready for media literacy instructors
to experiment with. Up until now, I have been working mostly alone
on the creation and implementation of the framework. This limits the
likelihood of identifying what still needs improvement.

    As indicated in the above section, the instrument will benefit through
continued usability testing. I imagine students using it to conduct their
own investigations into specific media relations. This will help revise the
framework and instrument. As Paul Cilliers (2005: 259) states,

    There is no stepping outside of complexity (we are finite beings), thus
    there is no framework for frameworks. We choose our frameworks. This
    choice need not be arbitrary in any way, but it does mean that the status
    of the framework (and the framework itself) will have to be continually
    revised. Our knowledge of complex systems is always provisional.

I believe that continuing to use the framework and instrument with
university undergraduates and graduate students who are studying
media education and media literacy will be very beneficial. Graduate
students in information literacy and the library sciences could also benefit
7. Conclusion    207

by experimenting with the instrument, both in order to understand their
own media relations but also as a way to educate others about media
literacy. Through continued studies with older students, potential issues
can further be remedied before having educators modify the instrument
in a manner that is tailored for younger students.

    Another recommendation for the field of media literacy is a policy
type of recommendation. In Chapter 2, I discussed several organizations
focused on media literacy (such as the Center for Media Literacy, the
National Association for Media Literacy Education, and the Association
for Media Literacy in Canada). These are very helpful resources for media
educators, and they all have their own unique approach to, and definition
of, media literacy. My recommendation is for these organizations to
incorporate more of a focus on the importance of understanding: 1)
the biases of particular mediums; and 2) how the specific context and
interrelations influence, and are influenced by, our relations with media.
These recommendations allow media literacy organizations to retain the
strength of focusing on media relations while also including the broader
context, allowing for a more inclusive and situated understanding.

                   Extrapolating to Other Fields

Looking to the future, I wish to share my enthusiasm for the potential
of using this posthuman approach for the broader fields of humanities
and social sciences. The framework and instrument is a useful way to
understand our selves as subjects who are continually being constituted
through a complexity of interrelations. I believe that research in the
various fields within the social sciences can benefit from leveraging
the posthuman approach in order to situate and bring perspective to
the specific research being conducted. I believe that it can even be used
with a non-technological engagement. For example, using it to better
understand one's experience marching in a political protest.

    This approach provides perspective, which in turn helps us
understand the interconnections and broader context of whatever
research is being conducted. For instance, social science research
focusing on the issue of race could use the framework in order to help
situate the specific race relations, demonstrating how they affect and
are affected by many of the other relations, all of which are interrelated
208  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

in a complex existence. This keeps researchers from being too narrow
in their approach, and can help demonstrate how race importantly
interrelates and affects other relations more broadly.

    This posthuman approach is an effective first step toward a
comprehensive situating framework. One of its strengths is in its
interdisciplinary nature, having been created by bringing concepts
together from different fields that have not necessarily interacted much
previously. This cross-fertilization can now have benefits by introducing
the approach back into some of the original fields of study. While the
approach attempts to be inclusive and holistic, it is meant to be static. Both
students and researchers in various disciplines can use it to investigate
more deeply into any of the already defined groups and subgroups--or
even create new groups and subgroups. To begin describing what this
might look like, I will briefly explore how philosophical posthumanism,
postphenomenology, and transhumanism might find the framework
and instrument useful.

                        Philosophical Posthumanism

Posthumanism has an excellent, broad perspective, creating a post-
anthropocentric, post-humanist, and post-binary outlook in order
to understand the complex and emergent human subject. However,
while posthumanism excels at keeping a broad perspective of what
constitutes a posthuman subject, it is less clear exactly how to implement
the posthuman concepts into an everyday living of one's lifeworld.
Most helpful to posthumanism are the contributions in the field that
implement the broader theoretical concepts into practical applications
(for examples, see Adams & Thompson, 2016; Bayley, 2018). I believe
that the intrasubjective mediating framework and instrument presented
has the potential to be used in such a manner as practical tool for
implementing posthumanist concepts relating to complexity as well as
a non-humanist and a non-binary focus. The design of the framework
leverages the broad concepts into a facilitating cartography that can be
specifically applied to a broad range of research.
7. Conclusion    209

                             Postphenomenology

Postphenomenology's concept of technological mediation and the
co-constitutionality of the I-technology-world formula is one of the
main foundations upon which the framework and instrument are built.
The framework can be useful in broadening postphenomenological
research to include the other constituting groupings of relations. This
inclusion helps keep postphenomenological research from being
limited by its predominant focus on technology and allows the broader
context of relations to also be addressed. Since the framework already
uses many concepts from postphenomenology, it should be relatively
easy to leverage it into the research within the field. This can also help
the field address some of the criticisms that have been made against it in
the past, specifically with regard to not incorporating cultural relations
along with the technological relations (Scharff, 2006).

                               Transhumanism

While transhumanism is a forward-looking discipline, it is hampered by
its foundation in rational humanist and Enlightenment concepts, dating
back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Hughes, 2010a; More,
2013). As a discipline, it generally views the world and the human
condition as complicated but solvable, allowing for an engineering
approach to resolve many of humanity's issues. While its goals center
on improving the human condition through contemporary and future
technologies, transhumanism would benefit by taking a critical look into
the philosophy it is built upon.

    I argue that by leaving rational humanism (and the debate with
bioconservatives) behind and incorporating intrasubjective mediation--
with its foundation based on a complex, post-humanist subject--
transhumanism has a better chance at positively improving not only
the human species, but all living organisms on the planet. Therefore, I
suggest that transhumanism evolve three of its perspectives: 1) the idea
of a standalone individual to an interrelated and continually emergent
subject; 2) the perception of human enhancement as complicated to
understanding it as complex; and 3) a neutral view of technology to an
understanding that technology is transformative and non-neutral. By
changing transhumanist's theoretical foundation based in humanism to
210  Technology, Media Literacy, and the Human Subject

a combination of posthumanism, postphenomenology, and complexity
theory, transhumanism can become more contemporary and bring a
more balanced and grounded expectation for the future of humans,
technologies, and the world.

                           Non-Western Cultures

The scope of this research has remained embedded in the contemporary
Western culture. However, as I conclude, it can be useful to think how
this proposed posthuman approach might be used in non-Western
cultures or to make comparisons between cultures. The framework is
setup in such a way as to be useful in researching any culture, as well
as being helpful in better understanding differences between cultures.
For instance, some cultures might have a more developed sense of
social interconnectedness, such as the idea of Ubuntu, which is roughly
translated as I am because you are (Lief & Thompson, 2015). While
much of this book has been focused on overcoming a strong sense of
individuality that permeates much of the contemporary Western world,
a culture based on the concept of Ubuntu can give rise to a vastly
different lifeworld.

    But rather than idealize or in some way other such a culture, the
framework provides a way to look at the embedded and situated
interrelations that exist within these cultures. We can use the framework
to better understand what is enabled and what is constrained across all the
various groupings of relations. The framework provides a cartography
to bring the various relations and interrelations to the foreground of
our awareness and to see on balance how all the groupings of relations
co-exist.

                        Final Thoughts

While marketing departments spend a lot of money trying to convince
us otherwise, there is no ideal technology that can do everything.
Each enables some abilities while constraining others. Most ICTs, as
technological objects, are closed systems. However, in their relations
with humans they become a part of a complex living system. These
complex systems and environments are emergent and dynamic, usually
fairly stable in any one moment but dynamic over time.
7. Conclusion    211

    The approach presented here allows a systematic analysis of the
many influences happening in the moment one is engaged with a specific
media technology. The approach also helps a media user to more clearly
understand that they are immersed in, and part of, an interrelated
environment. Changing any one relation can have wide ranging effects
on the other relations.

    One might ask the question, so what? My response is to point out
that an increase in understanding--an increase in self-literacy--allows
us to be more aware and better informed when we choose what ICT
or technological medium we decide to engage with, thus helping us to
regain agency with regard to all the relations within our lifeworld. To
emulate John Culkin (1967), we shape our media environments and in
turn our media environments shape us. Using this posthuman approach
can help us more clearly understand the interplay of media relations in
our lives, allowing us the chance to shape them to our best advantage.

Technology, Media Literacy,
and the Human Subject

A Posthuman Approach

RICHARD S. LEWIS

Media literacy is often focused on evaluating the message rather than reflecting on the medium.
Bringing together postphenomenology, media ecology, posthumanism, and complexity theory,
Richard Lewis offers a method for such a reflection and shows how our everyday media environments
constitute us as (post)human subjects, always in a state of becoming. An original interdisciplinary
effort and a must-read for everyone interested in how we become with and through technologies.

                                                             Prof. Mark Coeckelbergh, University of Vienna

We are mediated by and immersed in a world where informaon and communicaon technologies
(ICTs) are undergoing accelerated innovaon. From hardware like smartphones, smartwatches,
and home assistants to soware like Facebook, Instagram, Twier, and Snapchat, our lives have
become inextricably entwined with a complex, interconnected network of relaons. Scholarship
on media literacy has tended to focus on developing the skills to access, analyze, evaluate, and
create media messages without considering or weighing the impact of the technological medium
and the broader context.

What does it mean to be media literate in today's world? How are we transformed by the many
media infrastructures around us?

These issues are addressed through the creaon of a transdisciplinary approach that allows for
both praccal and theorecal analyses of media invesgaons. The author proposes a framework
and a pragmac instrument for understanding the mulplicity of relaons that all contribute
to how we affect--and are affected by--our relaons with media technology. The increased
awareness provided by this posthuman approach affords us a greater chance for reclaiming some
of our agency by providing a sound foundaon upon which we can then judge our media relaons.
