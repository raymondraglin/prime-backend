Preface

   This book is aimed at managers, business owners, marketing managers, and aspiring
social media marketing interns and managers. I will assume that however accomplished in
your own field - baker, developer, teacher and that even as successful business owners,
you approach the topic of social media marketing as a beginner. Even if you are a digital
native, or an avid personal user of social networks, we will treat this book as a guided tour
of social media for marketing purposes.

   While this is a textbook, it is not meant to read like a traditional textbook, especially on
a topic that is rooted in digital to an audience who, let's be honest, doesn't really like to
read. No shade. I too would rather watch a YouTube video on how to fix a problem with
my laptop than read the manual.

   Like many of my Generation X peers, I began using forums and chat rooms in the
early 1990's and have watched social networks come and go (AOL and Yahoo chat rooms,
Friendster, Myspace) - To those not inclined to spend countless hours online over the past
couple of decades, it may seem as if things change too often.

   For others, particularly those born into the technology, aka digital natives, social
networks as with most technology, are second nature to you, but not having work
experience may leave you perplexed as to what your boss/ client / customers really want
from you as a social media manager.

   If you fall within either one of these audiences, this book is for you. I will do my best
to help you sort out a basic understanding of the why of social media as a marketing tool
for business, for personal brand building, and perhaps more importantly, where to find
supporting information and research to help you design, monitor, test, and re-define a
social media marketing strategy.

   If you are utilizing this book as an instructor or are considering using this book as an
instructor, first of all, Thank you very much! Here, you will find the instruction plan and
a practical way of teaching students how the principles of marketing work. We will also
explore the principles for each prominent social website. Also, the exercises with every
chapter will give students a better chance at understanding these concepts as well.

   To sum it up, the target audience for the book is a person who is interested in social
media marketing for brand building.

   PLAN OF THE BOOK
   PART 1 -- we'll discuss the origins of marketing principles. A definition of marketing and

                                                                                                                                                                             Preface | 1
how many of the concepts that have been around for ages are the same as what we do
today in social media marketing. Part 1 answers the question, "what is marketing?" and
we'll begin to explore marketing strategies for the modern age. We'll touch on the basics
principles of marketing and a bit of the psychology of as a way to introduce concepts that
hopefully won't be so foreign to you as we dive deeper into the nature of social networks.

   PART 2 -- we'll get into more of what social media marketers know and how it fits
within a marketing strategy. We'll talk about social networks in a way that no matter what
networks are present and popular when you read this book, you'll have an understanding
of how you can create content, engage with your customers, and grow your brand.

Open Education at Oklahoma State

University

   Introduction to Social Media is an Open Educational Resource (OER). This means the
book is free (It was a good joke, right?). When Dr. Joshua Daniel became Director of First
Year Composition in June of 2020, one of the first things he did was survey instructors and
students to learn what they thought of the program. At that time, the program had two
commercial textbooks students were required to purchase, and they were in negotiations
with another textbook company to add a third. Many things became clear when he talked
to students and instructors, but two points are relevant here: 1) instructors hated using
the textbooks; 2) students hated the textbooks and generally did not do the reading. Dr.
Daniel didn't think that is because instructors or students are lazy; he thought it was
because commercial textbooks generally aren't very good. The reason for this is they, as
products that need to be marketed and sold for profit, need to be as applicable as possible
in as many contexts as possible. In other words, the textbooks the program was using
stood the best chance of being profitable if they were equally as useful at OSU as they
would be at OU, or UC Davis, or NYU. See the problem? Even though many commercial
textbooks are quite good, by being applicable in so many contexts, they are never as good
as they could be in any specific context. This book was built by and for the instructor of
this course, an entrepreneur and practicing professional in her field. Moreover, when we
find problems, we get to update it as you go (none of that, "Do I have to purchase the third
edition, or can I get by with the second edition?").

   So that's a reason to embrace Open Education: the textbooks are better. Here is another.
Education is both a right for every human being and a responsibility for every democratic
nation. Speaking as a 90's child now staggered by student loan debt, Joshua Daniel
comments with certainty you are already paying more than enough for your education,
and textbooks for your courses, when possible, should not add to that burden. All told, if
you calculate the three textbooks previously in use for the first year composition program,
students were spending just under half a million dollars per academic year on commercial
textbooks. This for textbooks that instructors hated and students did not read. Not the
best investment, at least not for us. Dr. Daniel believes all of you have a right to pursue
education as far as you wish, and a small way we can help enable that is to remove as many
barriers to entry as possible. Dr. Daniel was a first-generation college student. He grew

                                                                                                                      Open Education at Oklahoma State University | 3
up on a farm in Mississippi. Both of his parents had to drop out of high school for work,
and none of his siblings were able to pursue higher education. When he arrived at my first
undergraduate institution (he bounced around quite a few before he managed to graduate)
he was lost and straight up broke. He dropped more than one course simply because he
could not afford the textbooks. Many of your instructors have similar stories to this. For
this reason as well as others, the instructor of this course is committed to removing the
cost of commercial textbooks as a barrier to your education.

OpenOKState Student Privacy

Guidelines

OpenOKState and the OSU Libraries Library Teaching and Learning (T&L) Team* strive to
enable engaging learning experiences for students using a variety of digital resources**.
When you--the student--use these resources, you're likely to produce some data, such
as data about how you used the resources (e.g., what you clicked on) or the content you
produced while using the resources (e.g., answering a question).

   In line with our values and our beliefs about student data privacy, our T&L team has
created and closely follows a set of guidelines, made up of 5 core principles, for any type
of student data we might come in contact with.

   We aim to be exceedingly transparent with you about your data. On this page, you can
learn about our team's values and beliefs regarding student data privacy as well as explore
the 5 core principles of our Student Data Privacy Guidelines.

   If you have any questions about these guidelines or about your data privacy, please
don't hesitate to contact the Director of Library Teaching and Learning, Holly Reiter, at
holly.reiter@okstate.edu.

   *The data and Guidelines referenced on this page are unique to Library Teaching &
Learning, and do not indicate guidelines for the Library or the University as a whole.

   **For our purposes, digital learning objects include interactive tutorials, OStateTV or
YouTube videos, the mobile Library Scavenger Hunt, visits to web pages that host these
items, Pressbooks, and graduate student workshop registration.

Student Data Privacy Beliefs

As a Teaching and Learning team, we have foundational, ethical, scholarship-shaped
beliefs about student data that have shaped our student data practice and guidelines.

   We believe in prioritizing student data privacy to...

   Protect students
   Respect student autonomy
   Return power to students and establish equity

   Build trust between students and Library Teaching and Learning
   Enable student data privacy literacy

Core Principles of Student Data Privacy

Responsibility

The Teaching and Learning team believes it's our ethical responsibility to protect your
data privacy. Specifically, we uphold the responsibility to:

   Ensure any collected data is handled carefully, used effectively, and used only for the
      stated purpose.

   Prevent unauthorized disclosure, use, or collection of your data
   Follow specific steps in data collection, use, storage, and destruction.

6 | OpenOKState Student Privacy Guidelines
   Carry a shared understanding of our role in your data privacy.

Transparency

T&L believes you shouldn't have to wonder what's happening with your data, so we strive
to be as open and transparent with you as possible. For each digital learning object we use,
we'll share the following:

   What we are and are not collecting
   Why we're collecting it
   How it's being collected
   How it's being used
   Who has access to the data

To keep you safe, we strive to store and process all data according to best practices. We'll
only collect the minimum amount of data necessary to achieve our stated objectives.

Privacy and Consent

T&L believes that privacy is your right. We strive to honor your privacy by never releasing
any personally identifiable information unless it is to your instructor of record who is
using the digital learning object within their class.

   Occasionally, we may share aggregates of de-identified or anonymized data internally
(e.g., with Library administrators) or externally (e.g., at Library or industry conferences).
We do this to continuously improve effectiveness, evaluate the effectiveness of our
teaching and learning program, or to help evolve and shape the practices of our
profession. Aggregating the data means that the data is in summary form and no individual
student can be identified.

   Finally, we will never sell or otherwise commodify your data, and will always prioritize
the use of vendors and resources that do the same.

                                                                                                                             OpenOKState Student Privacy Guidelines | 7
Confidentiality and Security

T&L takes great strides to ensure that any and all data we collect is kept confidential and
secure.

   We use several vendors to help us create and host digital learning objects and collect
analytics. Sometimes, these vendors have access to your personally identifiable
information for operational purposes, so we intentionally investigate and select vendors
that also prioritize confidentiality and security.

Access

Sometimes we do collect and store personally identifiable information so we can do things
like retain records for your instructor of record or keep track of event registrations. In
these cases, T&L believes you have the right to know what that data is, request corrections
if you think it's incorrect, and request that it be deleted. Please note, we'll always make
every effort to honor deletion requests, but sometimes we're required to retain records
for various reasons. If that's the case, we'll be open about why we can't delete it now, and
if and when it can be deleted.

Acknowledgements

Library Teaching and Learning would like to acknowledge several projects that helped
inform our Guidelines. We extend our sincerest gratitude for the effort and dedication
that individuals invested in these works.

Marketing in the Age of COVID-19 -
When the World Went Digital and
Toilet Paper Became Gold

CHERYL LAWSON

So, remember when COVID-19 hit and the world turned upside down? Yeah, me too. We
had to change the way we lived and worked in the blink of an eye. And boy, did we realize
how vital social media and digital platforms were for our professional and personal lives.
Just think about companies like Zoom, Instacart, TikTok, and YouTube - they were the real
MVPs during the pandemic. Let's dive into how the global crisis shook up marketing and
made social media the star of the show.

1.1 Embracing the Digital Life (and Hoarding Toilet Paper)

When the pandemic struck, we quickly learned that working from home was the new
norm. We didn't need to be at the office to get stuff done - all we needed was a laptop and
a decent internet connection (and maybe some pants, but who's checking?).

   Oh, and speaking of the pandemic, can we talk about how we all suddenly became
obsessed with toilet paper? It turns out, people were using 40% more of it while stuck at
home (source). That's a lot of TP, folks. But let's get back to the topic at hand...

                                              Marketing in the Age of COVID-19 - When the World Went Digital and Toilet Paper Became Gold | 13

1.2 Social Media: Our Lifeline in Lockdown

As we hunkered down in our homes, social media became more crucial than ever. It was
our connection to the outside world, our source of news, and a way to keep in touch with
friends and family. Businesses caught on, and those who hadn't already embraced social
media marketing were suddenly scrambling to get on board.

   Let me give you a personal example. I've been producing an annual social media
conference since 2011, and we were all set to celebrate our 10th anniversary in March
2020. Talk about bad timing, right? With just a few weeks to spare, I had to make the tough
call to postpone the conference until September (because, you know, maybe the pandemic
would be over by then... oh, how naive we were).

   But here's the silver lining: between March and September, the mobile app we'd been
using as a bonus feature for our conference - Whova - became our saving grace. It created
a community for event organizers like myself, where we could swap best practices for
transitioning our events from in-person to virtual. And you know what? Even though we
couldn't all meet up in Tulsa like we'd planned, our virtual conference went off without a
hitch, thanks to Zoom, Vimeo, and Whova.

   So there you have it - a firsthand example of how social media and digital platforms

their power, I don't know what is.

1.3 What Is Marketing?

Alright, let's get down to the nitty-gritty: what the heck is marketing, anyway? I know what
you're thinking - isn't it just selling and advertising? Well, hold on to your hats, because
there's a lot more to it than that.

   The American Marketing Association gives us this definition:
   "The activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering,
and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at
large."
   In plain English, marketing pros help businesses win over new customers by offering
them something they can't resist - and then keeping them happy so they'll stick around
and spread the word. It's all about creating a value proposition that's simply too good to
pass up.

1.4 What is Marketing Today? With Seth Godin

In Seth Godin's video "What is Marketing Today?", he emphasizes that marketing has
shifted from being a side effect to the core of what businesses do. In the past, companies
would simply produce average products and rely on marketing teams to sell them.
However, today's marketing landscape is centered around telling a story, connecting with
customers, and focusing on how products can make a difference in people's lives.

   Godin argues that old-school marketing, which involved buying mass media ads to reach
average consumers, is fading away. The internet has turned into a medium of micro-
segments, where companies can no longer buy attention in the same way they did with
TV advertising. Instead, businesses need to pick their niche, measure when necessary, and
focus on building connections, trust, and attention.

   Godin emphasizes the importance of understanding your "why" but also recognizing
that it's often a general concept. The key is to identify who you seek to serve and
make things better for them. By continuously improving, earning trust, and transforming

attention into a promise and a brand, you can achieve success regardless of your
profession.

   Lastly, Godin stresses the responsibility that comes with marketing, as every action
has an effect. Marketers must own the consequences of their campaigns and strive to
create products and messages they're proud of. By focusing on making things better
and inventing products that positively impact the world, marketers can contribute to
meaningful change.

1.2 What Is Digital Marketing?

At a high level, digital marketing refers to advertising delivered through digital channels
such as search engines, websites, social media, email, and mobile apps. Using these online
media channels, digital marketing is the method by which companies endorse goods,
services, and brands. Consumers heavily rely on digital means to research products.
For example, Think with Google marketing insights found that 48% of consumers start
their inquiries on search engines, whereas 33% prefer to consult brand websites and the
remaining 26% consumers search within mobile applications.

   While modern day digital marketing is an enormous system of channels to which
marketers simply must onboard their brands, advertising online is much more complex
than the channels alone. In order to achieve the true potential of digital marketing,
marketers have to dig deep into today's vast and intricate cross-channel world to discover
strategies that make an impact through engagement marketing. Engagement marketing
is the method of forming meaningful interactions with potential and returning customers
based on the data you collect over time. By engaging customers in a digital landscape, you
build brand awareness, set yourself as an industry thought leader, and place your business
at the forefront when the customer is ready to buy.

16 | Marketing in the Age of COVID-19 - When the World Went Digital and Toilet Paper Became Gold
   By implementing an omnichannel digital marketing strategy, marketers can collect
valuable insights into target audience behaviors while opening the door to new methods of
customer engagement. Additionally, companies can expect to see an increase in retention.
According to a report by Invesp, companies with strong omnichannel customer
engagement strategies can retain around 89% of their customers as compared to
companies with weaker omnichannel programs that have a retention rate of just 33%.

   As for the future of digital marketing, we can expect to see a continued increase in the
variety of wearable devices available to consumers. Forbes also forecasts that social media
will become increasingly conversational in the B2B space, video content will be refined for
search engine optimization (SEO) purposes, and email marketing will become even more
personalized.

   "Digital is at the core of everything in marketing today--it has gone from `one of the things
marketing does' to `THE thing that marketing does.'"

   - Sanjay Dholakia, Former Chief Marketing Officer, Marketo

How Many P's are in Marketing Now?

CHERYL LAWSON

While we're learning Marketing concepts, let's talk about the Marketing Mix. Even though
the marketing world has gone digital, this "old-school" concept is very relevant today .
We're talking about the 4 P's of Marketing. First, who do we have to thank for this? Neil
Borden first came up with the term Marketing Mix, but it was Jerome McCarthy from
Notre Dame University who really made it famous. He called it "the Four P's of Marketing"
in his guide, "Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach".

   The legendary marketing guru, Philip Kotler, said it best: "Marketing Mix is the set of
controllable variables that a firm can use to influence the buyer's response." What's cool
about this is that digital and social media marketing still use these age-old concepts. We're
just adapting them to new tools and methods, making them work in the digital world. So,
the 4 P's are still alive and kicking, even in the age of Instagram and TikTok!

                                                                  Illustration

Let's dive into the 4 P's of marketing, keeping it short and sweet:

Product: This is the good or service you're offering to your customers. It includes
everything from the design, features, packaging, and even the product life cycle. The goal
is to create something that solves a problem or fulfills a need.

   Price: This is how much you charge for your product. It's about finding the sweet spot

18 | How Many P's are in Marketing Now?
between making a profit and offering value to your customers. Factors like production
costs, competition, and perceived value all come into play when setting the right price.

   Place: This is where and how you distribute your product to reach your target audience.
It includes choosing the right channels, such as online stores, brick-and-mortar shops, or
both. The goal is to make your product accessible and convenient for your customers to
buy.

   Promotion: This is how you communicate your product's value to your target audience.
It involves a mix of marketing strategies like advertising, public relations, social media,
and content marketing. The goal is to create awareness, generate interest, and ultimately,
persuade people to buy your product.

Applying Basic Marketing Principles to
Social Media Marketing

CHERYL LAWSON

   Some people are confused about social media, but it's essential to understand that social
marketing has been around for a long time. Digital and social media marketing are not new
philosophies; they are traditional practices adapted to new tools.

   Historically, business was conducted in social settings like door-to-door sales or
marketplaces. These gatherings allowed people to share ideas and communicate across
networks. Similarly, event marketing created connections between buyers and sellers

20 | Applying Basic Marketing Principles to Social Media Marketing
through dealer conferences or even extravagant parties attended by influential
individuals.

   Nowadays, many of these connections happen online through platforms like LinkedIn
or Facebook. However, some businesspeople shy away from using these modern
technologies as they appear daunting compared to traditional methods such as television,
radio, newspaper advertising or direct mail campaigns.

   The ease of digital marketing allows businesses to quickly share their stories by taking
pictures or conducting interviews with just a smartphone. Despite the low cost of entry
into this form of promotion, many entrepreneurs still find it challenging due to lack of
education in marketing principles and strategy creation.

   Social media is simply another way to market a product or service using traditional
theories adapted for new mediums. Each platform has its own language and style which
requires tailored communication strategies for success.

   The main difference between traditional and modern-day digital/social media
marketing lies in the technology available today rather than any significant change in
underlying principles.

   Before we move forward, let's go back to some of our earlier definitions of marketing by
Seth Godin;

   "Marketing is at the core of what we do. It is the story you tell, who you're telling it to,
and why people are going to buy your product or service."

   He also said,"Marketing is no longer about the stuff that you make, but about the stories
you tell".

The 4Ps Reimagined: Translating Marketing Mix to Social Media

While social media marketing is relatively recent in the grand scheme of things, marketing
itself isn't new at all. Applying foundational marketing concepts to social media is not just
essential, but also incredibly effective. By grounding your social media strategy in these
tried-and-true marketing principles, you'll be better equipped to leverage these platforms
and communicate your brand message powerfully and persuasively.

   Product is where we begin. (When I use `product' here, I mean product or service) It's
critical to understand what sets your product apart and how it enriches your customer's
life. These unique insights allow you to effectively utilize platforms like LinkedIn,
Instagram, or YouTube to tell your product story. Keep in mind that savvy customers today

                                                                                              Applying Basic Marketing Principles to Social Media Marketing | 21
are not just buying a product; they're investing in your brand's narrative, which can include
your connection to community, your social and environmental responsibility, and or your
family connection to the product.

   Then, let's discuss Price. This isn't just about the dollar value; it's about the perceived
value your product delivers. Striking the right balance in pricing is paramount. You don't
want to scare off customers by being too expensive, nor do you want to sell yourself
short. E-commerce and social media have changed the pricing landscape, allowing you
to operate with leaner margins and potentially pass the savings onto your customers.
Techniques such as Dropshipping and Just-In-Time manufacturing can be powerful tools
in your arsenal to manage costs.

   Now, we move on to Place. This term encapsulates all the platforms where customers
can find or access your offerings. Social media has revolutionized this aspect, making
it possible for customers to shop from their living room while allowing you to engage,
respond, and improve the customer experience in real-time.

   Last, but definitely not least, Promotion. Traditional marketing techniques still have
their place, but the digital landscape, especially social media, has opened up new
possibilities. You can foster lasting relationships with your customers, earn their trust,
and transform them into advocates for your brand. Promoting your brand on social media,
optimizing your website for search engines, and leveraging email marketing can be cost-
effective ways to enhance your visibility and reach.

   As you craft your social media strategy, keep these principles at the forefront. Each one
provides a lens to view your product, your customers, and the market. They aren't mere
steps, but ongoing considerations that can help your brand connect, engage, and grow in
the dynamic world of social media.

What's it All For?

CHERYL LAWSON

In the complex world of marketing, social media has emerged as a powerful tool, greatly
influencing tactics and strategies. Businesses are constantly urged to invest in social
media marketing, leaving many to question why it garners such emphasis amidst a
plethora of alternatives. Unveiling the benefits of social media for businesses, we shall
explore the tangible returns one can expect from a robust social media strategy.

   Social media allows you to convey the narrative behind your product, appealing to
your audience's emotions and values, thereby spreading your brand message. Crafting
compelling visuals or stories around the genesis of your business, your team, or products
can foster a strong brand reputation.

   A significant advantage of social media marketing lies in its cost-effectiveness compared
to traditional marketing approaches. It provides a level playing field for small and medium-
sized businesses to compete with established brands without exorbitant expenses,
thereby offering excellent return on investment.

   Engaging your followers with captivating content not only retains them as loyal
customers but can also turn them into brand ambassadors, extending your reach to their
network. This organic promotion can reap rich dividends for your brand.

   Social media's targeted advertising capability ensures that your investment is put to
optimal use by reaching your desired audience. Moreover, retargeting options help keep
your brand at the forefront of potential customers' minds, gently nudging them towards
conversion.As we delve deeper into the purpose and significance of an impactful social
media presence for businesses, it's important to highlight six key benefits that underscore
why so many businesses prioritize this form of digital marketing.

   These advantages are integral to a thriving online presence, influencing various aspects
of a business's growth and success. They include SEO and Search Engine Optimization,
Increasing Website Traffic, Decreasing Customer Acquisition Cost, Direct-to-Consumer
engagement, PR and Brand Awareness, and Lead Generation. Each of these elements plays
a crucial role in leveraging the power of social media to advance your brand and drive
results.

                                                                                                                                                             What's it All For? | 23
SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a powerful digital marketing tool that focuses on
increasing your brand's visibility on search engines. With the right SEO strategies in place,
your social media platforms and website can rank higher in search engine results. This
is crucial as studies show that the top results on search engine pages get the majority of
clicks. By optimizing your social media profiles and creating SEO-friendly content, you
can enhance your brand's online presence and reach.

Increase Website Traffic

Social media marketing can significantly drive traffic to your website. By sharing engaging
content, promotional offers, blogs, product launches, and more on your social media
platforms, you can entice your followers to click through to your website. This increased
traffic not only brings in potential customers but also contributes to improving your site's
SEO rankings. Over time, a robust social media strategy can help create a cycle of higher
search rankings and increased website traffic.

Decrease Customer Acquisition Cost

Social media is a cost-effective platform for reaching potential customers and nurturing
relationships with existing ones. The cost of acquiring customers through social media
is often lower than traditional marketing channels due to its organic reach and precise
targeting. Moreover, through retargeting capabilities, you can re-engage users who have
shown interest in your brand or product, further reducing the cost of customer
acquisition.

24 | What's it All For?
Direct to Consumer (Avoid Traditional Wholesale and
Third-Party Sellers)

In traditional business models, products often go through several intermediaries such as
wholesalers and retailers before reaching the end consumer. This can inflate the final
price of the product and dilute the brand's control over the customer experience.

   By using social media as a direct-to-consumer channel, you can sidestep these
intermediaries, lowering costs and retaining more control over the customer journey.
This model allows you to understand your customers' preferences, needs, and behaviors
in real-time, enabling you to tailor your products and services accordingly. In addition,
direct interaction with consumers can foster a stronger sense of community and loyalty
around your brand.

PR Brand Awareness

Public Relations (PR) and brand awareness go hand in hand. Social media provides a
platform where businesses can not only promote their products or services but also
shape public perception by sharing their company's mission, values, and stories. It is an
opportunity to humanize your brand and build a reputation that resonates with your
audience.
Social media platforms are ideal for conducting PR campaigns. They allow you to reach
a wider audience and give you the opportunity to engage directly with them. This could
involve answering customer queries, addressing concerns, or simply thanking them for
their support. Such interaction fosters a positive image of your brand and enhances your
reputation.

   Moreover, social media enables real-time communication during crisis situations,
allowing you to manage your reputation effectively. By proactively responding to issues
and demonstrating your commitment to customer satisfaction, you can maintain and even
improve your brand image.

                                                                                                                                                             What's it All For? | 25
Lead Generation

   Lead generation is another key benefit
of social media marketing. Social media
platforms offer various tools and features
that can assist in collecting potential leads.
This includes call-to-action buttons,
direct messaging, and ad campaigns
specifically designed to capture user
information.

   By sharing engaging content and
building relationships with your audience
on social media, you can attract potential
customers who may be interested in your
products or services. Once these potential
leads are identified, they can be nurtured
through targeted content and
personalized engagement, ultimately
guiding them through the sales funnel.

   Moreover, social media platforms offer
advanced targeting options, allowing you
to reach out to the right audience who are
more likely to become quality leads. In this
way, social media can efficiently and effectively enhance your lead generation efforts.

Social Media Marketing. A Brief
History

CHERYL LAWSON

Social media is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of online platforms and tools
that allow users to connect and share content with each other. The history of social media
is long and complex, but it can be traced back to the early days of the internet.

   One of the earliest examples of social media was Usenet, which was created in 1982.
Usenet was a system of discussion forums where users could post messages and reply to
each other. Another early example of social media was Six Degrees, which was launched in
1997. Six Degrees was a social networking site that allowed users to connect with friends
and family members.

   In the early 2000s, social media began to take off. In 2004, Facebook was launched, and
it quickly became one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. In 2005,
YouTube was launched, and it revolutionized the way people watch and share videos. In
2006, Twitter was launched, and it became the go-to platform for sharing short updates
and news.

   In the years since, social media has continued to evolve. New platforms have been
launched, and existing platforms have been updated with new features. Social media has
also become increasingly important in our lives. We use it to stay connected with friends
and family, to learn about current events, and to share our thoughts and ideas with the
world.

   Social media has had a profound impact on our society. It has changed the way we
communicate, the way we consume news, and the way we interact with the world around
us. It is still too early to say what the future holds for social media, but it is clear that it
will continue to play an important role in our lives and our businesses.

                                                                                                                              Social Media Marketing. A Brief History | 27
     Storytime

        Let me tell you about December 2005. I saw a Business Week cover headline, "The Myspace Generation," and
     it just clicked. I was only a year into starting my own event planning biz, and my new client was a dance
     conference who's audience was 18-25-year-old women. Myspace was their jam - seriously, it was the new mall
     hangout.

        So, what did I do? I hopped on the Myspace train and used it for the dance conference to dish out resources
     like tryout dates, dance makeup, and clothing recommendations. We became the ultimate one-stop-shop for all
     things dance and our efforts resulted in the conference being in the black for the first time.

        A bunch of us Gen Xers credit Myspace for teaching us HTML back in the day. It's crazy to think about it now
     with TikTok ruling the roost, but Myspace was our first taste of being social online.

search engine optimization (SEO) and how it impacts everything we do online. Our main
goal? Make sure our social media posts and website content are super easy to find.

   Let's not forget platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube,
which have their own search engines for users to discover content. Fun fact: YouTube is
the world's second-largest search engine, giving birth to the term "YouTube University."

          -- Alicia Tatone (@AliciaTatone) March 28, 2023

As savvy business owners and marketers, we need to know how folks find us online. Sure,
ROI and engagement metrics matter, but creating searchable content should be top of
mind.

   That means getting found on big-time search engines like Google and Bing, as well
as individual social networks. And hey, let's not forget about Google Business profiles.
Though not technically social media, they can be part of our social media strategies. Pop
those eye-catching social campaign creatives on your Google Business pages too! Bottom
line: Optimize everything from image titles to alt text descriptions, so search engines can't
resist indexing your content.

     In Class Exercise: Google yourself!
     Google your name and take note of the results that show up. This activity can help you understand the importance of your
     online presence and how search engines present information about you. It can also encourage discussions about personal
     branding, digital footprints, and strategies to improve visibility in search results.

                                                                                                                                                       Do You Even Google? | 29
Creating SEO with Your Photos Using Flickr

Taking advantage of every SEO opportunity is crucial for your online visibility, and this
includes optimizing your images. Using platforms like Flickr to host your photos allows
you to enhance your photo SEO, as it provides fields for adding titles and descriptions
to individual and bulk images. These additional details not only make your photos more
accessible to people browsing the web but also to search engine algorithms. When
uploading photos to your website, take the time to rename them using relevant keywords
and phrases. This simple step ensures your images contribute positively to your website's
SEO. Remember, every bit of "search engine juice" matters, and properly optimizing your
photos can give you an edge in the increasingly visual digital landscape.

Wrapping up this section, let's discuss an invaluable tool that can help you stay informed
and monitor your brand or personal brand online: Google Alerts.

   Google Alerts is a free service provided by Google that allows you to set up alerts for
specific keywords or phrases. When new content containing those keywords or phrases
is published on the web, you'll receive an email notification. This tool is especially useful
for discovering content to share on social media platforms, as well as keeping track of
mentions about your brand or personal brand.

   By setting up Google Alerts for your business name, industry keywords, or even your
own name, you can keep a pulse on what's being said about you, your business, or
your industry. This information can not only help you curate content to share with your
audience, but it can also provide valuable insights into public perception and enable you
to address any potential issues or concerns.

marketing and social media strategy. It allows you to stay informed, monitor your brand,

you can set up alerts tailored to your needs and ensure you never miss out on vital

In this section, we'll dive into the art of crafting a rock-solid social media strategy that's
custom-made for your business. But first things first: let's nail down what type of business
you're running. Are you in the apparel game, living that lifestyle brand life, flexing your
creative muscles, schooling folks in education, or hustling in the service or B2B/B2C
support industry? Pinpointing your business type is crucial, but remember, you're not
boxed in - think of how Amazon evolved from a mere online bookstore to an everything
store.

   Now, before we go all-in on marketing strategies (be it traditional or social media), we
need to make sure we can explain our business in a way that's snappy and easy to grasp.
No, you don't have to cram it all into a 30-second elevator pitch, but you should be able to
convey your message clearly and efficiently across different organizations and industries.
Your message should scream, "This is who we are, and this is why we do what we do!" Easy
peasy.

   So, what's next? Let's dig deeper into the components of a killer social media strategy.
We'll talk about how to align your social media goals with your overall business objectives,
define your target audience, and create content that speaks their language. We'll also
explore the importance of analyzing your competition and staying on top of trends that
are relevant to your industry.

   And, of course, we'll dive into the nitty-gritty of choosing the right social media
platforms and tools that suit your unique business needs. With the right blend of
creativity, analytics, and good ol' fashioned hustle, you'll be well on your way to crafting a
social media strategy that gets your message out there, engages your audience, and drives
results for your business.

   It's time to make your social media game unstoppable with a strategy that's tailored to
your one-of-a-kind business. Let's do this!

Case Study: Amazon in 2023 By Sunil
Gupta and Margaret L. Rodriguez

CHERYL LAWSON

I like to bring in the Harvard Business Publishing case "Amazon in 2023" by Sunil Gupta
and Margaret Rodriguez to give students a solid, real-world example.

       Abstract: Amazon kicked off its journey in July 1995, selling books online. Fast
       forward to 2020, and it's a digital behemoth raking in over $280 billion in yearly
       sales. A significant chunk of its growth comes from branching out into various
       businesses that some might consider unrelated. So, is Amazon spreading itself too
       thin, or is it strategically positioning itself for future success?

Now, your students might not have access to the actual case, but let me break down some
core concepts from the authors, so everyone can grasp the essentials without the case.
Plus, this'll help anyone teaching with the textbook to integrate the case more effectively.

   In today's market landscape, broad differentiation - being cheaper or better - is no
longer enough to succeed. The digital era requires businesses to connect consumers and
products through network effects and complementary offerings. This "winner-take-all"
strategy creates connections between different industries, as seen with Amazon Studios
videos offered for free with Prime memberships, leading to increased spending on their
e-commerce platform.

   Sunil Gupta, a professor at Harvard Business School, has spent over 12 years researching
how technologies are changing consumer behavior and business strategies. His case study
"Amazon in 2023" examines Amazon's expansion into seemingly unrelated businesses and
raises questions about whether this lack of focus is detrimental or if it's positioning the
company for future success.

   Gupta emphasizes that differentiation alone is not enough in the digital era. Instead,
businesses need to connect consumers and products through network effects and
complementary offerings. This approach allows companies to be a "razor" in one industry
and a "blade" in another, such as Amazon offering free videos through Prime to increase
spending on their e-commerce platform.

   When teaching this case, Gupta encourages pushing students to think more deeply

                                                                                  Case Study: Amazon in 2023 By Sunil Gupta and Margaret L. Rodriguez | 37
about Amazon's various ventures and question who the company is competing with. This
case study can be easily taught online and appeals to a wide range of student groups.
The key is to enjoy the case, stay updated on the latest developments, and engage in
meaningful discussions about Amazon's evolving strategies.

In this 2010 interview with Charlie Rose, Jeff Bezos, the founder and former CEO of
Amazon, shares his insights on Amazon's competitive advantage, how they approach
competition. Bezos explains that Amazon's approach to maintaining a competitive edge
consists of three key factors: a wide selection, low prices, and fast, convenient, reliable
delivery. He also emphasizes the importance of being customer-obsessed, focusing on
the customer more than on competitors. Bezos highlights that Amazon's online business
model allows for cost structure advantages and that their purchasing power is now
comparable to that of Walmart. Additionally, Bezos it's almost scary how much foresight
Bezos had regarding Amazon Web Services

Who Is Your Customer?

CHERYL LAWSON

Creating Buyer Persona

   Let's talk about creating customer personas! A customer persona is like a character
sketch of your perfect customer. You base it on actual data from your current customers
and research into your target market. Knowing your customers' needs, wants, and pain
points helps you tailor marketing and sales strategies that really click with them.

   So, how do you create a customer persona? First, gather data about your target market.
You can get this from:

                                                                                                                                                    Who Is Your Customer? | 41
   Customer surveys
   Website analytics
   Social media insights
   Industry reports

Now, with your data in hand, let's build that persona. Give them a name and a job title.
Then, dive into the details:

   Demographics: Age, gender, location, income level, and so on.
   Psychographics: Interests, hobbies, values, and more.
   Challenges: What big hurdles does your persona face?
   Goals: What's your persona aiming for?
   Pain points: What bothers or frustrates your persona?
   Needs: What does your persona need to reach their goals?

With your customer persona complete, use it to shape your marketing and sales
strategies. For instance, craft targeted content that speaks to their interests, or develop
sales pitches that address their specific needs and pain points.

   Creating customer personas is super helpful for boosting your marketing and sales
results. By really understanding your target market, you can design campaigns that
convert leads into customers more effectively.

   A few extra tips for creating customer personas:

   Get different perspectives by involving multiple people in the process.
   Be as specific as possible--the more details, the better.
   Keep your personas up-to-date as your target market evolves.

Storytime:

Here's a personal example of how creating customer personas can be a valuable exercise.
When I was working as the marketing director for the Route 66 Marathon in Tulsa,
we started working on our customer personas. The good news was that through the
registration process, we already had a lot of information about each of our participants. A
lot of that information even showed up on their runner bib, such as which distance they

42 | Who Is Your Customer?
were running or walking, If they were a member of a running club, which start corral they
were in. Being in corral A or B meant they were more likely a fast runner, while C or D
indicated they were either one of our "party runners," back-of-the-packers, or they simply
registered late.

   During the registration process, we also asked if they would like to participate in our
bloggers/social media panel and inquired about their job. So, by looking at photos on a
plane ride back from a conference, we were able to identify and create our personas.
By understanding the different types of participants, we could then create targeted
marketing campaigns that catered to the various runner profiles, enhancing our overall
marketing strategy.

   In summary, gathering as much information as possible about your customers from
the very beginning is crucial to creating effective customer personas. The more data you
have about their demographics, psychographics, challenges, goals, pain points, and needs,
the better you can tailor your marketing and sales strategies to resonate with them. By
understanding your customers' unique characteristics, you can create targeted campaigns
that drive engagement and conversions, ultimately leading to a more successful business.

                                                                                                                                                    Who Is Your Customer? | 43

Customer Personas and D.I.S.C

CHERYL LAWSON

I have been using the DISC (D-I-S-C) method for many years in various classes, ranging
from event planning to social media marketing. This technique is not only helpful for
understanding how to communicate with customers, coworkers, colleagues, or family
members but also enables us to know ourselves better.

   Early in my career at General Motors, we participated in a Myers-Briggs personality
style assessment. It was an eye-opening experience as I began to understand my
communication preferences and recognize that others may have different styles. People
want to be treated according to their preferences.

   At Fleetwood RV, we incorporated DISC training into our sales system. Understanding
your own communication style and identifying the customer's profile (whether they are D,
I, S or C) greatly aids the sales process and helps tailor presentations accordingly.

   This same concept applies in marketing when identifying customer personas.
Recognizing that our preferred communication style may differ from our target audience
allows us to adapt our marketing visuals, tone of voice and overall presentation on
platforms such as websites or social media pages like Instagram and Facebook.

   Utilizing the DISC method can significantly improve your understanding of yourself and
others while enhancing your professional skills in areas like sales and marketing. There are
numerous places where you can take this test - even simple versions can be found online
for use during class or while reading at home.

   Next, plot the numbers from the totals columns on the graph provided below. For
instance, if the total number in the "D" column was 15, you would place the plotting point
(dot) halfway between the 14 and the 16 on the graph for that dimension.

help you pinpoint the right social media platforms to reach your customers, and tailor
your content, tone, and style to match their preferences. Let's explore this:

   If your customers fall into the `S' or Steady Shelia category, they might appreciate the
familiar communities on Facebook or the professional connections on LinkedIn. They
value consistency, patience, and long-term relationships. So, platforms that facilitate
regular, meaningful engagement could be their digital hangout spots.

   Those in the `C' or Compliant Curtis group are all about details and clarity. They might
be drawn to the defined guidelines and clear communication of LinkedIn or the fast-
paced, information-dense environment of Twitter. These platforms could be their go-
to sources for in-depth information and precise updates. You might also find Cs in the
Dataisbeautiful subReddit.

   For our `D' or Dominant Dan category customers, quick, result-oriented platforms like
Instagram or TikTok could be their arena. They're dynamic, decisive, and enjoy seeing
the impact of their actions. These platforms can offer them immediate engagement,
inspiration, and opportunities to take action.

   And for the `I' or Influencing Iris types, the networking-friendly environments of
Instagram or Twitter could be their stomping grounds. They're all about expressing their
thoughts and making connections. These platforms allow them to network widely and
share their influential ideas.

   Remember, these are general tendencies and real-world preferences can vary. People
might engage with multiple platforms for different reasons. So, it's crucial for you as a
marketer to keep your approach flexible and adaptable. Monitor your engagement, adjust
your strategy, and most importantly, keep learning about your customers!

   Incorporating DISC into your customer personas can give you valuable insight into how
your customers think, behave, and communicate. With this in your tool kit, you can create
targeted, relevant content and connect with your customers in a way that resonates with
them. It's all about meeting them where they are and speaking their language.

CHERYL LAWSON

"If you make the opportunity, you'll be the first in the position to take advantage of it."
   - Biz Stone Co-Founder of Twitter

let's dive into the realm of social media competitive analysis. As a business, you've got
competition, those pesky folks selling similar products or services as you, targeting the
same crowd. With e-commerce, these competitors aren't just on the next block, they
could be across the globe.

   The web has removed geographical barriers, exposing your business to a worldwide
wrestling ring. Your competition isn't just the store down the street; it's also that trendy
online shop based halfway around the globe. And believe me, their Instagram ads can be
pretty slick.

   Ignoring what your competitors are doing on social media? Not an option. It's about
learning their tactics, their successes, their failures. It's about staying one step ahead. But
this isn't about being creepy, spying, or doing anything sketchy. It's just good business
sense.

   Your competition could be publicly listed companies whose financial reports are easily
accessible. You get a peek at their financial health, and you know what you're up against.
It's not always a David vs Goliath scenario; often, the smaller, more innovative companies
outperform their larger competitors.

   When we chat about competition, it's not always a bad thing. It keeps you on your toes,
pushing you to improve your product, your customer service. Plus, you get to learn from
those who've been around the block.

   So, who are these competitors? Here's the breakdown:

   Direct Competition: These are your most obvious competitors. If you're selling
      pizzas, it's the other pizza joints. Picture the Pepsi-Coca-Cola rivalry.

   Indirect Competition: These are a bit sneakier. If you have a toy shop downtown,
      your indirect competition might be that online toy store who's also targeting your
      city's kiddos.

   Replacement Competition: This one's tricky. It's about the alternatives, the
      substitutes. The folks who sell something different, but it can still replace what

     Coke vs. Pepsi The Ultimate Rivalry

        The soft drink industry has been dominated by two cola giants for decades - Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Their
     fierce rivalry has fueled some of the most memorable marketing campaigns, and among them, none is more
     iconic than the "Pepsi Challenge." This bold initiative, launched by Pepsi in the mid-1970s, invited consumers to
     participate in a blind taste test to determine which cola they preferred. The results became a pivotal moment in
     advertising history and sparked an ongoing debate about brand loyalty and consumer behavior. In the video,
     "Marketing Experts Break Down the Coke vs. Pepsi Rivalry" by Vanity Fair, experts delve into the dynamics of
     this legendary rivalry, revealing key insights and strategies that continue to shape the world of marketing

 Why Perform Competitor Analysis

Why should you bother to perform a social media competitor analysis for your strategy?
   First and foremost, understanding your competition gives you an understanding of your

customers. It's easy for businesses to get tunnel vision, focusing on their strengths while
forgetting to take a look around at what's happening in the marketplace. Competitive
analysis, especially on social media, gives you a fresh set of eyes and a clearer perspective
on what your customers want and need.

   Secondly, it helps you identify potential threats. Keeping tabs on your competitors'
social media activities gives you a heads-up on potential threats lurking around the
corner. Whether it's a new market entrant or a disruptive technology, a thorough analysis
of your competitors' social media activities will alert you well in advance.

   Thirdly, it allows you to set relevant benchmarks. Businesses often set performance

50 | Competition Check
standards or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), but without a solid understanding of the
competitive landscape, these benchmarks may be out of step with the market realities.
Monitoring your competitors on social media helps ensure your benchmarks are in line
with industry standards.

   Moreover, a social media competitor analysis is a fantastic tool for recognizing market
gaps. Even in a crowded market, there's always a blind spot your competition is missing.
Through a careful study of your competitors' social media activities, you could discover an
untapped niche or a customer group that's been overlooked.

   For instance, say you're in the furniture business. You might find that none of your
competitors are targeting the millennial market on social media. There's your gap. You can
then develop a social media strategy to engage millennials with modern furniture designs
and grow your customer base.

   A deep dive into your competitors' social media might uncover some struggling
businesses. Here's where potential opportunities for acquisitions or mergers could come
up. By merging with or acquiring these businesses, you could expand your operation,
improve your product quality, and tap into their distribution network to reach new
markets.

   In conclusion, a social media competitor analysis isn't just a "nice-to-have" for your
social media strategy; it's a vital tool that can steer your business in the right direction,
help you stay ahead of the curve, and ultimately, succeed in the marketplace.

How to Perform a Social Media Competitive Analysis

The article from Hootsuite outlines a step-by-step process for conducting a social media
competitive analysis, which is a critical tool for any business wanting to excel in the online
space. Here's a summary of the key points:

  1. Identify Your Competitors: Start by listing out who your competitors are. These
      could be businesses that offer similar products or services, operate in the same
      geographical area, or target the same audience demographic. You can use social
      listening tools or conduct a simple Google search to identify these competitors.

 2. Choose Which Social Networks to Analyze: Your competitors may not be active on
      all social networks, and neither should you. Prioritize the platforms where your
      target audience is most active. You could use a social media demographics guide to

                                                                                                                                                          Competition Check | 51
      help identify these platforms.

      presence on each platform. How many followers do they have? How frequently do
      they post? What's their brand voice and personality?
 4. Evaluate Your Competitors' Content: Study the types of content your competitors
      share. What gets the most likes, shares, or comments? Is it videos, images,
      infographics, or user-generated content? Use this information to inform your own
      content strategy.
 5. Measure Your Competitors' Engagement: Look at how your competitors interact
      with their audience. How do they respond to comments or complaints? Do they use
      any specific hashtags? Do they run contests or giveaways?
 6. Track Your Competitors' Posting Frequency: How often are your competitors
      posting? This can help inform your own posting strategy.
  7. Analyze Your Competitors' Audience: This involves studying the demographic
      details of your competitors' followers. What's their age, gender, location, and
      interests?
 8. Use Tools for Social Media Competitive Analysis: There are various tools available
      that can help streamline this process, such as Hootsuite, Sprout Social, or BuzzSumo.
 9. Document Your Findings: As you gather all of this information, document it in a way
      that allows you to make direct comparisons between your social media performance
      and that of your competitors.
10. Make Strategic Decisions: Finally, use all this information to make strategic
      decisions about your own social media strategy. Maybe you need to post more
      frequently, diversify your content, or engage more with your audience. Whatever it
      is, a competitive analysis will help you spot the areas where you can improve.

SWOT Analysis

A SWOT analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
and threats related to your business - or in this context, your social media marketing
strategy. Here's how it applies to social media:

   Strengths: These are the things your business does well on social media. Maybe you
have a highly engaged community, your video content receives massive views, or your
customer service via direct messaging is top-notch. This could also include factors like

52 | Competition Check
having a well-defined brand voice that resonates with your audience, or having
influencers or brand advocates who regularly share your content.

   Weaknesses: These are the areas where your social media marketing could use some
improvement. Perhaps your post frequency is inconsistent, your engagement rate is low,
or your content isn't resonating well with your audience. Or maybe your response time to
customer queries is too long. Identifying these weak points can help you devise strategies
to improve them.

   Opportunities: Opportunities are external factors in your business environment that
could provide a boost to your social media presence. Maybe there's an emerging social
media platform where your competitors are not yet active, or a trending topic that aligns
with your brand which you can capitalize on. Perhaps there are industry events, holidays,
or popular hashtags related to your business that you could leverage for increased
visibility.

   Threats: Threats are external factors that could potentially harm your social media
presence. This could be anything from changes in social media algorithms that decrease
your organic reach, to negative reviews or public relations crises that emerge online. Also,
it could be potential actions of your competitors - if they're planning to launch a big social
media campaign, for example, it could overshadow your own efforts.

   Conducting a SWOT analysis in the context of a social media competitive analysis
involves not just looking at your own strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats,
but also those of your competitors. This can give you a clearer picture of where you stand
in the social media landscape and help you identify ways to improve your performance
and gain a competitive edge.

   Remember, the goal isn't to copy your competitors, but to understand what they're
doing well and identify areas where you can differentiate yourself.

                                                                                                                                                          Competition Check | 53

      Exploring Meta Ad Library

     The Meta Ad Library is a treasure trove of information about the strategies your competitors are using to reach their target
     audience. Here's an exercise to get you familiar with it. We'll be doing three searches for your competitor or a brand you are
     familiar with. Here's how to do it:
     Search for a Competitor: Go to the Meta Ad Library and type in the name of your competitor or a brand that you're interested
     in. Browse through the ads that are currently active. What kinds of messages are they promoting? What is their call to action?
     How does their ad design reflect their brand identity?

Winning Combo: Content, Marketing,
and Measurement: The "See, Think, Do,
Care" Framework

CHERYL LAWSON

Introducing Avinash Kaushik's "See, Think, Do, Care" framework - a snappy, innovative
strategy to understand your customer's journey and align it with your social and digital
content. Imagine it as a cycle that your customers are constantly flowing through, with
each stage reflecting a different state of mind, a different need, a different level of
engagement.

Here's a brief rundown:

See: This is the largest possible audience, all the folks out there who could potentially be
interested in your products or services. They may not know they need your product yet,
but we're trying to catch their eye.

   Think: This is a subset of the "See" crowd. These are the people who are actively
thinking about a product or service like yours, but haven't quite made the decision to
purchase yet.

   Do: Now we're getting into serious territory. This group is smaller still, made up of
people who are ready to make a move. They're ready to buy, subscribe, download, you
name it.

   Care: This last group is the cream of the crop. These are your most loyal customers.
They've bought, they're happy, and they're likely to do it again. Not only that, but they're
also likely to tell their friends about how great you are.

   Now, how do we tackle content for each of these stages? This is where the fun begins.
Each stage requires a different approach.

See-Think-Do-Care framework for Social Media Content
   The beauty of the See-Think-Do-Care framework lies in its versatility and applicability

to virtually any content marketing strategy, including social media. It provides a clear
roadmap to content creation, helping you address the unique needs of audiences at
different stages in their customer journey. Let's break down how to use it in your social
media strategy:

   See: At this stage, your aim is to raise awareness and attract potential customers.
Content here should be engaging, informative, and shareable, but it doesn't need to
directly promote your product or service. Think of blog posts, infographics, and videos
that answer common questions or solve problems in your industry. Share this content on
your social platforms to attract a broad audience, gain followers, and build your brand
reputation.

   Think: Here, your audience is contemplating their options. They're aware of their needs
and are actively seeking solutions. Your social media content should guide them towards
your offerings without being overly promotional. Case studies, customer testimonials,
product comparison posts, and `how-to' content that features your product or service can
be effective here. This type of content can help sway their opinion in your favor and push
them further down the funnel.

   Do: At this stage, your audience is ready to take action. They've done their research,
they've weighed their options, and they're ready to make a decision. The content here
should be targeted, direct, and persuasive, with clear calls to action. Offer exclusive

56 | Winning Combo: Content, Marketing, and Measurement: The "See, Think, Do, Care" Framework
discounts, highlight the unique selling points of your product or service, share product
demos, or promote free trials.

   Care: This stage is all about nurturing and retaining your existing customers. Engage
with your loyal customers on social media by sharing user-generated content, offering
exclusive promotions or sneak peeks at new products, and asking for their input on
upcoming features or products. Your goal here is to keep them interested and engaged
with your brand, transforming them into brand advocates.

   By understanding and implementing the See-Think-Do-Care framework, you can
ensure that your social media content marketing is hitting all the necessary touchpoints,
effectively guiding your audience from awareness to conversion, and beyond.

CHERYL LAWSON

Navigating your path through the terrain of social media marketing can seem daunting,
particularly when deciding which social media platform is most suitable for your business.
You've defined your objectives; you may be aiming to hone your skills as a social media
marketer for an enterprise or leveraging your knowledge to boost your startup's growth.
In either scenario, the question of "Which social media platform is the best for my
business?" inevitably arises.

   This is a longstanding debate, yet it's important to realize that each network carries its
own significance. The choice of platform hinges not on general perceptions of `the best',
but on what best aligns with your unique business goals and fits the specific needs of your
customer personas.

   Social media platforms were developed with distinct objectives in mind. Facebook
sought to unify individuals worldwide, LinkedIn established an avenue for professional
networking, Instagram provided a platform for all age groups to capture and chronicle
their significant moments. Consequently, understanding the benefits unique to each
platform is vital. It's about deciding which platform offers the capabilities that best serve
your business goals, aligns with your industry and resonates with your defined customer
personas.

   Remember the initial chapters: "What business are you in?" and "Who is your
customer?" Keeping your specific industry and your target customer personas in mind
is key when assessing these platforms. Each one offers unique benefits and reaches
specific demographics, so consider where your customers are most likely to be active and
engaged. The platform that best reaches your customers and aligns with your business
objectives is the one you want to focus on.

     Side Note:

        Regardless of whether you're a budding startup or an established brand, it's wise to secure your brand name
     across all social media networks, even if you're not actively using them in your current strategy. This

                                                                                                                                                Every Network is an Island | 61
     preemptive measure ensures your brand name isn't hijacked or misused by others. The last thing you want is
     for someone else to lay claim to your brand's name.

Who Lives There?

A primary appeal of social media for marketers is the extensive targeting options it
provides. Unlike traditional marketing which often focuses on mass marketing, social
media marketing allows you to precisely target the audience for your marketing
campaigns.

   Before launching any marketing campaign, it's essential to set clear goals, including
defining the type of audience who should view your ads and how they should interact with
your business. For this, it's essential to know the demographics of users on each social
platform. Let's talk Statistics for a bit.

Facebook

Facebook is populated mostly by adults of 25-34 years age group. The second largest

                                                                                                                                                Every Network is an Island | 63
group is 18-24 years who make up 23.8% of Facebook's population and only 4.8% of users
fall into the senior age group. The biggest country present on the platform is India, while
users from the US and Canada are only 10% of the total Facebook population. As for
gender, males dominate the platform with 56% of the total population. Also, 51% active
users visit the website several times a day and 75% of Facebook users are at least college
graduates.

Instagram

On Instagram, the highest population is of 25-34 year olds who make up 33.1% of all users
and age group of 18-24 years is second with 29.6% share. Most of them come from the US,
whereas India and Brazil hold second and third positions respectively. 43% of these users
are college graduates and 42% earn over $75,000 per annum.

   Over 510 million users are females and males are behind with a difference of 20 million.
These users spend around 28 minutes a day on Insta. Most users follow at least a single
brand on the app and 73% of teens in the US find Instagram the easiest way to reach and
interact with a brand.

TikTok

TikTok is a customer favorite app and stands second among the most popular free apps of
2019. Its users are present in 141 countries while China, India, United States, and Turkey
are among the countries where it is more frequently downloaded and used.

   44% TikTok users are females and 56% are males. Out of these, 41% users are aged 16-24
years who spend at least 52 minutes every day on the app, watching videos related to
entertainment, dance, pranks, fitness and other categories.

   90% of TikTok or Douyin users access the app via Android smartphones and maintain a
healthy engagement rate of 52%. In 2019, people spent $115.3 million on the app for in-app
purchases, influencer marketing, etc.

   This was a brief overview of some popular social platforms. You can opt for the platform
that suits your business needs.

What Language Do They Speak?

Whether you're talking to friends in a party, communicating with little kids in social
gatherings, or sharing thoughts with business associates in a professional setting, you
should always be aware of your audience. When you choose the language or tone they
understand, you can conveniently communicate with each other without
misunderstandings.

   Don't forget this rule when communicating with your audience on social media.
Creating a profile on social websites is easy. What's difficult is to spread your message
and get people talking about the brand in a positive manner. However, this objective can
be achieved by determining what type of content the audience prefers and creating posts
accordingly.

Hashtags (#)

Hashtags were introduced by Chris Messina in an attempt to organize content on social
media. Twitter platform first introduced this unique feature in 2007, but it was later
adopted by Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, and LinkedIn due to its usability.

   A hashtag categorizes content on the basis of topic. If you want to reach the right
audience for your business, you need to target popular and relevant ones. Moreover, you
can also create custom hashtags to promote your products.

   Let's discuss this concept with an example. Imagine that a roofing service provider hires
you as a social media marketer. To build their business online, you need to come up with
suitable hashtags for the social marketing strategy. Here are a few trends and hashtags
that may prove useful:

   #roofing #roofingcontractor #construction #greenroofing #roofrepair #roofgutters

Long Form vs. Short Form Content

The internet users tend to have short attention spans. They easily get distracted and can
ignore your posts if they don't find it interesting. This is why content marketing in digital

                                                                                                                                                Every Network is an Island | 65
media focuses on captivating and concise content that can keep readers hooked till the
last line.

   If we need to keep the content short, how can we share important information or news
with the target audience?

   It's common for social media marketers to get confused about the length of content. But
you should remember that the content length depends on the interest of your audience as
well as the platform where you intend to post it.

   If you are planning to set up a company blog, it's best to opt for long-form content. The
purpose of blogging is to educate people about a relevant topic and offer comprehensive
solutions to problems. For example, if you are an expert in providing electrical installation
and repair services, you may want to write posts about safety tips for customers. Blog
posts can be 500-1,000 words, but you should aim for publishing blogs of 2,000-2,500
words to boost SEO score.

   LinkedIn is also suitable for posting long-form content. You can write about your area
of expertise and experiences to share knowledge with other professionals.

   Other social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. may be suitable for
short-term content. Whether you are thinking of creating text posts, videos, or images,
it's a better option to keep the content short for better engagement.

   Also, don't forget that long form videos aren't compatible with most social websites.
Instagram supports videos of up to 15 seconds. So, if you are creating long form
informative videos, it may be a good option to post it on YouTube and share a brief snippet
on Twitter and other social websites. Your followers who find the topic interesting will
visit your YouTube channel to watch the entire video.

What's Their Favorite Dish?

Back in the day, social media marketing was all about text posts and still images. With
technology advancements, a wide variety of content is now available to internet users.
Let's first take a look at the most popular types of digital content. After that, we will
discuss which content goes well with popular social websites.

   Blogs or articles
   eBooks
   Images (still images, GIFs, 360 images)

66 | Every Network is an Island
   Videos (recorded videos and live streaming)
   Infographics
   Testimonials
   Contests
   Polls
   Podcasts
   Webinars
   How-to guides

Instagram is an image-based platform. To promote your brand, you can share high-
quality images of products, team members, as well as stills from networking events.
Adding relevant captions and hashtags is also essential. A similar strategy is suitable for
Pinterest where you can capture attention via images.

   As for Facebook, videos perform far better than any other type of content. This includes
live streams as well as processed images for coverage of organizational events. You can
also post videos developed with the aim of advertising on your Facebook page.

   With the increasing population of TikTok, you shouldn't ignore its importance in the
marketing plan. You can complement videos with captions and can include links to your
website to increase web traffic.

   Twitter network was mostly known for its credibility when it comes to news and
information. Users of this platform show more interest in professionally processed
content which includes informational infographics and videos. Lately, in 2024, the
credibility of the platform has suffered as Elon Musk's pay for verified status has blurred
the lines of trustworthiness on the platform.

   For LinkedIn, you can turn to long form articles, user guides, and eBooks to increase
engagement. We all know YouTube is one of the most popular video streaming websites.
So, you can post videos on this platform regardless of their size or length.

Analyzing Twitter's Evolution: BM to
AM

CHERYL LAWSON

Discussing Twitter is a necessity, even if its demise seems imminent. The platform's
significance in communication, news sharing and societal movements since its
establishment remains noteworthy. Essentially, we should analyze it during two eras:
before Elon Musk (BM) and after his acquisition (AM).

   Presently viewed as a colossal disaster under Musk's ownership, Twitter's integrity has
suffered. Launching with mass firings of developers and alienating advertisers to the point
where major companies retracted their support-despite not being an optimal advertising
choice compared to Facebook, Instagram or Google-Twitter was still patronized due to its
large audience base.

   Musk intended for Twitter users to freely voice their opinions without censorship
despite his controversial business tactics leading many to dub the situation as a "dumpster
fire." Though you can interact with acquaintances on the platform, engaging becomes
more challenging due primarily to bots proliferating hate speech and explicit content.

   The decline in active users is evident; most only log in occasionally for mentions or
event interactions via sponsors that maintain accounts there. However, sustaining such
activity increasingly becomes burdensome.

                                                                                                                            Analyzing Twitter's Evolution: BM to AM | 69
   However, to appreciate Twitter's true potential, we need to look back to the era before
Musk. This was a time when Twitter's original purpose, as encapsulated by co-founder Biz
Stone, was at its purest.

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/introtosocialmedia/?p=390#oembed-1

In a series of captivating anecdotes from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone at the Cannes
Lions 2009, the birth, growth, and global impact of Twitter are traced. Born out of the
inspirations from simplicity and ease of communication present in platforms like AOL
Instant Messenger, Twitter grew into a real-time communication network, facilitating an
intriguing sense of connection among users. Initially, the allure of Twitter was the real-
time updates, as mundane as they may be, lending an intriguing peek into the lives of
others.

   A remarkable example includes a tweet from Stone announcing a pub change that led to
the new pub reaching its capacity within 10 minutes. This showcased Twitter's ability to
facilitate group coordination in real-time, akin to a flock of birds moving as a single unit.

70 | Analyzing Twitter's Evolution: BM to AM
This potential was also visible when Twitter's presence at a festival created a buzz and
brought people together.

   Twitter's potential extended beyond casual coordination, manifesting in profound
impacts on journalism and activism. One example saw a man in Egypt using Twitter to
document protests, demonstrating how social media could capture and spread significant
moments globally. Furthermore, a single-word tweet even managed to secure legal
assistance for someone in trouble, exemplifying Twitter's potential to affect real-world
change.

   The platform itself, however, wasn't just about technology but also about the triumph
of humanity. As seen in instances where Twitter was used to coordinate efforts during
wildfires, gas shortages, breaking news events, and natural disasters, the platform proved
to be a facilitator for collective human action.

   The notion of collective action is further strengthened by Twitter's open network
and ecosystem, fostering growth and diversification on a global scale. By opening its
infrastructure to developers, Twitter sparked the creation of over 11,000 registered
applications that generate three times the traffic of twitter.com itself. This approach
allowed Twitter to tap into the power of billions of mobile and internet users globally,
creating a potentially impactful and unpredictable open network.

   On the commercial side, Twitter has proven to be a valuable tool for businesses, leading
to increased revenue and customer engagement. Brands used Twitter for customer
service, monitoring customer complaints and providing immediate responses. Even small
businesses could stay connected with local customers without incurring substantial costs,
by using Twitter for marketing and customer service.

   Stone's recounting of Twitter's history not only presents the platform as a means of
communication and information sharing but also as an instrument of global connectivity
and collective action. The ability for businesses to leverage this platform for commercial
gain is significant, but equally, if not more important, is the potential of Twitter, or any
social media platform, to address complex global challenges by fostering a culture of
collaboration, openness, and interoperability.

     on a personal note:

        On a personal note, I am deeply saddened by Twitter's dramatic decline since Musk acquired the company in
     October 2022. Twitter was my favorite social network, primarily because of the conversations and connections

                                                                                                                             Analyzing Twitter's Evolution: BM to AM | 71
     it facilitated. I fondly recall receiving an email from then-Senator Barack Obama, inviting me to join him on this
     new platform. It was a thrilling era, seeing politicians and news outlets begin to leverage the power of social
     media.

        In 2009/10, Jeff Pulver initiated the 140 conference (named after Twitter's character limit at the time),
     bringing together enthusiasts who recognized Twitter's potential to connect the world. This inspired me to
     launch the SMTULSA Conference to unite social media enthusiasts in my own region.

        Twitter changed the trajectory of my career/personal brand.
         1. My dog's Twitter account @imajackrussell brought me speaking gigs, and sponsorships
        2. I created and sustained the annual SMTULSA Conference for 10 years & it all started with Twitter.
        Today, my visits to Twitter are limited to learning about new AI tools and receiving local weather updates
     through the #okwx hashtag, which remains invaluable for Oklahoma residents. However, the majority of my
     time is now spent on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and as of yesterday, (July 2023) Instagram's new Twitter
     competitor, Threads. We'll delve into the rise of these emerging social platforms later, but for now, it's a solemn
     farewell to the Twitter we once knew.
        The good old days were when the worst thing that happened on Twitter was the `fail whale'.

72 | Analyzing Twitter's Evolution: BM to AM
                                                                                                                                                      Twitter Fail Whale

Enough with the nostalgia about Twitter. It's probably evident from my reminiscing that it
held a special place in my heart during the BM era. However, let's shift our focus back to
the present. If you're considering Twitter as a part of your brand or project's social media
strategy, I have a couple of valuable exercises to help you learn how to effectively leverage
the platform.

     Exercise
        Exercise 1: Live Tweet a YouTube Video
        Objective: To enhance your ability to create compelling, real-time content and learn how to incorporate

     relevant hashtags effectively.
        Steps:
         1. Choose an interesting and relevant video from YouTube. This could be related to your industry, a
             motivational talk, or a tutorial - anything that provides value to your audience.
                                                                                                                             Analyzing Twitter's Evolution: BM to AM | 73
        2. As you watch the video, compose live tweets that summarize key points, insights, or interesting facts.
             Remember, each tweet is a standalone message, so it should be comprehensible on its own.

        3. Incorporate the official hashtag in your tweets. This could be the video title, the speaker's name, the
             event hashtag (ie: #TedxTulsa) or the topic being discussed.

        4. Engage with your audience. If they reply to your tweets or ask questions, respond promptly and keep
             the conversation going.

        This exercise not only helps you understand the dynamics of live-tweeting but also enables you to observe
     how your audience engages with different types of content.

        Exercise 2: Twitter for Search - #ai
        Objective: To explore the power of Twitter as a search tool and identify valuable content in your area of
     interest.
        Steps:
         1. Log in to your Twitter account or visit https://twitter.com/explore
        2. In the search bar at the top, enter the hashtag #ai and press enter.
        3. Browse through the resulting tweets to identify threads or individual tweets that catch your attention.
        4. Look for content that provides new insights, challenges your thinking, or offers a fresh perspective on

             artificial intelligence.
        5. Retweet your favorite thread or tweet, and consider adding a comment of your own to spark

             conversation.
        6. Make a note of any new influencers, thought leaders, or interesting accounts you come across during

             your search.
         7. This exercise will help you realize the vast amount of information available on Twitter, and how

             effectively using hashtags can streamline your search for quality content. Caution! Due to the increased
             prevalence of spam and inappropriate content on Twitter, particularly after Elon Musk's acquisition (AM),
             your search results may include potentially offensive tweets. For this reason, it's not recommended to
             conduct this exercise via a projected screen.

Just when I thought the Twitter Chapter was over, Elon Musk strikes again. This time,
it's changing the name of Twitter to X.

Facebook: Pioneering a Digital Revolution

From the hallowed halls of Harvard to practically every corner of the globe, Facebook's
journey is nothing short of iconic. Whether you've been captivated by the dramatization
of its inception in "The Social Network" movie, or pored over early interviews of a young
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's revolutionary impact on our societal fabric is undeniable.

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/introtosocialmedia/?p=396#oembed-1

The video, harking back to a time twelve years prior, beautifully captures the essence of
Facebook's mission and the groundbreaking vision its founders had:

   Breaking Convention: Facebook's approach wasn't just to be different for the sake of
it. They yearned to challenge the status quo, urging not just to opt for conventional
choices. The aim was to find a distinctive path because their vision was unlike any that had
come before. "Don't just make the conventional decisions, but think about how we can do
something differently than everyone else because what we're attempting is distinct from
prior endeavors."

   The Ripple Effect: It's a testimony to the power of ideas. The musings and efforts of a
handful can ripple out, influencing the lives of hundreds of millions globally. "The impact
of a small group of people's ideas can touch the lives of hundreds of millions of real
individuals every day."

   Embracing Failure: The Facebook ethos was to take chances, fueled by the right
intentions. Mistakes were part of the journey, but they believed in the support of their

76 | Facebook a Metaverse
community. "Don't fear trying something if the intentions are genuine. Even if you falter,
there's a community to support you, and undue criticism won't be your portion."

   Critical Creativity: Facebook's work environment thrived on fostering a blend of
analytical thinking and imagination. They didn't just want employees; they wanted
visionaries who could identify gaps and make monumental impacts. "Facebook urges its
workforce to be analytical and innovative, enabling them to identify voids and effect
significant changes."

   Expanding Horizons: Even at its inception, Facebook was never just about `status
updates'. It was about tapping into the potential of shared human experiences and the
complexities of the world around us. "The possibility for individuals to disseminate
intricate and meaningful insights about their environment is just at its dawn at Facebook."

   A Global Footprint: Beyond likes, shares, and pokes, Facebook facilitated heartwarming
adoptions and became the backbone of pivotal political movements, like during the Iranian
elections. "Facebook's influence spans the globe, from playing a role in adoption processes
to bolstering political revolutions such as the Iranian elections."

   The Future is Personal: Facebook was just scratching the surface. They foresaw a future
where every digital interaction would be deeply personal and interconnected. "We're
on the threshold of a future where every site and gadget feels like an extension of the
individuals we cherish and are familiar with."

   In retrospection, Facebook's journey underscores the idea that when a vision is powered
by genuine intent, resilience, and innovation, it can not only change the course of
technology but also deeply intertwine with the fabric of human lives and their
experiences.

Facebook's Societal Imprint: The Good, The Bad, and The Legal

Facebook, or Meta as it's now known, stands as one of the towering giants in the digital
realm. Its influence touches almost every facet of modern life, and with such expansive
reach comes a series of undeniable societal impacts, both positive and negative.

Positive Societal Impact

Global Economic Catalyst: Facebook has drastically altered the landscape of global

                                                                                                                                                       Facebook a Metaverse | 77
economic activity. By connecting businesses with potential consumers and clients, it has
made marketing more accessible and cost-effective. Small businesses, artisans, and even
hobbyists have found a global audience, leading to economic prosperity and encouraging
a spirit of entrepreneurship.

   Sharing Memories: In the age of smartphones and the internet, Facebook has become
a go-to platform to share cherished moments. By posting photos, videos, and tagging
friends and family, it has made it seamless for people to reminisce about memories,
rekindling connections and bridging the physical distance.

Negative Societal Impact

Mental Health Concerns: A dark cloud over the realm of social media, especially platforms
as vast as Facebook, is the evident link between its heavy usage and detrimental mental
health outcomes. Several research studies have painted a concerning picture, linking
excessive social media usage with depression, anxiety, loneliness, and even self-harm or
suicidal tendencies.

   Political Tampering: The platform hasn't been immune to controversies, with
allegations and evidence of it being used as a tool for political tampering. From the spread
of misinformation to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook has faced criticism for its
role in influencing elections and public opinion, intentionally or otherwise.

The Legal Battlefield: Class Action Lawsuit

Amidst the melange of pros and cons, the platform has also found itself embroiled in legal
turmoil. A class-action lawsuit, named In re: Facebook, Inc. Consumer Privacy User Profile
Litigation, has been brought against Facebook on behalf of its users. The allegations are
severe - claiming Facebook shared or otherwise provided unauthorized access to third
parties about users and their connections. This includes a vast spectrum ranging from
third-party app developers to advertisers and data brokers.

   The gravity of these allegations emphasizes the lack of stringent monitoring and
enforcement of data access and usage by these third parties. Facebook, now under the
name Meta Platforms, Inc., has faced this lawsuit under the vigilant eyes of the Honorable
Vince Chhabria of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.

78 | Facebook a Metaverse
   Despite the allegations and the consolidation of these lawsuits, Meta has categorically
denied any wrongdoing or liability.

Reflection

In reflection, Facebook's odyssey serves as a vivid testament to the power of vision,
genuine intent, resilience, and innovation. Such a combination can not only reshape
technological landscapes but also intricately weave into the tapestry of human
experiences and emotions. Boasting over 3 billion users, Facebook presents an undeniable
resource for business owners and organizations. It allows them to organically tap into
an expansive audience and leverage affordable paid options to reach their desired
consumers. This journey encapsulates the dual nature of the digital age. While it has
undeniably empowered businesses, fostered connections, and championed expression, it
also casts a spotlight on the profound responsibility tech giants bear. They must prioritize
users' mental well-being and staunchly defend the pillars of democracy. As we transition
to the next segment, we'll delve into the continued utility of Facebook for businesses and
showcase its transformative potential through real-world examples.

Business Optimization on Facebook:

While the digital landscape is constantly evolving, the tenets of a robust online presence
often remain consistent. Facebook, despite its occasional tumult, remains a bastion for
businesses keen on tapping into its vast user base. A proactive approach, centered around
optimizing and enriching a Facebook business page, can create a marked difference in
how a brand resonates with its audience. In 2021, I offered to audit a Facebook business
page for members of one of our facebook groups. All of this advise still rings true: Here's a
summary.

                                                                                                                                                      Facebook a Metaverse | 79
1. Visually Engaging Imagery:

   Regularly refresh your profile and cover photos to echo your brand's current themes
      or offerings.

   Infuse important business information in these visuals, such as contact info or
      promotional details.

   Use captions not just for clarity, but to engage or steer actions.

2. Responsive Engagement:

   Always be there; acknowledge comments, encourage sharing and tagging.
   Set up auto-replies for your messages. Quick responses can leave lasting

      impressions. We do this a lot during big events and festivals. Adding the most
      frequently asked questions as auto replies is a great time saver.

3. Content Curation:

   Share the love - when you share content from other sources, give them a shoutout
      by tagging.

   Lean on visuals - whether it's vivid photos or captivating videos, let them tell your
      story. Think about videos to answer FAQs or to give a sneak peek into your
      operations.

   Align with the world - time your posts with events or global happenings to remain in
      sync.

4. Competitive Intelligence:

   Use the Ad Library to explore ads running across Meta. It's a goldmine not just to see
      competitor ads, but also to understand the broader industry's pulse.

   Dive deep into ads concerning social issues, politics, or elections. Understanding
      who's funding these and their target audience can offer intriguing insights.

   Utilize Facebook's page transparency feature. When choosing a competitor for
      comparison, ensure you're on a level playing field.

5. Experiment and Adapt:

   Stay curious. With features like Reels gaining momentum, ponder how they might fit

80 | Facebook a Metaverse
      into your brand story.
   Monitor, learn, and tweak. Celebrate the content that's a hit and recalibrate what

      doesn't quite land.

And hey, while the digital toolbox might be ever-expanding, the essence remains: be
genuine, offer real value, and always have your ear to the ground. Facebook's gigantic
user base is not just a statistic; it's an array of opportunities. Conversations, connections,
conversions - it's all there, waiting for you. Up next, let's dive into some real-life examples
of businesses acing their Facebook game! Shall we?

     Facebook Business Page Analysis Exercise (Can be in class exercise and discussion or
   homework)

      For this exercise, we're going to deep dive into the social media presence of a brand you love or frequently use.
    Analyzing established brands can provide a wealth of insights for your own social media strategy.

     Step 1: Choose Your Brand
     Select a brand that resonates with you. It could be one you admire, are curious about, or even critique. Share the Facebook page
     URL of your chosen brand:
     Brand's Facebook URL: facebook.com/brandpage
     Step 2: Profile & Page Essentials
     A brand's cover and profile images are like the storefront of a physical store. They should be inviting, relevant, and in sync with
     the brand's identity.
     Cover & Profile Image: Does the brand have both? Are they relevant and updated?
     Description & Call to Action (CTA): Is the brand's purpose or offering clearly mentioned? Do they have an active CTA, like `Shop
     Now' or `Learn More'?
     Step 3: Community Engagement
     Understanding the brand's follower count and their interaction can provide insights into their community management efforts.
     Follower Count: How many followers do they have?
     Engagement Metrics: Analyze their general post metrics. Look at likes/reactions, shares, and comments.
     Brand Responses: Is the brand actively engaging with its followers by responding to comments?
     Step 4: Post Analysis
     Choose the brand's most recent post for this analysis.
     Target Persona: Based on the content, tone, and visuals of the post, can you identify which customer persona they are targeting?
     Post Enhancement: What changes would you suggest for their post or caption to make it more engaging or effective?

                                                                                                                                                       Facebook a Metaverse | 81
A Personal Note on Privacy

In addition to the intricacies of using Facebook for business, there's another essential
aspect I always emphasize to my students: Privacy. Given the vast amount of personal
information and content we share on Facebook, it's paramount to understand and control
who sees what.

   If you've been away from Facebook for some time, or if during our "Google Yourself"
assignment you noticed content from your Facebook profile popping up, it's a clear sign
you need to revisit your privacy settings.

   I strongly recommend doing a Facebook Privacy Checkup. It's a user-friendly tool
offered by Facebook to help you review and adjust who can see your posts, profile details,
and more. You can find a step-by-step guide here.

   Remember, it's your content and data. Make sure it's accessed only by those you truly
intend to share it with. Privacy isn't just about safeguarding data; it's about preserving your
personal boundaries in the digital realm.

The Acquisition and Rapid Growth
   In 2012, Facebook made a strategic move by acquiring a burgeoning photo-sharing

app, Instagram, for approximately $1 billion. This acquisition signaled the potential and
importance of visual-based social platforms in the ever-evolving digital landscape. The
purchase not only bolstered Facebook's portfolio but also ushered in an era of rapid
growth for Instagram.

   The Rise to a Cult-like User Base
   Instagram quickly transcended its initial status as a simple photo-sharing app. Its easy-
to-use interface, paired with a range of editing tools, allowed even amateur photographers
to produce captivating, professional-grade images. This democratization of photography,
combined with the app's social features, cultivated a devout and ever-expanding user
base.
   The `Platform Killer' Image
   Instagram's continuous evolution made it a formidable contender in the social media
realm. With its innovative features and consistent updates, it began overshadowing other
platforms, earning it the moniker of a `(insert social platform here) killer'.
   Stories and the Snapchat Influence
   In 2016, Instagram introduced `Stories,' a feature allowing users to share transient,
24-hour content. This was undeniably inspired by Snapchat's primary function.
Instagram's rendition, however, boasted a more intuitive interface and integration with an
already robust platform, making it instantly popular.
   A Hub for Photographers and Artists
   Instagram became an essential platform for photographers, both amateur and
professional. Its focus on visuals allowed artists to showcase their work, gain followers,
and even monetize their artistry through collaborations and sponsorships.
   Enter Reels: The TikTok Resemblance
   Continuing its trend of integrating successful external features, Instagram launched
`Reels' in 2020. A clear nod to TikTok's short-form video content, Reels gave users the
ability to create and explore short, engaging videos on a new dedicated Feed.
   The Rise of the Instagram Model and Influencer
   As Instagram grew, so did its influence on popular culture. The platform saw the rise

                                                                                                                                      Facebook a Metaverse: Instagram | 83
of the `Instagram Model' and the `Instagram Influencer' - individuals who leveraged their
substantial follower base to shape trends, promote brands, and in many cases, carve out
lucrative careers.

   Empowering Businesses: Tools, Shop, and More
   Instagram recognized the immense potential of its platform for businesses. It rolled
out a suite of features tailored for brands and entrepreneurs: from detailed insights and
advertising options to the `Shop' feature, transforming profiles into storefronts. Today,
businesses, big and small, harness the power of Instagram to reach audiences, drive sales,
and bolster their brand image.

The Rule of Thirds in Photography:

For many aspiring photographers and Instagram enthusiasts, understanding the
fundamentals of framing can enhance the quality of photos tremendously. One such
fundamental concept is the "Rule of Thirds."

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/introtosocialmedia/?p=416#oembed-1

Key Insights from the Video:

   The rule of thirds is paramount in both photography and cinematography. It's a key
      principle that paves the way for dynamic, aesthetically pleasing compositions.

   The concept involves imagining your image divided into nine equal segments by two
      vertical and two horizontal lines. The idea is to position the essential elements in
      your scene along these lines, or at the points where they intersect.

   Placing your subject at any of the four intersections or aligning them with these
      lines, be it horizontally or vertically, results in an engaging and balanced
      composition.

   By deliberately placing focal points off-center and providing negative space, a
      photograph can convey a richer story or mood. For instance, aligning a subject's eyes
      with the top horizontal line can create a compelling portrait.

   It's also crucial to consider multiple dimensions within a frame - left vs. right, up vs.

84 | Facebook a Metaverse: Instagram
      down, or forward vs. backward. This multi-dimensional approach can lead to a more
      dynamic visual narrative.

     Exercise: Photography with the Rule of Thirds

        Objective: To understand and apply the Rule of Thirds in photography, leading to the creation of dynamic and
     visually pleasing images. (Instructors, I usually allow students time during class to explore campus and take
     their photos, then we discuss them as a class)

        Instructions:
        Choose Your Subject: This could be anything - a friend, a pet, a building, a tree, or any object that catches
     your eye. Remember, the goal is to emphasize the subject using the Rule of Thirds.
        Frame with the Grid: Imagine your camera or phone screen is divided into nine equal rectangles, split by two
     horizontal and two vertical lines. Most smartphones and digital cameras have a built-in grid feature you can
     activate.
        Place Your Subject: Position your subject along one of the vertical or horizontal lines, or ideally, at one of the
     four intersections. Remember, this rule is a guide, not a strict directive. Feel free to experiment!
        Capture the Photo: Once you're satisfied with your composition, capture the image.
        Reflect: Look at the photo. Does your subject draw the eye? Does the surrounding space in the photo lead
     viewers to explore the rest of the image?
        Share and Discuss: Share your photo with peers or on a discussion platform. Discuss:
        Why did you choose the particular subject.
     The placement of the subject in accordance to the Rule of Thirds.
     Where you intend viewers to focus and how you hope they will explore the entire frame.
     Note: Save these photos as we'll be revisiting them later in the chapter for further exercises and discussions.
     Understanding the theory behind photography principles is one thing, but seeing its application in your photos
     will solidify your grasp on the concept!

Boosting Engagement with Reels and Stories: Tips and Tools

Instagram (and Facebook) Reels and Stories offer a great way to boost engagement and
visibility. Here are some tips and tools, including AI-driven ones, to optimize your content:

                                                                                                                                      Facebook a Metaverse: Instagram | 85
   Understand Your Audience: Before diving into tools, identify the content your audience
enjoys. Insights will show which Stories or Reels get the most engagement.

   Embrace AI for Content Creation: Tools like ChatGPT and Bard can help generate
creative ideas or even draft engaging captions for Reels, especially when experiencing

YouTube: A Deep Dive

A Brief History of YouTube

YouTube was founded in February 2005 by three former PayPal employees: Chad Hurley,
Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim. What began as a dating site (Yes, a dating site) quickly
pivoted to a user-generated video platform. In a little over a year, it grew so rapidly that
Google acquired the platform in November 2006 for $1.65 billion in stock.

   The platform underwent rapid evolution, introducing monetization for creators with
the Partner Program, expanding into mobile streaming, and eventually becoming the go-
to destination for video content of all kinds: from DIY tutorials to news, music videos, and
even full-length movies.

   Today, YouTube boasts over 2 billion logged-in monthly users, with videos in more
than 80 languages, making it a truly global platform.

YouTube for Business: Unlocking Potential

1. Second Largest Search Engine:
It's not just a video platform. YouTube is the world's second-largest search engine after
Google. This means businesses have a prime opportunity to ensure their content is
discoverable to billions, just by optimizing their video descriptions, titles, and tags.

   2. Telling Your Brand's Story:
There's no medium quite as compelling as video to convey a story. It's visceral, it's emotive,
and it's immersive. Businesses can utilize YouTube to craft and share their brand

                                                                                                            Youtube: The World's Second Largest Search Engine | 87
narratives, be it their company history, customer testimonials, product showcases, or
behind-the-scenes looks.

   3. Challenges - Camera Shyness:
One common hurdle many face is the discomfort or apprehension of appearing on camera.
It's a genuine concern, especially if you're representing your brand. Here are some
strategies to consider:

   Animated Videos: Use animated videos or explainer videos to convey information
without needing to appear on camera.

   Slideshows: Combine images and voiceovers to produce content. This can be
particularly useful for informational or tutorial-style content.

   Hire Presenters or Influencers: There are many YouTubers or presenters who can
represent your brand on your behalf.

   Practice Makes Perfect: The more you do it, the more comfortable you'll become. Start
by making unlisted videos or practicing live streams to gain confidence.

   4. Optimization Tips:
   Keyword Research: Just like SEO for websites, YouTube videos thrive on good keyword
research. Use tools like TubeBuddy or vidIQ to identify keywords that are relevant to your
business and have a good search volume.
   Engaging Thumbnails: A captivating thumbnail can be the difference between a click
and a miss.
   Consistent Posting: Like any platform, consistency is key. Regular uploads can boost
your channel's visibility and subscriber base.
   Engage with Your Community: Respond to comments, engage with other creators, and
be an active participant in your niche. This fosters a sense of community and can amplify
your reach.

     Examples

     My Mom's Unexpected YouTube Stardom

        If you ever need a heartwarming testament to the unpredictable charm of YouTube, I have a personal story
     for you.

        About a decade ago, armed with nothing but my smartphone and a heartfelt intention to preserve my family's
     oral traditions, I began recording my mother. She's an exceptional cook and a passionate gardener, having her

88 | Youtube: The World's Second Largest Search Engine
roots (pun intended!) in the countryside of Arkansas. With the sheer amount of wisdom she possesses about
the natural world and the kitchen, I thought, "Why not immortalize it?"

   One particular day, her garden was bursting with okra - a rich harvest that was too bountiful to consume
immediately. As she started preparing the okra for freezing, a method she used to preserve their freshness, I
instinctively began recording the process. Once done, I uploaded the footage to her dedicated YouTube
account and, admittedly, it slipped my mind soon after.

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them
                    online here: https://open.library.okstate.edu/introtosocialmedia/?p=420#oembed-1

   Imagine my astonishment when, months later, I stumbled upon that very video and found it had garnered
over 30,000 views! The comments section was a heartening mix of nostalgia and gratitude. Many mentioned
how her technique mirrored their own grandmothers', while others playfully remarked they'd love to be guests
at her Sunday dinners. To date, that video stands proudly with over 50,000 views.

   But the story doesn't end there. At the vibrant age of 86, my mom continues to be the star of her own little
corner of YouTube. This year, she's been caught in a playful battle of wits with backyard squirrels who have a
penchant for her tomato plants. Her strategy to pick the tomatoes before the cheeky critters get to them has
resonated with many, and it's one of our popular uploads this year. (Note the upgraded kitchen)

   The moral of this tale? In the words of a certain sneaker brand and slightly modified by the essence of our
experience: Just do it. You never know whose life you might touch, or how the simple acts we take for granted
can resonate deeply with others.

The Meteoric Rise of TikTok and its
Business Implications

CHERYL LAWSON

A Brief History of TikTok:

TikTok, initially launched as Douyin in China in 2016, entered the global market a year
later. In 2018, after acquiring the app Musical.ly, TikTok merged its platforms, quickly
capturing the hearts and screens of millions, especially Gen Z. Known for its short-form
videos, catchy soundtracks, and user-friendly editing tools, the app has transformed from
a fun platform for sharing lip-syncs and dance challenges into a significant force in social
media marketing.

The `Keith Lee Effect' - An Exemplary Success Story:

One of the most fascinating success stories emerging from TikTok is that of food critic

Keith Lee. His journey began with heartwarming content centered around cooking for

his postpartum wife, and it evolved as viewers got a front-row seat to her pregnancy

cravings with their second child. Today, Keith's reviews have taken a charitable turn. He's

turned the spotlight on small mom-and-pop restaurants, often struggling with marketing

budgets.

The "Keith Lee Effect" is a real phenomenon in the TikTok world. When he graces a

restaurant with a favorable rating, it isn't surprising to see lines stretching around the

block the very next day. Keith's organic and genuine approach to food reviews has made

him a beacon for local businesses. His story is a testament to the power of authenticity on

  TikTok and how the platform can rapidly amplify a message or a brand.  #foodcritic

Harnessing TikTok for Business:
While TikTok's spontaneity is its charm, there's a method to the madness for businesses:

   Educational Content: Much like YouTube, TikTok has become a hub for `how-tos' and
tips. Brands can leverage this by sharing expertise in bite-sized clips.

   Trend Integration: TikTok's algorithm places a heavy emphasis on trending sounds and
challenges. Brands can use these trends, integrating them smartly with their message. It
not only displays cultural relevance but can also boost visibility.

   Authenticity Over Polish: While high-production value videos are appreciated, the
TikTok community has always leaned towards raw and genuine content. Brands should
not shy away from candid moments.

   Engage, Don't Broadcast: Unlike traditional advertising platforms, TikTok is about two-
way communication. Engage with your followers, participate in challenges, and respond
to comments.

     Exercise: Dive into TikTok for Your Business!

        Objective:
     Leverage a trending sound on TikTok to create a promotional video for your school or project business. Analyze
     and understand the dynamics of engagement based on your video.

        Steps:
        Research Trending Sounds:
        Open the TikTok app.
     Go to the `Discover' tab. Here, you'll find current trending sounds and challenges.
     Listen to a few and select one that resonates with the message or vibe you want to convey for your school or
     business.
     Plan Your Content:
        Think about how the sound can be integrated with your business or school's promotional content. Does it
     evoke humor, sentimentality, motivation, or any other emotion that aligns with your brand voice?
     Draft a storyboard or jot down the primary elements you want in the video. This helps in ensuring that your
     video is cohesive and in sync with the sound.
     Shoot Your TikTok Video:
        Utilize the external tools discussed in the previous chapters for shooting and editing if needed. Remember,
     while quality is essential, TikTok appreciates authenticity. It doesn't have to be a high-production video.
     Incorporate branding elements subtly, like wearing branded merchandise, including the business logo, or
     showcasing your product or service.
        Upload & Analyze:

                                                                                                     The Meteoric Rise of TikTok and its Business Implications | 91
        If you have a test account or are comfortable with your main account, upload the video.
     Add relevant hashtags, an engaging caption, and ensure the video is set to `public.'
     Monitor the engagement over a period. Look for likes, shares, comments, and new followers. This will give you
     insights into what works and what doesn't.
     Reflect & Discuss (For those not uploading):

        Share your video concept with the class or a group.
     Discuss why you chose the particular sound and how it complements the business voice.
     Get feedback and refine your strategy for future videos.

        Note: Engaging with your audience is crucial on platforms like TikTok. If you receive comments or questions,
     make an effort to respond, as this can foster community and enhance brand loyalty.

        Good luck, TikTokers! Remember, consistency and authenticity are key. Happy filming!

Trending Social Networks: A Dive into
the Digital Age

CHERYL LAWSON

In the infancy of the digital age, the competition between emerging social networks often
seemed like a zero-sum game: one network's gain was another's loss. Fast forward to
today, and the digital landscape has radically evolved. With an array of platforms, users
now enjoy the luxury of choice, and businesses have multiple avenues to market their
brand.

The Rise of New Challengers

Twitter, once a singular giant in the micro-blogging arena, is now feeling the competitive
heat. With Elon Musk's recent forays causing ripples on the platform, competitors are
emerging to potentially dethrone the once-unchallenged king. Platforms like Sproutable
and Mastodon are coming up as potential rivals, providing alternative spaces for
conversation and content.

   Threads, once (just weeks ago) celebrated as the future of intimate topic-centric
discussions, now faces challenges in retaining its users despite its unique approach to
fostering deep engagements on particular subjects. Meanwhile, Twitter itself seems to
be evolving, aiming to be more comprehensive. Its efforts to emulate China's super app,
WeChat, are evident with features that go beyond just tweeting.

   Moreover, the audio-chat renaissance with Twitter Spaces and Clubhouse is reshaping
how we engage online. Lemon8 and Discord further emphasize this shift, blending
traditional messaging with voice channels, making communication more dynamic than
ever.

                                                                                                          Trending Social Networks: A Dive into the Digital Age | 95
The Power of Strategy in the Age of Diversity

The digitized world's beauty lies in its diversity; a vast array of platforms catering to
various user needs. With a correct digital marketing strategy, businesses can tap into
this diversity, promoting brand awareness, engaging their target audience, and fostering
enduring relationships.

   Remember the days of Myspace's dominance? It was the giant of its time, only to
be overshadowed by Facebook's meteoric rise. Such transitions teach businesses the
importance of adaptability and the dangers of complacency. As Circuit City fell to Best
Buy, and Polaroid was overshadowed by digital cameras, the message is clear: innovation
and adaptability are keys to enduring success.

   Competition breeds excellence. With multiple platforms vying for user attention, each
strives to outdo the other, leading to innovative features, better user experiences, and
more value for marketers.

Why Choose Just One?

Businesses often grapple with the `right platform' for their marketing efforts. In the age
of multiplicity, why choose just one? Leveraging different platforms for various marketing
needs can be a game-changer. An Instagram reel might be perfect for showcasing a
product, while a thoughtful thread on Threads could be ideal for brand storytelling.

   However, with great power comes great responsibility. It's not about being everywhere
but being where it matters. Understanding where your audience resides and how they
engage is pivotal.

Dive into the Now

2023 paints a vibrant picture of the social media landscape:
   Facebook remains a dominant force with its 2.7 billion users.

YouTube stands strong as the second-largest search engine with 2 billion users.
WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger cater to the instant messaging realm, boasting 2

96 | Trending Social Networks: A Dive into the Digital Age
billion and 1.3 billion users respectively.
WeChat holds its ground with 1.2 billion, especially strong in the Asian markets.
Instagram continues to be the go-to for visual content with 1.15 billion.
TikTok, the newcomer, has swiftly captured hearts, boasting nearly 700 million users.

Setting Sail in Digital Waters

Embarking on the digital journey requires not just a ship but a map. As you navigate the
vast waters of social media:

   Understand Your Audience: Know where they hang out, what they like, and how they
engage.
Content is King: Craft content that resonates. Authenticity matters.
Engage: Social media is not a monologue. Engage with your audience, respond to
comments, and foster a community.
Adapt and Evolve: The digital landscape is ever-changing. Stay updated with trends and
be ready to pivot when needed.

                                                                                                           Trending Social Networks: A Dive into the Digital Age | 97
Analytics - The Backbone of Your
Social Media Strategy

CHERYL LAWSON

In the modern digital landscape, there's a saying: "If it can't be measured, it can't be
managed." This holds particular resonance in the realm of social media, where the sheer
volume of data can be dizzying. Yet, tucked within this deluge of data are the golden
insights that can steer campaigns to success and refine content to engage more
effectively.

Why Analytics Matter

Every interaction a user has on social media, whether it's clicking a link, liking a post, or
watching a video, generates data. When interpreted, these actions offer deep insights into
user behaviors, preferences, and trends. Armed with this understanding, businesses can
tailor their strategies, ensuring their content hits the mark with their target audience.

Built-in Analytics and Third-party Tools

While most major social media platforms come with their own suite of analytics (Facebook
with its Insights, Instagram with its analytics for business accounts, and so forth), those
looking for more granular, cross-platform insights often turn to third-party tools:

98 | Analytics - The Backbone of Your Social Media Strategy
 Iconosquare: Initially centered around Instagram and Facebook, Iconosquare has
   expanded its reach, now offering support for Twitter and TikTok as well. Its visual
   analytics platform, complemented by easy-to-download graphs and graphics, makes
   reporting a breeze.

 Hootsuite: Not just a scheduling tool, Hootsuite provides in-depth analytics across a
   range of platforms, aiding in both content planning and performance review.

 Sprout Social: This is a comprehensive tool providing analytics, scheduling, listening,
   and reporting for a cross-channel perspective.

 HubSpot: Beyond its renowned inbound marketing tools, HubSpot offers a robust
   suite of social media analytics.

 Falcon.io: It integrates analytics insights with engagement, listening, and publishing
   features, offering a holistic view of a brand's social presence.

 Zoho Social: Tailored for growing businesses, it provides real-time monitoring
   coupled with actionable insights.

 Meta Business Suite: Designed for Facebook and its associated apps, this suite
   delivers profound insights and advertising tools.

Key Metrics to Monitor

For those steering organic social media campaigns, defining and adhering to specific
metrics that echo with your overarching business goals is essential. Some of these metrics
could include:

   Engagement rates (likes, shares, comments)
   Video views or play duration
   Click-through rates on shared content
   Growth trajectory in followers or subscribers

Remember, the key lies in consistency. Pinpoint metrics that align with your goals and
monitor them at regular intervals, be it weekly, monthly, or annually. This not only helps
in recognizing trends but also in course correction whenever needed.

Running Ads? Here's Your Guide to Measurement

The success of social media advertisements can be gauged robustly. Platforms, be it
Facebook, Instagram, or others, provide a rich tapestry of metrics, from click-through
rates and leads generated to sales conversions and user interactions. However, measuring
is just step one. To truly harness the power of ads, brands must be willing to analyze and
iterate based on what the data reveals.

   In the vast expanse of social media, analytics stands as a lighthouse, guiding strategies
towards success. By decoding what truly engages audiences, businesses can fine-tune
their approach, resulting in content that resonates and campaigns that deliver. As we
journey ahead, we'll dive deeper into each analytical tool, unveiling how to derive
actionable insights from them. So, stay engaged and let's navigate this analytical odyssey
together!

Keep Calm and Be Platform Agnostic:
A Content-First Approach

CHERYL LAWSON

In an ever-evolving digital landscape, myriad social media platforms beckon businesses
and content creators. While tempting to plunge into every platform available, a wiser
strategy revolves around the essence of your message--the content itself. Instead of
spreading too thin, take a content-first approach, which means prioritizing your message
and then tailoring it to each platform you deem beneficial.

Why Content-First?

Content, at its core, is the foundation of any marketing strategy. Before determining which
platform best serves your needs, establish your message, voice, and desired impact. Your
content represents your brand; platforms are merely channels to convey it.

Crafting a Robust Content Strategy

   Understand Your Goals: Whether you're aiming for brand awareness, engagement, or
      sales conversions, your goals will shape your content.

   Know Your Audience: Platforms are diverse because audiences are. Tailor your
      content based on where your target audience primarily hangs out.

   Type & Frequency: From blog posts and infographics to podcasts and videos, the
      type and frequency of content should align with both your resources and audience
      preferences.

   Measure and Adjust: Use KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to monitor performance.
      Adjust content and strategy accordingly.

                                                                                           Keep Calm and Be Platform Agnostic: A Content-First Approach | 101
Brand Voice & Authenticity

Your brand voice should be consistent across platforms but adapted to each platform's
language and culture. Authenticity reigns supreme; hence, storytelling should be genuine,
reflecting your brand's ethos.

The Art of Content Repurposing

Given the energy and time devoted to content creation, repurposing offers a smart way to
maximize reach without reinventing the wheel. An infographic can be broken down into
bite-sized visuals for Instagram, or a blog post can be transformed into a podcast.

Mastering Live vs. Processed Content

The spontaneity of live videos offers authenticity, whereas polished and processed videos
project professionalism. A blend of both caters to varied audience preferences.

Essential Tools for the Trade

Even on a budget, there are tools to enhance content quality. From smartphones and
tripods for video to Canva for graphics, investing in a few tools can significantly amplify
your content.

Engaging Through Captions & Hashtags

Pair your visuals with compelling captions. While brevity often wins, occasional deep

102 | Keep Calm and Be Platform Agnostic: A Content-First Approach
dives can engage audiences differently. Hashtags, when used judiciously, enhance
discoverability and community engagement.

Understanding the Younger Demographic

If targeting Gen Z or younger millennials, consider engaging them in content
brainstorming. Their tech-savviness and understanding of current trends can offer fresh
perspectives.

Navigating Ethical Waters

While daring content can gain attention, it's pivotal to approach with sensitivity and
awareness. Avoid cultural appropriation, offensive content, or anything that can tarnish
your brand reputation.

Persistence Pays Off

In the digital arena, overnight success stories are rare. Patience, consistency, and
adaptability are the hallmarks of a sustainable content-first approach.

   --
   In the maze of platforms, a content-first approach ensures you never lose sight of
your brand's essence. Platforms will evolve, emerge, or even disappear, but genuine, high-
quality content will always find its audience. Prioritize content, be adaptable, and the right
platform will amplify your message.

                                                                                          Keep Calm and Be Platform Agnostic: A Content-First Approach | 103

Time Management and Social Media:
Let AI Be Your Sidekick

CHERYL LAWSON

Remember when we chatted about analytics tools? Many of those tools can also help
schedule content.

   I'll add one more recommendation,
   The Social Media Time-Trap
   We all know the charm of social media for businesses. But, without some discipline and
cool tools, you'll be endlessly scrolling instead of strategizing. Been there, done that!
   Two big things to keep in mind:

  1. Don't Spread Too Thin: You don't need to be on every platform. Pick ones that align
      with your goals.

 2. Stay Focused: It's super easy to get distracted. Set timers for tasks. Got a tweet to
      post? Set aside specific time for it.

Juggling different accounts? Grab a password manager. Trust me, it's a lifesaver. No more
forgotten passwords or those risky sticky notes!

   AI to the Rescue: Social Media Automation
   Here's where AI steps in and makes magic:

   Chatbots: Tools like MobileMonkey or ManyChat can handle common questions,
      bookings, or even lead generation on platforms like Facebook Messenger. It's like
      having a 24/7 customer service rep!

   Image Recognition: Tools like Google Cloud Vision can scan user-generated content
      for images related to your brand. This way, you can jump into conversations you
      didn't even know were happening.

   Predictive Analysis: Platforms like Crimson Hexagon can predict future trends
      based on social media chatter. Talk about staying ahead of the curve!

   Tailwindapp Ghostwriter: Tailwindapp's new AI-based technology generates

Plan Your Social Media Like a Pro
   Planning is still key. And with a content calendar, you're golden. Find a template or whip

up your own. Schedule a month ahead, tweak as events unfold, and make sure everyone's
in sync.

   If time zones or odd hours have you tied up, scheduling tools like SocialPilot, HootSuite,
or Feedly have got your back.

   Watch Out for Those Oops Moments!
   Automated scheduling is fantastic, but remember Sephora's hashtag mishap? Double,
no, triple-check before scheduling. And keep up with current events. Event the best
content can seem insensitive if a world event has happened.
   IFTTT and Beyond
   Heard of "If This, Then That"? IFTTT lets you automate content across platforms. It's
nifty, but remember to review. Automation's neat, but you want that genuine touch -
always.
   AI's a game-changer, but it doesn't replace the human touch. Use it to free up time,
avoid repetition, and get insights. Just always add your personal flavor. After all, social
media is about making genuine connections.

Nurturing Engagement for Business
Growth

CHERYL LAWSON

In the age of digitization, businesses are increasingly turning to social media to amplify
their reach. While boosting follower counts is one metric of success, true growth is driven
by fostering deeper connections and active interactions. This chapter delves into the
importance of engagement and how it plays a pivotal role in elevating your brand's social
media presence.

The Depth of Engagement

Merely having a presence on social media isn't enough. Sure, the number of followers
can look impressive, but what really counts is how many of them actively engage with
your content. Whether it's a like, a share, or a comment, these engagements signal that
your audience isn't just passively scrolling past, but is genuinely invested in what you're
offering.

   Let's put it this way - having followers is good, but having engaged followers? That's the
gold standard. Why? Because consistent interaction ensures your content keeps popping
up on their timelines, keeping your brand at the forefront of their minds.

The Digital Competition Arena

Today, the digital world offers countless avenues for brands to make their mark. But
with increased accessibility comes increased competition. If your content doesn't spark
interest, users will swiftly move on to something that does. So, keeping them hooked is
essential. And how do you do that? By regularly posting engaging content and staying
responsive to their interactions.

                                                                                                                      Nurturing Engagement for Business Growth | 107
Social Listening

Want to monitor how your brand is faring in terms of engagement? There's a toolkit for
that. Platforms like Iconosquare, Buzzlogix, Zoho Social, and Agorapulse not only track
engagement rates but also gauge your brand's reputation across the social sphere.

Silence Isn't Always Golden

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, the interaction just doesn't pour in. Before hitting
the panic button, pause and reassess. Is it your content? Or perhaps the platform?
Tweaking your strategy based on honest introspection can turn things around.

   Also, remember, your brand isn't just a logo and a tagline. It's a personality. And
personalities connect best when they're genuine. Hosting live Q&A sessions, showcasing
your team, and leveraging user-generated content can humanize your brand and drive
meaningful interactions.

Influencers: The New-Age Brand Ambassadors

For an added engagement boost, consider influencer collaborations. Their endorsement
can introduce your brand to a broader audience, boosting visibility and, in turn,
engagement.

Why Email Isn't Outdated

Think email's had its day? Think again. Regular emailers, newsletters, and targeted
campaigns are a proven way to keep your audience in the loop. By directing them to your
website or latest blog post, you're nurturing a deeper brand-consumer relationship.

108 | Nurturing Engagement for Business Growth
Handling Negative Feedback

In the business world, you can't please everyone. But how you handle dissatisfaction says
a lot about your brand. Instead of viewing negative feedback as a setback, consider it an
opportunity for growth. Address concerns with empathy, offer solutions, and always strive
to better your service.

Troll Alert!

Navigating the social media landscape also means encountering trolls. It's crucial to
distinguish genuine feedback from baseless criticism. Set community guidelines and stick
to them. Always engage with grace and never let trolls dictate your brand narrative.

Transforming Feedback into Strategy

Negative comments, though challenging, can be your road map to improvement. Instead
of shying away, lean into constructive criticism. Address concerns, tweak your strategies,
and let your audience know you value their input. This not only builds trust but
strengthens brand loyalty.

Prioritizing Customer Relations

At the heart of every thriving business is a loyal customer base. Prioritize their needs,
address their concerns, and always aim for excellence in service. By cultivating a
customer-centric culture, you not only bolster brand reputation but ensure long-term
success.

   While growing your follower base is essential, true success lies in meaningful
engagement. Value your audience, prioritize their feedback, and consistently deliver
quality - the pillars of a robust social media strategy.

The Social Media Job Guide: Tips for
Aspiring Professionals

CHERYL LAWSON

For those aspiring to forge a career in social media, this chapter's for you. While
organizations like Social Media Tulsa excel in project management and event-based social
media, the journey for beginners can be a roller-coaster.

   Decoding the Social Media Myth
   It's a misconception that success in social media revolves only around fluency with
platforms and content creation. Social media expertise is deeply rooted in marketing
principles. Once you internalize these foundational concepts, you'll be leagues ahead
of others in the game. Although technology gifts us myriad platforms, the essence of
marketing remains consistent.
   Lessons from the Internship Trenches
   Early in your career, internships provide valuable firsthand experience. While they're
a gateway to invaluable insights, they can also be a whirlwind of tasks. As the new kid
on the block, you might sometimes find the blame landing on your desk. Embrace these
moments; they shape resilience and equip you for future roles.
   Does Your Resume Stand Out?
   Your resume is more than just a document; it's your first impression. A bland or
incomplete resume can close doors even before they open. Highlight your skills,
experiences, and strengths in a captivating design that grabs attention. Before sending it
out, ensure it's error-free and tailor-made to align with the roles you're targeting.
   Is LinkedIn Still Relevant?
   LinkedIn, established in 2003, has aged like fine wine. While some argue its golden days
are over, the platform remains a potent tool for professionals. Many recruiters actively
source and even interview candidates here. Engage, share insights, and foster connections
on LinkedIn--it could be your ticket to your dream job.
   Venturing Out Alone
   Joining a seasoned team offers rich learning experiences, but solo ventures might
appeal to the entrepreneurial spirit in you. Freelancing can be the first step, eventually

leading to your own agency. Before embarking on this journey, devise a solid business plan,
from strategies to resources, and consider creating a professional online presence.

   Showcasing Your Skills: The Portfolio
   Your portfolio is a testament to your abilities. Employers and clients alike will ask
to see proof of your expertise. If you're starting out and lacking in substantial work to
showcase, consider crafting your own personal brand on various platforms. This can serve
as tangible evidence of your proficiency.

                                                                                                  The Social Media Job Guide: Tips for Aspiring Professionals | 111
Mastering Social Media Strategy:
Drawing Insights from "How Benjamin
Button Got His Face"

CHERYL LAWSON

In the iconic TED talk by Ed Ulbrich on how Benjamin Button was brought to life, a
profound journey of innovation, collaboration, and persistence was unfolded. Taking
inspiration from the dedication and creativity of that team, we've curated a guide to craft
your own social media strategy. Just as Benjamin Button's face was a masterpiece, so too
can be your digital footprint.

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/introtosocialmedia/?p=118#oembed-1

   1. ADMIT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM (Understanding Your Current Position)

   History & Background: Before you can solve a problem, you must recognize and
      understand it. Dive into the history of your brand's social media presence and
      understand its evolution.

   Current Environment: Examine the current digital landscape, how your brand is
      positioned, and the challenges you're facing.

2. BREAK DOWN THE PROBLEM (Setting Smart Goals)

   Identify Objectives: List everything you hope to accomplish. This could be
      increasing followers, boosting engagement, or driving website traffic.

   Analyze the Details: Dive into the intricacies of your current strategy. As Ulbrich
      explored the markers in Benjamin's aging, you too must understand the pivotal
      moments and elements in your social media journey.

   Challenge the Norm: Sometimes, it's essential to reconsider and even discard long-

      held beliefs or practices. Be willing to pivot or completely revamp your strategy.
3. TECHNOLOGY STEW (Conducting a Social Media Audit)

   Seek Inspiration: Just as the creators looked to other industries for technology
      solutions, so should you. There might be a strategy, tool, or platform in another
      industry that's perfect for your needs.

   The Aha Moment: This is when things begin to click. When you find that strategy,
      tool, or idea that promises to revolutionize your approach.

   Imagine the Possibilities: Always be open to innovative approaches. Pose the
      question, "What if?"

4. SANDBLAST THE EDGES (Formulating a Plan)
   Based on your audit, objectives, and inspiration, carve out a tailored social media
      strategy. This is the blueprint that will guide all your actions on digital platforms.

5. BOX OFFICE (Measuring Performance)
   Quantify Outcomes: Just as box office numbers reflect a movie's success, your
      metrics - followers count, engagement rate, click-throughs - will depict the success
      of your strategy.
   Test, Test, Test: The digital world is ever-evolving. Consistently test new strategies,
      tools, and content types to see what resonates best with your audience.

In conclusion, crafting a successful social media strategy requires understanding,
innovation, and adaptation, much like the journey of creating Benjamin Button's face. As
you embark on this journey, let persistence be your guide and creativity your tool. Happy
strategizing!

company or department within the university. You'll pick a client/company (real or
fictional), focusing on an organization with a decision-maker for whom you'll design the

   Steps 3-4: March 9
   Steps 5-7: April 6
   Steps 8-10: May 4

   Step 3. Eye on the Customer
   Identify target audiences using client criteria or platform data, and create customer
personas with demographics and psychographics.
   Step 4. Know the Competition
   Examine competitors' social media performance and compare it to the client's. Identify
standout tactics for both.
   Step 5. Social Media Checkup

                                                                                                                                Course Project: Social Media Strategy | 117
   Assess what's working or not, audience engagement, target audience network usage,
and comparison to the competition.

   Step 6. Tone It Up
   Decide on a communication style for your strategy based on audience, personas, and
platform suggestions. Include a hashtag strategy.
   Step 7. Content Countdown
   Pick the networks to use based on target audience and persona data. Create a content
calendar for March, April, and May.
   Step 8. Content Crafting
   Develop content, captions, posting dates/times, including photos, videos, links, reposts,
and captions.
   Step 9. Platform Play

(Meta Business Manager/ Creator Studio, Tailwind, Iconosquare, Buffer, Hootsuite,
Creator Studio, IFTTT, etc.).
   Step 10. Measure and Report
   Submit your overall strategy, content plan, and any analytics available from posted
content.
