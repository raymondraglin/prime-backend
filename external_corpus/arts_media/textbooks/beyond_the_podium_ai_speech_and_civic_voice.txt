1.0: WHY PUBLIC
SPEAKING MATTERS
TODAY

   Tiffany Petricini

Communication is how we make meaning, form relationships,
and shape the world around us (Carey, 1989). It is not just
something we do. It is how we exist together. Whether we are
telling a story, asking a question, presenting an idea, or sitting
in silence beside someone we care about, communication
allows us to connect, understand, and be understood.

   This book begins not only with public speaking as a skill,
but with communication as a human practice. From
interpersonal conversations to civic speeches, from face-to-face
dialogue to AI-mediated interaction, our ability to
communicate with care and clarity has never been more
important or more complex.

   We live in a time when communication is everywhere, and
yet meaning is easily lost. Algorithms sort our messages.
Generative AI tools assist--and sometimes mislead--our
voices (see Gillespie, 2014). Digital platforms alter how and
when we are heard. Amid all this, the ability to speak
4 | 1.0: WHY PUBLIC SPEAKING MATTERS TODAY

thoughtfully, listen actively, and build shared understanding
remains essential.

   This book focuses on one powerful form of
communication: public speaking. But it does so within a
broader goal. You will work toward becoming a more
competent communicator overall. Competent
communicators know how to adapt across contexts. They
understand audience, purpose, ethics, and effect. They know
when to speak, when to listen, and how to respond. They
also reflect on how their communication is shaped not just by
personal choices but also by technologies, cultures, and power
structures.

   Public speaking provides a vital space to practice and apply
those skills. Whether you are addressing a classroom, leading
a community meeting, or sharing a message online, public
speaking invites you to be intentional. It asks you to clarify
your message, reflect on your audience, and consider the
lasting effects of your words.

   And yes, public speaking still matters. Despite the rise of
texts, tweets, and short-form videos, people continue to
gather--online and in person--to listen. TED Talks, town
halls, graduation speeches, campaign rallies, startup pitches,
Zoom meetings, advocacy campaigns, and digital storytelling
events all rely on the enduring power of one person speaking
to others with purpose.

   Today, those speeches may be written with the help of AI,
delivered to hybrid audiences, or reshaped through
                         1.0: WHY PUBLIC SPEAKING MATTERS TODAY | 5

algorithmic filters. Learning to speak beyond the podium
means learning not only how to organize your ideas and deliver
them clearly, but also how to navigate the media environments
that shape your message and influence its reach.

   This book will help you build both practical skills and
critical awareness. You will learn how to prepare and deliver
speeches. More importantly, you will develop tools to think
carefully about your role as a communicator in a networked
and post digital world. Together, we will explore what it means
to construct meaning--and to do so with responsibility,
creativity, and care.

1.1: WHY IS
COMMUNICATION
IMPORTANT?

   Tiffany Petricini

Learning Objectives

 1. Explore three types of public speaking in everyday life:
      informative, persuasive, and special occasion

 2. Understand the benefits of taking a course in public
      speaking

 3. Explain the benefits people get from engaging in public
      speaking

 4. Explain how AI impacts different types of public
      speaking and message delivery

We live in a world shaped by communication. Every
relationship, every workplace, every community depends on
our ability to share ideas, listen actively, and collaborate
effectively. This book is not just about public speaking. It is
about becoming a more intentional communicator in all areas
of life--whether you are giving a speech, participating in a
                            1.1: WHY IS COMMUNICATION IMPORTANT? | 7

group project, writing an email, or navigating a tough
conversation with someone you care about.

   Good communication is not just about talking. It is about
making meaning with others. It involves listening, reflecting,
adapting, and responding. It requires an understanding of
context, audience, purpose, and ethics. And it is one of the
most important skills you can develop, no matter your career
path or goals.

Three Purposes of Public
Communication

One of the most direct ways communication shows up in
public life is through speaking. While this book explores
multiple forms of communication, public speaking offers a
unique opportunity to practice meaning-making with a visible
audience. Public messages often serve three main purposes:

Course?

The course that accompanies this book offers more than
presentation practice. It gives you tools to build
communication competence across settings. Some of the key
benefits include:

 Stronger critical thinking: You will learn how to
   organize ideas clearly, evaluate evidence, and
   communicate with purpose. These skills support
   effective dialogue, not just speeches.

 Improved interpersonal and group communication:
   You will gain awareness of how your verbal and
   nonverbal choices affect others, and how to adapt based
   on audience, context, and goals.

 Greater confidence: Whether you are asking a question
   in class, leading a meeting, or giving a formal talk,
   confidence grows with practice. You will develop
   techniques for managing anxiety and becoming more
   comfortable in a variety of communication situations.

 Ethical awareness: You will explore how language can
   include or exclude, amplify or silence, empower or harm.
   Ethical communication means thinking critically about
   the impact your words have on others.

1.2: THE PROCESS OF
PUBLIC SPEAKING

   Tiffany Petricini

Learning Objectives

 1. Identify the three components of getting your message
      across to others

 2. Distinguish between the interactional models of
      communication and the transactional model of
      communication

 3. Analyze the evolving role of AI in interactional and
      transactional models of communication

 4. Explain the three principles discussed in the dialogical
      theory of public speaking

Communication is not simply about transmitting
information. It is about creating shared meaning. Some call
communication a science (Berger & Chaffee, 1988). Whether
we are engaging one person or addressing a large group,
effective communication relies on our ability to connect with
others, adapt to context, and respond to feedback. Public
speaking is one of the most visible ways to practice these skills,
                               1.2: THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING | 13

but it also serves as a window into how all communication
works.

   To become a strong public communicator, you must
understand both the components of communication and the
theories that help explain how communication functions in
everyday life.

Three Core Components:
Message, Skill, and Presence

Getting your message across requires more than just good
ideas. It involves three essential components: the message itself,
your communication skills, and your presence or sense of
purpose.

   Message: The content of what you say must be clear,
      coherent, and meaningful. A strong message is well-
      organized, tailored to the audience, and supported by
      credible evidence. If your audience cannot follow or
      relate to your content, they will tune out--even if your
      delivery is polished.

   Skill: Communication involves both verbal and
      nonverbal elements. Your voice, gestures, eye contact,
      pacing, and use of space all contribute to how your
      message is received. These skills can be practiced, refined,
      and adapted to fit different contexts.

   Presence: Audiences respond when speakers are
14 | 1.2: THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING

      engaged and invested in what they are saying. Passion,
      curiosity, urgency, or care can help draw people in.
      When your message matters to you, it is more likely to
      matter to others.

Together, these components support not only public
speaking, but everyday communication--meetings,
interviews, collaborative work, and conversations that matter.

Models of Communication: From
Interaction to Transaction

To understand how communication works, scholars have
developed several foundational models. Two of the most
                               1.2: THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING | 15

influential are the interactional model and the transactional
model.

   The interactional model sees communication as a one-way
flow of information from sender to receiver. While this model
introduces key ideas such as encoding, decoding, and feedback,
it often treats communication as a series of exchanges rather
than a shared experience. It is useful for thinking about basic
message design, but it has limitations when applied to real-
world interactions (see Shannon and Weaver, 1963; Schramm,
1954). In 1960, Berlo, using Shannon and Weaver and
Schramm's early models of communication, introduced the
SMCR Model.
16 | 1.2: THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING

        Figure 1.1: SMCR Model of
               Communication

Adapted from Berlo's SMCR Model of Communication (1960)
and designed by Dr. Tiffany Petricini, this image outlines four
essential elements--Source, Message, Channel, and
Receiver--as a linear framework for understanding how
communication occurs

Image Long Description
This image visually represents the Berlo's SMCR
communication model, which breaks down communication
into four components:

 1. Source - Depicted by an icon of a person within a red
      box labeled "SOURCE." This represents the originator
                               1.2: THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING | 17

      of the communication.
 2. Message - Shown as a speech bubble inside an orange

      box labeled "MESSAGE." This represents the content or
      idea being communicated.
 3. Channel - Represented by a broadcasting tower icon
      within a teal box labeled "CHANNEL." This
      symbolizes the medium or method used to transmit the
      message.
 4. Receiver - Depicted by another person icon in a gray
      box labeled "RECEIVER," representing the individual
      who receives and interprets the message.

   Arrows connect the boxes from left to right, indicating the

direction of the communication process from the source to the
receiver.

The transactional model views communication as a
simultaneous, dynamic process in which all participants are
both senders and receivers. Meaning is not just sent or
received--it is co-created. This model emphasizes shared
experience, context, and the continuous exchange of signals,
including nonverbal cues, interruptions, and emotional tone
(see Barnlund, 2013).

    Figure 1.2: Transactional Model of
18 | 1.2: THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING

               Communication

The Transactional Model of Communication represents
communication as a simultaneous process in which
individuals are both senders and receivers, exchanging
messages and feedback through channels within a shared

Image Long Description
This image is a labeled diagram of the Transactional Model
of Communication. It features two illustrated people facing
each other -- a male figure on the left and a female figure on
the right -- both labeled as Sender/Receiver. Between them is
a rectangular area labeled Shared Field of Experience. Within
that area:

   A double-headed arrow labeled Message runs from left
      to right.

   Another double-headed arrow labeled Feedback runs
      from right to left, just beneath the message arrow.

   Above the Shared Field of Experience is a labeled box:
      Context -- indicating the influence of environmental or
      situational factors.

   Below the sender/receiver roles and message arrows,
      there is a box labeled Noise, which represents any
      interference in communication. A curved line labeled
      Channel connects the two Sender/Receiver roles,
      running through the Noise box, illustrating the medium
      through which the message is transmitted.

The model visually emphasizes the dynamic, simultaneous
sending and receiving of messages, with feedback, context,
noise, and shared experience as critical components.

Dialogic Theory: Communication as
Shared Meaning

Building on these ideas, the dialogic theory of public
speaking argues that even public speaking should be
understood as a form of dialogue--not monologue. Scholars
like Ronald Arnett, Pat Arneson and Janie Harden Fritz have
22 | 1.2: THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING

emphasized that communication is most ethical and effective
when it involves mutual recognition and responsiveness (see
Arnett & Arneson, 1999; Fritz, 2013; Fritz, Bell McManus,
and Kearney, 2023).

   Dialogic public speaking is grounded in three principles:

   Dialogue is more natural than monologue: Even
      formal speeches involve feedback. Nods, eye contact,
      reactions, and questions shape how speakers adjust their
      tone, pacing, and message.

   Meanings live in people, not words: A word may
      seem clear to you but carry a very different meaning for
      someone else. Shared meaning must be constructed, not
      assumed.

   Context matters: Our words take on different
      meanings depending on the social, cultural, and
      historical moment. A joke, metaphor, or reference might
      resonate in one setting and fall flat in another.

A dialogic approach encourages speakers to see
communication not as a performance, but as a relationship.
It reminds us to remain open to our audience's responses and
to approach communication as a two-way ethical act--even
when the audience is not speaking aloud.

1.3: CONCLUSION:
SPEAKING BEYOND THE
PODIUM

   Tiffany Petricini

Public speaking is more than a performance skill--it's a way
of participating in the shared work of making meaning in the
world. Whether you are presenting research, rallying a
community, telling a story, or engaging in dialogue across
differences, the choices you make as a communicator shape
how others think, feel, and act. Speaking beyond the podium
means recognizing that your influence doesn't end when the
speech is over; your words ripple through conversations,
decisions, and relationships long after they are spoken.

   In this chapter, you explored why public speaking matters
today, how communication functions in both everyday and
formal contexts, and how technology--including
AI--changes the way we create and share messages. You also
began to see that effective speaking requires more than
technique. It demands awareness of context, openness to
dialogue, and the ability to adapt in a rapidly shifting media
environment.

   But skill alone is not enough. In a world where voices can
              1.3: CONCLUSION: SPEAKING BEYOND THE PODIUM | 27

be amplified, silenced, or reshaped by human and algorithmic
forces, how we speak--and the values guiding those
choices--matters as much as what we say. This brings us to
the next step in our journey: exploring the ethics of
communication. In the following chapter, we will ask: What
does it mean to speak responsibly? How can we ensure our
messages build understanding rather than division? And how
can we navigate the opportunities and challenges of AI-
mediated communication with integrity and care?

   Because beyond the podium also means beyond ourselves,
into the shared spaces where words meet the lives of others.

          Key Takeaways

          Communication is more than speaking -
            it's how we build relationships, share
            meaning, and shape the world around
            us.

          Beyond the podium means applying
            public speaking skills across everyday,
            civic, and digital contexts.

          Public messages often aim to inform,
            persuade, or inspire--and these
            purposes guide both content and
            delivery.
28 | 1.3: CONCLUSION: SPEAKING BEYOND THE PODIUM

          Competent communicators adapt
            messages to audience, context, and
            purpose while balancing clarity,
            connection, and ethics.

          AI and algorithms can assist in
            message creation and delivery but also
            influence what gets seen, heard, or
            valued.

Ethics Today

Communication may look effortless, but every choice--what
we say, how we say it, when we speak, and even when we
remain silent--rests on an invisible foundation: ethics. Ethics
is the hidden backbone of all communication. Just as a
building needs a strong foundation, every message depends on
ethical intent, responsible means, and accountable ends.

Every day, people around the world make ethical decisions
regarding public speech. Is it ever appropriate to lie to a group
of people if it's in the group's best interest? As a speaker,
should you ignore new evidence that comes to light after you
have completed writing your speech if that new evidence
contradicts your speech's core argument? As a listener, should
34 | 2.1: PRELUDE TO ETHICS MATTERS -- UNDERSTANDING THE
ETHICS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING

you refuse to listen to a speaker with whom you fundamentally

disagree? These three examples represent ethical choices

speakers and listeners face in the public speaking context. In

this chapter, we will explore what it means to be both an

ethical speaker and an ethical listener. To help you understand

the issues involved with thinking about ethics, this chapter

begins by presenting a model for ethical communication

known as the ethics pyramid. We will then show how the

National Communication Association (NCA) Credo for

Ethical Communication can be applied to public speaking.

The chapter will conclude with a general discussion of free

speech.

Learning Objectives

 1. Explain how the three levels of the ethics pyramid might
      be used in evaluating the ethical choices of a public
      speaker or listener

 2. Evaluate the implications of moderating free speech in
      digital spaces

 3. Reflect on potential biases and ethical challenges when
      using AI to generate speech content

 4. Evaluate ethical dilemmas presented by AI-generated
      speech content

 5. Evaluate the ethical implications of incorporating AI
      tools during speech preparation

Fritz et al. (2023) note that we live in a moment with
disagreement about right and wrong--about what is "good"
for humans to be and to do. This disagreement does not mean
that we cannot speak meaningfully about ethics; ethical
positions come from the moral traditions, or narratives, that
38 | 2.2: THE ETHICS PYRAMID

guide our lives. Particular religious, political, or philosophical
ways of understanding the world, or frameworks, inform our
ethical decisions, even if we are not fully aware of their
influence. In this moment, many different narratives or
frameworks are part of our public sphere, and they are often
in contention. Furthermore, it is not always easy to figure out
what to do in situations that present difficult ethical choices,
even if we think we know, in general terms, the "right" thing
to do. Whether it is a difficult choice that may result in an
ethical lapse in business or politics or a disagreement about
medical treatments and end-of-life decisions, people come into
contact with ethical dilemmas regularly. Speakers and listeners
of public speech face numerous ethical dilemmas as well. What
kinds of support material and sources are ethical to use? How
may speakers adapt to an audience and still maintain their own
views? What makes a speech ethical?

thinking about ethics (Tilley, 2005). Her ethics pyramid
involves three basic concepts: intent, means, and ends.

Wrap-Up: The pyramid is not just a diagram--it's a habit.
Every time you prepare or deliver a speech, ask yourself: What
is my intent? What are my means? What are my ends?
42 | 2.2: THE ETHICS PYRAMID

Intent

According to Tilley (2005), the first major consideration to be
aware of when examining the ethicality of an action, whether
spoken or performed, is the issue of intent. To be an ethical
speaker or listener, it is important to begin with ethical
intentions. For example, if we agree that honesty is ethical, it
follows that ethical speakers will prepare their remarks with the
intention of telling the truth to their audiences. Similarly, if we
agree that it is ethical to listen with an open mind, it follows
that ethical listeners will be intentional about letting a speaker
make his or her case before forming judgments. Even in a time
when "truth" is disputed (Neu, 2025), we still expect speakers
to do their best to tell the truth, and we, as listeners, must work
diligently to assess the truthfulness of speakers' claims.

   One option for assessing intent is to talk with others about
how ethical they think a behavior is; if you get a fairly
consistent set of answers saying the behavior is not ethical,
then perhaps it should be avoided. A second option is to check
out existing codes of ethics. Many professional organizations,
including the Independent Computer Consultants
Association, American Counseling Association, Society for
Professional Journalists, Public Relations Society of
American, and American Society of Home Inspectors, have
codes of conduct or ethical guidelines for their members.
Individual corporations such as Monsanto, Coca-Cola, Intel,
and ConocoPhillips also have ethical guidelines for how their
                                                   2.2: THE ETHICS PYRAMID | 43

employees should interact with suppliers or clients. Even when
specific ethical codes are not present, you can apply general
ethical principles, such as whether a behavior is beneficial for
the majority (utilitarianism) or whether you would approve of
the same behavior if you were listening to a speech instead of
giving it.

   In addition, it is important to be aware that people can
engage in unethical behavior unintentionally. For example,
suppose we agree that it is unethical to take someone else's
words and pass them off as your own--a behavior known as
plagiarism. What happens if a speaker makes a statement that
he believes he thought of on his own, but the statement is
actually quoted from a radio commentator whom he heard
without clearly remembering doing so? The plagiarism was
unintentional, but does that make it ethical?

Means

Tilley (2005) describes the means you use to communicate
with others as the second level of the ethics pyramid.
According to McCroskey, Wrench, and Richmond (2003),
"means" are the tools or behaviors we employ to achieve a
desired outcome. We must realize that there are a range of
possible behavioral choices for any situation and that some
choices are good, some are bad, and some fall in between.

   For example, suppose you want your friend Marty to spend
an hour reviewing a draft of your speech according to criteria,
44 | 2.2: THE ETHICS PYRAMID

such as audience appropriateness, adequate research, strong
support of assertions, and dynamic introduction and
conclusion. What means might you use to persuade Marty to
do you this favor? You might explain that you value Marty's
opinion and will gladly return the favor the next time Marty
is preparing a speech (good means), or you might threaten to
tell a professor that Marty cheated on a test (bad means). While
both of these means may lead to the same end--having Marty
agree to review your speech--one is clearly more ethical than
the other.

   The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) as a potential tool--or a means, in Tilley's (2005)
framework--for producing all or part of a speech calls for
ethical discernment on the part of public speakers inside the
classroom and beyond. Recent research on the ethical use of
GenAI in public speaking suggests that it may supplement,
supplant, assist, or coach in various parts of the speech
construction and practice context (Pekka Isotalus &
Karppinen, 2025; Pollino et al., 2025). Some issues emerging
in the college classroom point to differences in opinion about
the ethics of GenAI use (Tong et al., 2025). Should an
instructor use AI to generate a syllabus? To create grading
rubrics? To grade assignments? If public officials have
speechwriters to craft their public messages, could they use
AI instead? Keep in mind that even if you use AI for parts
of your speech, you must still check the sources it suggests.
Some programs generate false or biased information (Jungherr
                                                   2.2: THE ETHICS PYRAMID | 45

& Schroeder, 2023). There is no substitute for reviewing and
checking the reliability of sources suggested by AI. Ethical
public speaking requires verification of sources and
information--attending to informational accuracy.

   Your instructor will provide guidelines about the extent to
which you are permitted to use GenAI in the process of
constructing your speech. For instance, perhaps you are
permitted to ask GenAI for possible speech topics, but you
are to do your own research and create a speech outline and
contents on your own. Some instructors may permit greater
use of GenAI, as long as you provide the prompts you
provided and show how you edited and reworked what GenAI
supplied.

Ends

The final part of the ethics pyramid is the ends. According to
McCroskey, Wrench, and Richmond (2003), ends are those
outcomes that you desire to achieve. Examples of ends might
include persuading your audience to make a financial
contribution for your participation in Relay for Life,
persuading a group of homeowners that your real estate agency
would best meet their needs, or informing your fellow students
about newly required university fees. Whereas the means are
the behavioral choices we make, the ends are the results of
those choices.

   Like intentions and means, ends can be good or bad, or they
46 | 2.2: THE ETHICS PYRAMID

can fall into a gray area where it is unclear just how ethical or
unethical they are. For example, suppose a city council wants
to balance the city's annual budget. Balancing the budget may
be a good end, assuming that the city has adequate tax
revenues and areas of discretionary spending for nonessential
services for the year in question. However, voters might argue
that balancing the budget is a bad end if the city lacks these
things for the year in question, because in that case balancing
the budget would require raising taxes, curtailing essential city
services, or both. Here, competing goods come into play,
creating conflict (Arnett et al., 2018).

   When examining ends, we need to think about both the
source and the receiver of the message or behavior. Some end
results could be good for the source but bad for the receiver, or
vice versa. Suppose, for example, that Anita belongs to a club
that is raffling off a course of dancing lessons. Anita sells Ben
a ten-dollar raffle ticket. However, Ben later thinks it over and
realizes that he has no desire to take dancing lessons and that if
he should win the raffle, he will never take the lessons. Anita's
club has gained ten dollars--a good end--but Ben has lost
ten dollars--a bad end. Again, the ethical standards you and
your audience expect to be met will help in deciding whether a
particular combination of speaker and audience ends is ethical.

Thinking through the Pyramid

Ultimately, understanding ethics is a matter of balancing all
three parts of the ethical pyramid: intent, means, and ends.
When thinking about the ethics of a given behavior, you could
ask yourself three basic questions:

   "Have I discussed the ethicality of the behavior with
48 | 2.2: THE ETHICS PYRAMID

      others and come to a general consensus that the behavior
      is ethical?"
   "Does the behavior adhere to known codes of ethics?"
   "Would I be happy if the outcomes of the behavior were
      reversed and applied to me?" (Tilley, 2005)

While you do not need to ask yourself these three questions
before enacting every behavior as you go through a day, they do
provide a useful framework for thinking through a behavior
when you are not sure whether a given action or statement may
be unethical. Ultimately, understanding ethics is a matter of
balancing all three parts of the ethical pyramid: intent, means,
and ends.

AI remains a tool that supports responsible communication
rather than undermining it.

Free Speech, the First
Amendment, and AI
Responsibility

When considering free speech in the context of AI-generated
communication, it is important to distinguish between the
legal protections of the First Amendment and the ethical
responsibilities of speakers. The First Amendment limits
government restriction of speech but does not extend absolute
protection to all forms of expression--speech that is obscene,
defamatory, or incites violence may be restricted.

   AI complicates this landscape by introducing a layer of
authorship that is not human. If an AI tool generates harmful,
misleading, or offensive content, the question arises: who bears
responsibility--the tool's developer, the platform that hosts
the content, or the human speaker who used the tool? From an
ethical standpoint, the speaker remains accountable for what is
delivered in their name, even if the words originated from an
algorithm.

   This means that while AI can serve as a helpful partner in
drafting or shaping ideas, speakers must evaluate the content
through the lens of both legal principles and ethical
responsibility. In practice, this requires fact-checking AI
56 | 2.2: THE ETHICS PYRAMID

outputs, considering potential harm, and recognizing that the
use of AI does not absolve a speaker of accountability for the
outcomes produced.

2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC
SPEAKING

   Janie Harden Fritz

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand how to apply the National Communication
      Association (NCA) Credo for Ethical Communication
      within the context of public speaking.

 2. Understand how you can apply ethics to your public
      speaking preparation process.

The study of ethics in human communication is hardly a
recent endeavor. One of the earliest discussions of ethics in
communication (and particularly in public speaking) was
conducted by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his
dialogue Phaedrus. In the centuries since Plato's time, an
entire subfield within the discipline of human communication
has developed to explain and understand communication
ethics. The National Communication Association has a
communication ethics division that supports the study of this
important area of the field (Fritz et al., 2023), and the
International Communication Association publishes the
58 | 2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

Handbook of Communication Ethics (now in its second edition;
see Pinchevski et al., 2025).

Communication Code of Ethics

In 1999, the National Communication Association officially
adopted the Credo for Ethical Communication (see the
following sidebar). Ultimately, the NCA Credo for Ethical
Communication is a set of beliefs communication scholars
have about the ethics of human communication.

     National Communication
     Association Credo for Ethical
     Communication

       Questions of right and wrong arise whenever
       people communicate. Ethical communication is
       fundamental to responsible thinking, decision
       making, and the development of relationships
       and communities within and across contexts,
       cultures, channels, and media. Moreover, ethical
       communication enhances human worth and
       dignity by fostering truthfulness, fairness,
       responsibility, personal integrity, and respect for
                                2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING | 59

self and others. We believe that unethical
communication threatens the quality of all
communication and consequently the well-being
of individuals and the society in which we live.
Therefore we, the members of the National
Communication Association, endorse and are
committed to practicing the following principles
of ethical communication:

We advocate truthfulness, accuracy, honesty,
and reason as essential to the integrity of
communication.

We endorse freedom of expression, diversity of
perspective, and tolerance of dissent to achieve
the informed and responsible decision making
fundamental to a civil society.

We strive to understand and respect other
communicators before evaluating and
responding to their messages.

We promote access to communication resources
and opportunities as necessary to fulfill human
potential and contribute to the well-being of
families, communities, and society.

We promote communication climates of caring
60 | 2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

       and mutual understanding that respect the
       unique needs and characteristics of individual
       communicators.
       We condemn communication that degrades
       individuals and humanity through distortion,
       intimidation, coercion, and violence, and through
       the expression of intolerance and hatred.
       We are committed to the courageous expression
       of personal convictions in pursuit of fairness and
       justice.
       We advocate sharing information, opinions, and
       feelings when facing significant choices while
       also respecting privacy and confidentiality.
       We accept responsibility for the short- and long-
       term consequences of our own communication
       and expect the same of others.

Applying the NCA Credo to
Public Speaking

The NCA Credo for Ethical Communication is designed to
inspire discussions of ethics related to all aspects of human
communication. For our purposes, we want to think about
each of these principles in terms of how they affect public
speaking

We Advocate Truthfulness, Accuracy,
Honesty, and Reason as Essential to
the Integrity of Communication

As public speakers, one of the first ethical areas we should be
concerned with is informational honesty. While there are cases
where speakers have blatantly lied to an audience, it is more
common for speakers to try to prove a point by exaggerating,
omitting facts that weigh against their message, or distorting
information. We believe that speakers build a relationship with
their audiences, and that lying, exaggerating, or distorting
information violates this relationship. Ultimately, a speaker
will be more persuasive by using reason and logical arguments
supported by facts and appropriate emotional appeals rather
than relying solely on emotional appeals designed to
manipulate the audience. Certainly the type of speech matters;
speeches designed to persuade, to be ethical, should leave space
for the audience to choose a course of belief or action. Just
62 | 2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

as issues of communication ethics emerge when consequences
for human beings are at stake, the issue is one of right and
wrong, and a choice of outcomes and ways to secure that
outcome are present (Fritz, 2018; Johannesen, 2001),
providing an ethical space for audience choice shows respect
for the audience.

   It is also important to be honest about where all your
information comes from in a speech. As speakers, examine
your information sources and determine whether they are
biased or have hidden agendas. For example, you are not likely
to get accurate information about nonwhite individuals from
a neo-Nazi website. While you may not know all your sources
of information firsthand, you should attempt to find objective
sources that do not have an overt or covert agenda that skews
the argument you are making. We will discuss more about
ethical sources of information in Chapter 7 later in this book.

   The second part of information honesty is transparency. As
ethical speakers, we disclose where we obtain the information
in our speeches. Ethical speakers know how important it is to
cite their sources of information within the body of a speech.
Whether you conducted an interview or read a newspaper
article, you must tell your listeners where the information
came from. We mentioned earlier in this chapter that using
someone else's words or ideas without giving credit is called
plagiarism. The word "plagiarism" stems from the Latin
word plagiaries, or kidnapper. The American Psychological
Association states in its publication manual: hat "Plagiarism
                                         2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING | 63

is the act of presenting the words, ideas, or images of another
as your own" (American Psychological Association, 2020, p.
254).

   In the previous paragraph, we placed quotation marks
around the last sentence to indicate that the words came from
the American Psychological Association and not from us.
When speaking informally, people sometimes use "air quotes"
to signal direct quotations--but this is not a recommended
technique in public speaking. Instead, speakers need to tell
an audience verbally when they are using someone else's
information. The consequences for failing to cite sources
during public speeches can be substantial. When Senator
Joseph Biden was running for president of the United States
in 1988, reporters found that he had plagiarized portions of
his stump speech from British politician Neil Kinnock (e.g.,
Fawzy, 2016). Biden was forced to drop out of the race as a
result. The student newspaper at Malone University in Ohio
alleged that the university president, Gary W. Streit, had
plagiarized material in a public speech. Streit retired abruptly
as a result (Laster, 2010). W. Franklin Evans, president of West
Liberty University, confessed to plagiarism in several speeches
and was not renewed as president a year later (Whitford, E.,
2021). Many examples of public figures who have plagiarized
speeches can be located with a quick search on the internet, in
fact (e.g., Fawzy, 2016).

   Even if you are not running for president of the United
States or serving as a college president, citing sources is
64 | 2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

important to you as a student. Many universities have policies
that include dismissal from the institution for student
plagiarism of academic work, including public speeches.
Failing to cite your sources might result, at best, in lower
credibility with your audience and, at worst, in a failing grade
on your assignment or expulsion from your school. While we
will talk in more detail about plagiarism later in this book, we
cannot emphasize enough the importance of giving credit to
the speakers and authors whose ideas we pass on within our
own speeches and writing.

   Speakers tend to fall into one of three major traps with
plagiarism. The first trap is failing to tell the audience the
source of a direct quotation. In the previous paragraph, we
used a direct quotation from the American Psychological
Association; if we had not used the quotation marks and
clearly listed where the cited material came from, you, as a
reader, wouldn't have known the source of that information.
To avoid plagiarism, you always need to tell your audience
when you are directly quoting information within a speech.

   The second plagiarism trap public speakers fall into is
paraphrasing what someone else said or wrote without giving
credit to the speaker or author. For example, you may have
read a book and learned that there are three types of schoolyard
bullying. In the middle of your speech you talk about those
three types of schoolyard bullying. If you do not tell your
audience where you found that information, you are
plagiarizing. Typically, the only information you do not need
                                         2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING | 65

to cite is information that is general knowledge. General
knowledge is information that is publicly available and widely
known by a large segment of society. For example, you would
not need to provide a citation within a speech for the name
of Delaware's capital. Although many people do not know the
capital of Delaware without looking it up, this information is
publicly available and easily accessible, so assigning credit to
one specific source is not useful or necessary.

   The third plagiarism trap that speakers fall into is re-citing
someone else's sources within a speech. To explain this
problem, let's look at a brief segment from a research paper
written by Wrench, DiMartino, Ramirez, Oviedio, and
Tesfamariam:

     The main character on the hit Fox television show
     House, Dr. Gregory House, has one basic mantra,
     "It's a basic truth of the human condition that
     everybody lies. The only variable is about what"
     (Shore & Barclay, 2005). This notion that "everybody
     lies" is so persistent in the series that t-shirts have
     been printed with the slogan. Surprisingly, research
     has shown that most people do lie during
     interpersonal interactions to some degree. In a study
     conducted by Turner, Edgley, and Olmstead (1975),
     the researchers had
66 | 2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

     130 participants record their own conversations with
     others. After recording these conversations, the
     participants then examined the truthfulness of the
     statements within the interactions. Only 38.5% of
     the statements made during these interactions were
     labeled as "completely honest."

In this example, we see that the authors of this paragraph cited
information from two external sources: Shore and Barclay
(2005) and Tummer, Edgley, and Olmstead (1975). These two
groups of authors are given credit for their ideas. The authors
make it clear that they did not produce the television show
House or conduct the study that found that only 38.5 percent
of statements were completely honest. Instead, these authors
cited information found in two other locations. This type of
citation is appropriate.

   However, if a speaker read the paragraph and made the
following statement during a speech, it would be plagiarism:
"According to Wrench, DiMartino, Ramirez, Oviedio, and
Tesfamariam, in a study of 130 participants, only 38.5 percent
of the responses were completely honest." In this case, the
speaker is attributing the information cited to the authors of
the paragraph, which is not accurate. If you want to cite the
information within your speech, you need to read the original
                       2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING | 67

article by Turner, Edgley, and Olmstead and cite that

information yourself.

There are two main reasons we find and read the study itself

if we cite it. First, Wrench, DiMartino, Ramirez, Oviedio, and

Tesfamariam may have mistyped the information. Suppose the

study by Turner, Edgley, and Olstead (1975) really actually

found that 58.5 percent of the responses were completely

honest. If you cited the revised number (38.5 percent) from

the paragraph, you would be spreading incorrect information.

The second reason we do not re-cite someone else's sources

within our speeches is because it's intellectually dishonest. You

owe your listeners an honest description of where the facts you

are relating came from, not just the name of an author who

cited those facts. It is more work to trace the original source of

a fact or statistic, but by doing that extra work you can avoid

this plagiarism trap.

Lucas and Stob (2020) identify

three types of plagiarism. Global

plagiarism involves presenting an        AI Insight
entire speech as if it were a
speaker's own. Perhaps the          An AI tool might

responsibility.  which we will discuss later,
                 speakers may be tempted to have

                 AI write the speech. Patchwork

                 plagiarism involves taking

significant portions in word-for-word form from various

sources and piecing them together into an entire speech

without giving credit to any of those sources. This type of

speech "curation" is still plagiarism; it takes ideas of others and

passes them off as one's own--idea theft (or idea kidnapping,

from our earlier discussion of the Latin term from which the

word plagiarism is derived). Incremental plagiarism involves

failing to cite small segments of others' words or

ideas--perhaps a single quote or a paraphrased idea--making

it seem as if it were your own original work. Note that the

forms of plagiarism move from failing to acknowledge

quotations or ideas to stitching together an entire speech from

segments of other speeches to presenting an entire speech you

did not construct. All forms are problematic and constitute

violations of public speaking ethics.

scenarios where students use AI in different ways during
speech preparation. Your task is to decide whether each case
reflects ethical practice or plagiarism, applying the NCA
Credo principles of honesty, accuracy, and responsibility.

Wrap-Up: These examples highlight how ethical choices
matter when incorporating AI into public speaking. By
practicing how to spot plagiarism and misuse, you strengthen
both your credibility as a speaker and your ability to apply
ethical communication standards.

We Endorse Freedom of Expression,
Diversity of Perspective, and
Tolerance of Dissent to Achieve the
Informed and Responsible Decision
Making Fundamental to a Civil Society

This ethical principle affirms that a civil society depends on
freedom of expression, diversity of perspective, and tolerance
70 | 2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

of dissent and that informed and responsible decisions can
only be made if all members of society are free to express their
thoughts and opinions. Further, it holds that diverse
viewpoints, including those that disagree with accepted
authority, are important for the functioning of a democratic
society.

   If everyone listened to only one source of information, then
we would be easily manipulated and controlled. For this
reason, we believe that people should be willing to listen to a
range of speakers on a given subject. As listeners or consumers
of communication, we should realize that this diversity of
perspectives enables us to be more fully informed on a subject.
Imagine voting in an election after listening only to the
campaign speeches of one candidate. The perspective of that
candidate would be so narrow that you would have no way to
understand and assess the issues at hand or the strengths and
weaknesses of the opposing candidates. Unfortunately, some
voters do limit themselves to listening only to their candidate
of choice and, as a result, base their voting decisions on
incomplete--and, not infrequently, inaccurate--information.

   Listening to diverse perspectives includes being willing to
hear dissenting voices. Dissent is by nature uncomfortable, as
it entails expressing opposition to authority, often in very
unflattering terms. Legal scholar Steven H. Shiffrin (1999) has
argued in favor of some symbolic speech that many may find
problematic (e.g., flag burning) because we as a society value
the ability of anyone to express their dissent against the will
                                          2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING | 71

and ideas of the majority. Ethical communicators will be
receptive to dissent, no matter how strongly they may disagree
with the speaker's message, because they realize that a society
that forbids dissent cannot function democratically.

   Ultimately, honoring free speech and seeking out a variety
of perspectives is very important for all listeners. We will
discuss this idea further in the chapter on listening.

We Strive to Understand and Respect
Other Communicators before
Evaluating and Responding to Their
Messages

Respecting other communicators is another ethical
characteristic that is specifically directed at receivers of a
message. As listeners, we often let our perceptions of a
speakers' nonverbal behavior--their appearance, posture,
mannerisms, eye contact, and so on--determine our opinions
about a message before the speaker has said a word. We may
also find ourselves judging a speaker based on information we
have heard about that speaker from other people. Perhaps you
have heard from other students that a particular teacher is a
really boring lecturer or is really entertaining in class. Even
though you do not have personal knowledge, you may
prejudge the teacher and the teacher's message based on
information you have been given from others. The NCA
credo reminds us that to be ethical listeners, we need to avoid
72 | 2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

such judgments and instead make an effort to listen
respectfully; only when we have understood a speaker's
viewpoint are we ready to begin forming our opinions of the
message.

   Listeners should try to analyze the content and arguments
within a speech as thoughtfully as possible, doing their best to
be aware of their own biases, before deciding how to respond.
Especially when we disagree with a speaker, we might find it
difficult to listen to the content of the speech and, instead,
work on creating a rebuttal the entire time the speaker is
talking. When this happens, we do not strive to understand the
speaker and do not respect the speaker.

   Of course, this consideration does not affect just the listener
in the public speaking situation. As speakers, we are often
called upon to evaluate and refute potential arguments against
our positions. While we always want our speeches to be as
persuasive as possible, we do ourselves and our audiences a
disservice when we downplay, distort, or refuse to mention
important arguments from the opposing side. Researching
and evaluating counterarguments with care and discernment is
an important ethical obligation for the public speaker.

We Promote Access to
Communication Resources and
Opportunities as Necessary to Fulfill
Human Potential and Contribute to the
Well-Being of Families, Communities,
             2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING | 73

and Society

Human communication is a skill that can and should be
taught. We strongly believe that you can become a better, more
ethical speaker. One of the reasons the authors of this book
teach courses in public speaking and wrote this college
textbook on public speaking is that we, as communication
professionals, have an ethical obligation to provide others,
including students like you, with resources and opportunities
to become better speakers.

We Promote Communication Climates
of Caring and Mutual Understanding
That Respect the Unique Needs and
Characteristics of Individual
Communicators

Speakers need to take a two-pronged approach when
addressing any audience: caring about the audience and
understanding the audience. When you as a speaker truly care
about your audience's needs and desires, you avoid setting up
a manipulative climate. This is not to say that your audience
will always perceive their own needs and desires in the same
way you do, but if you make an honest effort to speak to your
audience in a way that has their best interests at heart, you
are more likely to create persuasive arguments that are not just
manipulative appeals.
74 | 2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

   Second, it is important for a speaker to create an atmosphere
of mutual understanding. To do this, you should first learn
as much as possible about your audience, a process called
audience analysis. We will discuss this topic in more detail in
the audience analysis chapter.

   To create a climate of caring and mutual respect, it is
important for us as speakers to be open with our audiences
so that our intentions and perceptions are clear. Nothing
alienates an audience faster than a speaker with a hidden
agenda unrelated to the stated purpose of the speech. One of
our coauthors once listened to a speaker give a two-hour talk,
allegedly about workplace wellness, which actually turned out
to be an infomercial for the speaker's weight-loss program. In
this case, the speaker clearly had a hidden (or not-so-hidden)
agenda, which made the audience feel disrespected.

We Condemn Communication That
Degrades Individuals and Humanity
through Distortion, Intimidation,
Coercion, and Violence and through
the Expression of Intolerance and
Hatred

This ethical principle is very important for all speakers.
Hopefully, intimidation, coercion, and violence will not be
part of your public speaking experiences, but some public
speakers have been known to call for violence and incite mobs
                                         2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING | 75

of people to commit atrocities. Therefore, distortion and
expressions of intolerance and hatred are of special concern
when it comes to public speaking.

   Distortion occurs when someone purposefully twists
information in a way that detracts from its original meaning.
Unfortunately, some speakers take information and use it in
a manner that is not in the spirit of the original information.
One place we see distortion frequently is in the political
context, where politicians cite a statistic or the results of a
study and either completely alter the information or use it in a
deceptive manner. FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg
Public Policy Center, and the St. Petersburg Times's
Politifact are nonpartisan organizations devoted to analyzing
political messages and demonstrating how information has
been distorted.

   Expressions of intolerance and hatred that are to be avoided
include using ageist, heterosexist, racist, sexist, and any
other form of speech that demeans or belittles a group of
people. Hate speech from all sides of the political spectrum in
our society is detrimental to ethical communication. As such,
we as speakers should be acutely aware of how an audience may
perceive words that could be considered bigoted. For example,
suppose a school board official involved in budget negotiations
for school programs used the word "brain damaged" to refer
to students with traumatic brain injuries (American
Psychological Association, 2020). The remark would be likely
to prompt accusations of insensitivity and/or bias against a
76 | 2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

particular group of students and to shift listeners' focus of
attention away from any constructive suggestions the official
might have for policy issues. Although the official might insist
that he meant no offense, he damaged the ethical climate of the
budget debate by using a word associated with bigotry.

   At the same time, it is important for listeners to pay
attention to expressions of intolerance or hatred. Extremist
speakers sometimes attempt to disguise their true agendas by
avoiding bigoted "buzzwords" and using mild-sounding terms
instead. For example, a speaker advocating the overthrow of
a government might use the term "regime change" instead of
"revolution"; similarly, proponents of genocide in various
parts of the world have used the term "ethnic cleansing"
instead of "extermination." By listening critically to the gist of
a speaker's message as well as the specific language he or she
uses, we can see how that speaker views the world.

We Are Committed to the Courageous
Expression of Personal Convictions in
Pursuit of Fairness and Justice

We believe that finding and bringing to light situations of
inequality and injustice within our society is important. Public
speaking has been used throughout history to point out
inequality and injustice, from Patrick Henry's arguments
against the way the English government treated the American
colonists and Sojourner Truth's description of the evils of
                                         2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING | 77

slavery to Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech
and Army Lt. Dan Choi's speeches arguing that the military's
"don't ask, don't tell policy" is unjust. Many social justice
movements have started because young public speakers have
decided to stand up for what they believe is fair and just.

We Advocate Sharing Information,
Opinions, and Feelings When Facing
Significant Choices While Also
Respecting Privacy and Confidentiality

This ethical principle involves balancing personal disclosure
with discretion. It is perfectly normal for speakers to want to
share their own personal opinions and feelings about a topic;
however, it is also important to highlight information within
a speech that represents your own thoughts and feelings. Your
listeners have a right to know the difference between facts and
personal opinions.

   Similarly, we have an obligation to respect others' privacy
and confidentiality when speaking. If information is obtained
from printed or publicly distributed material, it's perfectly
appropriate to use that information without getting
permission, as long as you cite it. However, when you have a
great anecdote one of your friends told you in confidence, or
access to information that is not available to the general public,
it is best to seek permission before using the information in a
speech.
78 | 2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

   This ethical obligation even has legal implications in many
government and corporate contexts. For example, persons who
work for the Central Intelligence Agency are legally precluded
from discussing their work in public without prior review by
the agency. And companies such as Google also have policies
requiring employees to seek permission before engaging in
public speaking in which sensitive information might be
leaked.

We Accept Responsibility for the
Short- and Long-Term Consequences
of Our Own Communication and
Expect the Same of Others

The last statement of NCA's ethical credo may be the most
important one. We live in a society where a speaker's message
can literally be heard around the world in a matter of minutes,
thanks to our global communication networks. Extreme
remarks made by politicians, media commentators, and
celebrities, as well as ordinary people, can unexpectedly "go
viral" with regrettable consequences. It is not unusual to see
situations where a speaker talks hatefully about a specific
group, but when one of the speaker's listeners violently attacks
a member of the group, the speaker insists that he or she had
no way of knowing that this could possibly have happened.
Washing one's hands of responsibility is unacceptable: all
speakers should accept responsibility for the short-term and
                                         2.3: ETHICS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING | 79

long-term consequences of their speeches. Although it is
certainly not always the speaker's fault if someone commits an
act of violence, the speaker should take responsibility for her
or his role in the situation. This process involves being truly
reflective and willing to examine how one's speech could have
tragic consequences.

   Furthermore, attempting to persuade a group of people to
take any action means you should make sure that you
understand the consequences of that action. Whether you are
persuading people to vote for a political candidate or just
encouraging them to lose weight, you should know what the
short-term and long-term consequences of that decision could
be. While our predictions of short-term and long-term
consequences may not always be right, we have an ethical duty
at least to think through the possible consequences and
implications of our speeches and the actions we encourage.

Learning Objectives

 1. Define the concept of free speech and discuss its origins
 2. Discuss the First Amendment to the US Constitution in

      terms of free speech
 3. Analyze how the principles of free speech under the First

      Amendment apply to AI-generated content and assess
      the speaker's responsibility for outcomes produced by
      AI
 4. Describe how free speech relates to other freedoms
      guaranteed by the First Amendment to the US
      Constitution

What Is Free Speech?

Free speech has been a constitutional right since the founding
of our nation, and according to Merriam Webster's Dictionary
of Law, free speech entails "the right to express information,
ideas, and opinions free of government restrictions based on
content and subject only to reasonable limitations (as the
                                                              2.4: FREE SPEECH | 87

power of the government to avoid a clear and present danger)
esp. as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments
to the U.S. Constitution" (Freedom of speech). Free speech
is especially important to us as public speakers because
expressing information and ideas is the purpose of public
speaking. It is also important to audiences of public speeches
because free speech allows us to hear and consider multiple
points of view so that we can make more informed decisions
(Arneson & Dewberry, 2006).

The First Amendment to the
Constitution

Free speech was so important to the founders of the United
States that it is included in the first of the ten amendments to
the US Constitution that are known as the Bill of Rights. This
is not surprising, considering that many American colonists
had crossed the Atlantic to escape religious persecution and
that England had imposed many restrictions on personal
freedoms during the colonial era. The text of the First
Amendment reads, "Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or
the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition
the Government for a redress of grievances" (National
Archives and Records Administration, 2011).

   The freedoms protected by the First Amendment may seem
88 | 2.4: FREE SPEECH

perfectly natural today, but they were controversial in 1791
when the Bill of Rights was enacted. Proponents argued that
individuals needed protection from overreaching powers of
government, while opponents believed these protections were
unnecessary and that amending them to the Constitution
could weaken the union.

Relationship of Free Speech to
Other Freedoms Guaranteed by
the First Amendment

Freedom of speech, of the press, of religion, of association,
of assembly and petition are all guaranteed in amendments
to the US Constitution. Free speech allows us to exercise our
other First Amendment rights. Freedom of assembly means
that people can gather to discuss and protest issues of
importance to them. If free speech were not protected, citizens
would not be able to exercise their right to protest about
activities such as war or policies such as health care reform.

   Free speech does not mean, however, that every US citizen
has the legal right to say anything at any time. If your speech is
likely to lead to violence or other illegal acts, it is not protected.
One recent example is a 2007 Supreme Court decision in the
Morse et al. v. Frederick case. In this case, a high school student
held up a sign reading "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" across from the
school during the 2002 Olympic Torch Relay. The principal
                                                              2.4: FREE SPEECH | 89

suspended the teenager, and the teen sued the principal for
violating his First Amendment rights. Ultimately, the court
decided that the principal had the right to suspend the student
because he was advocating illegal behavior (Supreme Court of
the United States, 2007).

   The meaning of "free speech" is constantly being debated
by politicians, judges, and the public, even within the United
States, where this right has been discussed for over two
hundred years. As US citizens, it is important to be aware of
both the protections afforded by free speech and its limits so
that we can be both articulate speakers and critical listeners
when issues such as antiwar protests at military funerals or
speech advocating violence against members of specific groups
come up within our communities.

how information is generated, the speaker is responsible for the

2.5: CONCLUSION:
ETHICS BEYOND THE
PODIUM

   Janie Harden Fritz

Ethical public speaking is not simply a classroom requirement;
it is a civic practice that shapes who you are as a communicator
and as a member of society. The principles outlined in this
chapter, like truthfulness, respect, responsibility, and
accountability are not just abstract ideals. They are guides for
navigating everyday choices, from how you cite sources in a
presentation to how you speak out in moments of conflict
or uncertainty. Beyond the podium, these decisions build
credibility, strengthen relationships, and contribute to the
trust that communities and organizations depend on.

   As we move forward, remember that ethical speaking is not
about perfection it. It is about awareness and intention. Each
decision you make about language, evidence, or delivery carries
weight, both in the immediate context and in the broader
world. Practicing ethics in small, everyday ways prepares you
to respond with integrity when larger challenges arise.

   In the next chapter, we shift from what is right to how to
speak with strength. Confidence is the bridge between ethical
                  2.5: CONCLUSION: ETHICS BEYOND THE PODIUM | 93

intention and effective delivery. By combining ethical
responsibility with confident expression, you will not only
speak responsibly but also speak in ways that inspire others to
listen and act.

          Key Takeaways

          Ethics is the hidden foundation of all
            communication--every choice in public
            speaking rests on intent, means, and
            ends.

          The Ethics Pyramid helps speakers
            evaluate decisions step by step: ask if
            your purpose, methods, and outcomes
            are ethical.

          The NCA Credo for Ethical
            Communication provides guiding
            principles like truthfulness, respect,
            responsibility, and freedom of
            expression.

          Plagiarism and misinformation
            damage speaker credibility and erode
            public trust; citing sources and
            practicing transparency are essential.

          Free speech is a right paired with
94 | 2.5: CONCLUSION: ETHICS BEYOND THE PODIUM

            responsibility--ethical speakers
            balance expression with accountability
            for consequences.
          AI tools do not remove
            responsibility; speakers must verify,
            edit, and ensure fairness when using
            technology in communication.
          Beyond the classroom, ethical
            communication strengthens
            communities, workplaces, and
            democracy by promoting honesty,
            clarity, and respect.

      anxiety

"Speech is a mirror of the soul," commented Publilius Syrus,
a popular writer in 42 BCE (Bartlett, 1919). Other people
come to know who we are through our words. Many different
social situations, ranging from job interviews to dating to
public speaking, can make us feel uncomfortable as we
anticipate that we will be evaluated and judged by others.
How well we communicate is intimately connected to our
self-image, and the process of revealing ourselves to the
evaluation of others can be threatening whether we are
meeting new acquaintances, participating in group
discussions, or speaking in front of an audience.

Definition of Communication
Apprehension

According to James McCroskey, communication
apprehension is the broad term that refers to an individual's
"fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated
communication with another person or persons"
(McCroskey, 2001). At its heart, communication
apprehension is a psychological response to evaluation. This
psychological response, however, quickly becomes physical
as our body responds to the threat the mind perceives. Our
bodies cannot distinguish between psychological and physical
threats, so we react as though we were facing a Mack truck
barreling in our direction. The body's circulatory and adrenal
systems shift into overdrive, preparing us to function at
maximum physical efficiency--the "flight or fight" or freeze
response (Sapolsky, 2004). Yet instead of running away or
fighting, all we need to do is stand and talk, but that doesn't
help with freezing up in front of your audience. In fact, if
we cannot fight or flee we often freeze up because we are
overwhelmed by stimuli and unable to process information
or keep a clear mind. This often happens when it comes to
communication apprehension because our physical responses
are often not well adapted to the nature of the threat we face.
This is why we tend to "freeze up" in front of an audience,
as the excess energy created by our body can make it harder
for us to be effective public speakers. But because
106 | 3.2 WHAT IS COMMUNICATION

communication apprehension is rooted in our minds, if we
understand more about the nature of the body's responses to
stress, we can better develop mechanisms for managing the
body's misguided attempts to help us cope with our fear of
social judgment.

Physiological Symptoms of
Communication Apprehension

There are a number of physical sensations associated with
communication apprehension. We might notice our heart
pounding or our hands feeling clammy. We may break out
in a sweat. We may have "stomach butterflies" or even feel
nauseated. Our hands and legs might start to shake, or we
may begin to pace nervously. Our voices may quiver, and we
may have a "dry mouth" sensation that makes it difficult to
articulate even simple words. Breathing becomes more rapid
and, in extreme cases, we might feel dizzy or light-headed.
Anxiety about communicating is profoundly disconcerting
because we feel powerless to control our bodies. Furthermore,
we may become so anxious that we fear we will forget our
name, much less remember the main points of the speech we
are about to deliver.

   The physiological changes produced in the body at critical
moments are designed to contribute to the efficient use of
muscles and expand available energy. Circulation and
breathing become more rapid so that additional oxygen can
                                          3.2 WHAT IS COMMUNICATION | 107

reach the muscles. Increased circulation causes us to sweat.
Adrenaline rushes through our body, instructing the body to
speed up its movements. If we stay immobile behind a lectern,
this hormonal urge to speed up may produce shaking and
trembling. Additionally, digestive processes are inhibited so
we will not lapse into the relaxed, sleepy state that is typical
after eating. Instead of feeling sleepy, we feel butterflies in
the pit of our stomach. By understanding what is happening
to our bodies in response to the stress of public speaking,
we can better cope with these reactions and channel them in
constructive directions.

Myths about Communication
Apprehension

Before we can discuss tips on how to overcome
communication apprehension, we must dispel some very
common myths. A wealth of conventional wisdom surrounds
the discomfort of speaking anxiety, as it surrounds almost
any phenomenon that makes us uncomfortable. Most of this
"folk" knowledge misleads us, directing our attention away
from effective strategies for thinking about and coping with
anxiety reactions.

   MYTH: People who suffer from speaking anxiety
      are neurotic. As we have explained, speaking anxiety is a
      normal reaction. Good speakers can get nervous just as
      poor speakers do. Winston Churchill, for example,
      would get physically ill before major speeches in
      Parliament. Yet he rallied the British people in a time of
      crisis. Many people, even the most professional
      performers, experience anxiety about communicating.
      Such a widespread problem, Dr. Joyce Brothers
      contends, "cannot be attributed to deep-seated
      neuroses" (Brothers, 2008).

   MYTH: Telling a joke or two is always a good way
      to begin a speech. Humor is some of the toughest
      material to deliver effectively because it requires an
      exquisite sense of timing. Nothing is worse than waiting
112 | 3.2 WHAT IS COMMUNICATION

      for a laugh that does not come. Moreover, one person's
      joke is another person's slander. It is extremely easy to
      offend when using humor. The same material can play
      very differently with different audiences. For these
      reasons, it is not a good idea to start with a joke,
      particularly if it is not well related to your topic. Humor
      is just too unpredictable and difficult for many novice
      speakers. If you insist on using humor, make sure the
      "joke" is on you, not on someone else. Another tip is
      never to pause and wait for a laugh that may not come. If
      the audience catches the joke, fine. If not, you're not left
      standing in awkward silence waiting for a reaction.
   MYTH: Imagine the audience is naked. This tip just
      plain doesn't work because imagining the audience
      naked will do nothing to calm your nerves. As Malcolm
      Kushner noted, "There are some folks in the audience I
      wouldn't want to see naked--especially if I'm trying not
      to be frightened" (Kushner, 1999). The audience is not
      some abstract image in your mind. It consists of real
      individuals who you can connect with through your
      material. To "imagine" the audience is to misdirect your
      focus from the real people in front of you to an
      "imagined" group. What we imagine is usually more
      threatening than the reality that we face.
   MYTH: Any mistake means that you have "blown
      it." We all make mistakes. What matters is not whether
      we make a mistake but how well we recover. One of the
                                       3.2 WHAT IS COMMUNICATION | 113

   authors of this book was giving a speech and wanted to
   thank a former student in the audience. Instead of saying
   "former student," she said, "former friend." After the
   audience stopped laughing, the speaker remarked, "Well,
   I guess she'll be a former friend now!"--which got more
   laughter from the audience. A speech does not have to
   be perfect. You just have to make an effort to relate to the
   audience naturally and be willing to accept your
   mistakes.
 MYTH: Avoid speaking anxiety by writing your
   speech out word for word and memorizing it.
   Memorizing your speech word for word will likely make
   your apprehension worse rather than better. Instead of
   remembering three to five main points and subpoints,
   you will try to commit to memory more than a thousand
   bits of data. If you forget a point, the only way to get
   back on track is to start from the beginning. You are
   inviting your mind to go blank by overloading it with
   details. In addition, audiences do not like to listen to
   "canned," or memorized, material. Your delivery is likely
   to suffer if you memorize. Audiences appreciate speakers
   who talk naturally to them rather than recite a written
   script.
 MYTH: Audiences are out to get you. With only a
   few exceptions, which we will talk about in Section 3.2
   "All Anxiety Is Not the Same: Sources of
   Communication Apprehension", the natural state of
114 | 3.2 WHAT IS COMMUNICATION

      audiences is empathy, not antipathy. Most face-to-face
      audiences are interested in your material, not in your
      image. Watching someone who is anxious tends to make
      audience members anxious themselves. Particularly in
      public speaking classes, audiences want to see you
      succeed. They know that they will soon be in your shoes
      and they identify with you, most likely hoping you'll
      succeed and give them ideas for how to make their own
      speeches better. If you establish direct eye contact with
      real individuals in your audience, you will see them
      respond to what you are saying, and this response lets
      you know that you are succeeding.
   MYTH: You will look to the audience as nervous as
      you feel. Empirical research has shown that audiences
      do not perceive the level of nervousness that speakers
      report feeling (Clevenger, 1959). Most listeners judge
      speakers as less anxious than the speakers rate
      themselves. In other words, the audience is not likely to
      perceive accurately the level of anxiety you might be
      experiencing. Some of the most effective speakers will
      return to their seats after their speech and exclaim they
      were so nervous. Listeners will respond, "You didn't
      look nervous." Audiences do not necessarily perceive our
      fears. Consequently, don't apologize for your nerves.
      There is a good chance the audience will not notice if
      you do not point it out to them.
   MYTH? A little nervousness helps you give a better
                                     3.2 WHAT IS COMMUNICATION | 115

 speech. This "myth" is true! Nervousness is NORMAL,
 as professional speakers, actors, and other performers
 consistently rely on the heightened arousal of
 nervousness to channel extra energy into their
 performance. People would much rather listen to a
 speaker who is alert and enthusiastic than one who is
 relaxed to the point of boredom. Many professional
 speakers say that the day they stop feeling nervous is the
 day they should stop speaking in public. The goal is to
 control those nerves and channel them into your
 presentation. In fact, nervousness is not a sign of being
 unprepared or that you won't succeed, but is a sign that
 you CARE about the presentation. So being nervous
 isn't bad or inappropriate - it means you care.

Learning Objectives

 1. Distinguish among the four different types of
      communication apprehension.

 2. Identify various factors that cause communication
      apprehension

We have said that experiencing some form of anxiety is a
normal part of the communication process. Most people are
anxious about being evaluated by an audience. Interestingly,
many people assume that their nervousness is an experience
unique to them. They assume that other people do not feel
anxious when confronting the threat of public speaking
(McCroskey, 2001). Although anxiety is a widely shared
response to the stress of public speaking, not all anxiety is
the same. Many researchers have investigated the differences
118 | 3.3 ALL ANXIETY IS NOT THE SAME-SOURCES OF
COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

between apprehension grounded in personality
characteristics and anxiety prompted by a particular situation
at a particular time (Witt, et. al., 2006). McCroskey argues
there are four types of communication apprehension: anxiety
related to trait, context, audience, and situation (McCroskey,
2001). If you understand these different types of
apprehension, you can gain insight into the varied
communication factors that contribute to speaking anxiety.

Trait Anxiety

                 Some people are just more

                 disposed to communication

     Beyond the  apprehension than others. As
                 Witt, Brown, Roberts, Weisel,
Podium Insight   Sawyer, and Behnke explain,
                 "Trait anxiety measures how
If you know      people generally feel across
you're           situations and time periods"
dispositionally  (Witt, et. al., 2006). This means

                 anxiety. While trait anxiety is not

                 the same as shyness, those with

high trait anxiety are more likely to avoid exposure to public

speaking situations, so their nervousness might be

compounded by lack of experience or skill (Witt, et. al.,
                         3.3 ALL ANXIETY IS NOT THE SAME-SOURCES OF
                                     COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 121

2006). People who experience trait anxiety may never like
public speaking, but through preparation and practice, they
can learn to give effective public speeches when they need to
do so.

Context Anxiety

Context anxiety refers to anxiety prompted by specific
communication contexts. Some of the major context factors
that can heighten this form of anxiety are formality,
uncertainty, and novelty. Also called "state anxiety," speakers
who suffer from context anxiety have a particular set of
circumstances which trigger their communication
apprehension - it could be the particular audience, context,
or topic that triggers their communication apprehension. For
example, a professor who is very comfortable speaking in
front of the classroom could get communication
apprehension when presenting in front of her peers. In this
case, the context of the audience triggers her communication
apprehension. We will talk more about this "context"
specifically below with audience anxiety.

   The feelings of context anxiety might be similar to those
you experience on the first day of class with a new instructor:
you don't know what to expect, so you are more nervous
than you might be later in the semester when you know the
instructor and the class routine better. Luckily, we will
122 | 3.3 ALL ANXIETY IS NOT THE SAME-SOURCES OF
COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

discuss AI tools to help reduce uncertainty and, in turn,
reduce your public speaking anxiety, later in this chapter

Formality

Some individuals can be perfectly composed when talking at
a meeting or in a small group; yet when faced with a more
formal public speaking setting, they become intimidated and
nervous. As the formality of the communication context
increases, the stakes are raised, sometimes prompting more
apprehension. Certain communication contexts, such as a
press conference or a courtroom can make even the most
confident individuals nervous. One reason is that these
communication contexts presuppose an adversarial
relationship between the speaker and some audience
members.

Novelty

Additionally, most of us are not experienced in high-tension
communication settings. The novelty of the communication
context we encounter is another factor contributing to
apprehension. Anxiety becomes more of an issue in
communication environments that are new to us, even for
those who are normally comfortable with speaking in public.

   Most people can learn through practice to cope with their
                         3.3 ALL ANXIETY IS NOT THE SAME-SOURCES OF
                                    COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 123

anxiety prompted by formal, uncertain, and novel
communication contexts. Fortunately, most public speaking
classroom contexts are not adversarial. The opportunities you
have to practice giving speeches reduces the novelty and
uncertainty of the public speaking context, enabling most
students to learn how to cope with anxiety prompted by the
communication context.

Audience Anxiety

For some individuals, it is not the communication context
that prompts anxiety; it is the people in the audience they
face. Audience anxiety describes communication
apprehension prompted by specific audience characteristics.
These characteristics include similarity, subordinate status,
audience size, and familiarity.

   You might have no difficulty talking to an audience of your
peers in student government meetings, but an audience
composed of parents and students on a campus visit might
make you nervous because of the presence of parents in the
audience. The degree of perceived similarity between you and
your audience can influence your level of speech anxiety. We
all prefer to talk to an audience that we believe shares our
values more than to one that does not. The more dissimilar
we are compared to our audience members, the more likely
we are to be nervous. Studies have shown that subordinate
status can also contribute to speaking anxiety (Witt, et. al.,
124 | 3.3 ALL ANXIETY IS NOT THE SAME-SOURCES OF
COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

2006). Talking in front of your boss or teacher may be
intimidating, especially if you are being evaluated. The size
of the audience can also play a role: the larger the audience,
the more threatening it may seem. Finally, familiarity can be
a factor. Some of us prefer talking to strangers rather than
to people we know well. Others feel more nervous in front
of an audience of friends and family yet have no problem
presenting in front of people they do not know.

Situational Anxiety

Situational anxiety, McCroskey explains, is the
communication apprehension created by "the unique
combination of influences generated by audience, time and
context" (McCroskey, 2001). Each communication event
involves several dimensions: physical, temporal, social-
psychological, and cultural. These dimensions combine to
create a unique communication situation that is different
from any previous communication event. The situation
created by a given audience, in a given time, and in a given
context can coalesce into situational anxiety.

   For example, I once had to give a presentation at a general
faculty meeting on general education assessment. To my
surprise, I found myself particularly nervous about this
speech. The audience was familiar to me but was relatively
large compared to most classroom settings. I knew the
audience well enough to know that my topic was
                         3.3 ALL ANXIETY IS NOT THE SAME-SOURCES OF
                                    COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 125

controversial for some faculty members who resented the
mandate for assessment coming from top administration.
The meeting occurred late on a Friday afternoon, and my
presentation was scheduled more than an hour into the two-
hour meeting. All these factors combined to produce
situational anxiety for me. While I successfully applied the
principles that we will discuss in Section 3.3 for managing
stage fright, this speaking situation stands out in my mind
as one of the most nerve-wracking speaking challenges I have
ever faced.

Learning Objectives

 1. Explain steps for managing anxiety in the speech
      preparation process

 2. Identify effective techniques for coping with anxiety
      during delivery.

 3. Explore how technology tools can help mitigate public
      speaking anxiety

 4. Recognize the general option available for stress
      reduction and anxiety management

Experiencing some nervousness about public speaking is
normal. The energy created by this physiological response can
be functional if you harness it as a resource for more effective
public speaking. In this section, we suggest a number of steps
that you can take to channel your stage fright into excitement
and animation. We will begin with specific speech-related
128 | 3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

considerations and then briefly examine some of the more
general anxiety management options available.

Speech-Related Considerations

Communication apprehension does not necessarily remain
constant throughout all the stages of speech preparation and
delivery. One group of researchers studied the ebb and flow
of anxiety levels at four stages in the delivery of a speech.
They compared indicators of physiological stress at different
milestones in the process:

   anticipation (the minute prior to starting the speech),
   confrontation (the first minute of the speech),
   adaptation (the last minute of the speech), and
   release (the minute immediately following the end of the

      speech) (Witt, et. al., 2006).

These researchers found that anxiety typically peaked at the
anticipatory stage. In other words, we are likely to be most
anxious right before we get up to speak. As we progress
through our speech, our level of anxiety is likely to decline.
Planning your speech to incorporate techniques for
managing your nervousness at different times will help you
decrease the overall level of stress you experience. We also
offer a number of suggestions for managing your reactions
while you are delivering your speech. Then we will give you
               3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 129

a number of AI technology tools that you can use to practice
our strategies in front of virtual audiences that mirror your
real-life speaking situation.

three phases of public speaking:

   Anticipation: Anxiety begins low but starts to increase.
   Confrontation: Anxiety peaks during the moment of
speaking.
   Adaptation: Anxiety decreases as the speaker continues.
   The graph features a bell-shaped curve representing anxiety
levels on the vertical axis (labeled "Anxiety Level") and the
three stages--Anticipation, Confrontation, and
Adaptation--on the horizontal axis.
   The line begins low, curves upward steeply during
anticipation, peaks at confrontation, and gradually curves
downward through adaptation.

Think Positively

As we mentioned earlier, communication apprehension
begins in the mind as a psychological response. This
underscores the importance of a speaker's psychological
attitude toward speaking. To prepare yourself mentally for
a successful speaking experience, we recommend using a
                3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 131

technique called cognitive restructuring. Cognitive
restructuring is simply changing how you label the
physiological responses you will experience. Rather than
thinking of public speaking as a dreaded obligation, make a
conscious decision to consider it an exciting opportunity. The
first audience member that you have to convince is yourself,
by deliberately replacing negative thoughts with positive
ones. If you say something to yourself often enough, you will
gradually come to believe it.

   We also suggest practicing what communication scholars
Metcalfe, Beebe, and Beebe call positive self-talk rather than
negative self-talk (Metcalfe, 1994; Beebe, 2000). If you find
yourself thinking, "I'm going to forget everything when I get
to the front of the room," turn that negative message around
to a positive one. Tell yourself, "I have notes to remind me
what comes next, and the audience won't know if I don't
cover everything in the order I planned." The idea is to
dispute your negative thoughts and replace them with
positive ones, even if you think you are "conning" yourself.
By monitoring how you talk about yourself, you can unlearn
old patterns and change the ways you think about things that
produce anxiety.

asking for a show of hands, or

relevant to your listeners' experience. When you see the

audience responding to you by nodding, smiling, or

answering questions, you will have directed the focus of

attention from yourself to the audience. Such responses

indicate success; they are positively reinforcing, and thus

reduce your nervousness.
134 | 3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

Clearly Organize Your Ideas

Being prepared as a speaker means knowing the main points
of your message so well that you can remember them even
when you are feeling highly anxious, and the best way to learn
those points is to create an outline for your speech. With a
clear outline to follow, you will find it much easier to move
from one point to the next without stumbling or getting lost.

   A note of caution is in order: you do not want to react
to the stress of speaking by writing and memorizing a
manuscript. Your audience will usually be able to tell that you
wrote your speech out verbatim, and they will tune out very
quickly. You are setting yourself up for disaster if you try to
memorize a written text because the pressure of having to
remember all those particulars will be tremendous. Moreover,
if you have a momentary memory lapse during a memorized
speech, you may have a lot of trouble continuing without
starting over at the beginning.

   What you do want to prepare is a simple outline that
reminds you of the progression of ideas in your speech. What
is important is the order of your points, not the specifics of
each sentence. It is perfectly fine if your speech varies in terms
of specific language or examples each time you practice it.

   It may be a good idea to reinforce this organization
through visual aids. When it comes to managing anxiety,
visual aids have the added benefit of taking attention off the
speaker.
               3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 135

Adapt Your Language to the Oral
Mode

Another reason not to write out your speech as a manuscript
is that to speak effectively you want your language to be
adapted to the oral, not the written, mode. You will find
your speaking anxiety more manageable if you speak in the
oral mode because it will help you to feel like you are having
a conversation with friends rather than delivering a formal
proclamation.

   Appropriate oral style is more concrete and vivid than
written style. Effective speaking relies on verbs rather than
nouns, and the language is less complex. Long sentences may
work well for novelists such as William Faulkner or James
Joyce, where readers can go back and reread passages two,
three, or even seven or eight times. Your listeners, though,
cannot "rewind" you in order to catch ideas they miss the first
time through.

   Don't be afraid to use personal pronouns freely, frequently
saying "I" and "me"--or better yet, "us" and "we." Personal
pronouns are much more effective in speaking than language
constructions, such as the following "this author," because
they help you to build a connection with your audience.
Another oral technique is to build audience questions into
your speech. Rhetorical questions, questions that do not
require a verbal answer, invite the audience to participate with
your material by thinking about the implications of the
136 | 3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

question and how it might be answered. If you are graphic
and concrete in your language selection, your audience is
more likely to listen attentively. You will be able to see the
audience listening, and this feedback will help to reduce your
anxiety.

Practice in Conditions Similar to
Those You Will Face When
Speaking

It is not enough to practice your speech silently in your head.
To reduce anxiety and increase the likelihood of a successful
performance, you need to practice out loud in a situation
similar to the one you will face when actually performing
your speech. Practice delivering your speech out loud while
standing on your feet. If you make a mistake, do not stop
to correct it but continue all the way through your speech;
that is what you will have to do when you are in front of the
audience.

   If possible, practice in the actual room where you will be
giving your speech. Not only will you have a better sense of
what it will feel like to actually speak, but you may also have
the chance to practice using presentation aids and potentially
avoid distractions and glitches like incompatible computers,
blown projector bulbs, or sunlight glaring in your eyes.

   Two very useful tools for anxiety-reducing practice are a
               3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 137

clock and a mirror. Use the clock to time your speech, being
aware that most novice speakers speak too fast, not too slowly.
By ensuring that you are within the time guidelines, you will
eliminate the embarrassment of having to cut your remarks
short because you've run out of time or of not having enough
to say to fulfill the assignment. Use the mirror to gauge how
well you are maintaining eye contact with your audience; it
will allow you to check that you are looking up from your
notes. It will also help you build the habit of using
appropriate facial expressions to convey the emotions in your
speech. While you might feel a little absurd practicing your
speech out loud in front of a mirror, the practice that you do
before your speech can make you much less anxious when it
comes time to face the audience.

Using AI to Mirror Your Speaking
Conditions

Can AI help you with your public speaking anxiety?
Undoubtedly, yes! You can use AI to practice in conditions
similar to those you will face when speaking so that you are
prepared for the audience and situation before speech day. For
                3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 141

example, a Reddit user commented on how he had horrible
social anxiety - he even walked off the stage in the middle of
giving a speech at a wedding! After researching beta blockers
he found a much more natural solution: AI.

   So I spent the week using this AI tool that basically lets
you have a live conversation with someone in a customized
scenario, so I customized my scenario to a public speech
where the audience gives feedback, and after each attempt it
would give me customized feedback to improve on. A big
part of it for me was just being able to rehearse in a realistic,
lifelike scenario really helped my confidence. So yesterday I
just delivered the best public speech of my life, all thanks to
this AI tool. Just wanted to share my success!

   This is one success story of many that illustrates how can
AI help you with your own communication apprehension.
This is because when you are practicing your speech at home,
you are missing one important component. You are not
addressing what is causing your communication
apprehension in the first place, which is the apprehension of
speaking in front of an audience. There is a big difference
between presenting to yourself in front of a mirror and
practicing in front of people. AI can help fix that.

   Overcoming public speaking anxiety requires both time
and practice, but there are several other strategies you can
incorporate into your routine to get over this common fear.
This is because AI gives you something you will not get from
a human audience: judgment-free feedback. Most if not all
142 | 3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

college students cannot afford a professional speaker coach,
but luckily AI gives you the next best thing (usually at a low
price, or even free!) (Puri, 2023).

   Today's AI programs can generate human-like content and
then respond to specific situations (like giving a speech in
a classroom). Simply put, using AI can help you become a
better communicator, in the classroom and in life, through
private, judgment-free speech coaching in real time. Not only
does AI give you a virtual reality practice environment and
audience-specific content, but also a personal analysis of your
speech patterns and then suggestions for improvement (Puri,
2023)

   Yes, AI can be your own personal practice coach, giving
you tools to overcome your public speaking fears while
analyzing your speech patterns and then offering personalized
feedback in real time. All while giving you a safe place to
combat your public speaking anxiety. Here are some more
benefits of using AI to help with your public speaking
anxiety:

   Audience engagement: If you have dealt with
      communication apprehension and public speaking
      anxiety, you know that standing in front of an audience
      can feel overwhelming and uncontrollable. This is why
      the main benefit of using AI to combat public speaking
      anxiety is that you can use its tools to present in front of
      a virtual audience. This allows you to immerse yourself
           3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 143

   into a "real life" speaking situation and then use AI's
   analysis and feedback to tryout different speaking styles,
   language, and vocals. This can boost your confidence
   considerably before you are graded in front of a live
   audience since you are essentially experiencing the
   sensation of presenting to your audience.
 A no-pressure, judgment free zone: Practice is essential
   to becoming a better public speaker and reducing
   communication apprehension. Yet, even practicing in
   front of your parents, siblings, roommates, or pets could
   bring on cold sweat inducing anxiety. Luckily, AI gives
   you the time needed to practice your speech and
   different calming strategies without the pressure of
   presenting in front of an actual human being.
 "Simulated" context and feedback: You can use AI to
   develop your own specific context and situation,
   including the event and audience. That way, you can
   practice your speaking skills, language, breathing
   techniques, and anything else in as close to a real-life
   situation as possible. Then, the AI platform will collect
   these details for more informed feedback on your
   presentation. This goes beyond telling you to have more
   eye contact or gestures; instead, AI will evaluate both
   your presentation skills and the words you are using
   depending on the situation.
 "On-demand" access at a low cost: You can use AI on
   your schedule since you don't need an actual audience.
144 | 3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

      This means you can practice before or after class, on
      weekends, morning or night. And the cost of AI has
      come down dramatically, with some options even being
      totally free or offering a free trial (for your semester!).

Here are Six AI Tools to Combat
Public Speaking Anxiety:

To do your best work and combat communication
apprehension, you need to invest in the right tools. This is
especially true when it comes to using AI to battle the anxiety
that comes with standing and speaking in front of a live
audience. AI tools allow students to practice their speeches
in real time in front of a virtual audience. Then, they get
personalized feedback to help them improve their public
speaking, become more confident, and minimize the
communication apprehension that arises during speeches.

   It is important to know the differences between the many
different AI tools out there today. Depending on what spurs
your public speaking anxiety, you will need to choose an AI
tool that best matches your specific needs. We touch on six AI
tools below that have helped students in 2025, and some are
free while others give free trials to help you better prepare for
your upcoming speeches (Cook, 2025; Perelman, 2024).

VIRTUAL ORATOR
   What is Virtual Orator?
   Virtual Orator is a revolutionary new technology for

training public speaking skills. Maximize your training
benefits, by practicing in the same situation for which you are
training: speaking in front of people. Virtual Orator is a virtual
reality simulator that creates the sensation of being in front of
an audience.
                3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 151

   Practice where, when, and as often as you need. No more
forcing your family, friends, or coworkers to endure five
rounds of practice presentations. Our virtual audiences will
take their place. Adjust the venue, audience size and behavior
to fit your training needs; from starting out with a fear to
perfecting that important presentation, Virtual Orator
provides the right speaking experience for every need.

   Practice in a variety of venues. Pick a space similar to where
you will present, so you can `own' the stage when you step
in front of the audience. Or, pick a venue and audience to
challenge yourself.

You simply create your account and then choose your settings
- the venue, audience size, even audience behaviors. This is a
very helpful immersive experience to practice public speaking
anxiety tips and strategies because it gives the best audience
engagement with a "human" audience. It also helps you
battle both the audience and situational anxiety discussed
earlier in the chapter. You can adjust the settings to fit your
audience and situation needs and use its fully-integrated
recording set up so you can record both the virtual setting and
the presentation to rewatch later. If you already have a VR
headset, this is a great AI tool to minimize or fully combat
your public speaking anxiety.

Microsoft Reading Coach will analyze some of the most
important aspects of public speaking delivery and then will
provide a report on the following: originality (i.e., not reading
off your PowerPoint slides), pacing, timing, pitch, filler
words, and repetition.

   This AI tool is great for speeches that require PowerPoint
presentations, as it will tell you if your language is original
or if you are simply reiterating what is on the slides. It also
focuses on your rate, filler words, and variance of inflection,
pitch and tone. However, there is no video element with this
AI tool, so you won't get feedback on eye contact, body
language, or facial expressions. In addition, don't close
PowerPoint before saving your rehearsal report! Once you
close out, it is gone forever because there isn't an option to
review reports later to monitor your progress.

VirtualSpeech lets you immerse yourself in the setting of your
choice and then you can enable interruptions to see how you
deal with them. For example, what would happen to your
public speaking anxiety if a student's cell phone goes off or
a classmate arrives late in the middle of your speech? What
about an excessive "cougher" in the front row? You can make
these distractions possible while you are practicing, helping
you better prepare for any real-life unexpected distractions
that may arise.

   Yes the feedback is limited with VirtualSpeech and focuses
generally on eye contact, pausing, and body language, but
knowing how to control your anxiety when distractions arise
can be very helpful with communication apprehension.

   REMEMBER: The goal of using AI is not to replace your
unique voice or (worse) write your speech for you! The goal is
to use it as a powerful tool to strengthen your public speaking
skills and minimize your communication apprehension by
practicing in front of a virtual audience, addressing any
weaknesses, and then making the improvements necessary
164 | 3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

before speech day. With its simulated audience and real-time
feedback, AI can ensure you are confident and prepared for
any speeches that come your way.

   There are also tools that are timeless (the software above
may not be around forever!) such as Google Scholar and The
Penn State University Library, which students can use
anytime to help prepare and practice speeches to alleviate
speech anxiety. Both Google Scholar and the Penn State
University library have sources available from all over the
world to help with speech feedback, apprehension,
confidence, and language use.

Watch What You Eat

A final tip about preparation is to watch what you eat
               3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 165

immediately before speaking. The butterflies in your stomach
are likely to be more noticeable if you skip normal meals.
While you should eat normally, you should avoid caffeinated
drinks because they can make your shaking hands worse.
Carbohydrates operate as natural sedatives, so you may want
to eat carbohydrates to help slow down your metabolism and
to avoid fried or very spicy foods that may upset your
stomach. Especially if you are speaking in the morning, be
sure to have breakfast. If you haven't had anything to eat
or drink since dinner the night before, dizziness and light-
headedness are very real possibilities.

Reducing Nervousness during
Delivery Anticipate the Reactions
of Your Body

There are a number of steps you can take to counteract the
negative physiological effects of stress on the body. Deep
breathing will help to counteract the effects of excess
adrenaline. Some students have found that using the syllable
"VU" and trying to say it long, low, and slow while focusing
on the "gut" can be calming. You also can place symbols in
your notes, like "slow down" or , that remind you to pause
and breathe during points in your speech. It is also a good
idea to pause a moment before you get started to set an
appropriate pace from the onset. Look at your audience and
166 | 3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

smile. It is a reflex for some of your audience members to
smile back. Those smiles will reassure you that your audience
members are friendly.

   Physical movement helps to channel some of the excess
energy that your body produces in response to anxiety. If at
all possible, move around the front of the room rather than
remaining imprisoned behind the lectern or gripping it for
dear life (avoid pacing nervously from side to side, however).
Move closer to the audience and then stop for a moment. If
you are afraid that moving away from the lectern will reveal
your shaking hands, use note cards rather than a sheet of
paper for your outline. Note cards do not quiver like paper,
and they provide you with something to do with your hands.

   Vocal warm-ups are also important before speaking. Just
as athletes warm up before practice or competition and
musicians warm up before playing, speakers need to get their
voices ready to speak. Talking with others before your speech
or quietly humming to yourself can get your voice ready for
your presentation. You can even sing or practice a bit of your
speech out loud while you're in the shower (just don't wake
the neighbors), where the warm, moist air is beneficial for
your vocal mechanism. Gently yawning a few times is also
an excellent way to stretch the key muscle groups involved in
speaking.

   Immediately before you speak, you can relax the muscles
of your neck and shoulders, rolling your head gently from
side to side. Allow your arms to hang down your sides and
               3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 167

stretch out your shoulders. Isometric exercises that involve
momentarily tensing and then relaxing specific muscle
groups are an effective way to keep your muscles from
becoming stiff.

Focus on the Audience, Not on
Yourself

During your speech, make a point of establishing direct eye
contact with your audience members. By looking at
individuals, you establish a series of one-to-one contacts
similar to interpersonal communication. An audience
becomes much less threatening when you think of them not
as an anonymous mass but as a collection of individuals.

   A colleague once shared his worst speaking experience
when he reached the front of the room and forgot everything
he was supposed to say. When I asked what he saw when he
was in the front of the room, he looked at me like I was crazy.
He responded, "I didn't see anything. All I remember is a
mental image of me up there in the front of the room blowing
it." Speaking anxiety becomes more intense if you focus on
yourself rather than concentrating on your audience and your
material.
168 | 3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

Maintain Your Sense of Humor

No matter how well we plan, unexpected things happen.
That fact is what makes the public speaking situation so
interesting. When the unexpected happens to you, do not let
it rattle you. At the end of a class period late in the afternoon
of a long day, a student raised her hand and asked me if I
knew that I was wearing two different colored shoes, one
black and one blue. I looked down and saw that she was right;
my shoes did not match. I laughed at myself, complimented
the student on her observational abilities and moved on with
the important thing, the material I had to deliver.

Stress Management Techniques

Even when we employ positive thinking and are well
prepared, some of us still feel a great deal of anxiety about
public speaking. When that is the case, it can be more helpful
to use stress management than to try to make the anxiety go
away.

   One general technique for managing stress is positive
visualization. Visualization is the process of seeing
something in your mind's eye; essentially it is a form of self-
hypnosis. Frequently used in sports training, positive
visualization involves using the imagination to create images
of relaxation or ultimate success. Essentially, you imagine in
great detail the goal for which you are striving, say, a rousing
               3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION | 169

round of applause after you give your speech. You mentally
picture yourself standing at the front of the room, delivering
your introduction, moving through the body of your speech,
highlighting your presentation aids, and sharing a memorable
conclusion. If you imagine a positive outcome, your body
will respond to it as through it were real. Such mind-body
techniques create the psychological grounds for us to achieve
the goals we have imagined. As we discussed earlier,
communication apprehension has a psychological basis, so
mind-body techniques such as visualization can be important
to reducing anxiety. It's important to keep in mind, though,
that visualization does not mean you can skip practicing your
speech out loud. Just as an athlete still needs to work out and
practice the sport, you need to practice your speech in order
to achieve the positive results you visualize.

   Systematic desensitization is a behavioral modification
technique that helps individuals overcome anxiety disorders.
People with phobias, or irrational fears, tend to avoid the
object of their fear. For example, people with a phobia of
elevators avoid riding in elevators--and this only adds to their
fear because they never "learn" that riding in elevators is
usually perfectly safe. Systematic desensitization changes this
avoidance pattern by gradually exposing the individual to the
object of fear until it can be tolerated.

   First, the individual is trained in specific muscle relaxation
techniques. Next, the individual learns to respond with
conscious relaxation even when confronted with the
170 | 3.4 REDUCING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION

situation that previously caused them fear. James McCroskey
used this technique to treat students who suffered from
severe, trait-based communication apprehension
(McCroskey, 1972). He found that "the technique was eighty
to ninety percent effective" for the people who received the
training (McCroskey, 2001). If you're highly anxious about
public speaking, you might begin a program of systematic
desensitization by watching someone else give a speech. Once
you are able to do this without discomfort, you would then
move to talking about giving a speech yourself, practicing,
and, eventually, delivering your speech.

   The success of techniques such as these clearly indicates
that increased exposure to public speaking reduces overall
anxiety. Consequently, you should seek out opportunities to
speak in public rather than avoid them. As the famous
political orator William Jennings Bryan once noted, "The
ability to speak effectively is an acquirement rather than a
gift" (Carnegie, 1955).

                    information from the beginning

                    of the speech. When

encountering these difficulties, a good strategy is to pause for

a moment to think through what you want to do next. Is it

important to include the missing information, or can it be

omitted without hurting the audience's ability to understand

the rest of your speech? If it needs to be included, do you

want to add the information now, or will it fit better later in

the speech? It is often difficult to remain silent when you

encounter this situation, but pausing for a few seconds will

help you to figure out what to do and may be less distracting

to the audience than sputtering through a few "ums" and

"uhs."

Technical Difficulties

Technology has become a very useful aid in public speaking,
allowing us to use audio or video clips, presentation software,
or direct links to websites. However, one of the best known
truisms about technology is that it does break down. Web
                                  3.5 COPING WITH THE UNEXPECTED | 173

servers go offline, files will not download in a timely manner,
and media are incompatible with the computer in the
presentation room. It is important to always have a backup
plan, developed in advance, in case of technical difficulties
with your presentation materials. As you develop your speech
and visual aids, think through what you will do if you cannot
show a particular graph or if your presentation slides are
hopelessly garbled. Although your beautifully prepared chart
may be superior to the oral description you can provide, your
ability to provide a succinct oral description when technology
fails can give your audience the information they need.

External Distractions

Although many public speaking instructors directly address
audience etiquette during speeches, you're still likely to
encounter an audience member who walks in late, a ringing
cell phone, or even a car alarm going off outside your
classroom. If you are distracted by external events like these, it
is often useful, and sometimes necessary (as in the case of the
loud car alarm), to pause and wait so that you can regain the
audience's attention and be heard.

   Whatever the unexpected event, your most important job
as a speaker is to maintain your composure. It is important
not to get upset or angry because of these types of
glitches--and, once again, the key to this is being fully
prepared. If you keep your cool and quickly implement a
174 | 3.5 COPING WITH THE UNEXPECTED

"plan B" for moving forward with your speech, your audience
is likely to be impressed and may listen even more attentively
to the rest of your presentation. And remember, you can add
these distractions into your AI tool so that you know exactly
what your "plan B" is when these external distractions arise.

3.6: CONCLUSION:
SPEAKING
CONFIDENTLY

   Stephanie Morrow

Speaking confidently is not about eliminating nerves. It is
about learning to work with them. Communication
apprehension will never vanish completely, but with
preparation, self-awareness, and practice, you can transform
anxiety into energy and presence. Beyond the podium,
confidence is less about how you feel in the moment and
more about the resilience you build each time you face an
audience. Every shaky breath, every pause, every recovery
from an unexpected distraction strengthens your ability to
stand and be heard.

   Confidence also comes from realizing that the audience
is not your adversary; they are participants in a shared act
of communication. When you see them not as critics but
as partners, your focus shifts outward and your message
becomes stronger. This shift is where authentic confidence
lives. It is not in the absence of fear, but in the presence of
connection.

   But confidence is not only about how you speak. It is
176 | 3.6: CONCLUSION: SPEAKING CONFIDENTLY

equally tied to how you listen. Public speaking is not a one-
way performance. It is a dialogue shaped by the feedback,
needs, and responses of your audience. In the next chapter,
we turn to the art of listening-an often-overlooked skill that
makes every speaker more responsive, ethical, and effective.

          Key Takeaways

          Plan ahead for how to cope with
            unexpected difficulties such as forgetting
            part of your speech content, having
            technical trouble with visual aids, or
            being interrupted by external
            distractions.

          Communication apprehension refers to
            the fear or anxiety people experience at
            the thought of being evaluated by others.
            Some anxiety is a normal part of the
            communication process.

          The psychological threat individuals
            perceive in the communication situation
            prompts physiological changes designed
            to help the body respond. These physical
            reactions to stress create the
            uncomfortable feelings of unease called
           3.6: CONCLUSION: SPEAKING CONFIDENTLY | 177

   speech anxiety and may include sweaty
   palms, shaking, butterflies in the
   stomach, and dry mouth.
 A great deal of conventional advice for
   managing stage fright is misleading,
   including suggestions that speech
   anxiety is neurotic, that telling a joke is a
   good opening, that imagining the
   audience naked is helpful, that any
   mistake is fatal to an effective speech,
   that memorizing a script is useful, that
   audiences are out to get you, and that
   your audience sees how nervous you
   really are.
 Communication apprehension stems
   from many sources, including the
   speaker's personality characteristics,
   communication context, nature of the
   audience, or situation.
 Many factors exaggerate communication
   apprehension. Formality, familiarity,
   novelty, perceived similarity, and
   subordinate status are a few of the
   factors that influence our tendency to
178 | 3.6: CONCLUSION: SPEAKING CONFIDENTLY

            feel anxious while speaking.
          There are many steps you can take

            during the speech preparation process to
            manage your communication
            apprehension, including thinking
            positively, analyzing your audience,
            clearly organizing your ideas, adapting
            your language to the oral mode, and
            practicing.
          You can employ a variety of techniques
            while you are speaking to reduce your
            apprehension, such as anticipating your
            body's reactions, focusing on the
            audience, and maintaining your sense of
            humor.
          Stress management techniques, including
            cognitive restructuring and systematic
            desensitization, can also be helpful.

4.1: PRELUDE TO THE
IMPORTANCE OF
LISTENING

   Janie Harden Fritz

"Are you listening to me?"

This question is often asked because the speaker thinks the
listener is nodding off or daydreaming--or perhaps hasn't
looked up from an ever-present phone. We sometimes think
that listening means we only have to sit back, remain
minimally conscious, and let a speaker's words wash over us.
While many Americans look upon being active as something
to admire, to engage in, and to excel at, listening is often
understood as a passive activity. However, as one CEO learned
the hard way, listening is a crucial element to the success of
a company's ecosystem--and it should be an active process
(Bryant & Sharer, 2021). Many leaders exist in an echo
chamber, and so creating structures for active listening by
which a team feels heard is imperative. As you can imagine,
good listening is also key for social and intimate interactions.
When you are having a conversation with a good listener, you
are likely to feel validated and affirmed in the relationship,
184 | 4.1: PRELUDE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF LISTENING

and you might also experience more open-mindedness and a
broadened perspective (Itzchakov et al., 2021).

   You may have heard the adage, "We have two ears but only
one mouth"--an easy way to remember that listening can be
twice as important as talking. As a student, you most likely
spend many hours in a classroom doing a large amount of
focused listening, yet sometimes it is difficult to apply those
efforts to communication in other areas of your life. Or
perhaps you find focused listening in the classroom difficult
given the draw of phone or laptop. College students spend
more than half of their daily communication engaged in
listening (Emanuel et. al., 2008). Nonetheless, your listening
skills may not be all they could be. In this chapter, we will
examine listening versus hearing, listening styles, listening
difficulties, listening stages, and listening critically.

Benefits of Listening

Listening should not be taken for granted. Before the
invention of writing, people conveyed all knowledge through
                                              4.2: LISTENING VS. HEARING | 189

some combination of showing and telling. Elders recited tribal
histories to attentive audiences. Listeners received religious
teachings enthusiastically. Myths, legends, folktales, and stories
for entertainment survived only because audiences were eager
to listen. Nowadays, however, we gain information and
entertainment through reading and electronic recordings
rather than through real-time listening. If we become
distracted and let our attention wander, we can go back and
replay a recording. Despite that fact, we can still gain at least
four compelling benefits by becoming more active and
competent at real-time listening.

Become a Better Student

When we focus on the material presented in a classroom, we
will be able to identify not only the words used in a lecture
but their emphasis and their more complex meanings. We will
take better notes and will remember more accurately the
instructor's claims, information, and conclusions. Many times,
instructors give verbal cues about what information is
important, specific expectations about assignments, and even
what material is likely to be on an exam, so careful listening can
be beneficial.
190 | 4.2: LISTENING VS. HEARING

Become a Better Friend

When we give our best attention to people expressing thoughts
and experiences that are important to them, those persons are
likely to see us as someone who cares about their well-being.
This fact is especially true when we give our attention only and
refrain from interjecting opinions, judgments, and advice.

Others Will View Thoughtful
Listeners as Intelligent and
Perceptive

When we listen well to others, we reveal ourselves as being
interested in people and events. In addition, our ability to
understand the meanings of what we hear will make us more
knowledgeable and thoughtful people.

Good Listening Can Help Public
Speaking

When we listen well to others, we start to pick up more on the
stylistic components related to how people form arguments
and present information. As a result, we have the ability to
analyze what we think works and doesn't work in others'
speeches, which can help us transform our speeches in the
process. For example, really paying attention to how others cite
                                               4.2: LISTENING VS. HEARING | 191

sources orally during their speeches may give us ideas about
how to cite sources in our presentations more effectively.

Alternative Listening Modes: The
Deaf Community

For some persons, listening does not involve sounds. The deaf
community hears differently, listening by means of visual cues.
Siple (1994) notes, "For the Deaf [person], the very nature of
deafness shifts the primary channel for information exchange
from auditory to visual" (p. 348). The visual channel becomes
the primary mechanism for message exchange. In fact,
according to Siple, the deaf community can be viewed as a
culture, with its own rules and norms. For many public
speaking events, it is possible to enlist the services of persons
who can use sign language to translate audible messages into
sign language or to have the speech projected through video
with closed captioning.

4.3: LISTENING STYLES

Learning Objectives

 2. Explain the people listening style.
 3. Explain the action listening style.
 4. Explain the content listening style.
 5. Explain the time listening style.

If listening were easy, and if all people went about it in the same
way, the task for a public speaker would be much easier. Even
Aristotle, over 2,000 years ago, recognized that listeners in his
audience were varied in listening styles. He differentiated
them as follows:

     Rhetoric falls into three divisions, determined by the
     three classes of listeners to speeches. For of the
     three elements in speech-making--speaker, subject,
     and person addressed--it is the last one, the hearer,
                                     4.3: LISTENING STYLES | 195

that determines the speech's end and object. The
hearer must be either a judge, with a decision to
make about things past or future, or an observer. A
member of the assembly decides about future
events, a juryman about past events: while those
who merely decide on the orator's skill are observers
(Aristotle, c. 350 BCE).

Thus Aristotle classified listeners into those who would be

using the speech to make decisions about past events, those

who would make decisions affecting the future, and those who

would evaluate the speaker's skills. This is all the more

remarkable when we consider that Aristotle's audiences were

composed exclusively of male citizens of one city-state, all

prosperous property owners.

                             In an article in the

                             International Journal of

Listening, Watson et al. (1995) identified four listening styles:

people, action, content, and time. While there are several

different approaches to understanding listening styles and

preferences, the following four listening styles are utilized most

often across disciplines:

People

The people-oriented listener is interested in the speaker.
People-oriented listeners listen to the message in order to learn
how speakers think and how they feel about their message. For
instance, when people-oriented listeners listen to an interview
with a musician or athlete, they are likely to be more interested
in the artist or sports figure as an individual than in the music,
even though the people- oriented listener might also appreciate
the artist's work. If audience members (receivers) are a people-
                                                      4.3: LISTENING STYLES | 197

oriented listeners, they might have certain expectations about
questions that will be answered, such as: Does the artist or
athlete feel successful? What's it like to be famous? What kind
of educational background does he or she have? In the same
way, if we're listening to a doctor who responded to an
earthquake crisis, we might be more interested in the doctor
as a person than in the state of affairs for the affected persons.
Why did he or she go in response to this crisis? How did he
or she get away from his or her normal practice and patients?
How many lives did he or she save? Although we might
certainly be interested in the equally important and urgent
needs for food, shelter, and sanitation following the
earthquake, we may want to hear about those issues in the
context of the doctor's experience.

   The people-oriented listener is likely to be more attentive
to the speaker than to the message. People-oriented listeners
understand that the message is about what is important to the
speaker.

Action

Action-oriented listeners are primarily interested in finding
out what the speaker hopes to accomplish through the
message. Does the speaker want votes, donations, volunteers,
or something else? Action-oriented listeners may need less
description, evidence, and explanations underlying a speaker's
case.
198 | 4.3: LISTENING STYLES

   Action-oriented listening is sometimes called task-oriented
listening. In it, the listener seeks a clear message about what
needs to be done and seeks less focus on the reasons behind the
task. This can be especially true if the reasons are complicated.
For example, when we are passengers on an airplane waiting
to push back from the gate, a flight attendant delivers a brief
speech called the preflight safety briefing. The flight attendant
does not read the findings of a safety study or the regulations
about seat belts. The flight attendant doesn't explain that the
content of the speech is actually mandated by the Federal
Aviation Administration. Instead, the attendant says only to
buckle up so we can leave. An action-oriented listener finds
"buckling up" a more compelling message than a message
about the underlying reasons.

Content

Content-oriented listeners are interested in the message
itself, whether it makes sense, what it means, and whether
it's accurate. When we give speeches, many members of our
classroom audience will be content-oriented listeners who will
be interested in learning from us. We therefore have an
obligation to represent the truth as accurately as possible. We
can emphasize an idea, but if we exaggerate, we could lose
credibility in the minds of our content-oriented audience
members. We can advocate ideas that are important to us, but
if we omit important limitations, we are withholding part of
                                                      4.3: LISTENING STYLES | 199

the truth and could leave our audience with an inaccurate
view.

   Imagine delivering a speech on the plight of orphans in
Syria. If we just talk about the fact that there are over forty-
five million orphaned Syrians, but don't explain why, we will
sound like an infomercial. In such an instance, our audience's
response is likely to be less enthusiastic than we might want.
Instead, content-oriented listeners want to listen to well-
developed information with solid explanations.

Time

People using a time-oriented listening style prefer a message
that gets to the point quickly. Time-oriented listeners can
become impatient with slow delivery or lengthy explanations.
This kind of listener may be receptive for only a brief amount
of time and may become rude or even hostile if the speaker
expects a longer focus of attention. Time-oriented listeners
convey their impatience through eye rolling, shifting about in
their seats, checking their cell phones, and other inappropriate
behaviors. If asked to speak to a group of middle-school
students, the speaker needs to realize that their attention spans
are simply not as long as those of college students. This is
an important reason speeches to young audiences must be
shorter, or broken up by more variety than speeches to adults.
200 | 4.3: LISTENING STYLES

                             Let's consider a professional

                             situation. Some audience

                             not be listening to the message.

This type of listening, however, may be contextual rather than

dispositional. In other circumstances, the same listeners may

exhibit a person-oriented, action-oriented, or content-oriented

style under most conditions, but, but when other matters

must be attended to, message length matters. In such cases,

time orientation may accompany the other styles of listening,

depending on the context.

DIFFICULT

   Janie Harden Fritz

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand the types of noise that can affect a listener's
      ability to attend to a message.

 2. Evaluate how AI-generated information, including
      content curation and algorithmic recommendations,
      contributes to different types of noise that impact a
      listener's ability to process a message.

 3. Explain how a listener's attention span can limit the
      listener's ability to attend to a speaker's message. Analyze
      how a listener's personal biases can influence her or his
      ability to attend to a message.

 4. Define receiver apprehension and the impact it can have
      on a listener's ability to attend to a message.

At times, everyone has difficulty staying completely focused
during a lengthy presentation. We can sometimes have
difficulty listening to even relatively brief messages. Some of
the factors that interfere with good listening might exist
202 | 4.4: WHY LISTENING IS DIFFICULT

beyond our control, but others are manageable. It's helpful
to be aware of these factors so that they interfere as little as
possible with understanding the message.

attentive listening even on the part of listeners whose minds are

elsewhere, either on the meal that will take place after a speech

or personal concerns that pull attention away from the

speaker. Likewise physiological noise related to one's bodily

reactions to the environment (the room is too hot or too cold

for an audience member) or due to illness may be beyond a

speaker's control.

Speakers can avoid creating semantic noise, which emerges

from vocabulary that is likely to be unfamiliar to an audience

if the speaker hails from a specialized profession, by crafting a

speech that incorporates everyday understandings of complex

terms or translates phrases in a language other than of the

audience members.

Many distractions are the fault of neither the listener nor

the speaker. However, when we are speakers, being aware of

these sources of noise can help us reduce interferences with our

audience's ability to understand.

Attention Span

A person can only maintain focused attention for a finite
length of time. In his 1985 book Amusing Ourselves to Death:
Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, New York
University's Steinhardt School of Education professor Neil
                                       4.4: WHY LISTENING IS DIFFICULT | 211

Postman argued that contemporary audiences have lost the
ability to sustain attention to a message (Postman, 1985).
More recently, researchers have engaged in an ongoing debate
over whether Internet use is detrimental to attention span
(Carr, 2010).

   The limits of the human attention span can interfere with
listening, but listeners and speakers can use strategies to
prevent this interference. As many classroom instructors
know, listeners will readily renew their attention when the
presentation includes frequent breaks in pacing (Middendorf
& Kalish, 1996). For example, a fifty- to seventy-five-minute
class session might include some lecture material alternated
with questions for class discussion, video clips, handouts, and
demonstrations. Instructors who are adept at holding listeners'
attention also move about the front of the room, write on
the board, draw diagrams, and intermittently use PowerPoint
slides or videos.

Receiver Biases

Good listening involves keeping an open mind and
withholding judgment until the speaker has completed the
message. Conversely, biased listening is characterized by
jumping to conclusions; the biased listener believes, "I don't
need to listen because I already know what I think." Receiver
biases can refer to two things: biases with reference to the
speaker and preconceived ideas and opinions about the topic
212 | 4.4: WHY LISTENING IS DIFFICULT

or message. Both can be considered noise. Everyone has biases,
but good listeners have learned to hold them in check while
listening.

   The first type of bias listeners can have is related to the
speaker. Often a speaker stands up and an audience member
simply doesn't like the speaker, so the audience member may
not listen to the speaker's message. Maybe the speaker is an
annoying classmate, or maybe we question a classmate's
competence on a given topic. When we have preconceived
notions about a speaker, those biases can interfere with our
ability to listen attentively to the speaker's message, decreasing
our listening accuracy.

   The second type of bias listeners can have is related to the
topic or content of the speech. If the speech topic is one we've
heard a thousand times, then we might tune out. Or maybe
the speaker is presenting a topic or position we fundamentally
disagree with. When listeners have strong preexisting opinions
about a topic, such as the death penalty, religious issues,
abortion, or climate change, their biases may make it difficult
for them even to consider new information about the topic,
especially if the new information is inconsistent with what
they already believe to be true. On the other hand, if we are
listening to speaker whose views are in alignment with our
own, we may fail to listen as critically as we might, which is
another type of bias. As listeners, we have difficulty identifying
our biases, especially when they seem to make sense. However,
it is worth recognizing that our lives would be very difficult
                                       4.4: WHY LISTENING IS DIFFICULT | 213

if no one ever considered new points of view or new
information. We live in a world where everyone can benefit
from clear thinking and open-minded listening.

Listening or Receiver
Apprehension

Listening or receiver apprehension is the fear that we might
be unable to understand the message or process the
information correctly or be able to adapt our thinking to
include the new information coherently (Wheeless, 1975). In
some situations, we might worry that the information
presented will be "over our heads"--too complex, technical, or
advanced for us to understand adequately.

   Many students will actually avoid registering for courses in
which they feel certain they will do poorly. In other cases,
students will choose to take a challenging course only if it's a
requirement. This avoidance might be understandable but is
not a good strategy for success. To become educated people,
students should take a few courses that can shed light on areas
where their knowledge is limited.

   As speakers, we can reduce listener apprehension by
defining terms clearly and using simple visual aids to hold the
audience's attention. We don't want to underestimate or
overestimate our audience's knowledge on a subject, so good
audience analysis is always important. For example, if we know
our audience doesn't have special knowledge on a given topic,
214 | 4.4: WHY LISTENING IS DIFFICULT

we should start by defining important terms. Research has
shown us that when listeners do not feel they understand a
speaker's message, their apprehension about receiving the
message escalates. Imagine that we are listening to a speech
about chemistry and the speaker begins talking about
"colligative properties." We may start questioning whether we
are even in the right place. When this happens, apprehension
clearly interferes with a listener's ability to understand a
speaker's message accurately and competently. As a speaker,
we can lessen the listener's apprehension by explaining that
colligative properties focus on how much is dissolved in a
solution, not on what is dissolved in a solution. We could also
give an example that they might readily understand, such as
saying that it doesn't matter what kind of salt to use in the
winter to melt ice on a driveway--what is important is how
much salt to use.

Learning Objectives

 1. Explain the receiving stage of listening.

 3. Explain the remembering stage of listening.
 4. Explain the evaluating stage of listening.
 5. Explain the responding stage of listening.
 6. Understand the two types of feedback listeners give to

As you read earlier, there are many factors that can interfere
with listening, so you need to be able to manage a number
of mental tasks at the same time in order to be a successful
listener. Author Joseph DeVito (2000) has divided the
listening process into five stages: receiving, understanding,
remembering, evaluating, and responding.

   Stage 1: Listening
   Stage 2: Understanding
   Stage 3: Remembering
   Stage 4: Evaluating
   Stage 5: Feedback

Receiving

Receiving is the intentional focus on hearing a speaker's
218 | 4.5: STAGES OF LISTENING

message, which happens when we filter out other sources so
that we can isolate the message and avoid the confusing
mixture of incoming stimuli. At this stage, we are still only
hearing the message. Notice in Figure 4.5, "Stages of
Listening," that this stage is represented by the ear because it
is the primary tool involved with this stage of the listening
process.

   One of the authors of this book recalls attending a political
rally for a presidential candidate at which about five thousand
people were crowded into an outdoor amphitheater. When
the candidate finally started speaking, the cheering and yelling
was so loud that the candidate couldn't be heard easily despite
using a speaker system. In this example, our coauthor had
difficulty receiving the message because of the external noise.
This is only one example of the ways that hearing alone can
require sincere effort, but we must hear the message before we
can continue the process of listening.

Understanding

In the understanding stage, we attempt to learn the meaning
of the message, which is not always easy. For one thing, if a
speaker does not enunciate clearly, it may be difficult to tell
what the message was--did your friend say, "I think she'll be
late for class," or "my teacher delayed the class"? Notice in
Figure 4.5, "Stages of Listening," that stages two, three, and
                                                 4.5: STAGES OF LISTENING | 219

four are represented by the brain because it is the primary tool
involved with these stages of the listening process.

   Even when we have understood the words in a message,
because of the differences in our backgrounds and experience,
we sometimes make the mistake of attaching our own
meanings to the words of others. For example, say you have
made plans with your friends to meet at a certain movie
theater, but you arrive and nobody else shows up. Eventually
you find out that your friends are at a different theater all the
way across town where the same movie is playing. Everyone
else understood that the meeting place was the "west side"
location, but you wrongly understood it as the "east side"
location and therefore missed out on part of the fun.

   The consequences of ineffective listening in a classroom can
be much worse. When professors advise students to "get an
early start on your speech," they probably hope students will
begin research right away and move on to developing a thesis
statement and outlining the speech as soon as possible.
However, students might misunderstand the instructor's
meaning in several ways. One student might interpret the
advice to mean that as long as she gets started, the rest of the
assignment will have time to develop itself. Another student
might instead think that to start early is to start on the Friday
before the Monday due date instead of Sunday night.

   So much of the way we understand others is influenced
by our own perceptions and experiences. Therefore, at the
understanding stage of listening, we should be on the lookout
220 | 4.5: STAGES OF LISTENING

for places where our perceptions might differ from those of the
speaker.

Remembering

Remembering begins with listening; if we can't remember
something that was said, we might not have been listening
effectively. Wolvin and Coakley (1996) note that the most
common reason for not remembering a message after the fact
is because it wasn't really learned in the first place. However,
even when we are listening attentively, some messages are more
difficult than others to understand and remember. Highly
complex messages that are filled with detail call for highly
developed listening skills. Moreover, if something redirects our
attention even for a moment, we could miss out on
information that explains other new concepts we hear when
we begin to listen fully again.

   It's also important to know that we can improve our
memory of a message by processing it meaningfully--that is,
by applying it in ways that are meaningful to our own lives
(Gluck, et al., 2008). Instead of simply repeating a new
acquaintance's name over and over, for example, we might
remember it by associating it with something in our own lives.
For example, "Emily," we might say, "reminds me of the Emily
we knew in middle school," or "Mr. Impiari's name reminds
us of the Prius our friend drives."
                                                 4.5: STAGES OF LISTENING | 221

   Finally, if understanding has been inaccurate, recollection of
the message will be inaccurate too.

Evaluating

The fourth stage in the listening process is evaluating, or
judging the value of the message. When listening to a speaker,
we might be thinking, "This makes sense" or, conversely, "This
is very odd." Because everyone embodies biases and
perspectives learned from widely diverse sets of life
experiences, evaluations of the same message can vary widely
from one listener to another. Even the most open-minded
listeners will have opinions of a speaker, and those opinions
will influence how the message is evaluated. People are more
likely to evaluate a message positively if the speaker speaks
clearly, presents ideas logically, and gives reasons to support the
points made.

   Unfortunately, personal opinions sometimes result in
prejudiced evaluations. Imagine listening to a speech given by
someone from another country and this person has an accent
that is hard to understand. We may have a hard time simply
making out the speaker's message. Some people find an accent
different from their own to be interesting or even exotic, while
others find it annoying or even take it as a sign of ignorance.
If a listener has a strong bias against unfamiliar accents, the
listener may not even attempt to attend to the message. If we
mistrust a speaker because of an accent, we could be rejecting
222 | 4.5: STAGES OF LISTENING

important or personally enriching information. Good listeners
have learned to refrain from making these judgments and
instead to focus on the speaker's meanings.

Responding                Responding--sometimes
                       referred to as feedback--is the

often give feedback in the form of verbal feedback; however, we
can just as easily respond nonverbally.

Formative Feedback

Not all response occurs at the end of the message. Formative
feedback is a natural part of the ongoing transaction between
a speaker and a listener. As the speaker delivers the message, a
listener signals his or her involvement with focused attention,
note- taking, nodding, and other behaviors that indicate
understanding or failure to understand the message. These
signals are important to the speaker, who is interested in
whether the message is clear and accepted or whether the
content of the message is meeting the resistance of
preconceived ideas. Speakers can use this feedback to decide
whether additional examples, support materials, or
explanation is needed.

Summative Feedback

Summative feedback is given at the end of the communication.
When we attend a political rally, a presentation given by a
speaker we admire, or even a class, there are verbal and
nonverbal ways of indicating our appreciation for or our
disagreement with the messages or the speakers at the end of
the message. Maybe we stand up and applaud a speaker we
224 | 4.5: STAGES OF LISTENING

agreed with or just sit staring in silence after listening to a

speaker we didn't like. In other cases, a speaker may be

attempting to persuade us to donate to a charity, so if the

speaker passes a bucket and we make a donation, we are

providing feedback on the speaker's effectiveness. At the same

time, we do not always listen carefully to the messages of

speakers we admire. Sometimes we simply enjoy being in their

presence, and our summative feedback is not about the

message but about our attitudes about the speaker. If our

feedback is limited to something like, "I just love your voice,"

we might be indicating that we did not listen carefully to the

content of the message.

4.6: LISTENING
CRITICALLY

   Janie Harden Fritz

Learning Objectives

 1. Define and explain critical listening and its importance
      in the public speaking context.

 2. Understand five distinct ways to improve ability to listen
      critically to speeches.

 3. Evaluate what it means to be an ethical listener.

Students are exposed to many kinds of messages: messages
conveying academic information, institutional rules,
instructions, and warnings. Students also receive messages
through political discourse, advertisements, gossip, jokes, song
lyrics, text messages, invitations, web links, and all other
manner of communication. It's not all the same, but it isn't
always clear how to separate the truth from the messages that
are misleading or even blatantly false. Nor is it always clear
which messages are intended to help the listener and which
ones are merely self-serving for the speaker. Part of being a
                                                4.6: LISTENING CRITICALLY | 227

good listener is to learn when to use caution in evaluating the
messages we hear.

   Wolvin and Athearn (2024) discuss the importance of
critical listening, which involves attending to how accurate and
consistent the message is. In other words, critical listening
involves careful attention to the ideas and logical elements of
a speech. Wolvin and Athearn discuss listening in public
contexts, drawing on a pioneer of listening research, Ralph
Nichols (1948), reminding us that listeners who are attending
to public speeches can listen well by focusing on content,
remaining objective, taking notes, asking questions, and
concentrating with deliberation, recognizing that listening
speed is much faster than speaking speed. Focusing on content
may involve distinguishing between fact and opinion and
identifying the speaker's assumptions, being alert for potential
bias. Consider relating new ideas that you are hearing to what
you already know in order to challenge your own
understanding and consider the reasonableness of the
speaker's message. Listening critically is hard work!

   Ethical listening respects persons and ideas. Scholars
Stephanie Coopman and James Lull (2008) emphasize the
creation of a climate of caring and mutual understanding,
observing that "respecting others' perspectives is one hallmark
of the effective listener" (p. 60). Respect, or unconditional
positive regard for others, means that you treat others with
consideration and decency whether we agree with them or
not. Professors Sprague, Stuart, and Bodary (2010) also urge
228 | 4.6: LISTENING CRITICALLY

us to treat the speaker with respect even when we disagree,
don't understand the message, or find the speech boring. This
approach to listening could be considered ethical listening
because it protects and promotes the good of learning, the
good of ideas in the public sphere, and the good of the other
person (Fritz et al., 2023).

   Doug Lippman (1998), a storytelling coach, wrote
powerfully and sensitively about listening in his book:

    Like so many of us, I used to take listening for
    granted, glossing over this step as I rushed into
    the more active, visible ways of being helpful.
    Now, I am convinced that listening is the single
    most important element of any helping
    relationship.

    Listening has great power. It draws thoughts
    and feelings out of people as nothing else can.
    When someone listens to you well, you
    become aware of feelings you may not have
    realized that you felt. You have ideas you may
    have never thought before. You become more
    eloquent, more insightful....

    As a helpful listener, I do not interrupt you. I do
    not give advice. I do not do something else
                                         4.6: LISTENING CRITICALLY | 229

while listening to you. I do not convey
distraction through nervous mannerisms. I do
not finish your sentences for you. In spite of all
my attempts to understand you, I do not
assume I know what you mean.

I do not convey disapproval, impatience, or
condescension. If I am confused, I show a
desire for clarification, not dislike for your
obtuseness. I do not act vindicated when you
misspeak or correct yourself.

I do not sit impassively, withholding
participation.

Instead, I project affection, approval, interest,
and enthusiasm. I am your partner in
communication. I am eager for your imminent
success, fascinated by your struggles, forgiving
of your mistakes, always expecting the best. I
am your delighted listener. (Lippman, 1998)

   Janie Harden Fritz

Listening is not a soft skill. It is a civic responsibility, an ethical
commitment, and the foundation of meaningful
communication. Beyond the podium, listening determines
whether messages build trust or breed misunderstanding.
When we fail to listen, we miss not just words but
opportunities for connection, empathy, and shared meaning.

   As speakers, learning to listen prepares us for more than
polite nods. It shapes how we adapt our words to others, how
we anticipate needs, and how we respond with respect.
Listening is the invisible half of speaking--it completes the

Audience analysis is the process of gathering information
about the people in your audience so that you can understand
their needs, expectations, beliefs, values, attitudes, and likely
opinions. In this chapter, we will first examine some reasons
why audience analysis is important. We will then describe three
different types of audience analysis and some techniques to
use in conducting audience analysis. Finally, we will explain
how you can use your audience analysis not only during the
creation of your speech but also while you are delivering it.

AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

   Angela Pettitt

What is an Audience Analysis?

A communicator, when either writing or speaking, should
be highly motivated to ensure their message is received as
intended by an audience. To do so, it helps to understand
the characteristics that define a given audience and will
affect what an audience is likely to think or understand
about the topic. For instance, a heart surgeon speaking
about the importance of a new screening test for heart
disease should probably use different language to describe
the test when addressing other doctors at a medical
conference than when they are speaking to the general
public at a health expo. The medical field is full of jargon,
specialized language within a closed group, and if the
speaker doesn't adapt to the audience, they may fail to
communicate the benefits and importance of the new test.
An audience of doctors and an audience of potential
patients will also likely be interested in different details
                       5.1: INTRODUCTION TO AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 245

about the test and have different questions the speaker will
need to consider.

   Audience analysis is also important when an audience is
unfamiliar with, skeptical about, or downright hostile
toward the topic. A proposal to ban cell phones in a
school or district is more likely to be immediately
welcomed by teachers and parents, whereas students
might not like the idea of losing access to their phones
throughout the day. Therefore, a speech highlighting the
benefits of the new policy for teachers probably won't be
effective in persuading students. In fact, it may sound
downright insulting to students. If the speaker wants to
elicit student support for the policy, they will have to
think about the policy from students' perspective and
adjust their speech to address students' concerns. In other
words, they need to consider their audience.

   Demographic categories such as race, gender, religion,
sexuality, location, and education level may also impact
how an audience responds to a topic. In the 1990s and
early 2000s, same-sex marriage was a highly controversial
and divisive topic, and a majority of Americans opposed
it. Efforts to persuade people to support gay and lesbian
couples' right to marry utilized a variety of approaches
that considered the perspective of different audiences. For
instance, a speaker might focus on the legal benefits of
marriage when addressing heterosexual couples who
hadn't considered that without the benefit of marriage,
246 | 5.1: INTRODUCTION TO AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

same-sex couples couldn't make medical decisions for their
partners, file joint tax returns, receive health benefits, and
were denied myriad other benefits that married couples
take for granted. Their heterosexual identity sometimes
created a blind spot that prevented them from
understanding why the issue was so important to same-sex
couples. However, that same approach was often not as
effective with people who were motivated by their
religious beliefs. In those cases, it sometimes helped to ask
them to consider various contradictions or outdated edicts
in their religious texts that are no longer relevant today,
such as the acceptance of slavery or death by stoning in the
Bible. By considering the values and perspective of
different demographics, the effort to increase acceptance
of marriage equality was successful, and today, more than
three-quarters of people support it.

Effective communication is based on mutual respect,
which is more easily achieved when a speaker creates a
relationship with their listeners. Scholars Sprague, Stuart,
and Bodary explain, "Speakers do not give speeches to
audiences; they jointly create meaning with audiences"
(Sprague, et al., 2010). The success of a speech rests in
large part on how an audience receives and understands it.
The best way to reduce the risk of offending, alienating, or
even just boring an audience is to conduct an audience
analysis as you prepare your speech.

     The Role of Respect in Communication

    "Speakers do not give speeches to audiences;
    they jointly create meaning with audiences"

Audience analysis is the process of gathering
information about the people in your audience so that
you can understand their needs, expectations, beliefs,
values, attitudes, and likely opinions. In this chapter, we
will first examine some reasons why audience analysis is
250 | 5.1: INTRODUCTION TO AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

important. We will then describe three different types of
audience analysis and some techniques to use in
conducting audience analysis. Finally, we will explain how
you can use your audience analysis not only during the
creation of your speech but also while you are delivering
it.

AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand the value of acknowledging our audience.
 2. Understand how to choose a worthwhile topic.
 3. Explain how to adapt your speech to your audience's

      needs.
 4. Explain the value of speaking with credibility.

Acknowledge the Audience

Picture yourself in front of the audience, about to deliver
your speech. This is the moment when your relationship
with your audience begins, and the quality of this
relationship will influence how receptive they will be to
your ideas, or at least how willing they'll be to listen to
what you have to say. One of the best ways to initiate this
relationship is by finding a way to acknowledge your
audience. This can be as simple as establishing eye contact
and thanking them for coming to hear your presentation.
254 | 5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

If they've braved bad weather, are missing a world-class
sports event, or are putting up with an inconvenience such
as a stuffy conference room, tell them how much you
appreciate their presence in spite of the circumstances.
This can go a long way toward getting them "on board"
with your message.

   For a political candidate who is traveling from town to
town giving what may be perceived as the same campaign
speech time and time again, a statement like "It's great to
be here in Springfield, and I want to thank the West Valley
League of Women Voters and our hosts, the Downtown
Senior Center, for the opportunity to be with you today"
lets the audience know that the candidate has at least
taken the trouble to tailor the speech to the present
audience. Stephanie Coopman and James Lull tell us that
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates often adapts to his
audiences by thanking them for their participation in the
computer industry or for their preparation to participate
in an electronic world. The authors say, "Even those brief
acknowledgments let audience members know that Gates
had prepared his speech with them in mind" (Coopman
& Lull, 2009). We will cover audience acknowledgment
further in Chapter 10.

Tailoring Your Topic

Oftentimes, your topic is semi-determined by your role or
                      5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 255

purpose for speaking in a particular environment. For
instance, if you are a pre-k teacher speaking at an early
education conference, you probably wouldn't choose to
speak about international trafficking or the need to spay
and neuter pets. If you are endorsing a candidate for
office, you will certainly want to speak about something
related to that candidate rather than something outside
the scope of their campaign. However, in both cases, there
are myriad topics you can choose within the boundaries of
what might be relevant, and your selection should reflect
the knowledge, interests, needs, priorities, and values of
your audience. Although there is no universal list of good
or bad topics, you have an ethical responsibility to select a
topic that will be interesting and relevant to your
audience.

   The classroom is no different. As a student delivering a
speech in class, you will likely consider your fellow
students as your audience, and it is important to choose a
topic that is engaging and important to them. Sure, you
might know a lot of detailed, complex, or technical
information about a particular topic, but will your
audience find it impossible to understand? Likewise, you
might be tempted to choose an easy topic that most
people in the audience already know about, but it might
make them feel like you are wasting their time with a
speech that is too obvious or simple. These are easy and
understandable temptations to save time and effort, but
256 | 5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

the result is a speech that doesn't achieve its objective. For
example, if the purpose of your speech is to inform or
persuade students in your public speaking class, topics
such as campus parking problems, the Greek system
(campus fraternities and sororities), or credit card
responsibility may be easy to address, but they probably
reiterate information and perspectives students have
already heard. It will be obvious that you opted for ease
rather than substance. To avoid this trap, seek a topic that
will be novel and interesting both for you and your
audience. You should also conduct some credible research
to ensure that even the most informed audience members
will learn something from you. Consider topics that are
current and emerging. What do you think should be on
students' radar that isn't? What issues are overlooked,
under-represented, or misunderstood? Where can you add
a new perspective to a familiar topic? Topics that add to
an ongoing conversation or that require the audience to
consider new information will be more likely to hold their
interest than something they've heard about time and
time again.

   Keep in mind, your audience will not have the same set
of knowledge that you do. It's important to define any
jargon or terminology that might be unfamiliar to a broad
audience. Your audience analysis will help you consider
how your audience will respond to you, your topic, and
your message.
                      5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 257

Clarity

Nothing is more lamentable than a rhetorical actor who
endeavors to make grandiose the impressions of others
through the utilization of an elephantine albeit
nonsensical argot--a.k.a., nothing is worse than a speaker
who tries to impress the audience with a giant vocabulary
that no one understands. In the first portion of the
preceding sentence, we pulled out as many polysyllabic
words as we could find. Unfortunately, most people will
just find the sentence wordy and the meaning will pass
right over their heads. As such, we as public speakers must
ensure that we are clear in what we say.

   Make sure that you state your topic clearly at the
outset, using words that your audience will understand.
Letting them know what to expect from your speech
shows consideration for them as listeners and lets them
know that you value their time and attention.

   Throughout your speech, define your terms clearly and
carefully in order to avoid misleading or alarming people
by mistake. Be careful not to use jargon or "insider"
language that will exclude listeners who aren't "in the
know." If you approach audience analysis in haste, you
might find yourself presenting a speech with no clear
message. You might avoid making any statements outright
from fear of offending. It is much better to know to
258 | 5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

whom you're speaking and to present a clear, decisive
message that lets listeners know what you think.

   Beyond the Podium Insight: Knowing your audience
isn't flattery. It's ethics. Attending to identities, needs, and
histories signals respect and reduces harm. In classrooms,
councils, and community meetings, analysis helps you
include voices that are often missed.

Controversial Topics Are
Important and Risky

Some of the most interesting topics are controversial.
They are controversial topics because people have deeply
felt values and beliefs about the problem, issue, or
solution, which makes it crucial that you understand the
various facets of the controversy. You will need to
investigate the voices speaking both in favor and against a
particular topic, as well as those proposing alternatives or
compromises to the general pro/con binary. For instance,
many people perceive nuclear energy to be a clean, reliable,
and much needed source of energy. Others say that even
the mining of uranium is harmful to the environment,
that we lack satisfactory solutions for storing nuclear
waste, and that nuclear power plants are vulnerable to
errors and attacks. Another group might view the issue
economically, believing that industry needs nuclear
energy. Engineers might believe that if the national grid
5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 259

could be modernized, we would have enough energy, and

that we should strive to use and waste less energy until

modernization is feasible. Some might feel deep concern

about our reliance on foreign oil. Others might view

nuclear energy as more tried-and-true than other

alternatives. The topic is extremely controversial, and yet

it is interesting and very important. Therefore,

understanding your audience will help you anticipate

arguments and craft a speech that is sensitive to the values

and needs of those listening to you.

Controversial topics are

important to address, but they

require careful research and               Beyond the

problem-solving.     Speech to
                     Audience Needs

                                When preparing a speech for
a classroom audience consisting of other students and
your professor, you may feel that you know their interests
and expectations fairly well. However, we learn public
speaking in order to be able to address all audiences in
hopes we can do some good. In some cases, your audience
might consist of young children who don't care that eggs
are healthier than cereal, because the cereal tastes better. In
other cases, your audience might include retirees living on
fixed incomes who feel another tax increase would be
more burdensome to them than beneficial to the
community.

   Even in an audience that appears to be
homogeneous--composed of people who are very similar
to one another--different listeners will understand the
same ideas in different ways. Every member of every
audience has his or her own frame of reference--the
unique set of perspectives, experience, knowledge, and
values belonging to every individual. An audience
member who has been in a car accident caused by a drunk
driver might not appreciate a lighthearted joke about
barhopping. Similarly, stressing the importance of
graduate school might be discouraging to audience
                      5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 261

members who don't know whether they can even afford
to stay in college to complete an undergraduate degree.

   These examples illustrate why audience analysis--the
process of learning all you reasonably can about your
audience--is so centrally important. Audience analysis
includes consideration of demographic information,
such as the gender, age range, marital status, race,
ethnicity, and socio-economic status of the people in your
audience. And each of these has various sub-groups that
influence how people might respond to a topic. For
instance, socioeconomic status includes a combination of
characteristics such as income, wealth, level of education,
and occupational prestige.

   Race is sometimes linked to religious affiliation and
immigration status. Each of these dimensions give you
some information about which kinds of topics, and which
aspects of various topics, will be well received and which
you might have to work harder to defend.

   Advertisers use this kind of information all the time to
determine how best to reach a particular audience, such as
targeting older generations through TV ads while
tailoring social media ads to appeal to teens. Car
companies are notorious for featuring rugged men hauling
construction equipment in their truck ads, while they
showoff the family-friendly features of minivans with
images of moms juggling kids and groceries. These
examples might seem like clichd stereotypes, but they still
262 | 5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

influence how a communicator attempts to reach a
particular receiver.

   For our purposes, suppose you are preparing to give an
informative speech about early childhood health care. If
your audience is a group of couples who have each
recently had a new baby and who live in an affluent
suburb, you might expect that they will be young adults
with high socioeconomic status, and they will likely be
eager to know about the very best available health care for
their children, whether they are healthy or have various
medical problems. In contrast, if your audience is a group
of nurses, they may differ in age, race, and religion, but
they will be similar in education and occupational
prestige. They will likely know more about the topic than
the new parents, so you will want to find an aspect that
may be unfamiliar to them, such as community health
care resources for families with limited financial resources
or for referring children with special needs. Lastly, if you
are addressing a city council committee that is considering
whether to fund a children's health clinic, your audience is
likely to have very mixed demographics and not everyone
will agree this is a necessary use of public funds.

   Audience analysis also takes into account what market
researchers call psychographic information, which is
more personal and more difficult to predict than
demographics. Psychographic information involves the
beliefs, attitudes, and values that your audience members
                      5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 263

embrace. Respecting your audience means that you avoid
offending, excluding, or trivializing the beliefs and values
they hold. Returning to the topic of early childhood
health care, you can expect new parents to be passionate
about wanting the best for their child. The
psychographics of a group of nurses would revolve around
their professional competence and the need to provide
"standard of care" for their patients. In a city council
committee meeting, the topic of early childhood health
care may be a highly personal and emotional issue for
some of your listeners, while for others it may be strictly a
matter of dollars and cents.

Consider Audience Diversity

Diversity is a key dimension of audience membership and,
therefore, of audience analysis. While the term "diversity"
is often used to refer to racial and ethnic minorities,
audiences can be diverse in many other ways. Being
mindful of diversity means being respectful of all people
and striving to avoid racism, ethnocentrism, sexism,
ageism, elitism, and other prejudicial assumptions.

   The United States is full of social contradictions.
Society today is more racially diverse than it has ever been.
However, people who identify as white still occupy a
disproportionate number of leadership roles in both
government and business, and people of color are more
264 | 5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

likely to face discrimination in employment, housing,
healthcare, and education. While women outnumber men
as both undergraduate and graduate students, they still
earn significantly less in comparable careers, face sexual
harassment in the workplace, and are wildly under-
represented in leadership roles. Members of the LGBTQ
community still endure hostile and even violent reactions
from the members of the general public even as they gain
rights and visibility in broader society. Further, we are
only recently beginning to consider the impact of mental
health and neurodiversity such as Autism Spectrum
Disorder and ADHD on daily life. Taken all together,
every audience likely includes members of various
minority groups that have faced discrimination, prejudice,
dismissal, or neglect and who therefore will appreciate a
speaker who acknowledges and respects them.

   Even when an audience might appear on the surface to
be homogenous, such as the parents group mentioned
earlier, a smart speaker will remember there might be
single parents, or same-sex or interracial couples in the
room who are not always welcome and accepted.
Referring only to "mom and dad" might send the message
that the speaker does not consider alternative families to
be "normal" or "legitimate."

   If a speaker is talking about American history and only
refers to colonists or settlers while ignoring the history of
indigenous people who were already present, or enslaved
                      5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 265

people who did not come willingly, then you are signaling
that the historical record of white, European Americans is
more official than other groups. Audience members who
descended from those other groups will notice and may
feel excluded.

   Consider how women in the audience may feel if a male
speaker at a seminar for first-time homebuyers tries to use
gender stereotypes for humor by routinely "joking" that
"everyone knows" women are difficult, indecisive, or picky
when looking at homes. Chances are, he actively offended
the women in the audience and lost their business with
what he said, but his unspoken stereotype that men are
passive or uninterested in homebuying and/or decorating
will also not be well received by most of the males in the
room.

Invisible differences

While gender, race, and culture may be relatively visible
aspects of diversity, there are many other aspects that are
less obvious, so your audience is often more diverse than
you might initially think. Suppose you are going to give a
talk on pool safety to residents of a very affluent suburban
community--will all your audience members be wealthy?
Of course not. There might be some who are
unemployed, some who are behind on their mortgage
payments, some who live in rented rooms, not to mention
266 | 5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

some who work as babysitters or housekeepers.
Furthermore, even if your listeners have some
characteristics in common, it doesn't mean that they all
think alike. An audience that consists of military families
won't all have identical beliefs about national security, and
members of a Bible study group may have very different
opinions about which parts of the book are most
important.

   This is where the frame of reference becomes important.
People have a wide variety of reasons for making the
choices they make and for doing the things they do. For
instance, a business student knows that profitability is
important but still might have a strong interest in green
lifestyles, low energy use, and alternative energy sources,
areas of economic development that might require a great
deal of investment before profits are realized. In fact, some
business students may want to be involved in a paradigm
shift away from "business as usual."

   These examples illustrate how important it is to use
audience analysis to avoid stereotyping--assuming
people with a certain characteristic in common have the
same likes, dislikes, values, beliefs, interests, and/or
abilities. All members of our audiences deserve to have the
same sensitivity and the same respect extended to them as
unique individuals. Respecting diversity is not merely a
responsibility within public speaking; it should be a
                      5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 267

responsibility we strive to embrace in all our human
interactions.

Avoid Offending Your Audience

It might seem obvious that speakers should use audience
analysis to avoid making offensive remarks, but even very
experienced speakers sometimes forget this basic rule.
Imagine if a white elected official addressing a Latino
audience made a joke about a Mexican American person's
name sounding similar to the name of a popular brand of
tequila. In fact, a state governor did just that in June 2011.
Not surprisingly, news organizations covering the event
reported that the joke fell flat (Shahid, 2011). People are
members of groups they didn't choose and can't change.
We didn't choose our race, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual
orientation, intellectual potential, or appearance. We
already know that jokes aimed at people because of their
membership in these groups are not just politically
incorrect but also ethically wrong.

   Scholars Samovar and McDaniel tell us that ethical
language choices require four guidelines:

 1. Be accurate; present the facts accurately.
 2. Be aware of the emotional impact; make sure that you

      don't manipulate feelings.
 3. Avoid hateful words; refrain from language that
268 | 5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

      disparages or belittles people.
 4. Be sensitive to the audience; know how audience

      members prefer to be identified (e.g., Indigenous instead
      of Indian, women instead of girls, people of color instead
      of colored people, disabled instead of crippled) (Samovar
      & McDaniel, 2007).

If you alienate your audience, they will stop listening.
They will refuse to accept your message, no matter how
true or important it is. They might even become hostile. If
you fail to recognize the complexity of your audience
members and if you treat them as stereotypes, they will
resent your assumptions and doubt your credibility.

Ethical Speaking Is Sincere
Speaking

Ethos is the term Aristotle used to refer to what we now
call credibility: the perception that the speaker is honest,
knowledgeable, and rightly motivated. Your ethos, or
credibility, must be established as you build rapport with
your listeners. Have you put forth the effort to learn who
they are and what you can offer them in your speech? Do
you respect them as individual human beings? Do you
respect their values, history, culture, and experiences?
Do you respect them enough to serve their needs and
interests? Is your topic relevant and appropriate for them?
                     5.2: WHY CONDUCT AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 269

Is your approach honest and sensitive to their preexisting
beliefs? Your ability to answer these questions in a
constructive way must be based on the best demographic
and psychographic information you can use to learn about
your listeners.

   The audience needs to know they can trust the
speaker's motivations, intentions, and knowledge. They
must believe that the speaker has no hidden motives, will
not manipulate or trick them, has their best interests at
heart, and is operating in good faith.

   In order to convey regard and respect for the audience,
you must be sincere. You must examine the motives
behind your topic choice, the true purpose of your speech,
and your willingness to do the work of making sure the
content of the speech is true and represents reality. This
can be difficult for students who face time constraints and
multiple demands on their efforts. However, the attitude
you assume for this task represents, in part, the kind of
professional, citizen, parent, and human being you want
to be. Even if you've given this issue little thought up to
now, you can examine your motives and the integrity of
your research and message construction. Ethically, you
should.

   Audience analysis requires that you adapt to the needs
of your audience; this includes considering cultural
diversity, making your message clear, avoiding offensive
remarks, and speaking with sincerity.

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand how to gather and use demographic
      information.

 2. Understand how to gather and use psychographic
      information.

 3. Understand how to gather and use situational
      information.

While audience analysis does not guarantee against errors
in judgment, it will help you make good choices in topic,
language, style of presentation, and other aspects of your
speech. The more you know about your audience, the
better you can serve their interests and needs. There are
certainly limits to what we can learn through information
collection, and we need to acknowledge that before
making assumptions, but knowing how to gather and use
information through audience analysis is an essential skill
for successful speakers.
                          5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 271

Demographic Analysis

A demographic analysis

requires gathering and analyzing

information on factors such as           AI Insight
gender, age range, marital status,
race and ethnicity, political       Let AI draft a
leanings, locality, and             first-pass
socioeconomic status. In your       audience profile
public speaking class, you          from public data,
probably already know how           but scan for

female, their approximate ages,     nuance from
and so forth. But how can you       interviews,

can ask the person or

organization that has invited you

to speak; it's likely that they can tell you a lot about the

demographics of the people who are expected to be

present. If you are speaking to the general public, you can

gather data on the local population from government

websites such as median income and age, racial

demographics, percent of residents who own versus rent

their home, etc. The information may not be perfect or
272 | 5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

comprehensive, but it will give you some idea of the
people in the area. If you have time for advance planning,
you might be able to conduct a survey to gather specific
information from the attendees themselves.

   Whatever method you use to gather demographics, it's
crucial to exercise respect from the outset. For instance, if
you are collecting information about sexual activity/
orientation, divorce, political opinions, trauma/abuse, or
other sensitive topics, be aware that not everyone will
want to answer your questions. You can't require them to
do so, and you may not make assumptions about their
reluctance to discuss the topic. You must allow them their
privacy.

   Demographic information can provide broad indicators
about a group but it can also lead a speaker to draw
inaccurate conclusions about the audience or reduce them
to stereotypes based on one or two categories. To avoid
this, it's important to use the information to get a sense of
the people likely to be listening to your speech while also
acknowledging the myriad differences within and across
all identity categories.

   Here are some demographic categories, examples of
how they could be helpful, and stereotypes to avoid.

Age

Age allows a speaker to assess the life stage, shared history,
                         5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 273

or cultural touchstones the audience might have in
common. Are they grandparents who remember The
Beatles and Vietnam or Gen Xers who grew up with Star
Wars in the 1970s and 80s? Are they in their 20s and 30s
and perhaps thinking about careers, homeownership, or
starting a family, or are they soon-to-be empty-nesters
with too much space? However, not everyone shares the
same life trajectory or experiences the same events the
same way. Some first-time parents are still teenagers while
others are in their 40s.

Gender

Society teaches us how to navigate the world based on our
gender identity, from how we navigate public space to
which careers we may have been steered toward, to how
we interact with each other. Many occupations still tend
to be highly gendered with leadership positions still
dominated by men (doctor, CEO, pilot, principal) and
subordinate positions held by women (nurse, secretary,
flight attendant, teacher). As children, though, boys
typically face harsher reprisal for breaking even the most
minor gender norms, such as admitting they enjoy
dancing or books with female main characters, which
teaches them to keep their thoughts and interests to
themselves for fear of saying or doing something that
could be construed as feminine by their peers. In
274 | 5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

heterosexual relationships, women often feel more social
pressure to be the primary caregiver while stay-at-home-
dads encounter stigma for freeloading off their wives.
Therefore, using gendered language to refer to specific
roles, jobs, or hobbies (e.g., saying maternity leave instead
of parental leave; she takes ballet and he plays soccer) could
perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Furthermore, gender
norms are also being increasingly challenged as we move
further into the 21st century - and in fact, the concept of
gender as a socially constructed spectrum rather than a
natural binary is gaining wider acceptance. Therefore, it is
important to acknowledge that our gender does not pre-
determine our interests or abilities.

Culture

In past generations, Americans often used the metaphor
of a "melting pot" to symbolize the assimilation of
immigrants from various countries and cultures into a
unified, harmonious "American people." Today, we are
aware of the limitations in that metaphor, and have largely
replaced it with a multiculturalist view that describes the
American fabric as a "patchwork" or a "mosaic." We know
that people who immigrate do not abandon their cultures
of origin to conform to a standard American identity. In
fact, cultural continuity is now viewed as a healthy source
of identity, and elements of various cultures that have
                         5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 275

been adopted into mainstream society have become staples
of mainstream food and society. Further, cultural
membership is also not visibly obvious, despite stereotypes
to the contrary. Physical signifiers such as skin tone,
clothing, hairstyle, or even language are superficial,
imprecise, and rooted in stereotypes. As a speaker, it is
important to trust that people in your audience hail from
different cultural backgrounds, but do not assume you
know what the background might be. Allow them to
share with you (or not) whether they identify as part of a
particular ethnic or cultural group. Differences make each
group interesting and are important sources of
knowledge, perspectives, and creativity.

Religion

There is wide variability in religion as well. Although a
majority of Americans still identify with a major religion
such as Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Islam,
Hinduism, and others, the number of unaffiliated, atheist,
or agnostic people has been growing in recent decades.
Christianity and its various denominations - Catholic,
Protestant, Baptist, Evangelical, etc. - remains the most
common religious affiliation, but since 2007, the percent
of the population who identifies as Christian has dropped
from 78% to 63% as of 2022 (Pew Research Center, 2022).
Even within a given religion, a great deal of diversity can
276 | 5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

be found. For instance, some people are devoutly religious
and attend services regularly while others attend
occasionally or not at all but still subscribe to major tenets
of the faith. Religion can also be tied to cultural identity,
with some people observing Easter, Yom Kippur, or Eid
al-Fitr out of sense of tradition or nostalgia rather than
spirituality. The dimensions of diversity in the religion
demographic are almost endless, and they are not limited
by denomination. Yet, even with these multiple facets,
religion is still a meaningful demographic lens. It can be
an indicator of probable patterns in family relationships,
family size, and moral attitudes.

Group Membership

Fraternities and sororities, sports teams, campus
organizations, political parties, volunteerism, and cultural
communities all have their own set of values, goals,
principles, and codes of ethics, and they provide people
with ways of understanding the world as it is and as we
think it should be. For instance, Scouting BSA, formerly
the Boy Scouts, emphasizes duty, obedience, strength, and
morality, while the Girl Scouts focuses on kindness,
fairness, respect, and stewardship. All are admirable and
honorable traits, but they are intentionally not identical as
each group wants to promote a slightly different set of
values to its members. Those differences will therefore
                         5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 277

potentially impact how an audience of former Boy or Girl
Scouts respond to a particular topic.

   Because public speaking audiences are often attending a
speaking event as part of a group affiliation, this
demographic category can be a useful and often easy way
to access a facet of audience analysis. The more you know
about the associations of your audience members, the
better prepared you will be to tailor your speech to their
interests, expectations, and needs.

Education

Higher education is often credited with providing a
"general education" that ensures exposure to a broad array
of ideas and subjects, along with a narrow focus on a
major in preparation for a career in a specific field. The
trades often provide highly technical job training but less
general education. And post-graduate work such as law,
medical, or graduate school, allows advanced and/or
specialized study in a particular field. However, making
assumptions about a person or group based on whether or
not they went to college is no less rooted in stereotypes
than assumptions based on race or gender. As with other
categories, an audience is likely to include people with
various educational backgrounds unless you are speaking
to a very specific group such as psychiatrists, lawyers,
accountants - or college students.
278 | 5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

Occupation

Occupation can give you a sense of what information your
audience might or might not know. Doctors and nurses
will understand medical jargon that others might not.
Farmers might laugh at a joke about the weather that
investment bankers don't get. Trade workers are more
likely to belong to a union than retail workers. But there
are also many misconceptions about most occupations.
For instance, many people believe that teachers work an
eight-hour day and have summers off. But the truth is they
take work home with them during evenings and
weekends, and in the summer, they may teach summer
school or take courses to keep up with new developments
in their fields. Learning about those occupational realities
is important in avoiding wrong assumptions and
stereotypes.

Psychographic Analysis

Psychographic analysis involves learning about such
things as values, opinions, attitudes, and beliefs, which
often cannot be extrapolated from demographic
information. Authors Grice and Skinner present a model
in which values are the basis for beliefs, attitudes, and
behaviors (Grice & Skinner, 2009). They say, "A value
expresses a judgment of what is desirable and undesirable,
                         5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 279

right and wrong, or good and evil. Values are usually
stated in the form of a word or phrase. For example, most
of us probably share the values of equality, freedom,
honesty, fairness, justice, good health, and family. These
values compose the principles or standards we use to judge
and develop our beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors." People
often inherit values from their family upbringing, cultural
influences, and life experiences. The extent to which
someone values family loyalty and obedience to parents,
thrift, humility, and work may be determined by these
influences more than by individual choice.

   It is important to recognize that, while demographic
information is fairly straightforward and verifiable,
psychographic information is much less clear-cut. Two
people of the same age, religion, and occupation may both
say they believe in equal educational opportunity but may
have very different interpretations of what "equal
opportunity" means. People who say they don't buy junk
food may have very different standards for what specific
kinds of foods are considered "junk food."

   Psychographic analysis can reveal preexisting notions
that limit your audience's frame of reference. By knowing
about such notions ahead of time, you can address them
in your speech. Audiences are likely to have two basic
kinds of preexisting notions: those about the topic and
those about the speaker.
280 | 5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

Preexisting Notions about Your
Topic

Many things are a great deal more complex than we realize.
Media stereotypes often contribute to our
oversimplifications. For instance, a student claims that
"the hippies meant well, but they did it wrong." Aside
from the question of the "it" that was done wrong, there
was a question about how little the student actually knew
about the diverse hippie cultures and their aspirations.
The student seemed unaware that some of "the hippies"
were the forebears of such things as organic bakeries,
natural food co-ops, urban gardens, recycling, alternative
energy, wellness, and other arguably positive
developments.

   It's important to know your audience in order to make
a rational judgment about how their views of your topic
might be shaped. In speaking to an audience that might
have differing definitions, you should take care to define
your terms in a clear, honest way.

   At the opposite end from oversimplification is the level
of sophistication your audience might embody. Your
audience analysis should include factors that reveal it.
Suppose you are speaking about trends in civil rights in
the United States. You cannot pretend that advancement
of civil rights is virtually complete nor can you claim that
no progress has been made. It is likely that in a college
                          5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 281

classroom, the audience will know that although much
progress has been made, there are still pockets of
prejudice, discrimination, and violence. When you speak
to an audience that is cognitively complex, your strategy
must be different from one you would use for an audience
that is less educated in the topic. With a cognitively
complex audience, you must acknowledge the overall
complexity while stating that your focus will be on only
one dimension. With an audience that's uninformed
about your topic, that strategy in a persuasive speech
could confuse them; they might well prefer a black-and-
white message with no gray areas. You must decide
whether it is ethical to represent your topic this way.

   When you prepare to do your audience analysis,
include questions that reveal how much your audience
already knows about your topic. Try to ascertain the
existence of stereotyped, oversimplified, or prejudiced
attitudes about it. This could make a difference in your
choice of topic or in your approach to the audience and
topic.

Preexisting Notions about You

People form opinions readily. For instance, students form
impressions of teachers the moment they walk into the
classroom on the first day. They get an immediate
impression of their teacher's age, competence, and
282 | 5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

attitude simply from appearance and nonverbal behavior.
In addition, many have heard the opinions of previous
students who were in the class.

   The same will be true for you when you walk into a
speaking environment. But it's not always easy to get
honest feedback about others' impressions of you,
especially if your audience is unfamiliar. You might be
aware that your friends think of you as a jock, or a nature
lover, or as someone who is too uptight, and so on. But it's
harder to assess someone's first impression of you in a
formal, short-term setting like a meeting or lecture.
Therefore, your concern should be serving your
audience's needs and interests, not debunking their
opinions of you or managing your image. In order to help
them be receptive, you address their interests directly, and
make sure they get an interesting, ethical speech.

Situational Analysis

The next type of analysis is called the situational
audience analysis because it focuses on characteristics
related to a specific topic, issue, event, occasion,
movement, or group or people. The situational audience
analysis can be divided into two main questions:

 1. How many people are in the audience, and why are they
      here? What events, concerns, and needs motivated them
                         5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 283

      to come? What is their interest level, and what else might
      be competing for their attention?
 2. What is the physical environment of the speaking
      situation? What is the size and layout of the room? Is
      there a podium, microphone, and digital media for
      visual aids? Is there room to walk around? Are there any
      distractions such as traffic noise? Are people seated at
      round tables or in rows of chairs? Is it stadium seating or
      flat? How are the acoustics?

Occasion

There are many occasions for speeches. Awards
ceremonies, conventions and conferences, holidays, and
other celebrations are some examples. However, there are
also less joyful reasons for a speech, such as funerals,
disasters, and the delivery of bad news. As always, there are
likely to be mixed reactions. For instance, award
ceremonies are good for community and institutional
morale, but some listeners who feel deserving but were
overlooked might be resentful. Likewise, a speech
announcing bad news is likely to cause some listeners to
feel grateful the bad news wasn't even worse. If your
speech is to deliver bad news, it's important to be honest
but also to avoid traumatizing your audience. For
instance, a condominium board member speaking to
residents after the building was damaged by a hurricane
284 | 5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

will need to provide accurate data about the extent of the
damage and the anticipated cost and time required for
repairs. At the same time, it would be needlessly upsetting
to launch into a graphic description of injuries suffered by
people, animals, and property in neighboring areas not
connected to the condominium complex.

   Some of the most successful speeches benefit from
situational analysis to identify audience concerns related
to the occasion. For example, when the president of the
United States gives the annual State of the Union address,
the occasion calls for commenting on the condition of the
nation and outlining the legislative agenda for the coming
year. The speech could be a formality that would interest
only "policy wonks," but with a good situational audience
analysis, it could be a popular event reinforcing the
connection between the president and the American
people. In January 2011, knowing that the United States'
economy was slowly recovering and that jobless rates were
still very high, President Barack Obama and his staff knew
that the focus of the speech had to be on jobs. Similarly, in
January 2003, President George W. Bush's State of the
Union speech focused on the "war on terror" and his
reasons justifying the invasion of Iraq. If you look at the
history of State of the Union Addresses, you'll often find
that the speeches are tailored to the political, social, and
economic situations facing the United States at those
times.
                         5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 285

Voluntariness of Audience

A voluntary audience gathers because they want to hear
the speech, attend the event, or participate in an event. A
classroom audience, in contrast, is likely to be a captive
audience. Captive audiences are required to be present
or feel obligated to do so. Given the limited choices
perceived, a captive audience might give only grudging
attention. Even when there's an element of choice, the
likely consequences of nonattendance will keep audience
members from leaving. The audience's relative perception
of choice increases the importance of holding their
interest.

   Whether or not the audience members chose to be
present, you want them to be interested in what you have
to say. Almost any audience will be interested in a topic
that pertains directly to them. However, your audience
might also be receptive to topics that are indirectly or
potentially pertinent to their lives. This means that if you
choose a topic such as advances in the treatment of spinal
cord injury or advances in green technology, you should
do your best to show how these topics are potentially
relevant to their lives or careers.

   However, there are some topics that appeal to audience
curiosity even when it seems there's little chance of direct
pertinence. For instance, topics such as Blackbeard the
pirate or ceremonial tattoos among the Maori might
286 | 5.3: THREE TYPES OF AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

pique the interests of various audiences. Depending on
the instructions you get from your instructor, you can
consider building an interesting message about something
outside the daily foci of our attention.

Physical Setting

The physical setting can make or break even the best
speeches, so it is important to exercise as much control as
you can over it. In your classroom, conditions might not
be ideal, but at least the setting is familiar. Still, you know
your classroom from the perspective of an audience
member, not a speaker standing in the front--which is
why you should seek out any opportunity to rehearse your
speech during a minute when the room is empty. If you
will be giving your presentation somewhere else, it is a
good idea to visit the venue ahead of time if at all possible
and make note of any factors that will affect how you
present your speech. In any case, be sure to arrive well in
advance of your speaking time so that you will have time
to check that the microphone works, to test out any visual
aids, and to request any needed adjustments in lighting,
room ventilation, or other factors to eliminate distractions
and make your audience more comfortable.

Now that we have described what audience analysis is and
why it is important, let's examine some ways you can learn
about the people who will make up your audience.

Direct Observation

One way to learn about people is direct observation. By
critically observing nonverbal patterns of behavior,
appearance, and group composition, you can learn a great
                             5.4: CONDUCTING AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 289

deal as long as you are careful how you interpret the
behaviors. For instance, do people greet each other with a
handshake, a hug, a smile, or a nod? Do men and women
interact or tend to congregate in their own groups? Is the
audience racially/ethnically diverse or mostly
homogenous? Are people dressed formally or casually?
Who seems to be missing or left out? By simply being
observant, you can gather useful information about the
people present. Also, by reading local news, talking to
people, and listening to public conversations (not
eavesdropping!), you can find out the issues that concern
people. Are people in the campus center talking about
political unrest in Washington? About concerns over
student loan debt? The economy, wages?

Interviews and Surveys

                    sometimes conducted face-to-

face or by phone, but online surveys are increasingly

common. You may collect and tabulate survey results

manually, or set up an automated online survey through

the free or subscription portals of sites like SurveyMonkey

and Google Forms. Using an online survey provides the

advantage of keeping responses anonymous, which may

increase your audience members' willingness to participate

and to answer personal questions. Surveys are an efficient

way to collect information quickly; however, in contrast

to interviews, they don't allow for follow-up questions to

help you understand why your respondent gave a certain

answer.

When you use interviews and surveys, there are several

important things to keep in mind:
                              5.4: CONDUCTING AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 291

   Make sure your interview and survey questions are
      directly related to your speech topic. Do not use
      interviews to delve into private areas of people's lives. For
      instance, if your speech is about funding models for
      public education, limit your questions to their opinions
      about that topic; do not meander into their beliefs about
      sexual behavior or their personal religious practices.

   Create and use a standard set of questions. If you "ad
      lib" your questions so that they are phrased differently
      for different interviewees, you will be comparing "apples
      and oranges" when you compare the responses you've
      obtained.

   Keep interviews and surveys short, or you could alienate
      your audience long before your speech is even outlined.
      Tell them the purpose of the interview or survey and
      make sure they understand that their participation is
      voluntary.

Don't assume a few respondents accurately represent the
views of your entire audience. To accurately identify
trends, you will need to follow formal guidelines for
statistical analysis. However, informal data gathering can
still be useful as it provides insight into the opinions and
perspectives that are circulating through the audience.

   In addition, when you conduct interviews and surveys,
keep in mind that people are sometimes less than honest
in describing their beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. This
292 | 5.4: CONDUCTING AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

widely recognized weakness of interviews and survey
research is known as socially desirable responding: the
tendency to give responses that are considered socially
acceptable. Marketing professor Ashok Lalwani divides
socially desirable responding into two types: (1)
impression management, or intentionally portraying
oneself in a favorable light and (2) self-deceptive
enhancement, or exaggerating one's good qualities, often
unconsciously (Lalwani, 2009).

   You can reduce the effects of socially desirable
responding by choosing your questions carefully. As
marketing consultant Terry Vavra advises, "one should
never ask what one can't logically expect respondents to
honestly reveal" (Vavra, 2009). For example, if you want to
know audience members' attitudes about body piercing,
you are likely to get more honest answers by asking "Do
you think body piercing is attractive?" rather than "How
many piercings do you have and where on your body are
they located?"

Focus Groups

A focus group is a small group of people who give you
feedback about their perceptions. As with interviews and
surveys, in a focus group you should use a limited list of
carefully prepared questions designed to get at the
                              5.4: CONDUCTING AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 293

information you need to understand their beliefs,
attitudes, and values specifically related to your topic.

   If you conduct a focus group, part of your task will be
striking a balance between allowing the discussion to flow
freely according to what group members have to say and
keeping the group focused on the questions. It's also your
job to guide the group in maintaining responsible and
respectful behavior toward each other.

   In evaluating focus group feedback, do your best to be
receptive to what people had to say, whether or not it
conforms to what you expected. Your purpose in
conducting the group is to understand group members'
beliefs, attitudes, and values about your topic, not to
confirm your assumptions.

Using Existing Data about Your
Audience

Occasionally, existing information will be available about
your audience. For instance, if you have a student
audience, it might not be difficult to find out what their
academic majors are. You might also be able to find out
their degree of investment in their education; for instance,
you could reasonably assume that the seniors in the
audience have been successful students who have invested
at least three years pursuing a higher education.
Sophomores have at least survived their first year but may
294 | 5.4: CONDUCTING AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

not have matched the seniors in demonstrating strong
values toward education and the work ethic necessary to
earn a degree.

   Other audiences might include veterans, retired
teachers, single parents, or members of a voluntary civic
organization such as the Lions Club or Mothers Against
Drunk Driving (MADD). This kind of information
should help you respond to their concerns and interests.

   In other cases, you may be able to use demographics
collected by public and private organizations.
Demographic analysis is done by the U.S. Census Bureau
through the American Community Survey, which is
conducted every year, and through other specialized
demographic surveys (Bureau of the Census, 2011). The
Census Bureau analysis generally captures information
about people in all the regions of the United States, but
you can drill down in census data to see results by state, by
age group, by gender, by race, and by other factors.

   Demographic information about narrower segments of
the United States, down to the level of individual zip
codes, is available through private organizations such as
The U.S. Census, National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES), Sperling's Best Places
(www.bestplaces.net), and City-Data.com. Sales and
marketing professionals use this data, and you may find it
useful for your audience analysis as well.

5.5: USING YOUR
AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

   Angela Pettitt

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand how you can use your audience analysis
      when you prepare a speech.

 2. Recognize how your audience analysis can help you alter
      your speech while speaking.

A good audience analysis takes time, thought,
preparation, implementation, and processing. If done
well, it will yield information that will help you interact
effectively with your audience. Professional speakers,
corporate executives, sales associates, and entertainers all
rely on audience analysis to connect with their listeners.
So do political candidates, whose chances of gaining votes
depend on crafting the message and mood to appeal to
each specific audience. One audience might be
preoccupied with jobs, another with property taxes, and
another with crime. Similarly, your audience analysis
should help you identify the interests of your audience.
298 | 5.5: USING YOUR AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

Ultimately, a successful audience analysis can guide you in
preparing the basic content of your speech and help you
adjust your speech "on the fly."

Prepare Content with Your
Audience in Mind

The first thing a good audience analysis can do is help you
focus your content for your specific audience. If you are
planning to deliver a persuasive speech on why people
should become vegans and you find out through analysis
that half of your audience is daughters and sons of cattle
ranchers, you need to carefully think through your
approach to the content. Maybe you'll need to tweak your
topic to focus on just the benefits of veganism without
trying to persuade the audience explicitly. The last thing
you want to do as a speaker is stand before an audience
that is suspicious or critical of your topic before you ever
open your mouth. While there will always be some
naysayers in any audience, if you think through your topic
with your audience in mind, you may be able to find a
topic that will be both interesting to you as a speaker and
beneficial to your audience as well.

   In addition to adjusting the topic of your speech prior
to the speaking event, you can also use your audience
analysis to help ensure that the content of your speech will
be as clear and understandable as humanly possible.
                               5.5: USING YOUR AUDIENCE ANALYSIS | 299

   One area of clarity to be aware of is the use of idioms
your audience may not know. An idiom is a word or
phrase where the meaning cannot be predicted from
normal, dictionary definitions. Many idioms are culturally
or temporally based. For example, the phrase "according
to Hoyle" indicates that something is done "by the book"
or "by the rules," as in "These measurements aren't
according to Hoyle, but they're close enough to give a
general idea." Most of us have no clue who Hoyle was or
what this idiom means. It refers to Edmond Hoyle, who
wrote some of the most popular card-playing rule books
back in the 1700s in England. Today, card game
enthusiasts may understand the intent of "according to
Hoyle," but for most people, it no longer carries specific
meaning. When thinking about your speech, be careful
not to accidentally use idioms that you find commonplace
but your audience may not.

Adjusting Your Speech Based on
Your Analysis

In addition to using audience analysis to help formulate
speech content, we can also use our audience analysis to
make adjustments during the actual speech. These
adjustments can pertain to the audience and to the
physical setting.

   The feedback you receive from your audience during
300 | 5.5: USING YOUR AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

your speech is a valuable indication of ways to adjust your

presentation. If you're speaking after lunch and notice

audience members looking drowsy, you can make

adjustments to liven up the tone of your speech. You

could use humor. You could raise your voice slightly. You

could pose some questions and ask for a show of hands to

get your listeners actively involved. As another example,

you may notice from frowns and headshaking that some

listeners aren't convinced by the arguments you are

presenting. In this case, you could spend more time on a

specific area of your speech and provide more evidence

than you originally intended. Good speakers can learn a

lot by watching their audience while speaking and then

make specific adjustments to both the content and

delivery of the speech to enhance the speech's ultimate

impact.

5.6: CONCLUSION:
AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

   Angela Pettitt

Audience analysis is more than a checklist. It is an ethical
commitment to see people as more than data points or
stereotypes. When you analyze your audience, you are not
just tailoring words, you are honoring the humanity,
diversity, and lived experiences of those who listen. This
respect transforms speeches from performances into acts of
dialogue and relationship-building.

   Beyond the podium, the practice of audience analysis
challenges us to become more empathetic communicators
in every context, such as at work, in communities, and
in our personal lives. Listening carefully, acknowledging
difference, and adapting our message are not simply public
speaking skills. They are civic virtues that strengthen trust
and connection.

   As you move into the next chapter, remember that
choosing a topic is never just about what you want to say. It
is about aligning purpose with audience, identifying what
matters to them, and crafting a message that brings people
304 | 5.6: CONCLUSION: AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

together. Audience analysis is the bridge that helps you
find not only your topic but also your relevance.

          Key Takeaways

           Audience analysis aligns your message with
             real people--their identities, needs, and
             contexts.

           Use three lenses: demographics (who they
             are), psychographics (what they value), and
             situational factors (why they're here, where
             you're speaking).

           Blend methods: observe, interview/survey,
             focus groups, and existing data--plus AI for
             speed (then verify).

           Design and adapt: plan with the data, watch
             the room, and adjust content and delivery in
             real time.

           Ethical communication means clarity,
             inclusion, and avoiding stereotypes; credibility
             grows from sincere audience care.

The Research Process: A Journey
of Discovery

Why is research important?

Academic research is essential because it cultivates critical
thinking and problem-solving abilities, which are vital for
understanding and addressing complex issues in the world. It
provides a structured approach to exploring new ideas,
validating existing knowledge, and contributing to the
collective understanding of various phenomena. Engaging in
research allows individuals to move beyond surface-level
comprehension, fostering a deeper appreciation for evidence-
based reasoning and intellectual rigor.
                                                   6.1: WHAT IS RESEARCH? | 311

What is academic research?

Academic research is a journey of discovery, extending beyond
just information gathering. It's a cyclical process involving
several key stages: identifying a topic, reviewing existing
literature, developing research questions, choosing a research
method, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions,
and sharing findings. Students in a public speaking class often
undertake research collaboratively or independently,
developing critical skills such as problem-solving and building
confidence that will be highly valued by employers. Research
is driven by curiosity and acts as a catalyst for understanding
in diverse fields, including AI ethics, climate science, and
mental health. Through research, we gain clarity, depth, and
ultimately, new knowledge, which can then inspire further
inquiry. (Mitra & Wagner, 2021; Bustillo, et. al., 2023)

Why is Identifying a Topic Important?

Identifying a topic for your speech is the first step because it
lays the groundwork for the entire research process. A well-
defined topic prevents the researcher from getting lost in a sea
of information. It determines what literature will be reviewed,
what questions will be asked, and what methods will be
employed. Without a clear topic, research efforts would be
aimless, inefficient, and likely lead to inconclusive or irrelevant
findings. Essentially, it's the compass that guides the journey
312 | 6.1: WHAT IS RESEARCH?

of discovery, ensuring the research remains relevant,
manageable, and ultimately, contributes meaningfully to
existing knowledge. To make your research project personally
meaningful, select a topic relevant to your academic major.

   Computer Science students might explore artificial
      intelligence, cybersecurity, or data analytics.

   Business students could investigate management
      practices, sustainable business, or consumer behavior.

   Criminal Justice students might research best practices
      in law enforcement, cybercrime, or racial disparities
      within the justice system.

   Psychology majors could study topics such as
      depression, online behaviors, or factors contributing to
      happiness.

Wrap-up: A strong literature review anchors your ideas
within existing scholarship, ensuring your work adds to--not
repeats--the conversation.

Developing Research Questions

Developing a good research question is important because it
serves as an anchor for the entire research part of your speech.
A well-formulated question provides clarity and precision,
defining the exact scope and focus of the study. It dictates
what specific information needs to be gathered, what
methodology is most appropriate, and how the collected data
                                                   6.1: WHAT IS RESEARCH? | 315

will be analyzed and interpreted. Without a clear and focused
research question, the research can become unfocused,
inefficient, and fail to generate meaningful or actionable
insights, ultimately hindering its ability to contribute new
knowledge or address a specific problem effectively. (Lim,
Wong, and Visessuvanapoom., 2024)

   Effective research questions narrow your topic to its core
and guide your entire research process. For example, if you're
interested in how students use AI in English classes, your
central question could be: "How do students use AI to
develop their papers for English classes?"

   Follow-up questions can further refine your inquiry:

   "What part of the writing process do you use AI for:
      brainstorming, information gathering, rough drafts,
      and/or final drafts?"

   "Do you use ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google
      Gemini, Ask AI, or another platform?"

   "How do you feel when you use AI to assist you with
      English papers?"

Consider your research questions as the foundational topics
for the different sections of your speech as the answers you
gather will form these sections. (Goldschmidt & Matthews,
2022)

discoveries.

                   Qualitative studies explore in-

                  depth understanding and rich

descriptions. While numbers provide part of the story,

incorporating qualitative elements like essays, short-

answer questions, and interviews can offer deeper

insights and perspectives. (Barroga & Matanguihan,

2022)
                                                   6.1: WHAT IS RESEARCH? | 317

Choosing a Research Method:
Surveys and Interviews

For class assignments, studying responses from your
classmates through surveys and interviews is typically
acceptable. However, for research conducted outside of a class
setting, you must obtain approval from your institution's
Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB ensures that your
research adheres to ethical guidelines.

   Surveys: Surveys are a systematic method for collecting
data (facts, figures, or opinions) from a sample to understand
the broader population. Survey administration has evolved
significantly. While postal surveys often have low response
rates, online platforms provide sophisticated and cost-effective
ways to reach diverse audiences, though securing participation
can still be a challenge. Face-to-face surveys tend to yield
higher completion rates within specific communities, and
mobile-based survey applications are also popular. (Hadler,
2025; Kraft and Shah, 2021; Lim, 2022)

What to Consider When Designing a
Survey.

   "Do you know what you want to ask?" Clear and
      well-defined research questions are crucial for obtaining
      usable data; ambiguous questions lead to unclear results.

   "Do you really need to collect data?" With vast online
318 | 6.1: WHAT IS RESEARCH?

      resources available, ensure the information you seek isn't
      already readily accessible or that your study expands
      upon existing research.
   "Do your participants know the information you
      want to find out, or if they do know, will they tell
      you?" Be cognizant and mindful of privacy concerns
      and data sensitivity. Intrusive questions are unlikely to
      elicit honest responses. Also, consider digital literacy and
      access to your target population to ensure equitable
      participation.
   "Is your goal generalizable?" In our diverse and
      interconnected world, it is important to ensure
      representation across demographics, considering
      socioeconomic status, cultural background, and
      technological access. Your surveyed population should
      be large enough to represent the population you are
      studying. (Hadler, 2025; Kraft and Shah, 2021; Lim,
      2022)

Interviews: Interviews, whether one-on-one or in focus
groups, provide rich qualitative data through direct
conversation. The interviewer's ability to ask follow-up
questions allows for deeper exploration of perspectives.

   You may be instructed to interview a professor or student
at your institution who is knowledgeable about the subject
you are studying. While in-person interviews remain valuable,
video conferencing offers a convenient and cost-effective way
                                                   6.1: WHAT IS RESEARCH? | 319

to reach participants globally. However, be mindful of
technological barriers and ensure equitable access.

   Choose interview participants who can best help answer
your research questions. For example, if you are preparing a
speech on fostering innovation in student startups,
interviewing successful student entrepreneurs and conducting
focus groups with those who faced difficulties can provide
valuable firsthand qualitative data to strengthen your
recommendations. (Taherdoost, 2022)

   After your interview, remember to code the answers you
received to correspond with your research questions. Coding
means connecting your research questions with the
information you have discovered. This connection between
research questions and collected data simplifies analysis and
conclusion drawing. (Knott et al., 2022)

Analyzing Data and Drawing
Conclusions

   After collecting survey and           Beyond the
interview data, organize your       Podium Insight
results by separating quantitative
and qualitative data. Then,         Information
employ various analysis methods,
such as descriptive statistics and
hypothesis testing, to draw
meaningful conclusions. Finally,

                   present your findings clearly and

                   the standard deviation. Advanced

                   survey software like Qualtrics

often provides this information automatically.

(Qualtrics)

 Hypothesis Testing: After analyzing your data, test

your hypothesis. Did the study confirm your

expectations? Did it support a null hypothesis that was

the opposite of what you expected? Or did it reveal

something entirely unexpected or an alternate

hypothesis? (Pugh and Milinaro, 2016)

Research transcends simply answering questions; it often
unveils unexpected perspectives and fosters intellectual
growth. The research process frequently leads to surprising
ideas and facts that reshape our understanding of a topic. This
is evident in fields like quantum computing, space
exploration, and personalized medicine. Research can ignite

Wrap-up: Every research journey follows this rhythm.
Understanding where you are in the cycle helps you stay
organized and purposeful.

Discovery, Revision, and
Reporting

Let's examine research through the lens of discovery, revision,
and reporting of resulting theories and applications.

   Discovery: Discovery in research involves exploring topics,
testing ideas, analyzing evidence, and uncovering entirely new
knowledge. A prime example is Alexander Fleming's 1928
322 | 6.1: WHAT IS RESEARCH?

discovery of penicillin, the first antibiotic, which
revolutionized medicine and saved countless lives. (Gaynes,
2017) Similarly, the discoveries of insulin for diabetes and
chemotherapy for cancer patients have significantly extended
lives. (Vecchio, 2018)

   Revision: Revising research means improving upon or
building existing knowledge. For instance, researchers
leveraged previous vaccine studies of SARS-CoV, MERS-
CoV, and other viruses to accelerate the development of
COVID-19 vaccines. Wilhelm Roentgen's discovery of X-
rays, through experiments with cathode ray tubes, was built
upon existing knowledge of electricity and radiation.
(Brakefield et al., 2022)

   Reporting: Reporting involves gathering and sharing
information, enabling others to learn from research. Many
researchers publish their findings in academic journals or
books within their field. There's also a growing trend of
researchers publishing their findings in Open Educational
Resources, making them accessible to everyone. Additionally,
researchers often present their findings at conferences,
frequently through poster sessions. (Cheung, 2023; Neylon et
al., 2021)
                                                   6.1: WHAT IS RESEARCH? | 323

Facts, Theories, and Applications:
The Results of Research

Facts: Facts are verified; measurable truths are established
through rigorous investigation.

   The distance from Earth to the Moon is approximately
      238,900 miles.

   The Mariana Trench reaches a depth of about 36,000
      feet (11,000 meters).

   Mount Everest's height is 8,848.86 meters (29,031 feet
      8+1/2 inches).

Theories: Theories are foundational frameworks that explain
phenomena, guiding future research and expanding scientific
understanding. In technology, current theories are rapidly
evolving around the possibilities and limitations of
autonomous AI and the diverse applications of Virtual
Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). Researchers
actively work to understand, challenge, or support existing
theories. (Abreu & Stiles, 2024; AlGerafi, 2023)

   A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of the
natural world, built on extensive evidence and repeated
testing. Scientists rigorously examine theories under diverse
conditions, striving to replicate findings and identify
limitations. For instance, the enduring theory of universal
gravitation not only describes phenomena like keys falling
324 | 6.1: WHAT IS RESEARCH?

from a table but also delves into how it happens. Physicists
continue to explore quantum gravity and other models for a
more complete understanding. Ongoing research at facilities
like LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory) and the James Webb Telescope constantly
refines our grasp of gravity and the universe. From a
researcher's perspective, science is an ever-evolving field,
continually adapting in the face of new knowledge. (James
Webb Telescope; Cal Tech, 2025; NASA, 2025; LIGO;
Sutton & Staw, 1995)

   Applications: Applications are the real-world tools and
solutions derived from research, encompassing new
medicines, technologies, and practices. Researchers frequently
seek innovative uses for existing substances. Take botulism,
for example. Once a dreaded bacterium that caused
widespread food poisoning and many deaths in the U.S., its
perception shifted dramatically. In the 1980s,
ophthalmologist Allan Scott began using a modified version
of botulism to treat muscle spasms, resulting in the drug
Onabotulinumtoxin A--better known as Botox (Williamson,
2011). In 1989, plastic surgeon Richard Clark reported that
the drug also had the surprising side effect of decreasing
wrinkles (Clark & Berris, 1989). Today, Botox treats a wide
range of medical conditions, from chronic migraines to
overactive bladder, and ongoing research is exploring even
more potential uses. (Mayo Clinic, 2025) This exemplifies the
continuous evolution of scientific discovery.

SECONDARY SOURCES

   Analysis or interpretation of primary sources
   Research Relies on two types of sources: Primary and

      Secondary

Primary sources are first-hand accounts or original materials
directly from the time or event being studied. They offer
direct evidence and haven't been interpreted or analyzed by
anyone else. Think of them as raw data or original expressions.

   Examples include:

   Historical documents: Diaries, letters, government
      records, birth certificates, trial transcripts, speeches,
      original manuscripts.

   Creative works: Novels, poems, paintings, sculptures,
      musical compositions, films (if you're analyzing the
      work itself).

   Research data: Results of experiments, statistical data,
      surveys, field notes.

   Eyewitness accounts: Autobiographies, memoirs, oral
      histories, newspaper reports written by reporters who
      witnessed an event.

   Artifacts: Clothing, tools, photographs, physical objects
      from a specific time.

332 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

      integrate them ethically.

Research Strategy

In the previous section, we discussed what research is and the
difference between primary and secondary sources. In this
section, we are going to explore how to develop a research
strategy. Think of a research strategy as your personal map.
The end destination is the actual speech, and along the way,
there are various steps you need to complete to reach your
destination: the speech. From the day you receive your speech
assignment, the more clearly you map out the steps you need
to take leading up to the date when you will give the speech,
the easier your speech development process will be (Tajvidi,
2015). In the rest of this section, we are going to discuss time
management, determining your research needs, finding your
sources, and evaluating your sources.

Allotting Time

When starting any new project, big or small, a critical first step
is to accurately estimate the time commitment. This is
especially true for tasks like speech preparation, where
deadlines are often set. Let's break down the process using a
project life cycle approach, adapted for your academic reality.
The moment your instructor assigns a speech, the clock starts
                           6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 333

ticking. Every day without progress is a day of lost
opportunity for a polished presentation. We get it -- college
life is packed with classes, family, jobs, friends, and social
engagements. That's why smart time management for both
research and speech development is so important. (Patzak,
2025; Project Management Institute, 2024; Wolters and
Brady, 2021)

Research Time

Research often consumes a significant portion of your
preparation. Whether you're gathering primary data or
relying on secondary sources, expect to dedicate ample time to
this phase. Think of research as an iterative process, not a one-
and-done task. As your speech evolves, you might uncover
new questions or realize you need additional information to
strengthen the point. Always allow some buffer time for
follow-up research. Don't forget about research librarians!
They're invaluable resources with tips and tricks to streamline
your search. However, librarians have busy schedules, so
proactively book an appointment once you have your initial
questions mapped out. A good rule of thumb is to dedicate
no more than one-third of your total speech preparation time
to research. For example, if you have three weeks, aim to wrap
up your research by the end of the first week. Neglecting this
balance can lead to a last-minute scramble to write your
334 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

speech, which is highly inadvisable. (Browne, 2013; Landry et
al., 2024)

        beyondthepodium/?p=721#h5p-48

Wrap-up: Time management transforms stress into structure.
The sooner you plan, the more confident your final
presentation will feel.

Speech Preparation Time

The second major phase is crafting your speech. This is where
you transform your research into a cohesive and compelling
presentation. You'll be building arguments, integrating
evidence, and potentially designing visual aids. Give yourself
sufficient time for this crucial stage. A common guideline is to
allocate one day of preparation for every minute of speaking
                           6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 335

time. Being sure to build in a time buffer also provides a safety
net for unexpected life events. Things happen, and unforeseen
circumstances can derail your progress. Having extra
preparation time protects you from these disruptions and
ensures you can still deliver a high-quality speech. Finally,
there's practice. This means actively rehearsing your speech
aloud. Simply scripting or mentally reviewing your speech
isn't enough. Research shows that speakers who practice
orally are more aligned with their intended delivery when
presenting. This dedicated practice time helps you become
comfortable not only with your speech's content but also
with your nonverbal delivery. (Hartelius, 2018)

Determining Your Needs

Before diving into research, define your objectives. Start by
clarifying your topic and considering any specific guidelines
from your instructor. Once you have a general understanding,
ask yourself these questions: What do I already know about
this topic? Are there any significant gaps in my current
knowledge or in literature? Do I need to conduct primary
research (e.g., interviews, surveys)? What type of secondary
research is required (facts, theories, applications)? The clearer
you are about your research needs upfront, the more efficient
your information gathering will be. (Browne, 2013)

University and College Libraries

University and College Libraries are incredible sources of
academic resources. Most Universities and college libraries
today offer physical libraries, hybrid libraries, and online
libraries. The University or college library is the best place to
begin your research.
338 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

   Physical Libraries: Visiting the library can be a great
      way to discover resources you might miss online. Most
      follow the Library of Congress system, making
      navigation familiar across different institutions.
      Browsing shelves can also lead to unexpected discoveries.
      (Hider, et al. 2022)

   Hybrid Libraries (Physical & Electronic): Most
      college and university libraries offer both physical
      collections and extensive electronic databases. Major e-
      book providers like ebrary and NetLibrary house vast
      digital collections. Additionally, many prestigious
      institutions like Harvard, the New York Public Library,
      the British Library, and the U.S. Library of Congress
      offer portions of their collections online for free.
      (Arulmathi and Kannan, 2019)

   Online-Only Libraries: The digital age has brought a
      surge of purely online libraries offering free, full-text
      documents. Notable examples include Project
      Gutenberg, Google Books, Read Print, Open Library,
      and Get Free E-Books. (Akhtar, 2020)

Library Resources for Research:

Academic Information Sources

Academic sources, also known as scholarly sources, are
publications that contain research-based information written
                          6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 339

and reviewed by experts in a specific field. They include
journal articles, books, conference proceedings, theses,
dissertations, and academic databases. These sources are
typically peer-reviewed, meaning they have been evaluated by
other experts to ensure accuracy and quality. Collections are
generally housed in databases and can be easily searched on
your institution's library web page.

   Textbooks: Written for student audiences, these books
      survey existing research within a specific academic field
      (e.g., a public speaking textbook). They are secondary
      sources designed for information transfer. Many colleges
      and universities are moving towards open-source
      textbooks for their courses. (Kotsiou and Shores, 2021)

   Academic Books: Books delve deeper into research and
      often present new findings. Major publishers include
      SAGE, Routledge, Jossey-Bass, and various university
      presses (e.g., Oxford University Press, University of
      Illinois Press).

   Journal Articles: Published in scholarly journals, they
      often feature original research and are peer-reviewed.
      Journal articles are usually based on academic studies or
      literature reviews. (Arrom, et al., 2018)

   Conference Papers: Papers presented at academic
      conferences often explore cutting-edge research in
      dynamic fields. Conferences include talks, poster
      sessions, and workshops.
340 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

   Government Publications: Reliable data and
      information related to policy and government initiatives.
      They are published by Federal, State and Local
      governments. The Occupational Outlook Handbook is
      an example that gives up-to-date information about
      career choices. (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2025)

   Theses/Dissertations: A thesis is the final research
      project that students do in their master's program. A
      Dissertation is the final research project that students do
      in their Doctoral programs. These are usually published
      in academic journals and in the library of their graduate
      school. (Lovitts and Wert, 2009)

   Academic Databases: Collections of scholarly
      materials, often accessed through university libraries or
      subscription services. A list of popularly used databases
      is below.

   Research Reports: Insights from think tanks and
      organizations, providing detailed analyses and
      recommendations. The University of Pennsylvania has a
      list of the major public policy think tanks in the United
      States.

   Encyclopedias: Broad overviews of topics, offering
      background information and definitions.

   Dictionaries: Provide definitions and explanations of
      terms.

   Websites: Some educational websites and academic
      databases offer valuable supplemental information.
                           6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 341

   Online Archives: Historical documents and early
      research.

   AI Tools: Can help with searches, brainstorming and
      polishing but should never be used to replace your
      writing style or speaking voice.

Nonacademic Information
Sources

Non-academic information sources, also known as popular
sources or non-scholarly sources, are designed for a general
audience rather than a specialized, academic one. They often
aim to inform, entertain, or persuade, and typically do not
undergo the rigorous peer-review process that scholarly
sources do. Here are common types of non-academic
information sources. These sources can be a good starting
point for background information about your topic.

   Newspapers: Provide current events, news, and often
      opinion pieces. Examples include The New York Times,
      The Wall Street Journal, and local newspapers. While
      they offer valuable timely information, their primary
      purpose isn't in-depth academic research, and they may
      not always cite sources in detail. Local newspapers
      (printed or online) can provide details about local events
      that the larger papers may not cover. (Sagic, 2019)

   Magazines: These can range from general interest
      (Time, Newsweek) to special interest (National
      Geographic, Scientific American, Psychology Today) or
      entertainment (People, Rolling Stone). They are written
      for a broad readership, often feature more casual
      language, and typically include many images and
      advertisements. (Rizvi & Hussian, 2023)
344 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

   Trade Journals/Publications: While more specialized
      than general magazines, these are still considered non-
      academic. They target professionals within a specific
      industry or field (e.g., Advertising Age, Chronicle of
      Higher Education). They provide industry news, trends,
      and practical applications, but generally don't present
      original, peer-reviewed research. Silva et al. (2024) found
      that trade publications and journals provide a bridge
      between readers and prior research.

   Websites: This is a vast category. Many websites,
      including personal blogs, commercial sites, news sites
      (not formal news publications), and opinion-based
      platforms, fall under non-academic. While some can
      offer valuable information, their credibility varies widely,
      and it's crucial to evaluate them carefully for bias,
      accuracy, and currency. Similar to Trade Journals, these
      sites can lead readers to more academic articles.
      (Obionwu, Broneske, Saake, 2022)

   Social Media: Platforms like (X), Facebook, Instagram,
      and TikTok are primarily for communication,
      entertainment, and sharing opinions. They are generally
      not considered reliable sources for academic research due
      to their informal nature, lack of vetting, and potential
      for misinformation. (Denniss and Lindberg, 2025)

   Reference Works (general): While useful for general
      knowledge, sources like Wikipedia and general
      encyclopedias are often considered non-academic. They
                           6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 345

      are good starting points for understanding a topic, but
      because they can be edited by anyone and are not peer-
      reviewed, they should not be cited as primary academic
      sources. In some Wikipedia articles, there are academic
      articles listed at the bottom of the Wikipedia article that
      can get students started on their research. (Wikipedia)
   Documentaries and Films: While they can offer
      insights and perspectives, documentaries and films are
      often created for entertainment or to promote a specific
      viewpoint and may not adhere to the same rigorous
      standards of evidence and objectivity required for
      academic work. They can often provide additional
      understanding of the topic you are studying. (Ghambi,
      et. al. 2023)

Key Characteristics to help recognize Non-Academic Sources

   Audience: General public.
   Purpose: Inform, entertain, persuade, or sell.
   Authorship: Often journalists, freelance writers, or staff

      writers; credentials may not be listed or extensive.
   Language: Casual, informal, may include slang.
   Review Process: Edited by staff editors, not typically

      peer-reviewed by experts in the field.
   Citations/References: Rarely include formal citations,

      footnotes, or bibliographies.
   Appearance: Often visually appealing, with graphics,
346 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

      photographs, and advertisements.
   Frequency of Publication: Can be daily, weekly, or

      monthly
   Non-Academic sources can help students gain an initial

      understanding of a topic by gathering information.
      They can also find current events and public opinion.
   (Mayer and Minervini, 2023)

Reading Literacy Skills for
Students to Use When Reading
Research Articles

Once you have chosen a research article, the first thing you
can do is read the Abstract. This will give you a brief overview
of the article. Next, read the conclusion section to see what
the study found. Finally, go back and read the whole article so
that you can summarize it in your paper or speech.

   Here are some ways to practice literacy as you are reading:

   Look for the main idea of the article.
   Take notes of ideas in the article that back up this idea.
   Consider the point of view of the writer and double

      check for biases.
   Review any charts and graphs and make sure you

      understand their meaning.
   Check the bibliography, works cited, or reference list to
                           6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 347

      see what articles the author cited that you may want to
      use.
   Next, find other articles on the same topic and see if they
      are saying the same thing.

Ask for Help

   Don't be afraid to ask for help. As discussed earlier in
      this chapter, reference librarians are your friends. They
      won't do your work for you, but they are more than
      willing to help if you ask.

Biases and Limitations of
AI-Generated Research Sources

AI-generated research sources, such as information from
chatbots, offer advantages in speed and accessibility, but are
also susceptible to various biases and limitations that can
compromise their reliability and validity. These challenges
arise from the data on which AI models are trained and the
design of algorithms themselves. You do not want to repeat
any AI biases when presenting your speech. For these reasons,
it is crucial to double-check the validity of any information
obtained through AI research.
348 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

Key Sources of Bias

1. Data Bias

AI models learn from vast datasets created by humans. If these
datasets reflect societal biases--such as those based on gender,
race, culture, or socioeconomic status--the AI will likely
reproduce and potentially amplify them.

   Here are some examples:

   An AI trained predominantly in research authored in
      Western contexts may overrepresent Western
      perspectives while underrepresenting or misinterpreting
      non-Western viewpoints. This became evident in a study
      by Xu (2025), which found that language models
      favored Western ideas and viewpoints even when
      alternative viewpoints were offered.

   A medical research model trained primarily on data from
      a specific demographic may produce findings that are
      not generalizable across diverse populations.
      Mittermaier, Raza, and Kvedar (2023) found that care
      decisions were biased against people from non-Western
      cultures.

   Zinnya del Villar (2025) discussed, in a U.N. forum, how
      AI language models trained on internet data may
      perpetuate gender stereotypes, such as associating certain
      professions (e.g., nurse, engineer) with specific genders.
                          6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 349

      She emphasizes, however, that AI can also be trained to
      be more inclusive.

2. Algorithmic Bias

Biased feature selection, variable weighting, and optimization
goals can introduce biases into AI models. These processes
can inadvertently favor certain outcomes or groups over
others, leading to unfair or inaccurate results. This is
especially seen in the human resource field. Chen (2023)
explains that biases exist in algorithms based on who created
the algorithm, considering gender, race, color, and personality
traits.

3. Implicit Bias

The optimization process itself can reflect assumptions or
biases of the developers, leading to models that favor specific
outcomes. Marinucci, Mazzuca, and Gangemi (2023)
discovered that race and gender biases exist in many AI
systems. For example, they indicated that when an AI was
asked to show a picture of a woman, it consistently showed a
white woman, which revealed the biases and stereotypes the
AI system had when retrieving the picture.

4. Confirmation Bias

The way a prompt is framed can lead an AI to prioritize
350 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

information that confirms a user's assumptions while
ignoring contradictory evidence. This unintentional
reinforcement of pre-existing beliefs may lead to biased
conclusions. Bashkirova and Krpan (2024) discussed how
psychologists favor AI recommendations that match their
initial diagnosis, making them more likely to accept future AI
suggestions.

5. Measurement Bias

Errors in the way data is processed or interpreted can lead the
model to learn and reproduce those biases. Hasanzadeh et al.
(2025) delineated a problem when medical information is
gathered from many different hospitals, each with different
data collection methods. They report that this happened with
medical diagnostic hardware purchased from varied
manufacturers.

Additional Considerations Contributing
to Bias:

1. Feature Selection

   Biased Feature Selection: If the chosen features do not
      adequately represent the underlying problem or are not
      equally relevant across all subpopulations, the model can
      be biased. For example, a COVID-19 risk prediction
                           6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 351

      model might underrepresent social determinants of
      health like socioeconomic status, leading to biased
      outcomes for vulnerable populations (Brakefield et al.,
      2022).
   Inadequate Representation: Features might be
      selected that are primarily available for the majority
      group, leading to a "one-size-fits-all" approach that
      doesn't account for the unique characteristics of
      subgroups (Holm & Ploug, 2023).
   Aggregation Bias: Data aggregation, where data from
      different sources is combined, can introduce bias
      through the selection of features that are maximally
      available across all subjects, leading to a "one-size-fits-all"
      approach (Nazer et al., 2023).

2. Variable Weighting

   Differential Weighting: If certain features are given
      disproportionate weight, the model can be biased
      towards those features, potentially ignoring or
      downplaying other important factors (Swartz et al.,
      2022).

   Ignoring Interactions: Some feature selection
      techniques may not adequately model feature-feature
      interactions, potentially leading to the loss of relevant
      interacting features (Pudjihartono et al., 2022).
352 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

3. Optimization Goals

   Favoring Specific Outcomes: The optimization goal of
      a model can unintentionally favor certain outcomes or
      groups. For example, a model trained to predict
      recidivism might unintentionally discriminate against
      certain racial groups (Belenguer, 2022).

4. Hallucinations and Factual Inaccuracies

AI models can generate confident but incorrect or entirely
fabricated information, often referred to as "hallucinations."
According to IBM (2025), common issues can include
fabricated citations or non-existent sources, invented statistics
or research findings not supported by evidence, and
misrepresentation of existing research.

5. Lack of Nuance and Contextual
Understanding

AI often struggles with complex reasoning and may fail to
grasp nuance, leading to oversimplification, omission of
alternate interpretations, and/or superficial summaries
lacking critical analysis. Thakkar et al. (2024) offer an example
of AI assuming a behavior is a mental disorder when it is a
cultural norm.
                           6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 353

6. Reproducibility Issues

The outputs of AI models can vary depending on phrasing,
version, or even the same input given at different times. This
non-determinism can challenge reproducibility, which is vital
in rigorous academic work. In other words, how can AI be
cited if the cited data is constantly changing? The University
of Maryland (2025) explains that AI needs to be cited as any
other citation using standard formats.

7. Attribution and Plagiarism Concerns

AI-generated text may synthesize information from various
sources without clear attribution. Without proper user review
and citation, this poses a risk of unintentional plagiarism and
ethical issues surrounding authorship (Chan, 2025).

AI Mitigation

Ferrara (2024) studied AI mitigation strategies and found that
data diversity, feature selection techniques, fairness metrics,
and bias detection and mitigation tools can help ensure the
inclusion of all possible participants. They suggested
implementing transparent AI training data. Elkhatat et al.
(2023) discussed evaluating AI sources, recommending
verifying information, watching out for hallucinations,
assessing the logic and coherence, and being aware of biases.
354 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

They recommend researching the information AI provides to
find out the source that AI uses.

Assessing the Credibility of
AI-Generated Sources

As you are researching sources for your speech, please be
aware that AI tools, especially large language models (LLMs),
can "hallucinate" information, meaning they produce factual
errors, invent sources, or present biased or incomplete data.
As such, critical evaluation is extremely important when using
them.

1. Fact-Checking and Verification:

   Cross-Reference with Reputable Sources: The most
      important step is to verify any factual claims made by AI
      with multiple, established, and credible sources. This
      includes academic journals, government publications,
      reputable news organizations, and well-regarded library
      databases. Giray (2023) found that ChatGPT tended to
      create citations that were not real or that pointed to non-
      academic sources.

   "Lateral Reading": After searching on AI, open new
      tabs and search for the claims made by the AI. This
      involves investigating the source of the information and
      looking for supporting or contradictory evidence from
                           6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 355

      other sources. Zhang and Pradeep (2023) explain
      ReadProbe, a tool that performs lateral reading on
      chosen citations. Of course, performing your own lateral
      reading will help you avoid possible AI biases and
      hallucinations. (ReadProbe open code, n.d.)
   Verify Citations (if provided): AI tools may provide
      citations, but these can be fake or inaccurate. Always
      look up the cited articles, books, or websites to ensure
      they exist and actually support the claims made by the
      AI. Check author names, publication titles, dates, and
      page numbers. Then, determine if they are academic
      resources. Caon et al. (2020) illustrate how the quality of
      citations usually reflects the quality of the paper, a
      worthwhile idea to remember.
   Compare with Other AI Tools: Try giving the same
      prompt to different AI tools and compare the results.
      Discrepancies can signal a need for further investigation.
      A caution, however, is presented by Sonmezoglu and
      Sonmezoglu (2024), who tested ChatGPT, Google
      Gemini, and Copilot with a prompt regarding cataract
      eye surgery and found serious quality issues in all three
      systems.

2. Identifying Bias and Missing Information:

   Consider the Training Data: AI models are trained on
      vast datasets, which can inherently contain biases or be
356 | 6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY

      outdated. Recognize that AI reflects the biases present in
      its training data and may not present a neutral or
      comprehensive perspective. In 2022, the EU released AI
      regulations that require AI to be transparent and non-
      discriminatory ("EU AI Act," n.d.). Liang (2022) found
      that the way data is developed and presented can have a
      huge effect on the efficacy and fairness of the model.
      They suggest evaluation and annotation at every stage of
      development, which will also make the models more
      transparent.
   Look for Multiple Perspectives: Does the AI content
      present a balanced view, or does it seem to favor a specific
      viewpoint, ideology, or group? Be wary of content that
      omits important information or promotes stereotypes.
      Matusov et al. (2024) have shown that AI does not have
      a dialogical self but rather a recursive self, one that can
      just follow the instructions of the prompt. It is up to the
      user to request that the AI look at an issue from multiple
      viewpoints.
   Assess for Oversimplification: Metcalfe et al. (2021)
      state that systems can sometimes oversimplify complex
      issues, missing nuances, interconnectedness, or wider
      context. Always delve deeper into topics presented by AI
      to ensure you understand their full potential.
   Check for Emotional or Manipulative Language:
      Credible sources typically use neutral, fact-based
      language. Be cautious of AI-generated content that uses
                           6.2: DEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY | 357

      overly dramatic, inflammatory, or emotionally charged
      language designed to provoke a reaction or influence
      opinions. Monteith et al. (2022) warn that there is a
      growing use of AI for commercial purposes, so the AI
      may be collecting data on you and leading your search to
      a commercial end rather than an academic one.

works cited list or a reference page with your speeches. In this
section, we're going to explore how to properly cite your
sources for a Modern Language Association (MLA) list of
works cited or an American Psychological Association (APA)
reference list. We're also going to discuss plagiarism and how
to avoid it.

Why Citing Is Important

Citing is important because it enables readers to see where
you found information referenced within a speech, article, or
book. Furthermore, not citing information properly is
considered plagiarism. To give credit to the sources we chose,
we use standard citation styles. While there are numerous
citation styles to choose from, the two most common style
choices for public speaking are APA and MLA.

APA versus MLA Source Citations

Style refers to those components or features of a literary
composition or oral presentation that have to do with the
form of expression rather than the content expressed (e.g.,
language, punctuation, parenthetical citations, and endnotes).
The APA and the MLA have created the two most commonly
used style guides in academia today. Scholars in the various
social science fields (e.g., psychology, human communication,
362 | 6.3: CITING SOURCES

business) are more likely to use APA style, and scholars in the
various humanities fields (e.g., English, philosophy, rhetoric)
are more likely to use MLA style.

APA Citations

The first common reference style is APA. As of July 2019, the
American Psychological Association published the seventh
edition of the Publication Manual of the American
Psychological Association (American Psychological
Association, 2019). The seventh edition provides considerable
guidance on working with and citing Internet sources.

MLA Citations

The second common reference style is MLA. As of 2021, the
Modern Language Association published the ninth edition of
the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers (Modern
Language Association, 2021). The ninth edition provides
considerable guidance for citing online sources.

How to Avoid Plagiarism in Public
Speaking

A study by Lin and Clark (2021), students who had higher
self-efficacy in understanding plagiarism were less likely to
                                                        6.3: CITING SOURCES | 363

plagiarize. Be one of those students who understands your
assignment and the rules against plagiarism.

Understand What Plagiarism Means in
a Speech:

   Direct Quotations: Using someone else's exact words
      without acknowledging them. Be careful to quote exact
      words.

   Paraphrasing: Restating someone else's ideas in your
      own words without attributing the original source.

   Summarizing: Condensing a larger piece of work or
      ideas from a source without giving credit.

   Using someone else's structure or outline: Even if you
      change the words, if you're using a pre-existing
      organization without credit, it can be considered
      plagiarism.

   Presenting common knowledge as your original
      research: While some things are common knowledge
      (e.g., "the sky is blue"), specific facts, statistics, or unique
      insights from a particular study or source still need
      attribution.

   Self-plagiarism: Reusing your own previous work (from
      another class or assignment) without permission from
      both instructors. While less common in public speaking,
      it's worth mentioning if students submit written
      components. (Council of Writing Program
364 | 6.3: CITING SOURCES

      Administrators, 2003; Turabian, 2013)

Why Citing Matters (Beyond
Avoiding Punishment):

   Ethical Responsibility: It's about honesty and respecting
      intellectual property.

   Credibility: Citing sources makes you, the speaker,
      appear more knowledgeable, trustworthy, and well-
      researched. It adds weight to your arguments.

   Audience Trust: Your audience will appreciate knowing
      where your information comes from. It allows them to
      follow up on interesting points or verify facts.

   Academic Integrity: It's a fundamental principle of
      academic work. (Santini, 2018)

How to Cite Sources Orally in
Your Speech:

Unlike written papers with footnotes or bibliographies, oral
citations need to be integrated smoothly into your delivery.
The goal is to provide enough information for your audience
to find the source if they wanted to, without bogging down
your speech with excessive detail.

   Important Information to Include (Who, What, Where,
When):
                                                        6.3: CITING SOURCES | 365

   Who: The author/speaker/organization.
   What: The title of the book, article, website, or

      publication.
   Where: (Optional, but helpful) The specific location

      (e.g., "in a recent article in The New York Times").
   When: (Optional, but helpful) The date of publication

      or when the information was stated.

Examples of Oral Citations:

For a Direct Quote: "As John Smith, in his book The Art of
Public Speaking, states, `Effective communication is key.'"

   Slight variation: "To quote the renowned expert, Dr. Emily
White, from her research presented at the 2023
Communication Conference, `The impact of nonverbal cues
cannot be overstated.'"

   For Paraphrased Information/Ideas: "According to a study
published last year by the Pew Research Center, young adults
are increasingly relying on social media for news."

   Slight variation: "Dr. Robert Jones, a professor at the
University of Pennsylvania, argues in his article `The Power of
Persuasion' that understanding your audience is paramount."

   From a Website: "On the National Institutes of Health
website, I found information suggesting that..."

   Slight variation: "The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's website reports that..."

   From a News Article/Magazine: "In a recent article from
366 | 6.3: CITING SOURCES

Time magazine, dated May 25th, 2024, it was reported that..."
   From an Interview: "During my interview last week with

local business owner Sarah Chen, she shared that..." (Ingram,
M. B., & Bradford, K. E., 2025)

Vary Your Citation Phrases:

Avoid sounding repetitive. Mix up your phrasing:
   "According to..."
   "As [Author's Name] noted in their book..."
   "In an article titled [Article Title], published in

[Publication]..."
   "The website for [Organization] states that..."
   "A study conducted by [Researcher/Institution] found

that..."
   "This idea is supported by research from..."
   "As reported by..." (Pearson W.S., 2021)

Tips for Integrating Citations Smoothly:

When presenting, seamlessly integrate citations by starting
with a brief lead-in phrase before delivering the information.
Keep citations concise, focusing on the essential "who" and
"what" to avoid interrupting your flow. Practice is key to
making these verbal citations sound natural rather than an
afterthought. Additionally, if using visual aids like
PowerPoint or Google Slides, include brief citations (author/
                                                        6.3: CITING SOURCES | 367

source) at the bottom of relevant slides, and provide a
comprehensive "Works Cited" or "Bibliography" slide at the
end of your presentation. (Knight, & Ingersoll, 1996)

Strategies to Use to Avoid
Accidental Plagiarism:

Strong Research Habits:

When conducting research, meticulous notetaking is crucial
for academic integrity and ease of citation. As you gather
information, immediately record comprehensive source
details--including author, title, publication, date, and specific
location information like page numbers or URLs--for every
piece of data. Equally important is to clearly distinguish your
original thoughts and analyses from the information you've
drawn from your sources. You can achieve this effectively by
employing various methods such as using different colored
pens, incorporating distinct symbols, or explicitly labeling
sections of your notes to delineate between your insights and
borrowed content. This practice not only streamlines the
citation process but also strengthens your critical engagement
with the material. (Coberly-Holt and Keech, 2021)
368 | 6.3: CITING SOURCES

Paraphrasing Effectively:

To effectively paraphrase, you should first thoroughly read
and understand the original material. Once you've grasped the
core concepts, put the source away--close the book or
minimize the screen--to prevent unintentional direct
copying. Then, articulate the information in your own words,
as if you were explaining it clearly to someone else who needs
to understand the concept. After writing your paraphrase,
carefully compare it to the original source; if you find too
many identical words or phrases, revise your version to ensure
genuine originality. Crucially, always remember that even a
perfectly rephrased passage still requires proper attribution to
its original source. (Bhagat and Hovy, 2013)

Consequences of Plagiarism:

Plagiarism in universities carries severe and multifaceted
consequences that undermine academic integrity and a
student's future. Academically, students caught plagiarizing
can face penalties ranging from a failing grade on the
assignment or the entire course to suspension or even
expulsion from the institution. This not only derails their
immediate academic progress but can also result in a
permanent mark on their academic record, making it
difficult to transfer to other universities or pursue higher
education. Beyond institutional sanctions, plagiarism erodes
                                                        6.3: CITING SOURCES | 369

the fundamental trust between students and faculty,
hindering genuine learning and the opportunity to receive
constructive feedback. In extreme cases, particularly involving
published works or research, plagiarism can lead to legal
repercussions, including copyright infringement lawsuits
and financial penalties. Ultimately, engaging in plagiarism can
irrevocably damage a student's reputation and integrity,
impacting future academic pursuits, career opportunities, and
professional credibility long after their university years.
(Tatum, 2022)

The Power of Personal
Integration

Think of it this way: the research provides bricks and mortar,
but it's your argument, your interpretation, and your analysis
that transform those materials into a compelling structure.
Your audience can find information anywhere; what they
come to you for is your distinctive perspective. What do you
see in the data that others might miss? What connections did
you make? How did you synthesize various pieces of
information into a coherent, compelling narrative? Magic
happens when you weave researched information with your
own experiences, insights, and analysis. A personal anecdote
illuminates a complex statistic, or your professional experience
lends weight to a theoretical concept. This balance makes your
speech relatable, authentic, and ultimately, more persuasive.
370 | 6.3: CITING SOURCES

When you infuse your speech with your own intellectual
fingerprints, you transform it from a mere report into a living,
breathing expression of your ideas. And in the end, that's
what resonates. It is you, the audience will remember. They'll
remember your passion, your unique insights, and the way
you made them think differently.

Assessing Credibility and
Integrating AI-Generated
Sources Ethically

Ethical integration of AI into your speeches goes beyond
merely avoiding plagiarism; it involves transparency, critical
engagement, and responsible use.

1. Transparency and Disclosure:

Understand College Policies: Students must be mindful of
their instructors' policies on AI use. Instructors typically state
their policy in the syllabus and on the learning management
system, such as Canvas.

   Acknowledge AI Use: When using AI, provide in-text
citations and include a full citation in your Works Cited list
(MLA) or Reference list (APA). For specific guidance, refer to
institutional resources, such as the Penn State Library Guide
for citing AI (e.g., Penn State University Libraries, n.d.).
                                                        6.3: CITING SOURCES | 371

2. Originality and Intellectual
Ownership:

AI as a Tool, not a Replacement: View AI as a tool to assist
your learning and research, not to replace your own critical
thinking, analysis, and writing. The final work should always
be in your own voice. Al-Sofi, 2024) emphasizes that AI can
serve as an assistant, not a substitute, for student research and
writing. Writing and Speaking Assignments Build the
Teacher/Student Relationship: Many academic assignments
are designed to help students develop specific skills and allow
teachers to understand students' genuine speaking and
writing styles. Instructors expect students to cite where their
material is derived, enabling them to distinguish between
student-generated content and AI-generated content. If AI
completes the process for students, they miss out on
developing their unique voice and on making meaningful
connections with their teachers. Barrett and Pack (2023)
showed that when clear AI guidelines are provided to
students, the relationship between teachers and students
improves.

   AI self-reflection fosters metacognition and helps students
understand the strengths and limitations of AI. Wang et al.
(2025) assessed the AI Ethical Reflection Scale (AIERS),
which measures students' opinions regarding AI ethical
awareness, critical evaluation of AI, and the use of AI for
social good. They found that the scale had good internal
372 | 6.3: CITING SOURCES

consistency, and the results indicated a correlation between AI
literacy and AI ethical reflection.

3. Academic Integrity and Avoiding
Misinformation:

As students, the onus of academic integrity rests firmly on
your shoulders, meaning you are solely responsible for the
accuracy and originality of your work. This responsibility
extends to all tools utilized in your academic pursuits,
including artificial intelligence. When incorporating AI into
your research or writing process, it is imperative to cite all
sources, acknowledging both traditional academic materials
and any AI assistance. Furthermore, exercise vigilance against
AI "hallucinations" - instances where the technology
generates plausible but incorrect information. Unverified AI
output can lead to the submission of factual errors, directly
undermining the integrity of your academic endeavors.
Therefore, always cross-reference information provided by AI
with credible, peer-reviewed academic sources. Finally,
cultivate a critical awareness of inherent biases within AI
systems. Because AI models are trained on vast datasets, they
can inadvertently perpetuate existing prejudice or
unsubstantiated claims present in that data. It is your
responsibility to critically evaluate AI outputs for bias and
ensure your submitted work is free from discriminatory or
unfounded assertions. By adhering to these principles, you
                                                        6.3: CITING SOURCES | 373

can responsibly leverage AI as a tool while upholding the
highest standards of academic honesty. (Monteith, et al.,
2024)

4. Data Privacy and Security:

Be Mindful of Sensitive Information: When individuals enter
information into AI tools, they are, in a sense, training the
system. Do not input sensitive personal data or confidential
research information into AI tools, as this data could
compromise privacy. By employing these AI ethical
integration strategies, students can responsibly navigate the
evolving landscape of AI and leverage its benefits while
upholding academic integrity. (Maritsch, et al., 2022)

Integrating AI-Generated
Sources Ethically

Ethical integration of AI into your speeches goes beyond
merely avoiding plagiarism; it involves transparency, critical
engagement, and responsible use.

1. Transparency and Disclosure:

Understand College Policies: Students must be mindful of
their instructors' policies on AI use. Instructors typically state
374 | 6.3: CITING SOURCES

their policy in the syllabus and on the learning management

serve as an assistant, not a substitute, for student research and
writing.

3. Academic Integrity and Avoiding
Misinformation:

Responsibility for Accuracy: Remember that students are
responsible for preparing their own work. Be sure to cite all
sources used, including AI.

   Combatting Hallucinations: Because AI can "hallucinate,"
relying on it without verification can lead to submitting
incorrect information, which undermines academic integrity.
                                                        6.3: CITING SOURCES | 375

Always double-check information provided by AI with
academic sources.

   Bias Awareness: Be aware that AI can perpetuate biases
present in its training data. Critically evaluate AI outputs for
bias and ensure your work does not perpetuate
unsubstantiated claims or prejudice.

Real Life Classroom Examples to
Learn From:

   Unforeseen Obstacles: Sometimes students arrive at
      class to find the electricity out in the school. This is a
      problem if it occurs on your assigned speech day.
      Sometimes the teacher will delay the speech for a day.
      However, in the event the speech cannot be delayed, it is
                                                        6.3: CITING SOURCES | 377

      a good idea to bring a corresponding poster board with
      your charts, graphs and overall research findings.
      Another option, if the class is small enough, is to show
      the class your speech on your laptop.
   The Power of Personal Connection: A student had a
      sports injury. For her speech she decided to research the
      specific physical therapy procedure that helped her with
      her injury. Her powerful personal example illustrates the
      importance of sharing a genuine real-life experience that
      ties in with your research to enhance audience
      engagement and make complex topics more relatable.
   A "Messy" Learning Process: You may be asked to
      work in a group to prepare a speech. Sometimes, in
      group research and presentation preparation there can
      be conflicting ideas, research difficulties, and the struggle
      to find their collective voice. In such examples, the
      experience teaches the group valuable lessons in
      communication, collaboration, and resilience, and
      usually culminates in a successful research presentation
      that surpasses their expectations.

These anecdotes highlight key aspects of a college speech
research class, including the challenges and triumphs of
research, the importance of adaptability and resilience, the
power of personal connection, and the collaborative nature of
academic work.

6.4: CONCLUSION:
WHAT IS RESEARCH?

   Terri Stiles

Research is more than gathering facts. It is an act of discovery
that allows speakers to transform curiosity into understanding.
In this chapter, you learned how academic research
strengthens credibility, how careful planning shapes the
research process, and how ethical citation honors the work of
others. Together, these practices ensure that every speech rests
on a foundation of evidence, transparency, and integrity.

   Beyond the podium, research represents more than
preparation. It is participation in a larger conversation. Each
question you ask connects your voice to others who have
studied, experimented, and imagined before you. When you
build your speech on solid research, you join that ongoing
dialogue and help it grow.

   As you move to the next chapter, you will take what you
have discovered and learn how to weave it into persuasive and
engaging messages. Research gives you the material; argument
and structure will give it form. Together, they turn
information into insight and insight into impact.
380 | 6.4: CONCLUSION: WHAT IS RESEARCH?

          Key Takeaways

           Research strengthens credibility. Solid
             research builds informed, ethical, and
             persuasive speeches grounded in evidence.

           Plan and balance your time. Allow space
             for both researching and practicing to create a
             polished, confident presentation.

           Use credible, diverse sources. Rely on
             academic materials for accuracy, while
             critically evaluating nonacademic and AI-
             generated content.

           Cite ethically and transparently. Give
             credit where it's due--cite your sources
             properly, disclose AI use, and maintain
             academic honesty.

           Integrate research with your own insight.
             Blend credible information with your personal
             analysis to make your speech authentic and
             memorable.

7.1 USING SUPPORTING
MATERIAL TO MAKE

   Erika Berlin

Learning Objectives:

 1. Define the term "supporting material."
 2. Understand three reasons we use support in speeches.
 3. Understand how speakers can use statistics to support

      their speeches.
 4. Differentiate among the five types of definitions.
 5. Differentiate among four types of supportive examples.
 6. Explain how narratives can be used to support

      informative, persuasive, and entertaining speeches.
 7. Differentiate between the two forms of testimony.
 8. Differentiate between two types of analogies that can be

      used as support.

Picture this: You're in a heated discussion with your
classmates about whether your campus should ban single-use
plastics. You feel strongly that it's necessary, but when you say,
"It would really help the environment," someone immediately
400 | 7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE

responds, "How do you know that? What's your proof?"
Suddenly, your passionate opinion isn't enough. To speak
effectively, whether in casual conversations, class presentations,
or campus debates, you need more than just strong feelings.
You need to support your claim with evidence, examples, and
clear reasoning that your audience can trust and understand.

   In this chapter, support refers to the material you use to
develop and strengthen your speech (facts and statistics,
definitions, narratives, testimony, and analogies) and how you
choose to deliver it. This supporting material serves three
crucial functions: it clarifies complex ideas, enhances your
credibility, and makes your speech more compelling to your
specific audience.

   Strong, research-cited support is information that is
credible, ethically sourced, and strategically selected for your
audience and purpose. This definition matters more than ever
as you navigate an era where both human experts and AI tools
generate content at unprecedented scales. But having good
evidence is only half the battle, you also need to connect that
evidence to your claims through sound reasoning, helping
your audience follow the logical path from your support to
your conclusions.

   As a civic-minded communicator, whether you're speaking
beyond the traditional podium in classrooms, workplaces, or
digital spaces, you have a responsibility to think critically about
your sources and your reasoning process. This means
evaluating how information is created and shared,
      7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE | 401

distinguishing between credible and questionable sources, and
constructing clear logical pathways that demonstrate how your
evidence supports your claims.

   Throughout this chapter, we'll explore how to gather,
evaluate, and integrate supporting material into your speeches,
then transform that evidence into compelling arguments
through strategic reasoning.

       Supporting material: evidence that develops
       and strengthens a speech by clarifying content,
       establishing credibility, and engaging the
       audience

Why We Use Supporting Material

   Clarify Content
   Add Credibility
   Add Vividness

Think of supporting material as the foundation that keeps
your message from collapsing. Without evidence, examples,
and expert voices backing up your claims, even your best
arguments can sound like empty opinions. A claim is your
statement that you want to prove and the audience to accept;
it can be as broad as your thesis or as specific as a subpoint.

   Supporting material serves three key purposes in your
404 | 7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE

speeches: they clarify your content, boost your credibility, and
make your message memorable.

   To Clarify Content: Sometimes, you need specific
supporting material simply to help your audience understand
what you're talking about. If you're giving a speech about
cyberbullying, you first need to define the term. If presenting
to classmates, you might say:

      "According to our university's 2024 student code of conduct,
      `Cyberbullying involves the use of information and
      communication technologies to support deliberate, repeated,
      and hostile behavior by an individual or group that is
      intended to harm others.'"

This type of supporting material ensures everyone in your
audience starts with the same understanding of your topic.

   To Add Credibility: Well-chosen supporting material
shows your audience that you've done your homework. Expert
testimony, recent research findings, and credible statistics all
signal that your speech rests on solid ground rather than
personal opinion alone. However, using questionable sources
or twisting evidence to say something it doesn't actually
support will damage your credibility rather than enhance it.
7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE | 405

   To Add Vividness: The right            Beyond the
supporting material makes your
speech memorable. When a             Podium Insight
public speaking student explained
the dangers of texting while         Strong
driving by comparing it to "trying   communicators
to thread a needle while riding a    go beyond
roller coaster," that vivid analogy  reciting

Facts and Statistics

Facts are verifiable observations, experiences, or events that
can be proven true. Whether you state "A 2024 Pew Research
study found that 83% of American adults use at least one social
media platform" (Beshay & Beshay, 2025) with a valid
citation, or engage the audience with your detail "I graduate
at the end of this semester with a degree in computer science -
and I think AI is taking over the job market!", you can use facts
when they will put your claim into context. Just remember:
your personal statement "...I'm terrified that AI is taking over
the job market" may inspire an active debate and is not a fact,
it's an opinion.

   Statistics represent numerical data that has been collected,
analyzed, and interpreted to reveal patterns or trends. You may
find yourself seeking stats to back up a claim that high school
athletic participation is declining, sure that an analysis of the
     7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE | 407

greater US population would not match a worldwide
comparison. Knowing how this could jumpstart your
audience, you might introduce your speech like this:

      "According to recent data from the Sports and Fitness
      Industry Association, American youth sports participation
      has plummeted over the past decade. Only 40% of young
      men are involved in any kind of athletics. In comparison,
      Australia leads the world with 84% of its population playing
      sports. So, here's my question: Are we raising a generation of
      couch potatoes while the rest of the world stays active around
      us?" (Participation Trends - State of Play 2023 - Project
      Play, n.d.-b), (AusPlay, 2023)

       Opinion: a judgement based on personal
       experience, values, or expertise that is subjective,
       arguable, and cannot be independently verified
       or proven as fact.

Definitions

Definitions ensure that you and your audience are speaking
the same language for multiple reasons. Many terms have more
than one meaning and will shift in tone depending on the
context of your claim. Use definitions when introducing
technical terms, discussing controversial topics where word
choice matters, and when speaking to diverse audiences who
may interpret terms differently.

scenarios. You can use a specific situation, problem, or story to
help illustrate or reinforce key ideas of your speech. Whether
they are brief stories or extensive explanations, examples can
cover a lot of ground. Craft an audience-centered example:
a personal story, hypothetical situation, or detailed walk-

Narratives

People love stories. That includes your audience.
   Telling a story, or what we call a narrative, can help your

audience care about your topic, understand your message
more clearly, and remember what you said long after your
speech is over. With an attention-getting story, the primacy
effect locks your effective sentiment into the audience's
memory before they get to the core of your speech! And thanks
to the recency effect, sometimes telling a story right at the end
helps you seal the deal to connect with your audience's hearts
and minds in a way that sticks, and influences!

   There are three different kinds of narratives:
414 | 7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE

Informative Narratives

Tell this story to help your audience understand something
unfamiliar. Perhaps you are giving a speech on how AI learns
your patterns the more you use it. Tell a story about how a
chatbot kept recommending the same music over and over...
until you changed your tone. That story shows how
algorithms work in real life.

Persuasive Narratives

Tell this story when you want your audience to care, change
their mind, or take action. If you're advocating for stricter
rules on deepfake videos, you might share a true story of your
friend who was harmed by a fake video of her in her prom dress
that went viral. This kind of narrative makes the consequences
real.

Entertaining Narratives

Tell this story when your goal is to connect with your audience
or bring some humor or personality into your speech.

   Maybe you're giving a lighthearted speech on first-year
college fails. Telling a story about your failed attempt at
laundry (pink socks, anyone?) makes you relatable and keeps
the mood fun.

Watch: Melissa Marshall's "Talk Nerdy
to Me"

In her 2012 TED talk "Talk Nerdy to Me," communications
coach Melissa Marshall tells a compelling personal story about
her transformation from fear to fascination when teaching
engineering students:

      "A few years ago, I was asked to teach a communications
      class for engineering students, and I was scared. Really
      scared. Scared of these students with their big brains and
      their complicated ideas and their jargon and their
      acronyms. But then these students started sharing their
      ideas with me, and I was amazed. I was amazed at the ideas
      that they had. These students were working on things that
      could change the world. But if we don't know about it and
      understand it, then the work isn't done."

Marshall then builds on this personal narrative to deliver her
central message:
416 | 7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE

      "So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us. Tell us
      why your science is relevant to us... We need to invite non-
      scientists into the wonderland of science and engineering."

After walking through the steps of improving speech
techniques for technical content, she lays out her final
equation:

      "Take your science, subtract your bullet points and your
      jargon, divide by relevance, and multiply it by the passion
      you have for your work."

This narrative works powerfully because Marshall has
established credibility through her expertise: she owns Present
Your Science, a company that teaches technical professionals
how to present their work effectively. The story structure
moves from conflict (her initial fear) through discovery
(realizing how amazing student ideas were) to resolution (her
call for better science communication). By sharing her own
transformation, she creates a memorable framework that helps
audiences understand both the problem and the solution she's
proposing.

Testimony

When you lack expertise on a topic, you can verify and add
credibility to your claim by incorporating expert or eyewitness
testimony. Expert testimony relies on professional knowledge
      7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE | 417

and expertise, while eyewitness testimony relies on personal
observation and direct experience of events.

   The opinions and statements from individuals across the
spectrum of time and experience can bolster your claim - just
make sure to verify your sources. Go through the real-time
fact-checking process to lay the transparent groundwork:
establish clear credentials when verifying an expert.
Understand the potential bias, unclear motivation,
misinformation, and disinformation risks when taking your
source at face value.

Try It: Lateral Reading Fact-Check

Activity Introduction: Good communicators verify
testimony before using it as support. In this short scenario,
you'll practice a 4-step check: 1. quick scan, 2. Google the

       Disinformation: False or misleading content
       written by a real person or created using artificial

Expert Testimony

Expert testimony expresses the attitudes, values, beliefs, or
behaviors recommended by someone who is an acknowledged
expert on a topic. The expert's credibility comes from their
education, experience, research, or professional standing in a
specific field.

   If you're giving a speech about child safety and technology,
you could quote Dr. Sonia Livingstone, Professor of Social
Psychology at London School of Economics and leading
researcher in child online safety, who developed the widely-
used framework for understanding digital risks to children:

      "For the CO:RE project, ... by I drew on earlier work by
      EU Kids Online to propose the 4Cs of online risk to
      children: content, contact, conduct and contract. My
      research takes a child rights approach, which means that
      society needs to consider the specific risks and children's
420 | 7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE

      own diverse life contexts and evolving capacities." (Esmh,
      2023)

This is strong expert testimony because Dr. Livingstone has
conducted research with over 25,000 children across 25
countries, directs major international child safety projects, and
was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire for
her services to child internet safety. Her framework is used
by policymakers worldwide to categorize and address online
risks. When you use expert testimony like this, you're citing
someone whose research directly informs government policy
and whose systematic approach provides concrete categories
for understanding complex safety issues.

Eyewitness Testimony

Eyewitness testimony is given by someone who has direct,
personal contact with the phenomenon or event related to
your speech topic. The witness's credibility comes from being
physically present and observing the situation firsthand.

   Officer Caroline Edwards, who was assigned to protect the
U.S Capitol during the January 6th attack in 2021 and was
one of the first officers injured by rioters, testified before the
January 6th Committee about what she personally witnessed:

      "It was something like I had seen out of the movies. I
      couldn't believe my eyes. There were officers on the
      ground. They were bleeding. They were throwing up. I was
      7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE | 421

      slipping in people's blood. It was carnage. It was chaos."
      (PBS NewsHour, 2022)

This eyewitness testimony is powerful. Edwards was not just
`on the job', her senses were heightened, her emotions were
raw. When you choose eyewitness testimony like this, you're
giving your audience access to someone who `was there', and
that firsthand perspective carries unique credibility that
secondhand accounts, that may carry misinformation,
disinformation, or opinion, simply cannot match.

Analogies

Analogies help you explain something unfamiliar by
comparing it to something your audience already knows. They
can make your ideas clearer, more persuasive, or just easier to
remember.

   There are two main types you might use: literal and
figurative.

Literal Analogies

Literal analogies compare two things from the same category.
You might compare two schools, two public policies, or two
technologies that work in similar ways.

   You could use a literal analogy to make your case about
online privacy. Try comparing it to privacy at home: "If you
422 | 7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE

wouldn't want someone snooping through your bedroom, you
shouldn't be okay with your data being tracked online." That's
a clear, relatable comparison that helps your audience connect
to the issue.

Figurative Analogies

When you use a figurative analogy, you're comparing things
from different categories. For example, "Regulating AI is like
building a dam in a hurricane." That's not a literal
comparison, but it paints a strong mental picture.

   Figurative analogies are helpful when you want to spark
emotion or curiosity. Just be careful: if your audience doesn't
buy the connection, your analogy might feel like an
exaggeration instead of support.

Can You Use AI to Help Create
Analogies?

Yes, but with caution. AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot can
help you brainstorm ideas and even suggest analogies. But it's
your job to double-check them. Does the comparison make
sense? Is it fair and ethical? Would it help your audience
understand or confuse them?
      7.1 USING SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO MAKE YOUR CASE | 423

Try It: Brainstorm with AI

Activity Introduction: Analogies bridge the gap between
what your audience knows and what they're learning. In this
interactive activity, you'll use AI as a brainstorming partner to
craft analogies that fit your topic, tone, and audience. Then,
refine them through critical and ethical reflection.

   Activity Instructions: Use AI to generate analogies that
help explain your speech topic clearly and ethically. Flip each
card to explore prompt tips, refinement strategies, and
reflection questions.

                   An interactive H5P element has been
                   excluded from this version of the text. You

        https://psu.pb.unizin.org/
        beyondthepodium/?p=740#h5p-56

Wrap up: AI can generate comparisons in seconds, but great
communicators evaluate each analogy for accuracy, tone, and
impact. Strong analogies don't just inform: they connect,
persuade, and resonate.

Sifting Through Your Support

When researching a topic, you will find a range of different
types of supporting material: facts and statistics, definitions,
examples, narratives, testimony, and analogies. Evaluate all
sources to ensure their validity, and be strategic and selective
about the research you use to support your speech.

Fact-Check Strategies

Lateral Reading

When doing online research, lateral reading is a must. It
is a strategy for evaluating online information by leaving the
original source to investigate what others say about it. Instead
of staying on one website to judge its credibility, open new tabs
to check the source's background, reputation, and reliability.
Coined by Sam Wineburg, researcher and founder of the
Stanford History Education Group, this method helps us
think like fact-checkers, especially in our era of potential
misinformation, deepfakes, and biased content (Wineburg et
al., 2020).

The SIFT Method

When you encounter information online, whether it's a
426 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

shocking statistic, an expert quote, or breaking news, don't
just accept it at face value. Use the SIFT Method, developed
by digital literacy expert Mike Caulfield, to quickly evaluate
sources like a professional fact-checker (Caulfield &
Wineburg, 2023). This simple process takes less than a minute
and can save you from citing unreliable information in your
speeches and presentations.

from June 15, 2025, when he released "Deep Background:
Fact-checks and Context". Happy testing! (Caulfield, 2025)

Consider This...

Both lateral reading and the SIFT Method fact-checking are
reactive evaluation techniques, that is, "Here is what I found,
what do I think of it?" As you solidify a purpose and conduct
research, you may discover content in front of you after
exploring topics on the Internet that you've never explored
before. Your algorithmic personification is broadening.
What does that mean? Your online life is well-known to
technology companies, and as such, everyday activity
information is stored, tracked, utilized, and shared. Networked
efforts can flood your feeds, timelines, and search results. In
this era, the process of proactive evaluation allows you to
keep facts - and technology - in check. That is, "Because I
understand where this information came from and why I'm
seeing it, I can trust it for this kind of information, and for this
purpose."

When it's ok:

You are researching for your speech that pets should be
adopted from the rescue shelter instead of purchased from
a puppy mill. You visited Instagram, YouTube, used Google,
ChatGPT, went to over 15 websites, and you even had a text
428 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

exchange with one of your parent's friends that worked at a
local shelter. Almost immediately, you start receiving a stream
of ads on your Instagram feed for the ASPCA, Google's
homepage showed a news story about a recent puppy mill
bust in your area. Even ChatGPT seemed to "remember" your
interest, continually offering suggestions for pet care and
volunteering.

When it's not:

You watch a YouTube video about alternative pet vaccines
out of curiosity. Soon after, your feed is flooded with videos
pushing unverified claims about pet health, anti-vet rhetoric,
and conspiracy theories about animal shelters. Ads and search
results start reinforcing these ideas, making it harder to find
trustworthy information. The algorithm, designed to feed you
more of what you engage with, creates a bubble of
disinformation which makes it feel like this skewed viewpoint
is widely accepted, when it's not.

Use a Variety of Supporting
Material

Think of supporting material like ingredients in your favorite
meal. You wouldn't make tacos with just tortillas, and you
               7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 429

shouldn't build a speech with just statistics. Mix it up to keep
your audience engaged and make your points stick.

   Different people connect with different types of evidence.
Some love hard numbers and data, while others are moved by
personal stories. Some individuals require concrete examples,
while others respond to expert opinions. When you use
multiple types of support, you're speaking everyone's
language.

   Here's how it works in practice:

     Topic: Mental health support on college campuses
     Start with a statistic:

           "According to the American University Health
           Association, 66% of students reported
           experiencing overwhelming anxiety in the past
           year."

     Add a personal story:

           "My roommate Sarah described feeling
           completely alone during finals week last
           semester, even though she was surrounded by
           people in the library every night."

     Include expert testimony:

           "Dr. Martinez, director of our campus counseling
430 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

           center, explains that peer support programs have
           reduced crisis calls by 40%."
     Provide a concrete example:
           "Schools like MBU have implemented 24/7 text-
           based crisis support, allowing students to get
           help without having to make a phone call."

     Topic: The importance of learning a second
     language
     Start with a definition:

           "Cognitive flexibility refers to your brain's ability
           to switch between different concepts and think
           about multiple concepts simultaneously."
     Provide a statistic:
           "Bilingual individuals show 20% better
           performance on multitasking tests compared to
           monolinguals."
     Include an analogy:
           "Learning a second language is like cross-training
           for your brain--just as athletes who do multiple
         7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 431

     sports tend to be more well-rounded, people
     who speak multiple languages develop stronger
     mental agility."

Provide a personal example:

     "When I worked at Starbucks, being bilingual
     didn't just help me take orders, it helped me
     think faster during rush periods and solve
     problems more creatively."

   The bottom line is this: don't          Beyond the

Final Supporting Material Review

Not all evidence works for every speech. When you are making
final edits, choose the support that fits your specific audience,
context, and specific purpose.

   Consider your context: Testimony might work great in
an informative speech, but they could fall flat if your general
purpose is to entertain. Narratives can be powerful for
persuasion, but might hurt your credibility in a formal
business proposal that calls for facts and statistics.

   Know your audience: Starting with "Remember when
TikTok first launched?" might not land with a room full of
professors. Similarly, testimony from experts your peers have
never heard of won't be as compelling as examples they can
relate to.

   Stay focused: You might find three amazing statistics that
all support your point, but using all three could overwhelm
your audience. Pick the strongest one and save the others for
another speech. Quality over quantity; your goal is to support
your argument, not bury it under a pile of evidence.

   Keep it relevant: Every piece of supporting material
should directly advance your specific purpose. That hilarious
narrative about your dog might be entertaining, but if it
doesn't help prove your argument about campus
sustainability, cut it. Your audience will notice when you go off
track, and your credibility will suffer.
434 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

Forming Your Speech Support

You've gathered, evaluated, and completed a final review of
your supporting material. Now comes the exciting part:
bringing it to life in your speech! How do you use it so your
audience understands, trusts, and remembers your message?

   Let's walk through five common forms of speech support
and how to use each effectively: quotations, paraphrases,
summaries, numbers, and visuals.

Quotations

Direct quotations use another speaker's or writer's exact words
within your speech. Here's how to make quotations work for
you:

   Famous quotes. Choose quotes that make people lean
      forward. Witty, surprising, or beautifully crafted words
      that stick will do the trick. Maya Angelou's "There is no
      greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you"
      hits differently than a bland summary of her philosophy.

   Focus on expertise. When Patrick Blanc, botanist and
      the modern expert on the "green wall", explains why
      vertical gardens could revolutionize cities, his words
      carry weight that yours alone might not.

   The details matter. Iconic American designer and
      architect Charles Eames said "Details are not details.
               7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 435

      They make the design." If you're analyzing how AI
      chatbots reveal unconscious bias, you need those exact
      algorithmic prompts, not your interpretation of them.
   It's YOUR speech. Quotes should enhance your voice,
      not replace it. Nobody wants to hear a greatest hits
      compilation when they came for your original insights.
   Keep it brief. Long quotes are like long elevator rides,
      everyone gets uncomfortable. Get in, make your point,
      get out.

Paraphrases

Paraphrasing is your chance to be a translator, taking someone
else's complex ideas and making them accessible to your
audience. It's collaboration at its finest:

   Clarity. When a researcher's methodology takes three
      paragraphs to explain, you can distill it: "Dr. Tchounga's
      team followed college students' phone habits for six months
      and discovered something surprising."

   Simplify. Academic jargon might impress professors,
      but it often confuses audiences.

   Freshen up. That 1990s case study about office
      communication? Transform it into insights about Zoom
      fatigue and remote work challenges.

   Be prepared. Use paraphrases for straightforward
      information, but when your audience might raise
436 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

      eyebrows, bring out the direct quotes for backup.

Summaries

Sometimes you need to paint the big picture before diving into
details. Summaries are your wide-angle lens, capturing entire
arguments or movements in digestible form:

   Start with a summary. When discussing AI ethics, you
      might need to summarize an entire philosophical
      framework before exploring its real-world applications.

   Present both sides. "Critics of universal basic income
      worry about three main issues..." gives your audience the
      full counterargument landscape.

   Compare support sources. "Whether you look at
      Stanford's sleep studies, MIT's productivity research, or
      Toronto's mental health findings, the message is clear..."

Numerical Support

Numbers tell stories, but only if you help them speak clearly.
Data can be your most persuasive ally or your biggest enemy, if
mishandled:

   Clearly confirm sources. "According to Pew Research's
      2024 study of 2,000 teenagers..." tells your audience
      exactly where this information comes from and why it
               7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 437

      matters.
   Emphasize data. Don't just say "ChatGPT gained 100

      million users in two months." Supplement that this
      makes it the fastest-growing consumer app in history;
      faster than TikTok, Instagram, or any previous
      technology.
   Clarify complex information. When you're juggling
      multiple statistics about renewable energy adoption, a
      simple visual can transform confusion into
      understanding.

Visual Support

Visual support is where your speech comes alive. Images and
videos don't just support your argument, they make it
unforgettable. For example, you can explain digital
manipulation by displaying TikTok's algorithm interface.
Showing how biodegradable packaging dissolves in water adds
clarity to verbal description.

   Here's how to make visuals work their magic:

   Show, don't just tell. Explaining proper ergonomics?
      Show it. Describing cultural dance movements? Have a
      YouTube video on standby. Some things simply can't be
      captured in words alone.

   Double your impact. When audiences see and hear
      information simultaneously, they remember it better.
438 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

      Your visual becomes a memory anchor.
   Use high-quality visual support. Blurry photos and

      AI-generated images with miscalculated fingers can
      undermine everything you've built. Quality matters.
   Make sure everyone can see. If people in the back can't
      see your visuals, you've lost half your audience. Make
      sure your visuals are visible to all.
   Explain the connection. Don't assume your audience
      sees what you see. Always explain how your visual
      strengthens your point. Make that connection crystal
      clear.

Now that you've dug deep into supporting material, assessed
its strengths and weaknesses, and started making selections to
support the specific purpose of your speech, the real work
begins. Building arguments is the crux of your speech, where
               7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 439

the credibility, accuracy, and relevance of your timely evidence
reigns. Beyond the podium, understanding an evidence-based
argument, both as a consumer and a creator, is key to
successful communication.

Understanding Arguments

You may associate the word "argument" with a situation in
which two people are having some kind of conflict. But in
the context of giving a speech, we consider a definition that
originated with the ancient Greeks, who saw arguments as
a set of logical premises leading to a clear conclusion. Fast
forward to our 21st century. Arguments can come at us with
and without our permission, in our social media feed, through
disinformation-fueled websites, and AI-generated loops.
Arguments aren't always clear-cut, and our critical thinking
skills are needed.

   Now, you've started to build an argument. You've solidified
a strategic purpose, confirmed your support, and a claim is
starting to crystallize. Your inner Greek is motivated! The
claim is the statement you want the audience to accept; what
you are trying to prove. Even more, you're finding credible
sources with a variety of supporting material that backs up this
claim. So you're ready to move on to the next claim, right?
Wrong!

   You might have made the connection between your support
and your claim, but will it be evident to your audience? Make
440 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

sure your argument is logical, sound, and understood by all,
which means you AND the audience, by conducting the
process of reasoning.

What Is Reasoning?

Reasoning is how we connect the dots in an argument; it links
the support to your claim so that you and your audience can
decide whether the evidence really does support it (Zarefsky
& Engels, 2019). In a speech, sound reasoning helps your
audience understand not just what you're saying, but why it
makes sense.

   How it works:

   Claim - what you're trying to convince your audience
      of

   Support - the evidence for your claim
   Reasoning - the logical "leap" that links them together

Your argument needs to take that mental leap, otherwise
referred to as an inference, because it's the explanation, the
"so what?", that makes your message click with your audience.

     Here's an example:
               7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 441

           Claim: Eating fast food has been linked to
             childhood obesity.

           Support: Childhood obesity is linked to early-
             onset type 2 diabetes, which can have many
             negative health ramifications.

           Reasoning: Therefore, for children to avoid
             developing early-onset type 2 diabetes, they
             must limit their fast-food intake.

This example makes a strong inference that fast food is not
only a risk for obesity, but for early-onset type 2 diabetes as
well. The official topic of this student's speech is not explicit.

   If this were your claim, what thesis would you be
supporting?

   Fast food restaurants should be banned within a 5 mile
radius of K-12 schools in the United States.

   This is a strong statement, but you could come from many
angles on the topic of children's health.

Strong vs. Weak Reasoning

Let's look at a few more examples. Strong reasoning makes
clear, logical connections. Weak reasoning leaves your audience
442 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

confused or, even worse, in doubt that they can trust your
argument.
         7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 443

Claim: Students should drink more water.
   Support: The human body is 60% water.

Reasoning: We need to maintain that 60% water level in our bodies in order to keep our brains functioning properly, regulate body temperature, Stro
and transport nutrients, which is why staying hydrated helps you think
clearly and avoid fatigue during long study sessions.

Claim: Campus mental health services should be expanded.

Support: Dr. Sarah Martinez, Director of Student Counseling at State

University, reports that 40% of students seeking help are turned away due

to a lack of availability.                                                 Stro

Reasoning: When nearly half of the students can't access the mental

health support they're actively seeking, it creates a crisis that affects

academic performance and student wellbeing across campus.

Claim: Everyone should switch to electric cars.

Reasoning: The cars look slick, so they should be worth buying!

Claim: We should ban soda in schools.

Support: Soda has more sugar than we realize.                              Wea

Reasoning: Therefore, soda should be banned.
444 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

What About AI?

AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, or Google Gemini can help
you brainstorm ideas and even construct your speech. But
when you begin building your arguments, AI is far from
perfect. Here's what to watch out for:

Evidence mismatch

Let's say you are searching for information about the first
African-American woman in the field of veterinary medicine,
Dr. Jane Hinton and, because of her rare significance, you ask
ChatGPT, "Please provide facts and expert testimony, examples,
and stories about veterinarian Dr. Jane Hinton." In seconds,
you begin to receive organized facts, quotes from articles about
Dr. Jane Hinton, a link to her obituary, and her profile and
current course list at SUNY. Wait, what? Dr. Jane Hinton,
the pioneer of female representation in STEM research, and
veterinary medicine, passed away in 2003. A real professor,
living in 2025, is a bridge between your prompted, accurate
result and a similar academic female meeting similar criteria.

Logical leaps

Imagine you're preparing a speech about social media's impact
on mental health. You ask AI: "How does Instagram use affect
teenagers' self-esteem?" AI might respond: "Studies show that
               7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 445

teenagers who use Instagram for more than 2 hours daily have
40% higher rates of depression. Therefore, Instagram directly
causes depression in teens." Hold on: that's a logical leap! AI
jumped from correlation (Instagram use and depression
occur together) to causation (Instagram causes depression)
without considering other factors. Maybe teens who are
already struggling with mental health spend more time on
social media as a coping mechanism. Always question whether
AI's reasoning actually follows logically from the evidence it
presents.

Repetitive bias

You're researching leadership styles for a presentation and ask
AI about effective CEO characteristics. AI consistently
describes leaders using words like "decisive," "aggressive," and
"commanding," which are traits traditionally associated with
male leadership. When you ask specifically about female
CEOs, it might emphasize "collaborative" and "nurturing"
styles. This isn't coincidence; it's bias from the AI's training
data reflecting societal stereotypes. AI isn't intentionally
discriminating, but it's repeating patterns from countless
articles, books, and websites that contain these biases. When
supporting your claim comparing Meta CEO Mark
Zuckerberg to Sheryl Sandberg (former Meta COO), do you
find that these characteristics are accurate as you dig deeper?
446 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

Always ask yourself: whose perspectives might be missing from
this response?

Confident confusion

AI never says "I don't know." Ask it about a highly technical
medical procedure, and it will confidently explain complex
steps, even if some details are completely wrong. You might
ask about "neuroplastic rehabilitation techniques for stroke
patients" and receive what sounds like expert medical advice,
complete with specific percentages and treatment timelines.
The problem? AI generates responses that sound authoritative
even when it's essentially making educated guesses. Just
because AI presents information confidently doesn't mean it's
accurate. Always verify important claims with credible sources.

Perfect puzzle pieces

When you research complex issues like climate change or
immigration policy, real experts usually acknowledge
uncertainty, conflicting evidence, and limitations in their data.
AI, however, often presents information that fits together too
neatly, like puzzle pieces that create a perfect picture without
any missing pieces or rough edges. If AI gives you a response
about a controversial topic without mentioning any
counterarguments, conflicting studies, or areas where experts
               7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 447

disagree, that's a red flag. Real-world issues are messy; if AI
makes them seem simple and clear-cut, dig deeper.

   Remember, reasoning is how         AI can generate

Make Your Reasoning Explicit

   When making that mental leap, you can rely on three
450 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

common reasoning patterns to connect your evidence to your
conclusion. Causal reasoning establishes that one event leads
to another, analogical reasoning draws comparisons between
similar situations, and sign reasoning uses indicators to point
toward larger conclusions. Let's explore how these different
types of reasoning work with various forms of support.

Causal Reasoning: "Because A
happened, B will result"

Establishes a cause-and-effect relationship

Use expert testimony:

   Claim: "Social media addiction significantly impacts
      teenage mental health"

   Support: Dr. Sarah Chen, an adolescent psychologist at
      the local hospital, states: "We're seeing unprecedented
      levels of anxiety and depression in teens who spend more
      than four hours daily on social platforms"

   Reasoning: "This happens because constant comparison
      and dopamine-driven feedback from likes rewires our
      developing brains, creating social media habits that harm
      healthy emotional control."
               7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 451

Use a narrative:

   Claim: "Mentorship programs transform at-risk students'
      academic trajectories"

   Support: "Maria Rodriguez entered high school with a
      1.8 GPA and frequent absences. After joining our peer
      mentorship program, she maintained a 3.4 GPA her
      senior year and earned a college scholarship"

   Reasoning: "This transformation occurs because consistent
      one-on-one support addresses the root causes of academic
      struggle (often lack of guidance and low expectations),
      which gives students both practical skills and renewed
      confidence in their abilities"

Analogical Reasoning: "Since X is like
Y, what's true for X is true for Y"

A comparison of people, places, things, events; or more
abstract relationships

With a fact:

   Claim: "Our elementary schools should adopt play-based
      learning curricula"

   Support: "Finland's education system ranks first globally
      while emphasizing play-based learning"

   Reasoning: "Like Finland, our elementary schools could
452 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

      benefit from this approach because young children develop
      cognitive skills more effectively through interactive,
      enjoyable activities than through rote instruction"

With a personal narrative:

   Claim: "Community gardens strengthen neighborhood
      bonds and reduce crime"

   Support: "In Detroit's Corktown district, resident Lisa
      Thompson recalls: `Before the garden, I barely knew my
      neighbors. Now we share recipes, watch each other's kids,
      and crime dropped 40% in two years'"

   Reasoning: "Like other revitalized neighborhoods, areas
      with community gardens create natural surveillance and
      social investment. When people care about a shared space,
      they protect it and each other"

Sign Reasoning: "A indicates B"

One thing stands for another

With expert testimony:

   Claim: "The local housing market is entering a dangerous
      bubble"

   Support: Real estate analyst David Park notes: "When
      average home prices exceed six times median household
               7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 453

      income, markets historically face major corrections within
      18 months"
   Reasoning: "These warning signs indicate unsustainable
      speculation. When working families can't afford homes in
      their own communities, the economic foundation becomes
      too narrow to support continued price growth"

With eyewitness account:

   Claim: "Emergency mental health services on campus are
      critically understaffed"

   Support: "Junior Ali Khan waited three weeks for a
      counseling appointment after experiencing panic attacks,
      saying: `I called every day, but they kept putting me on a
      waiting list. By the time I got help, I'd already failed two
      midterms'"

   Reasoning: "These delays reveal a system stretched beyond
      capacity--when students in crisis face weeks-long waits, it
      indicates staffing levels inadequate for actual demand,
      putting vulnerable students at serious risk"

Regardless of which reasoning pattern you use, always make
your logical connection explicit. Your audience needs to
understand not just what you believe and why you believe
it, but how you arrived at that conclusion. This transparency
builds trust and allows listeners to evaluate your argument
fairly, which is the hallmark of ethical persuasion.
454 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

   The Claim, Support, Reasoning process will help you craft
clear, logical arguments that your audience can easily follow
and evaluate.

      Step 1: Establish Your Claim

                Start by clearly stating what you want
                your audience to believe or do. Your claim
                should be specific and debatable;
                something a reasonable person might
                disagree with.
               Example: "Our university should
               implement a four-day class schedule."

      Step 2: Present Your Support

                Provide evidence that backs up your claim.
                This might include statistics, expert
                testimony, examples, or research findings.
                Ensure your support is credible and
                relevant to your target audience.
               Example: "A pilot study at Northwest
               Penn State University showed that
               students on a four-day schedule had 15%
      7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 455

        higher course completion rates and
        reported 23% less stress."

              A wise choice! This statistical
                evidence from a Northwest Penn
                State pilot study provides credible,
                quantifiable data that directly
                relates to student outcomes, which
                are key concerns for any university
                considering schedule changes.

Step 3: Connect Through Reasoning

        Your inference makes the conclusion
        explicit, showing your audience exactly
        why the support proves the claim.
        Here are three examples that solidify the
        argument in a relevant, logical manner:
        Causal Example: "This suggests that
        condensed schedules allow students to
        focus more intensively on their
        coursework while having extended time
        for rest and part-time work, leading to
        better academic outcomes overall."
456 | 7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS

                      This reasoning establishes a cause-
                        and-effect relationship, explaining
                        the mechanism by which four-day
                        schedules produce better results.

               Analogical Example: "Just like how
               many successful companies have adopted
               four-day work weeks and seen improved
               employee performance and retention, our
               university can expect similar benefits from
               a four-day class schedule. When people
               have more time to recharge, they bring
               greater focus and energy to their tasks."

                      This reasoning draws parallels
                        between similar situations,
                        suggesting that what works in one
                        context will work in another
                        comparable context.

               Sign Example: "These improved
               completion rates and reduced stress levels
               indicate that students are better able to
               manage their academic workload,
               suggesting that our current five-day
                  7.2: USING SUPPORT AND BUILDING ARGUMENTS | 457

                  schedule may be creating unnecessary
                  pressure that interferes with learning."

                        This reasoning treats the observed
                          outcomes as indicators pointing to a
                          broader conclusion about systemic
                          issues.

        Test it!

                  Would someone who disagrees with you
                  understand your logic, even if they don't
                  accept your conclusion?

  In the next section, we'll cover the importance of supporting
  your arguments, how to assess them, avoid reasoning pitfalls,
  and how to confirm relevance and credibility.

Avoiding Errors in Reasoning -
Six Questions

In general, problems in reasoning are referred to as fallacies. An
inference is correct at first, but when you inspect, you discover
a significant flaw. It could be broad - the audience simply
disagrees with your claim - or it could be very specific to a
logical point. In most cases, a fallacy is an inference regarded
as "unreasonable by a broad and diverse audience of listeners
exercising their best critical judgment" (Zarefsky & Engels,
2019)

   1. Does your claim follow the supporting material? That
is, could a careful Google search confirm the connection?
Probably not. In the example below, both the claim and the
                   7.3 ASSESSING ARGUMENTS AND CREDIBILITY | 463

supporting material are correct, but no reasoning bridges the
gap.

      "Because our city's population has grown by 15% in the past
      decade, we should switch to renewable energy sources."

2. Does your supporting material simply restate your claim?
Are you saying the same thing, only in different words? That's
called making a circular argument.

      "We should ban cell phones in classrooms because mobile
      devices shouldn't be allowed during instruction time."

3. Does your claim even relate to your speech topic? While
some information is interesting, it could actually be distracting
and take your audience down the wrong path. That's
commonly referred to as a red herring - technically ignoring
the question, not a good use of anyone's time and energy!

      "Our government should invest in building a public
      transportation system because citizens in many other
      countries enjoyed theirs."

4. Does your reasoning have multiple meanings? If your
language is unequivocal, your speech is in the clear. If your
supporting material includes a testimony from a local
politician claiming "no tax increases," the potential for
questioning begins. Which taxes? Whose taxes?

      "Merging the four elementary schools into one central
      location will eliminate operational and maintenance costs
464 | 7.3 ASSESSING ARGUMENTS AND CREDIBILITY

      in several small towns, therefore balance the budget of the
      school district without increasing property taxes or lowering
      the educational experiences our children receive."

5. Does your argument treat probability as certainty?
Overstating your case by presenting debatable claims as
absolute facts from beginning to end risks losing the audience's
buy-in.

      "Raising the minimum wage will definitely eliminate
      poverty"

6. Does your cited support come from experts on your speech
topic or famous people who got your attention? Your topic
is free and reduced meals for elementary students. A quote
from your favorite actor Andrew Garfield is enticing, but is
considered a false authority. In comparison, Governor of
Pennsylvania Josh Shapiro stated:

      "We can't expect our kids to pay attention in class, learn, and
      succeed if they haven't eaten all day - and that's why I want
      to give free breakfast to every child in our schools."

       Circular argument: Restating the claim in only
       slightly different words, rather than supporting
       the claim.
                   7.3 ASSESSING ARGUMENTS AND CREDIBILITY | 465

       Red herring: Otherwise known as ignoring the
       question, this is an inference that diverts
       attention from the issue.
       False authority: When a source's credentials
       are not relevant to their claims.

Assess Your Argument

Go through a checklist with your supported claims to ensure
you've developed arguments that are credible, relevant, and
accurate.

   Arguments clearly state a claim
   Arguments clearly use supporting material
   Arguments clearly state inference/reasoning
   Arguments use a reasoning pattern
   Arguments are ethically valid
   Arguments do not have any fallacies

Now, answer this question...

Put yourself in the shoes of a skeptical audience member -
would you regard your reasoning as sound?
466 | 7.3 ASSESSING ARGUMENTS AND CREDIBILITY

Giving Your Speech

After you have selected support material, connected it to your
claim, and built an argument with sound reasoning, you're
ready for the final step. It's time to prepare to give your speech
to an audience, establishing credibility for your content and
your character, your ethos. Ensure your reasoning efforts
connect to your audience and your strategic purpose is
achieved.

Oral Citation

When using support during your speech, provide an oral
citation telling the audience where your information came
from. Simply giving the website isn't enough.

   Depending on the source, you should include the author's
name, their expertise (if relevant), the title, the publication or
platform, and the date.

   Start with the author and source. If it's part of a larger work,
like an article in a magazine, mention both. Give the full date
if possible.

   Explain the author's credibility when it helps the audience
understand why this person should be trusted. If the author is
widely known, you don't need to explain. For instance, if you
cite President Barack Obama or President George W. Bush in a
speech about U.S. politics, you can assume the audience knows
who they are. But if your source is less familiar and you don't
                   7.3 ASSESSING ARGUMENTS AND CREDIBILITY | 467

explain their background, your audience might question the
reliability of your support.

     Here are three examples:

         1. According to Melanie Smithfield in an article
             titled "Do It Right, or Do It Now," published in
             the June 18, 2009, issue of Time Magazine...

         2. According to Roland Smith, a legendary civil
             rights activist and former chair of the Civil
             Rights Defense League, in his 2001 book The
             Path of Peace...

         3. According to James Cameron, acclaimed
             director of Titanic and Avatar and executive
             producer of the National Geographic
             documentary series, in his April 2024 video
             "Secrets of the Octopus" on the National
             Geographic YouTube channel...

     These oral citations help your audience understand
     your source and trust your message.

Audience Connection

After presenting your evidence, now it's time to connect with
your audience. Like we covered in section 7.2, you build your
468 | 7.3 ASSESSING ARGUMENTS AND CREDIBILITY

arguments through the process of connecting your claim and
your support through reasoning. It's time to explain to your
listeners how your support proves your point, and finally draw
the conclusion that ties everything together. To make sure this
moves through each claim smoothly, keep your audience's
perspective in mind throughout the entire speech delivery. You
can prepare for audience connection while building your
argument.

   Here are a few tips:
   Know your broad audience, but don't assume. There
are some audience details you will know for sure
(demographic), but others are behind a curtain
(psychographic). You have choices to make about the claims
you choose to move forward with and the supporting material
you select to support that claim. The more insight you have on
who you'll be presenting to, the more flexibility you have to
practice motivated reasoning.
   Be explicit. You've got your claim  support  reasoning
down pat, and your speech seems complete to you. But you
might be covering some of your claims with unclear support
connections or obscure reasoning. Be wary; if you rely on the
audience's knowledge and expectations to establish the
inference, they may not align with your goals. Do not assume
that your audience is doing the mental leap. Explicitly state the
argument from beginning to end.
   Bring your audience to the table. When audience
members can relate to your evidence through personal
                   7.3 ASSESSING ARGUMENTS AND CREDIBILITY | 469

experience, they become more engaged, even if they initially
disagreed with your position. You may be supporting one side
of the aisle; they may be on the other side. But it is an open
door to swap support, experiences, and boost engagement.

   Relationships and values motivate. Your reasoning can
align with or challenge your audience's core relationships and
values. When your argument conflicts with what your
audience believes, you have two strategic options: adjust your
reasoning to better connect with their existing values or appeal
to a higher shared value that transcends the disagreement. For
example, if arguing for a policy that challenges local traditions,
you might appeal to broader values like fairness or community
wellbeing that your audience also holds dear.

   The biggest tip: fill your toolbox! As you grow as a
researcher, reasoner, and argument builder, you will find that
you will learn the most from direct interaction with your
audience. Do audience analysis, keep going back to your
sources for trusted support, brainstorm when you're
motivated, and gather different types of support to plug and
play depending on your location and audience.

       Motivated reasoning: Using reasoning to
       protect your existing beliefs.

community forum, or engaging online, your credibility
depends on your ability to back your ideas with thoughtful,
ethical support.

   As you step beyond the podium, remember that every
argument you construct, spoken or written, is an act of civic
participation. The way you select, verify, and explain your
evidence determines whether your audience perceives you as
trustworthy and informed or careless and uncritical. In a world
flooded with misinformation and AI-generated content, your
commitment to credible, reasoned communication is what
distinguishes you as an ethical communicator.

   In the next chapter, we'll shift our focus from what you
say to how you begin saying it. You'll learn how to craft
introductions that grab attention, establish credibility, and
preview your central message--setting the stage for arguments
that not only inform but inspire.

          Key Takeaways

             use causal, analogical, or sign reasoning as
             needed.
           Use numbers and visuals with context so the
             audience understands why they matter;
             prioritize quality over quantity.
           Guard against reasoning errors: avoid circular
             arguments, red herrings, false authority, leaps
             from correlation to causation, and probability
             stated as certainty.
           Establish credibility in delivery with clear oral
             citations (author, credentials when relevant,
             title, source, date) and audience-centered
             explanations.
           Treat AI as a brainstorming partner, not a
             source of truth; verify all AI outputs and
             watch for bias, oversimplification, and
             hallucinations.

8.0: INTRODUCTIONS
MATTER - HOW TO
BEGIN A SPEECH
EFFECTIVELY

   Tiffany Petricini

When most people think about public speaking, they imagine
someone standing behind a podium, delivering polished lines
to a silent crowd. But in today's world, public speaking goes
far beyond the podium. Whether you're presenting in a
classroom, recording a video for social media, or joining a
virtual team meeting, how you begin matters. Your
introduction is your first opportunity to shape how others
listen--and whether they choose to listen at all.

   A good introduction isn't just a warm-up. It's an invitation.
It frames your purpose, connects you to your audience, and
sets the tone for everything that follows. In some settings, you
may only have a few seconds to make an impression. Audiences
today are used to scrolling, skipping, and filtering content in
seconds. That's why it's more important than ever to know
how to start strong.

   This chapter will help you move beyond generic openings
478 | 8.0: INTRODUCTIONS MATTER - HOW TO BEGIN A SPEECH
EFFECTIVELY

like "Hi, my name is..." and into powerful introductions that
capture attention, build credibility, and prepare your audience
to engage. We'll also explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can
support your brainstorming process--and where it might lead
you astray if you're not careful.

   Introductions typically make up only 10-15% of your total
speech time. In a five-minute speech, your introduction might
last just 30 to 45 seconds. But in that short span, a lot must
happen. A strong introduction should do the following:

   Grab the audience's attention
   Establish relevance and give them a reason to care
   Clearly state your thesis or purpose
   Build your credibility
   Preview the structure of your speech
   Set the appropriate tone for your topic and context

Throughout this chapter, we'll explore each of these goals in
depth. You'll learn how to select the right attention-getter,
craft a clear and compelling thesis, and structure an
introduction that invites real listening.

          Beyond the Podium Insight

    In a world of deepfakes, AI-generated

influencers, and information overload, public
speaking is no longer just a performance--it's a
form of responsibility. Your introduction is a
signal: What kind of speaker are you? Why
should anyone trust what you say? Whether
you're addressing a classroom or recording a
TikTok explainer, your intro shapes your
credibility and your civic voice. That's why
going beyond the podium means going beyond
performance--it means beginning with
purpose.

     AI Insight: Can AI Write My Intro?

Tools like ChatGPT or Copilot can help
brainstorm ideas for your introduction, suggest
attention-getters, or organize your thoughts.
But they should never replace your voice. AI-
generated introductions are often vague or
generic. Use AI to spark ideas--but personalize
everything you say, and always fact-check.
Your audience wants you, not a machine.

engage. While introductions typically make up just 10 to 15
percent of your total speaking time, they hold enormous
weight in shaping how your audience perceives you and your
message.

   Whether you're speaking in person, recording for digital
platforms, or preparing remarks for hybrid or asynchronous
audiences, your introduction must do six key things:

1. Grab the Audience's Attention

Before anything else, you need your audience to look up, lean
in, or at least not mentally check out. Attention is the currency
of communication--and in today's media-saturated world, it's
in short supply.

   Effective attention-getters might include:

   A surprising statistic
   A vivid anecdote
   A rhetorical question
   A powerful quotation
   A brief story
   A relevant joke (if appropriate and ethical)

colored segments, each representing a different method to grab
an audience's attention in a speech introduction. Each method
is labeled and described:

   Surprising Statistic (top left, gold):
          Description: "Use data or facts to amaze your
            listeners."

   Brief Story (top right, yellow-orange):
          Description: "Narrate a short, illustrative tale."

   Powerful Quotation (middle right, red-orange):
          Description: "Share a compelling quote that
            supports your topic."

   Rhetorical Question (bottom right, navy blue):
          Description: "Pose a question for the audience to
            consider."

   Vivid Anecdote (bottom left, teal):
          Description: "Tell a brief, memorable personal
            story."

   Surprising Statistic (top left, mustard yellow):
          Repeated description to emphasize a data-driven
            approach.

Each segment is shaped like a pie slice and evenly spaced
around the central circle. The diagram uses bold colors to
differentiate each option and is designed to be visually

This step builds both attention and trust. It also aligns with
what communication scholars call receiver-centered
communication, which prioritizes the needs, perspectives,
and experiences of the audience (Beebe & Beebe, 2022).

3. State the Purpose and Thesis of
Your Speech

Your thesis statement is the core idea of your speech. It should
be clear, concise, and specific. It often answers the question:
What do you want your audience to know, feel, or do by
the end of your speech?
490 | 8.1: THE SIX FUNCTIONS OF AN EFFECTIVE INTRODUCTION

Examples:

Weak - "Today I'm going to talk about
recycling."

Strong - "Today I'll show you how small
changes in our daily habits--like how we sort
trash or reduce packaging--can significantly
reduce landfill waste and environmental harm."

As public speaking researcher Stephen Lucas (2020)
emphasizes, a clear central idea is essential for guiding both the
audience's understanding and the speaker's structure.

4. Build Credibility (Establish Ethos)

Aristotle called this ethos--the speaker's credibility. Modern
scholars (McCroskey & Teven, 1999) identify three
components of credibility:

            1. Competence: Are you

                        2. Trustworthiness: Do you seem

This is called the preview

statement. It tells the audience

what's coming next and shows that your speech is organized.

Strong previews function like a GPS for your audience,

especially if their attention drifts and needs to reengage.

Example:

"To understand the impact of smart home
devices, I'll first explain how they collect data,
then discuss how that data is used by
companies, and finally explore what you can do
to protect your privacy."
492 | 8.1: THE SIX FUNCTIONS OF AN EFFECTIVE INTRODUCTION

Baker (1965) found that speakers perceived as disorganized
were rated significantly lower in credibility than speakers who
gave clear previews and followed them.

6. Set the Tone for the Speech

Introductions don't just deliver content--they shape
expectations. Are you giving a serious policy pitch? A heartfelt
personal story? A motivational call to action? Your language,
tone, and style should match your purpose and context.

   Tone-setting also helps audiences decide how to listen. A
humorous opener may signal levity and playfulness, while a
solemn story may signal the need for reflection.

   If your audience expects something different from
your tone (too serious, too casual, too fast, etc.), it can
create confusion or discomfort. Think of tone-setting as
emotional framing.

Activity Introduction: An effective introduction is more
than a formality--it's the launchpad for your speech. This
activity will help you distinguish between strategies that
strengthen an opening and choices that weaken it, so you can

recognize the habits you want to build and the ones you
should avoid.

Wrap-Up: The strongest introductions combine clear
purpose, audience connection, and credibility. As you
develop your own, aim for choices that invite your
audience in, set the right tone, and make them want to
hear more.

Summary: Why These Six
Functions Matter

An introduction is your chance to shape attention, credibility,
structure, and tone. As we move beyond the podium and into
hybrid, digital, and AI-augmented communication spaces,
494 | 8.1: THE SIX FUNCTIONS OF AN EFFECTIVE INTRODUCTION

these six elements remain essential--but how you achieve them
might change. Whether you're recording a one-minute pitch
or standing before a live audience, a strong intro sets
everything else in motion.

8.2: CHOOSING A
COMPELLING
ATTENTION-GETTER

   Tiffany Petricini

Learning Objectives

 1. Define what an attention-getter is and explain its role in
      the speech introduction.

 2. Identify and evaluate the four key considerations for
      selecting an effective attention-getting strategy: audience,
      purpose, topic, and occasion.

 3. Describe and differentiate among at least eight types of
      attention-getting devices, including examples.

 4. Assess the appropriateness of various attention-getting
      strategies for different audiences and speaking contexts.

 5. Recognize the ethical considerations when using humor,
      shock, or AI-generated content to capture audience
      attention.

Grabbing your audience's attention is the first--and often
most important--step of any speech introduction. In today's
media landscape, where attention is fragmented and
496 | 8.2: CHOOSING A COMPELLING ATTENTION-GETTER

competition for it is fierce, speakers must open in a way that
earns audience focus quickly and authentically. Whether
you're presenting in person, on video, or through a digital
platform, how you begin shapes whether your audience
chooses to keep listening.

   An attention-getter is a brief, purposeful device used at the
very beginning of a speech to draw listeners in and spark
interest in the topic.

     Example:

    "Imagine waking up one morning to discover
    your online identity has been stolen by an AI
    system that mimicked your voice and face."

This opening doesn't just shock--it creates curiosity
and urgency, both powerful motivators for attention.

Four Key Considerations for
Choosing an Attention-Getter

Before selecting your opening, consider the following:

   Audience - What is their background, interest,
      knowledge level, or investment in your topic?
           8.2: CHOOSING A COMPELLING ATTENTION-GETTER | 497

   Purpose - Is your goal to inform, persuade, or entertain?
   Topic - Does your attention-getter align with the

      speech's subject?
   Occasion - Is the setting formal or informal? Live or

      digital? Does it call for humor, reflection, or urgency?

Watch for redundancy: Avoid saying your opener is both
"appropriate and relevant"--choose one. Precision helps your
speech feel intentional and concise.

Types of Attention-Getters

Scholar E.E. Miller (1946) identified 11 common attention-
getting techniques. Below is an updated and student-friendly
version of this list, with examples and practical guidance.

Wrap-Up: Every attention-getter works best when it fits both
your message and your audience's expectations. Use this
exercise to build a mental toolbox of strategies you can adapt
for any speaking situation.

          AI Insight

    Yes--AI tools like ChatGPT can help you
    brainstorm attention-getters, especially for
    unfamiliar or technical topics. However:

          Always check facts from trusted
            sources.

          Revise for tone and audience.
          Don't use AI-generated humor or stories

            unless they're edited for clarity,
            relevance, and authenticity.

Learning Objectives

 1. Identify the six key components of an effective
      introduction within a sample speech.

 2. Analyze how each component functions to support
      audience engagement, clarity, and credibility.

 3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the speaker's tone, content,
      and organization.

 4. Reflect on how introduction strategies apply across live,
      digital, and AI-influenced speech contexts.

Let's take everything we've learned so far and apply it to a real-
world example. Below is the introduction to a speech about
AI-generated influencers--digital personas that look and act
like real people but are created entirely by algorithms. As you
read, look for the six elements of an effective introduction:

     Sample Introduction: AI Influencers and the Future
     of Trust

     "You've probably heard of Instagram
     influencers--but what if I told you some of the most
     popular ones aren't even real?

     Meet Lil Miquela: She has over 2 million followers,
     promotes fashion brands like Prada, and has
     released multiple singles on Spotify. She also doesn't
     exist. Lil Miquela is an AI-generated
     influencer--completely virtual, but deeply embedded
     in real human networks.

     As AI technology improves, we're seeing more digital
     personas being treated like real people. Companies
     are investing millions into virtual influencers, and
     audiences are often unaware that the person they're
     following is fictional.

     As a digital media researcher and content creator,
     I've been tracking this trend closely--and what it
     reveals about trust, identity, and authenticity in
     online spaces.

     Today, I'll explain how AI influencers are created,
506 | 8.3: ANALYZING A SAMPLE INTRODUCTION: FROM HOOK TO
CREDIBILITY

     why they're so appealing to brands, and what their
     rise tells us about the future of human
     communication. First, we'll break down the
     technology behind these avatars. Then, I'll share
     examples of how they're used in marketing. Finally,
     we'll examine the ethical and cultural questions they
     raise about truth, influence, and emotional
     connection."

          AI Insight

    Yes, an AI tool could generate a basic version of
    this introduction. It is important to remember
    that personal connection, ethical framing, and
    nuanced tone shows the audience intention,
    voice, and perspective, all of which are
    individual.

          Beyond the Podium Insight

    Introductions like this move beyond
    performance--they frame civic questions about
    authenticity, digital culture, and who we trust.
    In a world of deepfakes and algorithmically
    designed personas, public speaking becomes a
    way of reclaiming human connection and
    critical voice.

Try It: Can You Tell Who Wrote It?

Activity Introduction: AI can create speech openings that
sound convincing--but can you tell the difference between
human and AI-generated hooks? This activity will help you
evaluate openings for authenticity, specificity, and
engagement, while raising your awareness of AI's strengths
and limitations in public speaking.

   Activity Instructions: Students are given 6 brief speech
hooks about AI and technology -- half human-written, half
AI-generated. They must match each to either "AI" or
"Human," then explain how they knew.

8.5: CONCLUSION:
OPENING THE DOOR TO
CONNECTION

   Tiffany Petricini

Introductions are more than the first words of your
speech--they are the moment you invite your audience into
your message. By crafting a strong attention-getter, building
credibility, and previewing your main points, you lay the
groundwork for trust, curiosity, and engagement.

   In this chapter, you explored how introductions can be
powered by creativity, authenticity, and strategic
thinking--and how AI can serve as both a brainstorming
partner and a potential trap for formulaic or impersonal
openings. You also saw that the skills you develop here apply
far beyond public speaking, shaping first impressions in
personal, professional, and digital spaces.

   But an introduction is only the beginning. In the next
chapter, we will turn to the body of the speech--the place
where ideas are developed, evidence is presented, and your
message gains depth. We'll explore how to organize main
points, support them with credible material, and maintain
514 | 8.5: CONCLUSION: OPENING THE DOOR TO CONNECTION

momentum so your audience stays with you from start to
finish.

          Key Takeaways
     Your introduction sets the tone for the entire
     speech--capturing attention, establishing credibility,
     and previewing your message.

           Attention-getters should be tailored to your
             audience and purpose, whether they use
             stories, questions, statistics, or humor.

           Establishing credibility combines expertise,
             authenticity, and connection--not just a list of
             qualifications.

           Preview statements guide your audience,
             making it easier for them to follow and
             remember your main points.

           AI can help brainstorm hooks, research
             content, and structure previews, but it should
             be refined to reflect your authentic voice.

           Beyond speeches, introduction skills enhance
             everyday interactions--from networking to
             digital communication.

           A strong introduction makes a promise your
             body should fulfill--transitioning naturally
    8.5: CONCLUSION: OPENING THE DOOR TO CONNECTION | 515

             into your main points.

From Ideas to Impact

In the digital age, the "body" of a speech is no longer bound
by the walls of a classroom or the space behind a podium.
Whether you're giving a TED-style talk, recording a podcast,
or pitching ideas in a remote meeting, your message lives (or
dies) by its structure. Today's audiences aren't just passive
listeners--they're active processors, constantly deciding
whether to engage, scroll, or tune out. To go beyond the
podium means designing the core of your message with
intention, clarity, and adaptability. It means understanding
how structure builds trust--and how that trust travels across
live, digital, and algorithmic environments.

   This chapter will show you how to turn purpose into
points, points into impact, and structure into power. You'll
learn how to organize your message in ways that resonate,
persuade, and endure.

Learning Objectives

 1. Revisit the function of a specific purpose.
 2. Understand how to make the transition from a specific

      purpose to a series of main points.
 3. Be able to narrow a speech from all the possible points to

      the main points.
 4. Explain how to prepare meaningful main points.

If your speech were a meal, the body would be the main course.
The body is where you dig into your core message, nourish
your audience with ideas, and give them something to chew
on after it's over. It's the heart of your message, where your
credibility is built, your purpose comes alive, and your
audience decides whether they'll remember (or forget) what
you said.

   A serving of broccoli labeled "INTRODUCTION" is
      positioned to the upper left of the steak, representing the
      opening portion of the speech.

   A small cup of dessert labeled "CONCLUSION" is
      placed below the broccoli, symbolizing the closing
      section of the speech.

Above the plate, in bold letters, it reads: "THE SPEECH AS A

   CONCLUSION (labeled under dessert)

So how do you structure that main course? And more
importantly, how do you make sure it lands?

   Let's start with what we know from research. Back in the
mid-20th century, early communication scholars like Smith
      9.1: DETERMINING YOUR MAIN IDEAS OBJECTIVES | 523

(1951), Thompson (1960), and Baker (1965) conducted

studies that revealed something pretty straightforward but

powerful: audiences can tell when a speech is disorganized, and

they don't like it. Disorganized speeches are harder to follow,

harder to remember, and harder to trust. Organized speeches,

on the other hand, are more persuasive, more credible, and

more likely to stick in the minds of listeners.

That's why structuring your

speech isn't just a technical skill.

It's  a  communication                     Beyond the

superpower. It helps you connect      Podium Insight

with people, earn their trust, and    A well-organized
                                      speech isn't just
move them from knowing to             easier to

caring to doing. In this section,     easier to trust. In

                  that names who your audience is,

                  what you want to accomplish, and

how you'll do it. For example:

 To inform a group of school administrators about
   open-source educational software.

 To persuade college students to switch from Microsoft
   Office to OpenOffice.

 To entertain a business group with a comical
   commercial for paid software, celebrating the rise of free
   tools.

Even though all three examples are about open-source
software, each one has a different purpose and audience--and
that's what makes each speech unique.

   Once you've locked in your specific purpose, you can begin
crafting your main points, the pillars of your message.

Title: From Purpose to Points
   Flowchart Steps:
   GENERAL PURPOSE
   SPECIFIC PURPOSE
   MAIN POINTS

Your main points are the core ideas that help you fulfill your
purpose. They're not just a list of things you want to
say--they're a carefully chosen set of messages that help your
audience understand, remember, and care.
528 | 9.1: DETERMINING YOUR MAIN IDEAS OBJECTIVES

How Many Points?

For most student speeches, aim for 3-5 main points. Why?
People can only hold so much in their short-term memory
(Cowan, 2001; Miller, 1956)

   More points often means less depth per point.
   Clear, focused ideas are easier to support--and easier for
your audience to retain.
   A good rule of thumb:

   Under 3 minutes? Stick to 2 points.
   3-10 minutes? Go with 3 points.
   Longer? You can add more but stay strategic.

How to Choose Your Points

Start by brainstorming: write down every possible idea, fact,
or insight that supports your purpose. Don't worry about
organizing yet--just dump it all out.

   Then chunk similar ideas together. Look for natural
groupings or themes that emerge. From there, identify the
essential ideas that your audience needs in order to walk away
informed, persuaded, or entertained. Those become your main
points.
        9.1: DETERMINING YOUR MAIN IDEAS OBJECTIVES | 529

Example:
Specific Purpose: To inform school administrators
about using open-source software.
Brainstorm:

      What is open-source software?
      Why does it matter?
      Pros and cons
      History
      Examples used in schools
      Needs of the audience
      Security concerns

Chunked Main Points:

      What is open-source software?
      What are its benefits and drawbacks for

        schools?
      What tools should school administrators

        consider?

You've now moved from a pile of ideas to a focused
structure.
530 | 9.1: DETERMINING YOUR MAIN IDEAS OBJECTIVES

          AI Insight

    AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini can help you
    brainstorm a list of possible points or examples.
    For instance, you might prompt: "List 10 main
    points for a 5-minute speech on [your topic]."
    But the real work is curating. Choose the points
    that align with your audience, your purpose,
    and your voice. Never let the tool override your
    intention.

5 Principles for Building Strong
               9.1: DETERMINING YOUR MAIN IDEAS OBJECTIVES | 531

Main Points

1. Unity: Do They All Belong?

Every point you include should serve your specific purpose.
If it doesn't move the audience closer to that goal, leave it out,
even if it's interesting to you.

2. Separation: Are They Distinct?

Avoid overlapping ideas. Each main point should feel different
from the others. If two points are too similar, combine or
reframe them.

   Not this:

   Apples are healthy.
   Oranges are healthy.
   Fruit is healthy.

Better:

   Fruit provides essential vitamins.
   Fruit improves digestion.
   Fruit lowers disease risk.
532 | 9.1: DETERMINING YOUR MAIN IDEAS OBJECTIVES

3. Balance: Are They Evenly
Developed?

Make sure you're not spending 4 minutes on one point and 30
seconds on another. If one point is too big, break it into two.
If one is too small, either expand it or cut it.

4. Parallelism: Do They Sound Alike?

Your audience will remember your message better if your
points are phrased in a similar way.

     Example:

    Define open-source software.

     Explain how schools use software.
     Describe three free software tools.
      These vary too much in tone and structure.
     Better:
     Define open-source software.
     Describe how it works in schools.
     Recommend useful open-source tools.
      The repetition in form supports memory.
               9.1: DETERMINING YOUR MAIN IDEAS OBJECTIVES | 533

5. Logical Flow: Do They Make Sense
in Order?

Sometimes it makes sense to go chronologically, sometimes
cause-to-effect, and sometimes general-to-specific. What
matters most is whether your audience will be able to follow
your progression without getting lost. If the order feels off,
trust your gut and revise.

9.2: USING COMMON
ORGANIZING PATTERNS

   Tiffany Petricini

Learning Objectives

 1. Differentiate among the common speech organizational
      patterns: categorical/topical, comparison/contrast,
      spatial, chronological, biographical, causal, problem-
      cause-solution, and psychological.

 2. Understand how to choose the best organizational
      pattern, or combination of patterns, for a specific
      speech.

Organizing for Impact: Choosing
a Structure That Works

Once you've identified your main points, the next step is to
decide how to organize them. The way you sequence your
ideas matters. It shapes how your audience understands,
processes, and remembers what you say.

   Think of your organizational pattern like a map for your
message. You're guiding listeners from one idea to the next,
                     9.2: USING COMMON ORGANIZING PATTERNS | 535

and the route you take should feel natural and intentional.
There's no single right path, but there are proven structures
that help your ideas travel clearly.

   Let's explore some of the most common ways to organize
a speech and how to choose one that fits your message--and
your audience.

Figure 9.3 Common Ways to Organize
                    a Speech

points, from timelines and locations to causes, problems,
and solutions. Design by Tiffany Petricini.

Image Description

The image presents eight icons, each representing a different
method of organizing a speech, arranged in two rows beneath
the title "Eight Common Organizational Patterns". Each icon
is accompanied by a label underneath it.

   Top Row (left to right):

   Chronological - Icon of a calendar, indicating a time-
      based sequence.

   Spatial - Icon of a folded map with a location pin,
      suggesting geographic or physical arrangement.

   Causal - Icon of a right-facing arrow, symbolizing cause-
      and-effect relationships.

   Compare-Contrast - Icon of a balanced scale,
      illustrating the evaluation of similarities and differences.

Bottom Row (left to right):

   Topical - Icon of a circle with horizontal lines,
      representing a category-based or theme-driven structure.

   Problem-Solution - Icon of a warning triangle with an
      exclamation mark, representing issue and resolution.

   Problem-Cause-Solution - Icon of a triangle with a
      lightbulb, suggesting deeper analysis before proposing a
      fix.

   Refutation - Icon of a document with an "X,"
      symbolizing rebuttal or discrediting of opposing
                     9.2: USING COMMON ORGANIZING PATTERNS | 537

      arguments.

The icons use red, blue, and black line art for visual clarity and
differentiation.

Title: Eight Common Organizational Patterns
   Patterns (with icons):

   Chronological
   Spatial
   Causal
   Compare-Contrast
   Topical
   Problem-Solution
   Problem-Cause-Solution
   Refutation

1. Categorical / Topical Pattern

Best for: speeches where the main points are distinct but
connected by a larger theme.

   In a topical pattern, you organize your points by categories
or chunks. Each section covers a unique part of your overall
topic.
538 | 9.2: USING COMMON ORGANIZING PATTERNS

     Example:
     Specific Purpose: To persuade high school juniors to
     apply to Generic University
     Main Points:

           Life in the dorms
           Life in the classroom
           Life on campus

These categories could be rearranged without losing clarity.
It's the structure you reach for when your speech covers
different facets of the same idea.

2. Comparison / Contrast Pattern

Best for: showing similarities and differences between two
things.

   This pattern helps listeners weigh options or perspectives.
It's especially useful when you want to highlight key
distinctions that matter.

     Example:
                     9.2: USING COMMON ORGANIZING PATTERNS | 539

     Specific Purpose: To inform physicians about Drug X
     and Drug Y
     Main Points:

           How the drugs are similar
           How they differ
     Want to go deeper? Add a first point to introduce
     both options:
     What are Drug X and Drug Y?
           Similarities
           Differences

This structure works well when helping people compare
choices or shift opinions.

3. Spatial Pattern

Best for: topics involving physical space, location, or anatomy.
In this pattern, you organize your ideas by where things
are--north to south, left to right, inside to outside, etc.
540 | 9.2: USING COMMON ORGANIZING PATTERNS

     Example (geographic):
     Specific Purpose: To inform history students about
     Confederate states
     Main Points:

           States near the Mason-Dixon Line
           Deep South states
           Western Confederate states
     Example (body system):
     Specific Purpose: To explain how the urinary system
     works
     Main Points:
           Kidneys and ureters
           Bladder
           Urethra and sphincter

This pattern helps visual learners and makes complex systems
easier to follow.

4. Chronological Pattern

Best for: anything with a timeline like history, process, or
personal story. Here, you organize your speech based on time
                     9.2: USING COMMON ORGANIZING PATTERNS | 541

order. You can go forward (past  present  future) or
backward (future  past).

     Example:
     Specific Purpose: To inform my audience about
     Churchill's writings
     Main Points:

           Writings before WWII
           Writings during WWII
           Writings after WWII

Chronological structures are intuitive. We're wired to
understand sequences--and this helps listeners track your
story.

5. Biographical Pattern

Best for: telling the story of a person's life or career. This can
be your life, someone else's, or a public figure. It often follows
a timeline, but you can also organize by themes or turning
points.
542 | 9.2: USING COMMON ORGANIZING PATTERNS

     Example:
     Specific Purpose: To inform about the early life of
     Marilyn Manson
     Main Points:

           Early life and feud with Christianity
           Journalism career
           Creation of Marilyn Manson persona

This structure works well for entertainment, celebration, or
reflection speeches.

6. Causal Pattern (Cause  Effect or
Effect  Cause)

Best for: showing why something happens and what it leads
to.

   Causal structures help your audience understand
relationships and implications.

     Example (cause  effect):
                     9.2: USING COMMON ORGANIZING PATTERNS | 543

     Specific Purpose: To explain alcohol abuse in
     communities
     Main Points:

           History and prevalence (cause)
           Health and social effects (effect)
     Example (effect  causes):
     Specific Purpose: To explain high domestic violence
     arrests in one city
     Main Points:
           Arrest data and patterns (effect)
           Possible causes (reporting, policing,

             community awareness)

This is a good fit for informative or analytical speeches.

7. Problem-Cause-Solution Pattern

Best for: persuasive speeches where you want to change minds
or behaviors.

   This pattern walks your audience through an issue:

   What's the problem?
   What's causing it?
544 | 9.2: USING COMMON ORGANIZING PATTERNS

   What should we do about it?

     Example:
     Specific Purpose: To persuade voters to support a
     citywide curfew
     Main Points:

           Vandalism and violence among youth is
             increasing

           Most incidents happen after 10 p.m.
           A curfew would reduce those incidents

This structure works when you want to build urgency and
offer clear solutions.

8. Psychological Pattern

Best for: arguments that follow a logical, persuasive
flow--especially where A leads to B, and B leads to C.

     Example:
              9.2: USING COMMON ORGANIZING PATTERNS | 545

Specific Purpose: To persuade nurses to use humor
in healing
Main Points:

      Humor affects the body (A)
      These effects improve healing (B)
      Nurses can apply humor in practice (C)

Psychological patterns work well when you're guiding people
through a mental journey, especially in motivational or
behavioral speeches.

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand the importance of transitions within a
      speech.

 2. Identify and be able to use a variety of transition words
      to create effective transitions within a speech.

 3. Understand how to use a variety of strategies to help
      audience members keep up with a speech's content:
      internal previews, internal summaries, and signposts.

How to Stay Clear, Connected,
and Coherent

Have you ever listened to a speech and suddenly thought,
"Wait... what are we talking about now?" If so, the speaker
probably skipped a crucial part of communication:
signposting. In a written essay, readers can pause, re-read, and
track your argument visually. But in a speech, your words fly
by in real time. Once they're gone, they're gone.
                                 9.3: KEEPING YOUR SPEECH MOVING | 549

   That's why structure isn't enough--you also need clarity.
This section will help you use transitions, previews,
summaries, and signposts to guide your listeners through your
speech like a well-marked trail.

   In short: you're not just giving a speech--you're leading a
journey.

a landscape-style illustration to represent the progression of a
speech.

   Starting point: A yellow flag labeled "Intro" is planted on a
hill at the river's origin.

   Along the river: The river flows past green hills labeled
"Main Point 1" (appears twice on opposite sides) and "Main
Point 2." Two arched bridges labeled "Transition" span the
river between these sections, indicating smooth movement
from one idea to the next.

   End point: A final yellow flag labeled "Conclusion" appears
on a hill at the end of the river.

   The image includes trees and soft hills to evoke a natural,
flowing path, reinforcing the idea that a well-structured speech
should feel like a guided, coherent experience for the audience.

552 | 9.3: KEEPING YOUR SPEECH MOVING

The Secret Sauce: Transitions

Think of transitions like verbal bridges: they help listeners
move smoothly from one point to the next. Without them,
your speech can feel like a series of disconnected ideas.

   A good transition does two things:

   Reminds the audience what they just heard.
   Prepares them for what's coming next.

     Example:
             "Now that we've explored the causes of food
             insecurity in urban neighborhoods, let's turn
             to some innovative programs that are making
             a difference."

     This one sentence reorients your audience,
     reinforces structure, and renews their attention.

          AI Insight: Be Careful with AI Transitions

    AI-generated transitions often sound
                                 9.3: KEEPING YOUR SPEECH MOVING | 553

    formulaic or repetitive. If every paragraph
    begins with "Now that we've discussed...",
    your speech may start to feel robotic. Use AI
    to draft--but always read it aloud and revise.
    Good transitions have rhythm and intention,
    not just clarity.

Transition Words and Phrases

Here's a toolbox of useful transition types and examples:
554 | 9.3: KEEPING YOUR SPEECH MOVING

Try It: Transitions that Work

Activity Introduction: Strong transitions are like the
connective tissue of your speech. They keep your ideas linked
and your audience oriented. In this quick exercise, you'll
identify the purpose of common transition phrases so you can
choose and adapt them more effectively in your own speeches

   Activity Instructions: Choose the best label for each
transition phrase in the sentence.

   Wrap Up: This activity strengthens students' ability to
recognize transition types, improving speech flow and clarity.
Recognizing transition types makes it easier to build flow into
your speech. The more you can vary and purposefully place
your transitions, the more confident and connected your
delivery will feel.

          Beyond the Podium Insight

    Attention spans are shorter and competition
    for focus is higher. On platforms like TikTok,
    Instagram Reels, or video shorts, content lives
    or dies in the first few seconds. Transitions
    aren't filler--they're fuel. Learning to guide
    your audience from point to point with clarity
556 | 9.3: KEEPING YOUR SPEECH MOVING

    is not just a speaking skill; it's a digital literacy
    skill.

Internal Previews

Internal previews are like short "coming up next" trailers
inside your speech. They help listeners know what to expect
within a major section.

     Example:
             "To understand why climate action is urgent,
             we'll first look at the latest scientific data,
             then we'll examine the economic risks of
             inaction."

     This approach not only clarifies your structure--it
     gives your audience a reason to stay tuned.

Tip: Use internal previews when:

   You're covering multiple ideas in one main point.
   You're shifting into complex or unfamiliar material.

Try It: Make It Memorable: Practice
Parallelism

Activity Introduction: Parallel structure isn't just a grammar
trick--it's a memory tool. This short exercise will help you
rewrite phrases so they have a consistent rhythm and style,
making them easier for your audience to follow and remember.

                   An interactive H5P element has been

        beyondthepodium/?p=131#h5p-38

   Wrap Up: Parallel structure makes your main points easier
to follow and more memorable.

   When your points "sound" alike in structure, your audience
can grasp them faster and recall them longer. Use this
technique to reinforce your message's clarity and impact.

Internal Summaries

Just like previews help listeners know where you're going,
internal summaries help them remember where they've
been. These quick recaps reinforce memory and signal that
you're wrapping up a section.
                                 9.3: KEEPING YOUR SPEECH MOVING | 559

     Example:
             "So far, we've seen how student debt affects
             mental health, academic success, and future
             career choices."

     This is especially useful before moving on to a new
     topic or argument. You're reminding your audience:
     "Here's what we've covered--don't forget it."

Signposts

Think of signposts like road signs: they're short, simple cues
that help people follow your path.

   They often mark:

   The number of points: "First, second, third...
   The importance of a point: "What matters most here

      is..."
   A shift in tone or topic: "Let's pivot," "Now let's

      explore..."
560 | 9.3: KEEPING YOUR SPEECH MOVING

     Examples:
     "The first key to online credibility is consistency."
     "Next, let's examine how visual design impacts
     trust."
     "Finally, we'll talk about managing misinformation."

Use signposts when you want your audience to track your
structure in real time--especially in persuasive or
instructional speeches.

Billboard Signposts: Emphasizing Key
Ideas

While most signposts help with direction, some are more like
billboards: they signal importance. These attention-grabbing
cues say, "Hey, listen up--this matters."

     Examples:
     "This is the turning point in our story."

     These billboards help your audience know when to
     lean in.

Putting It All Together

Let's walk through an example to see how all four
tools--transitions, previews, summaries, and
signposts--might show up in a single speech:

       "We've looked at the rise of burnout among
       remote workers. (summary) Now, let's explore
       what employers are doing to prevent it.
       (transition) In this next section, we'll first
       examine flexible scheduling policies, then explore
       strategies for digital detox. (preview)
       The first solution is flexible scheduling.
       (signpost)...
       The second solution is digital detox programs.
       (signpost)...
562 | 9.3: KEEPING YOUR SPEECH MOVING

       So far, we've seen two creative ways companies
       are rethinking remote work. (internal summary)"
       See how smooth that flow is? It's not flashy, but
       it keeps your audience grounded and connected.
       You are your audience's guide--not just a
       speaker, but a translator, navigator, and
       storyteller. These simple tools--transitions,
       previews, summaries, and signposts--are your
       way of saying:
       "I've got you. You won't get lost."

When a speech flows well, it feels good to listen to. And when
your audience can follow your ideas, they're far more likely to
remember--and act on--what you say.

9.4: ANALYZING THE
BODY OF A SPEECH

   Tiffany Petricini

Learning Objectives

 1. See what a full speech body looks like in order to identify
      major components of the speech body.

Learning to See Structure in
Action

At this point, you've learned how to build the body of a
speech, from shaping your main points to choosing the right
structure to keeping everything flowing clearly. Now let's flip
the script and become the audience for a moment. What does
a well-organized body look like when it's actually written and
delivered?

   In this section, you'll practice breaking down the body of a
real speech to see how the strategies we've discussed play out in
action. Learning to analyze a speech from the inside out helps
you reverse-engineer powerful techniques and apply them to
your own work.
564 | 9.4: ANALYZING THE BODY OF A SPEECH

   Let's walk through a sample speech body, one paragraph
at a time, and then step back to evaluate how the speaker
constructed the message.

Speech Topic: Smart Dust

Main Point 1: What Is Smart Dust?

"To help us understand smart dust, we'll begin by examining
what it actually is. Dr. Kris Pister, a professor at the University
of California, Berkeley, originally introduced the concept in
1998. Funded by DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency), his goal was to create a device the size of a
cubic millimeter--about a fifth the size of a grain of rice--that
could contain sensors, a computer, and a communication
system. These mini-devices, called motes, could collect and
share data wirelessly. According to The New York Times, smart
dust could eventually be deployed across entire environments
to monitor changes in real time--from climate conditions to
infrastructure stress to biological changes."

   What's working here?

   Clear transition from intro to first main point.
   Strong definition and context for an unfamiliar topic.
   Use of specific sources and vivid comparisons (e.g.,

      "grain of rice") helps audience visualize scale.
                            9.4: ANALYZING THE BODY OF A SPEECH | 565

Main Point 2: Military Applications of
Smart Dust

"Now that we've covered what smart dust is, let's explore its
military potential. Because it was developed with defense
funding, many early applications were geared toward
surveillance and intelligence gathering. According to the Smart
Dust project team, possible uses include treaty monitoring,
tracking enemy movement, and even detecting weapons of
mass destruction. Major Scott Dickson from the U.S. Air
Force believes smart dust could help improve battlefield
awareness and overcome enemy attempts to jam
communication systems. Some researchers have even suggested
that smart dust could be deployed into space to detect
dangerous solar storms or debris that might threaten satellites
and human life."

   What's working here?

   Smooth transition phrase ("Now that we've covered...").
   Maintains topical/categorical organization--second

      major category of application.
   Ties evidence to real-world implications, building

      interest and relevance.
566 | 9.4: ANALYZING THE BODY OF A SPEECH

Main Point 3: Everyday and Medical
Uses of Smart Dust

"Let's shift our focus from military uses to how smart dust
could impact our daily lives. According to the Smart Dust
project website, these tiny sensors might be applied to our
fingertips to control devices with invisible keyboards. They
could track inventory in warehouses, ensure food freshness
during shipping, or monitor bridges for structural weakness.
In healthcare, smart dust might be injected into the human
body to monitor for early signs of cancer or infection, helping
doctors treat issues before symptoms even appear. The goal
is to make our world more responsive--bridging the physical
and digital in ways we've never experienced before."

   What's working here?

   A clear shift in tone and scope, announced explicitly
      ("Let's shift our focus...").

   Continues the topical pattern by covering a third
      category: civilian uses.

   Uses examples that are imaginative, specific, and
      audience-relevant.

What Organizational Pattern Is
This?

Topical/Categorical.
   The speaker divided a complex subject into three clear

categories of explanation. This helped the audience move from
unfamiliar tech to real-world impact.

   Speeches that stick with us do more than just share
information. They guide us through an experience. When the
body of a speech is well-organized, it creates clarity, builds
trust, and keeps listeners engaged from beginning to end. As
                            9.4: ANALYZING THE BODY OF A SPEECH | 569

you start building your own speeches, take a moment to step
back and ask:

   Do my main points follow a clear structure?
   Can I mark where each point begins and ends?
   Would someone listening for the first time be able to

      follow along?

Practicing this kind of analysis will help you level up your
own public speaking--and move your message far beyond the
podium.
570 | 9.5: CONCLUSION: STRUCTURE AS A BRIDGE BEYOND THE
PODIUM

9.5: CONCLUSION:
STRUCTURE AS A
BRIDGE BEYOND THE
PODIUM

   Tiffany Petricini

The body of your speech is where ideas take shape, credibility
is earned, and audiences decide whether to lean in or tune out.
In a world where communication extends across podiums,
screens, and algorithms, your structure is more than an
outline--it's a bridge. It connects your purpose to your
audience's needs, guiding them through your ideas with
intention and clarity.

   Going beyond the podium means understanding that your
speech structure is transferable. A well-organized message
doesn't just work in a classroom. It adapts to a livestream,
a podcast, a social media clip. It's portable, memorable, and
resilient enough to survive in fast-moving, fragmented
attention environments.

   As you refine your skills in building strong main points,
choosing effective organizational patterns, and keeping your

                                                                          PODIUM | 571

speech moving with smooth transitions, remember that every
choice you make in structure is also a choice in connection.

   In the next chapter, we'll turn our attention to
conclusions--the moment when your speech must leave a
lasting imprint. Just as a strong body carries your message
forward, a strong conclusion ensures it stays with your
audience long after the final word.

          Key Takeaways

           Structure builds trust. A well-organized
             body signals credibility, whether you're
             speaking live or online.

           Main points should serve your purpose.
             Every idea in your speech body must connect
             directly to your specific purpose.

           Choose patterns strategically. Match your
             organizational pattern to your topic, audience,
             and goal.

           Transitions are the glue. Previews,
             summaries, and signposts keep your audience
             oriented and engaged.

           Think beyond the moment. Build a
             structure that works across mediums, from
             the podium to digital platforms.

WITH POWER

   Tiffany Petricini

In a world where attention is fleeting and meaning is often
fragmented, how you end a message matters as much as how
you begin it. Audiences do not just remember your points.
They remember how you made them feel, what you asked of
them, and whether your final words offered a sense of clarity,
purpose, or inspiration.

   To go beyond the podium is to treat your conclusion as
more than a signal that the speech is over. It is the moment
you shape memory, trust, and impact. Whether you are closing
a classroom speech or recording a persuasive message online,
your conclusion is your last chance to leave something behind
that matters.

10.1: WHY
CONCLUSIONS MATTER

   Tiffany Petricini

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand the basic benefits of a strong conclusion.
 2. Explain the serial position effect and its importance on

      public speaking.

We've all experienced it: a speaker delivers a compelling and
engaging message. That is, until the last few seconds, when it
just ends. No final thought. No summary. No impact. Just
a mumbled "So, yeah... that's it." As an audience member,
this kind of conclusion feels disappointing. As a speaker, it's a
missed opportunity.

   Your conclusion is not simply a signal that your speech is
ending. It is your final chance to reinforce your message, re-
engage your audience, and leave a meaningful impression.
Conclusions matter because they shape what your audience
remembers and how they feel about what you've said.

Why Do So Many Speakers
                                     10.1: WHY CONCLUSIONS MATTER | 577

Struggle with Conclusions?

Many novice speakers devote so much energy to their
introductions and main points that the conclusion becomes
an afterthought. Others simply feel relieved to be done and
trail off. But the way a speech ends can significantly affect
how it is received and remembered. If a speech lacks a strong
closing, even the most compelling arguments can fade from
the audience's memory.

   A well-crafted conclusion can tie everything together,
remind listeners why the topic matters, and motivate them
to think or act differently. Whether you're delivering an
informative talk or a persuasive appeal, your conclusion is your
moment to anchor the message in your audience's minds.

to end abruptly or without resolution. A strong ending offers
closure, coherence, and impact. The same applies to your
speech. When you plan and practice your conclusion as
carefully as your introduction, you set your audience up to
understand and remember your core message.

   Let's return to the image of a bridge. The introduction
welcomes your audience onto the bridge, the body walks them
across your key points, and the conclusion brings them back
to solid ground. A strong conclusion helps the audience
disembark safely with something valuable to take with them.

   Flowchart Steps:

   Restate Thesis
   Review Points
   Concluding Device

A strong conclusion restates your thesis, reviews your main
points, and ends with a memorable device.

   A powerful conclusion does three essential things: it
reminds the audience of the purpose of the speech, reinforces
the key ideas, and leaves them with a final impression that
588 | 10.2: THE THREE KEY ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE
CONCLUSION

resonates. These steps aren't just formalities. They're strategic
tools that help your speech land with clarity and power.

1. Restate the Thesis

Start by restating your thesis in a clear and concise way. Your
thesis is the central idea or claim you made in your
introduction. It includes what your speech set out to prove,
explain, or explore. But instead of repeating it verbatim, you
can rephrase it in a way that reflects the journey your audience
has just gone on.

     Example:
             Original Thesis:
             "Social media platforms are reshaping how
             we form and maintain interpersonal
             relationships."
             Restated in conclusion:
             "Over the last few minutes, we've seen that
             social media doesn't just connect us--it
             redefines how we build and sustain
             relationships today."

     Restating the thesis shows your audience that your
                      10.2: THE THREE KEY ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE
                                                                  CONCLUSION | 589

     message has come full circle and reaffirms the
     importance of your central argument.

          AI Insight: "Test Drive" Your Thesis Restatement

    AI tools can offer rewordings that match a
    more reflective tone. Ask, "Can you restate this
    thesis for a speech conclusion?" Then revise it
    to reflect your own voice and perspective. The
    goal is not to copy but to spark a clearer
    version of what your audience just heard.

2. Review the Main Points

Oral communication relies heavily on repetition. Unlike
reading, your audience can't flip back a few pages to check
what you said. That's why reviewing your main points at the
end is so important. It helps solidify your message in their
memory.
590 | 10.2: THE THREE KEY ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE
CONCLUSION

     Example (reviewing three points): "Today, we looked
     at the evolution of social media platforms, the way
     they influence our communication habits, and their
     effects on intimacy and trust."

You don't need to recap every detail. Just reinforce the big
takeaways. Keep the tone confident and concise.

3. Use a Concluding Device

The final step in an effective conclusion is to select a strong
concluding device--something memorable, thought-
provoking, or action-driven that wraps up your message.
Think of it as your "mic drop" moment. The device should
match your speech's purpose and tone. This could be a
powerful quotation, a call to action, a visualization, a
rhetorical question, or another technique you'll explore in the
next section.

   Your goal is not just to finish but to finish well.

          Beyond the Podium Insight: Your Ending Builds

    When you close with intention, you reinforce

    purpose shows the audience that the message
    was designed, not improvised. A weak ending
    can undo a strong speech. A clear, confident
    one affirms trust.

   Reference to Audience

After restating your thesis and reviewing your main points, it's
time to leave your audience with something they won't forget.
This is where a concluding device comes in. A concluding
device is a final strategy such as a sentence, image, question,
challenge, or action. It helps your message linger long after
your speech ends.

   Communication scholar Elwood Murray Miller (1946)
identified ten distinct types of concluding devices frequently
used by speakers to create memorable endings. These
strategies, published in his article Speech Introductions and
Conclusions, remain foundational in public speaking
instruction today.

   Miller's taxonomy helps students and professionals alike
                      10.2: THE THREE KEY ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE
                                                                  CONCLUSION | 595

consider not just how to end a speech, but how that ending
should feel to the audience.

1. Challenge

A challenge urges your audience to take action or adopt a new
mindset. It requires effort and often appeals to motivation or
values.

     Example: "I challenge you to reduce your social
     media use by just 30 minutes a day--and see what
     changes."

2. Quotation

Using a powerful or poetic quote can reinforce your message.
Choose one that's relevant, meaningful, and brief.

     Example: "As Maya Angelou once said, `People will
     forget what you said... but they will never forget
     how you made them feel.'"
596 | 10.2: THE THREE KEY ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE
CONCLUSION

3. Summary

A summary is helpful when your speech has been long or
technical. It extends your point review for clarity but should
still be concise.
Use sparingly in short speeches.

4. Visualization of the Future

Help the audience imagine a changed world if your ideas are
adopted--or if they are ignored. This is especially effective in
persuasive speeches.

     Example: "Imagine a world where every child has
     access to clean water, not as a luxury, but as a right."

5. Appeal for Action

This device asks your audience to do something. It may be
a physical action (signing a petition) or a cognitive one
(changing a belief).

     Example: "If you care about privacy, write to your
     local representative today. Don't wait."

6. Inspiration

This approach aims to stir the emotions and leave listeners
uplifted. Often used in ceremonial or motivational speeches.
Conclude with a moving poem, story, or call for hope that
connects to your theme.

7. Advice

Offer a practical or expert recommendation, especially if your
speech presents you as a knowledgeable guide.

     Example: "If you're struggling to find your voice,
     start by listening closely to the stories around you."

8. Proposal of a Solution

End with a specific solution to a problem discussed in your
598 | 10.2: THE THREE KEY ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE
CONCLUSION

speech. This works well when the body of the speech was
diagnostic or problem-based.

     Example: "Let's begin by partnering with local
     organizations already doing this work."

9. Question

Asking a rhetorical question can provoke reflection. It should
invite the audience to think deeply without expecting an
answer.

     Example: "What kind of world do we want to leave
     for our grandchildren?"

10. Reference to Audience

Make the conclusion about your listeners--what the issue
means for them personally or how it connects to their lives.

     Example: "As students, you already have the power
     to shape change. The question is: will you?"

10.3: SAMPLE
CONCLUSION ANALYSIS

   Tiffany Petricini

Learning Objectives

 1. See what a full conclusion section looks like.
 2. Distinguish among the three parts of a conclusion.
Let's take what we've learned and apply it to a real-world
example. The following conclusion was written for an
informative speech about sleep and student success.

Sleep and Student Success

       "Today, we've explored how consistent sleep
       impacts students' academic performance by
       examining the science of sleep cycles, the effects
       of sleep deprivation, and practical strategies for
                               10.3: SAMPLE CONCLUSION ANALYSIS | 603

       better rest. While it's tempting to cut sleep to
       make time for more study or socializing, the
       evidence is clear: sleep isn't a luxury--it's a tool
       for success. As sleep scientist Matthew Walker
       (2017) warns, "The shorter your sleep, the
       shorter your life span." So tonight, choose
       rest--not just for yourself, but for your future."

Let's Break It Down

This brief paragraph includes the three essential parts of a
strong conclusion:

   Breakdown:

   Restated Thesis: The speaker reiterates that sleep is
      vital to student success.
      "...how consistent sleep impacts students' academic
      performance..."

   Review of Main Points: Summarizes the body: science
      of sleep, consequences of deprivation, and strategies.
      "...the science of sleep cycles, the effects of sleep deprivation,
      and practical strategies..."

   Concluding Device: Uses a powerful quotation from a
      sleep researcher and a call for reflection.
604 | 10.3: SAMPLE CONCLUSION ANALYSIS

      "`The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.'"

Why This Works

This conclusion is effective because it mirrors the structure
of the speech, reaffirms its relevance, and leaves the audience
thinking. Even though it's an informative speech, the speaker
builds ethical awareness and future-thinking into the
conclusion--without stepping into persuasion.

Ethical Speaking Reflection

Not all conclusions are created equal and not all are ethical.
   Strong conclusions often appeal to audience emotions, but

emotional content should never substitute for substance. It's
one thing to move an audience with a story that reinforces your
message. It's another to shock or manipulate them in order to
make up for weak content or poor preparation.

Use Emotion--Don't Abuse It

Ethical conclusions should be rooted in truth, aligned with
the speech's content, and respectful of the audience. If you're
informing, inspire curiosity or reflection. If you're persuading,
move people through reason and emotion together. Emotional
impact should deepen understanding, not replace it.

10.4: CONCLUSION:
LAST WORDS, LASTING
IMPACT

   Tiffany Petricini

A conclusion is not simply where a speech ends--it is where
meaning lingers. By restating your thesis, reviewing your
points, and choosing a powerful device, you shape how your
audience remembers your message and how they carry it
forward. To go beyond the podium is to recognize that endings
are not just closures but civic openings--moments that invite
reflection, trust, and action long after you finish speaking.

   In the next chapter, we shift from how to close with power
to how to structure your ideas effectively in the first place.
Outlining will give you the framework that ensures your
introduction, body, and conclusion flow together with clarity
and purpose.

          Key Takeaways
608 | 10.4: CONCLUSION: LAST WORDS, LASTING IMPACT

           Conclusions are more than endings; they
             shape memory, trust, and impact.

           The serial position effect shows audiences
             best remember what comes first and
             last--making conclusions crucial.

           An effective conclusion includes a restated
             thesis, a brief review of main points, and a
             memorable device.

           Miller's ten strategies (challenge, quote,
             summary, visualization, etc.) give speakers
             tools to close with power.

           Ethical conclusions inspire or inform without
             manipulating emotion or bypassing reasoning.

           Beyond the podium, strong conclusions build
             ethos and open space for continued reflection
             or action.

11.1 WHY OUTLINE?

   Jonathan Woodall

Learning Objectives

 1. Outlines help maintain the speech's focus on the thesis
      by allowing the speaker to test the scope of content,
      assess logical relationships between ideas, and evaluate
      the relevance of supporting ideas.

 2. Outlines help organize a message that the audience can
      understand by visually showing the balance and
      proportion of a speech.

 3. Outlines can help you deliver clear meanings by serving
      as the foundation for speaking notes you will use during
      your presentation.

 4. Use AI as a conversation partner in the process of
      creating an outline to test main points, organizational
      patterns, and clarity of ideas.

Every great speech starts with a great plan. For your speech
to be as effective as possible, it needs to be organized into
logical patterns. Information will need to be presented in a way
your audience can understand. This is especially true if you
already know a great deal about your topic. You will need to
614 | 11.1 WHY OUTLINE?

take careful steps to include pertinent information and explain
relationships your audience might not know and or be evident
to them. Using a standard outline format, you can make
decisions about your main points, the specific information you
will use to support those points, and the language you will
use. Without an outline, your message is liable to lose logical
integrity or focus. It might even deteriorate into a list of bullet
points with no apparent connection to each other except the
topic, leaving your audience confused about the topic and
relieved when your speech is finally over.

Professors often teach three types of outlines, and they can be
viewed as a series of stages in your speech preparation. First,
a working outline is an outline you use for developing your
speech. Once you are confident in the internal unity of your
basic message, you can begin filling in the supporting points
in descending detail--that is, from the general (main points)
to the (supporting points) and then to greater detail. This
second outline with everything you plan to say is called the
full-sentence outline. While this outline is great for
organization, it is not what you want to take to the podium
with you, and so the third type of outline professors

recommend is a speaking outline that condenses your full-
sentence outline to aid your extemporaneous delivery. More
about the types of outlines will follow this section.

   FULL-SENTENCE OUTLINE
   SPEAKING OUTLINE

A full-sentence outline lays a strong foundation for your
message. It will call on you to have one clear and specific
purpose for your message. As we have seen in other chapters
of this book, writing your specific purpose in clear language
serves you well. It helps you frame a clear, concrete thesis
statement. It helps you exclude irrelevant information while
focusing only on information that directly advances or
explains your thesis. It reduces the amount of research you
must do. It suggests what kind of supporting evidence is
needed, so less effort is expended in trying to figure out what
to do next. It helps both you and your audience remember the
central message of your speech.
                                                          11.1 WHY OUTLINE? | 619

   Finally, a solid full-sentence outline helps your audience
understand your message because they will be able to follow
your reasoning. Remember that live audiences for oral
communications lack the ability to "rewind" your message to
figure out what you said, so it is critically important to help the
audience follow your reasoning instantaneously in real time.

   Professors often note a reluctance among students to write
full-sentence outlines. It's a task too often perceived as
busywork, unnecessary, time consuming, and restricting. On
the one hand, those feelings of reluctance are understandable.
But on the other hand, students who carefully write a full-
sentence outline show a stronger tendency to give powerful
presentations of meaningful messages.

Try It: Purpose of the Outline

Activity Introduction: When giving a live speech, your
audience can't pause or replay what you've said, so your
outline must help them follow your reasoning clearly and
easily. Try this quick check to see why a full-sentence outline
matters.

Wrap-Up: Strong outlines guide your audience through your
ideas in real time--because unlike a video, a live speech doesn't
have a rewind button.

Tests Scope of Content

A clear, concrete thesis statement acts as a compass for your
outline. Each main point should directly advance or explain
your thesis. The test of the scope will be a comparison of each
main point to the thesis statement. If you find a poor match,
you will know you've wandered outside the scope of the thesis.

   Let's say the general purpose of your speech is to inform,
and your broad topic area is wind-generated energy. Now you
must narrow this to a specific purpose. You have many choices,
but let's say your specific purpose is to inform a group of
property owners about the economics of wind farms where
electrical energy is generated.

   Your first main point could be that modern windmills
require a very small land base, making the cost of real estate low
and directly related to economics. Then, you need to provide

evidence to support your claim that only a small land base is
needed.

      A strong outline keeps your ideas aligned with

The image features four concentric circles, with each circle
representing a level of speech content:

   Innermost circle (yellow): Labeled "Thesis" - this is the
      core idea of the speech.

   Second circle (blue): Surrounding the thesis, labeled
      with "Main Point" in three separate positions.

   Third circle (green): Also labeled with "Main Point" in
      three positions.

At the top of the image, the heading reads "Testing Scope of

   The overall idea visually demonstrates that:

   All main points must directly relate to and support the

finding authoritative sources of information to support that
claim.

AI as a Conversation Partner

One way to test the scope and focus of your main points is to
use Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a conversation partner during
your outline creative process. Just like a student might run an
idea by a friend, or professor after class, AI can be accessed as
a great tool during the establishment of an outline, so in this
chapter we will explore different ways to use AI and provide
some safeguards to make sure AI is a collaborative partner
in YOUR creative process, and not a cheap substitute for
substantive work on your part.

   For example, to check the relationship between your main
points and the thesis you have chosen, you can go to Microsoft
Copilot and type in a prompt. We will use the example of
wind-generated energy above to check the three main points
already established. The prompt was entered as follows:

   "I am outlining a speech that seeks to inform a group of
property owners about the economics of wind farms where
electrical energy is generated. I have come up with three main
points. First, modern windmills require a very small land base.
Second, once windmills are in place, they require virtually no
maintenance. Last, the cost for generating electrical energy
with windmills is lower compared to other sources. Do these

points advance my thesis in a way that the audience can
understand and how might I make them better?"

The response received from Copilot AI
was this:

"Modern Windmills Require a Very Small Land Base"
   Why it works: This addresses a common concern among

property owners--land use.
   How to improve:

   Clarify the benefit: Emphasize that the land around
      wind turbines can still be used for farming or grazing,
      which means dual land use.

   Use a comparison: For example, "A single wind turbine
      only takes up about a quarter-acre of land--less than the
      size of a tennis court."

Revised point: "Wind turbines use minimal land and allow
for continued agricultural use, maximizing land value."

"Once Windmills Are in Place, They Require Virtually No
Maintenance"

   Why it works: It suggests low ongoing cost, which is
attractive economically.
626 | 11.1 WHY OUTLINE?

   How to improve:

   Be more precise: "Virtually no maintenance" might
      sound too good to be true. Instead, say they require low
      maintenance and explain what that means (e.g., periodic
      inspections, remote monitoring).

   Add a stat: Mention average annual maintenance costs
      per turbine if available.

Revised point: "Wind turbines have low maintenance needs,
with most systems monitored remotely and requiring only
occasional servicing."

"The Cost for Generating Electrical Energy with Windmills Is
Lower Compared with Other Sources"

   Why it works: This is the core economic argument.
   How to improve:

   Be specific: Mention the cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh)
      compared to fossil fuels or nuclear plants.

   Highlight long-term savings: Emphasize that wind
      energy has no fuel costs and stable pricing over time.

Revised point: "Wind energy is among the cheapest sources of
electricity today, offering long-term savings and price stability."

Tests Logical Relation of Parts

You have many choices for your topic, and therefore, there
are many ways your content can be logically organized. In the
example above, we simply listed three main points that were
important economic considerations about wind farms. Often
the main points of a speech can be arranged into a logical
pattern; let's take a look at some such patterns.
                                                          11.1 WHY OUTLINE? | 629

Comparison-Contrast
Spatial

A chronological pattern arranges main ideas in the order
events occur. In some instances, reverse order might make
sense. For instance, if your topic is archaeology, you might
use reverse order, describing the newest artifacts first. A
biographical pattern is usually chronological. In describing
the events of an individual's life, you will want to choose the
three most significant events. Otherwise, the speech will end
up as a very lengthy and often pointless timeline or bullet point
list. For example, Mark Twain had several clear phases in his
life. They include his life as a Mississippi riverboat captain,
his success as a world-renowned writer and speaker, and his
family life. A simple timeline would present great difficulty in
highlighting the relationships between important events. An
outline, however, would help you emphasize the key events
that contributed to Mark Twain's extraordinary life.

   A cause-and-effect pattern calls on you to describe a
specific situation and explain what the effect is. However, most
effects have more than one cause. Even dental cavities have
multiple causes: genetics, poor nutrition, teeth too tightly
spaced, sugar, ineffective brushing, and so on. If you choose a
cause-and-effect pattern, make sure you have enough reliable
support to do the topic justice.

                         2003).

Tests Organizational Patterns
with AI

If you are unsure which organizational pattern would be best
to use, then ask AI to show you the differences between the
different patterns. For example, let's take the example above
                                                          11.1 WHY OUTLINE? | 633

and ask Copilot "How would these three main points fit into
a chronological pattern?"

   The answer was to place the main points in this order:

 1. Land Use: The Starting Point - "Modern windmills
      require a very small land base."

 2. Installation and Maintenance: What Happens After
      Setup - "Once windmills are in place, they require
      virtually no maintenance."

 3. Energy Production and Cost Savings: The Long-Term
      Benefit - "The cost for generating electrical energy with
      windmills is lower compared with other sources."

Let's ask the same question, but change the organization
pattern to another option, "How would these three main
points fit into a comparison-contrast pattern?"

 1. Land Use: Wind vs. Other Energy Sources - "Modern
      windmills require a very small land base."

 2. Maintenance: Wind vs. Traditional Power Plants -
      "Windmills require low maintenance once installed."

 3. Cost of Energy: Wind vs. Other Sources - "Wind energy
      is cheaper to generate than many other sources."

While the points are in the same order as the first example,
they would be substantiated in two different ways, resulting
in two very different speeches. It's up to you, as the speaker,
634 | 11.1 WHY OUTLINE?

to determine which pattern more effectively achieves your

objective. Let's ask the question one more time with a different

organizational pattern: "How would these three main points

fit into a spatial pattern?"

                              For this prompt, before

statement and then look at the three main points in your

outline, you should easily be able to see the logical way in

which they relate. Choosing an organizational pattern is a

this selection is choosing a pattern that most effectively and
clearly communicates your thesis to your audience.

Tests Relevance of Supporting
636 | 11.1 WHY OUTLINE?

Ideas

When you create an outline, you can clearly see that you need

supporting evidence for each of your main points. For

instance, using the example above about wind-generated

energy, your first main point claims that less land is needed for

windmills than for other utilities. Your supporting evidence

should be about the amount of acreage required for a windmill

and the amount of acreage required for other energy

generation sites, such as nuclear power plants or hydroelectric

generators. Your sources should come from experts in

economics, economic development, or engineering. The

evidence could consist of expert opinion but not the opinions

of ordinary people. The expert opinion will provide stronger

support for your point.

                         Similarly, your second point

                         claims that once a wind turbine

     Beyond the          is in place, there is virtually no
                         maintenance cost. Your

main point, you should make use

of just a few well-selected statistics

from authoritative sources to

show the effectiveness of wind farms compared to the other

energy sources you've cited.

Where do you find the kind of information you would need

to support these main points? A reference librarian can

quickly guide you to authoritative statistics manuals and help

you make use of them.

An important step you should take note of is
that the full-sentence outline includes its
authoritative sources within the text. This is a
major departure from the way you have learned
to write a research paper. In the research paper,
you can add that information to the end of a
638 | 11.1 WHY OUTLINE?

       sentence, leaving the reader to turn to the last
       page for a fuller citation. In a speech, however,
       your listeners can't do that. From the beginning
       of the supporting point, you need to fully cite
       your source so your audience can immediately
       assess its importance.
       Because this is such a profound change from the
       academic habits that you're probably used to,
       you will have to make a concerted effort to
       overcome the habits of the past and provide the
       information your listeners need when they need
       it.

Test the Balance and Proportion
of the Speech

Part of the value of writing a full-sentence outline is the visual
space you use for each of your main points. Is each main point
of approximately the same importance? Does each main point
have the same number of supporting points? If you find that
one of your main points has eight supporting points while
the others only have three each, you have two choices: either
choose the best three from the eight supporting points or
                                                          11.1 WHY OUTLINE? | 639

strengthen the authoritative support for your other two main
points.

   Remember that you should use the best supporting
evidence you can find even if it means investing more time in
your search for knowledge.

Notes During the Speech

Although we recommend writing a full-sentence outline
during the speech preparation phase, you should also create
a shortened outline that you can use as notes allowing for a
strong delivery. This is known as a keyword or delivery outline.
If you were to use the full-sentence outline when delivering
your speech, you would do a great deal of reading, which
would limit your ability to make eye contact and use gestures,
640 | 11.1 WHY OUTLINE?

hurting your connection with your audience. For this reason,

we recommend writing a short-phrase outline that can be used

when you speak. Some speakers transfer this outline onto

notecards or create "card-like" slides that can be read on a

device in front of the audience. Whichever method you choose

to use, it should allow you to feel comfortable and confident

while making a connection with your audience.

and phrases that will help you present your introduction. Your
second slide/card can contain your first main point, together
with key words and phrases to act as a map to follow as you
present. If your first main point has an exact quotation you
plan to present, you can include that on your slide/card. Your
third slide/card should be related to your second main point,
your fourth slide/card should be about your third main point,
and your fifth slide/card should be related to your conclusion.
In this way, your five slides/cards follow the very same
organizational pattern as your full outline. In the next section,
we will explore more fully how to create a speaking outline.

Learning Objectives

 1. Define three types of outlines: working outline, full-
      sentence outline, and speaking outline.

 2. Identify the advantages of using note cards or slides to
      present your speaking outline.

 3. Use AI as a conversation partner to ensure all
      components of the full-sentence outline before moving
      to the speaking outline.

When we discuss outlining, we are actually focusing on a series
of outlines instead of a single one. Outlines are designed to
evolve throughout your speech preparation process, so this
section will discuss how you progress from a working outline
to a full-sentence outline and, finally, a speaking outline. We
will also discuss how using notecards or slides with notes for
your speaking outline can be helpful to you as a speaker.

Working Outline

A working outline is an outline you use for developing your
speech. It undergoes many changes on its way to completion.
This is the outline in which you lay out the basic structure
of your speech. You must have a general and specific purpose;
an introduction, including a grabber; and a concrete, specific
thesis statement and preview. You also need three main points,
a conclusion, and a list of references. (There is a worksheet
provided for reference, remember that this is a working outline
and not the full-sentence outline that provides the entire plan
for the speech)

   One strategy for beginning your working outline is to begin
by typing in your labels for each of the elements (Provided on
the Worksheet). You can fill in the content, later.

   When you look ahead to the full-sentence outline, you will
notice that each of the three main points moves from the
644 | 11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES

general to the particular. Specifically, each main point is a
claim, followed by particular information that supports that
claim so that the audience will perceive its validity. For
example, your first main point in a speech about coal mining
safety might focus on the idea that coal mining is a hazardous
occupation. You might begin by making a very general claim,
such as "Coal mining is one of the most hazardous
occupations in the United States," and then become more
specific by providing statistics, authoritative quotations, or
examples to support your primary claim.

   A working outline allows you to work out the kinks in your
message. For instance, let's say you've made the claim that lung
disease is no longer a leading hazard compared to other risks,
but you cannot find authoritative evidence as support. You
must now reexamine that main point to assess its validity. You
might have to change that main point in order to be able to
support it. If you do so, however, you must make sure the new
main point is a logical part of the thesis statement-three main
points-conclusion sequence.

   The working outline shouldn't be thought of as a "rough
copy," but as a careful step in the development of your
message. It will take time to develop. Here is an example of a
working outline:

 2. Smart dust can be used by the military--no, no--smart

      dust could be an enormous asset in covert military
      operations. (That's better because it is more clear and
      precise.)
 3. Smart dust could also have applications to daily life.

Introduction: (Attention Grabber) (fill in later)
   (Thesis Statement) Thus far, researchers hypothesize that

smart dust could be used for everything from tracking patients
in hospitals to early warnings of natural disasters and
defending against bioterrorism.

   (Preview) Today, I'm going to explain what smart dust is
and the various applications smart dust has in the near future.
To help us understand the small of it all, we will first examine
what smart dust is and how it works. We will then examine
some military applications of smart dust. And we will end
by discussing some nonmilitary applications of smart dust.

   Conclusion: (Bring your message "full circle" and create a

psychologically satisfying closure.)
   This stage of preparation turns out to be a good place to

go back and examine whether all the main points are directly

related to the thesis statement and to each other. If so, your
message has a strong potential for unity of focus. But if the
relationship of one of the main points is weak, this is the time
to strengthen it. It will be more difficult later for two reasons:
first, the sheer amount of text on your pages will make the
visual task more difficult, and second, it becomes increasingly
difficult to change things in which you have a large investment
in time and thought.

Working Outline with AI

This is also a great time to consult AI as a collaborative partner
in the process. For example, we can take the outline provided
above and type a prompt into Microsoft Copilot that provides
the thesis and purpose of the speech and asks AI to provide
an outline. So, our prompt will be, "I am developing a speech
examining the hypothesis that smart dust could be used for
everything from tracking patients in hospitals to early
warnings of natural disasters and defending against
bioterrorism for the purpose of informing a group of science
students about the potential of smart dust. Can you provide
me with a working outline with introduction, body and
conclusion along with transition statements?"

The Response from Copilot is below:

Speech Outline: The Potential of Smart Dust
648 | 11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES

 1. Introduction

          Attention Getter: "Imagine a world where
            microscopic sensors float through the air, silently
            monitoring health, detecting threats, and
            predicting disasters--this isn't science fiction, it's
            the emerging reality of smart dust."

          Purpose Statement: "Today, I want to inform you
            about the fascinating technology of smart dust and
            explore how it could revolutionize fields from
            healthcare to national security."

          Preview of Main Points: "We'll look at what smart
            dust is, how it could be used in hospitals, how it
            might help us detect natural disasters early, and
            how it could serve as a defense against
            bioterrorism."

 2. Body

          A. What is Smart Dust?
                Definition: Tiny microelectromechanical
                  systems (MEMS) with sensors,
                  communication, and computing capabilities.
                How it works: Wireless communication,
                  powered by ambient energy or micro-
                  batteries.
                Current development stage and examples.
                                      11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES | 649

      Transition: "Now that we understand what
         smart dust is, let's explore how it could
         transform healthcare."

 B. Smart Dust in Healthcare
      Patient tracking in hospitals: real-time
         monitoring of vitals and location.
      Infection control: detecting pathogens in the
         air.
      Drug delivery and internal diagnostics.
      Transition: "Beyond the hospital walls, smart
         dust could also help us prepare for nature's
         most unpredictable forces."

 C. Smart Dust for Natural Disaster Detection
      Environmental monitoring: temperature,
         humidity, seismic activity.
      Early warning systems for earthquakes,
         wildfires, and floods.
      Deployment in remote or hazardous areas.
      Transition: "While natural disasters are a
         threat from nature, smart dust could also help
         us defend against human-made dangers."

 D. Smart Dust in National Security and
  Bioterrorism Defense
      Detection of airborne toxins or biological
         agents.
      Surveillance in sensitive areas.
      Real-time alerts for chemical or biological
650 | 11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES

                  threats.
                Transition to Conclusion: "As we've seen, the

                  potential applications of smart dust are vast
                  and impactful."

 3. Conclusion

          Summary of Main Points: "From tracking patients
            in hospitals to detecting natural disasters and
            defending against bioterrorism, smart dust offers a
            glimpse into a smarter, safer future."

          Closing Thought: "Though still in development,
            smart dust challenges us to rethink what's possible
            when technology becomes nearly invisible--and
            infinitely powerful."

          Call to Curiosity: "As future scientists and
            innovators, how might you contribute to shaping
            the future of this groundbreaking technology?"

While you can see the generic nature of this outline, AI did a
good job of making sure the major components of the speech
are included. Remember that it is always up to you as the
speaker to provide authentic content in your speech, AI will
only react to the prompts that you provide. This working
outline will help you organize specific knowledge about the
subject by seeing how a more generic flow of thought can be
used to create a specific outline for your speech. Remember
                                                   11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES | 651

that this outline, while helpful, should never be a substitute for
your thoughts and ideas. Use AI as a conversation partner, do
not allow it to lead or take over your speech. As is always the
case, a speaker wants to meet the needs of the specific audience
to be effective.

Summary of Working Outlines

You can see that this working outline can lay a strong
foundation for the rest of your message. Its organization is
visually apparent. Once you are confident in the internal unity
of your basic message, you can begin filling in the supporting
points in descending detail--that is, from the general (main
points) to the particular (supporting points) and then to
greater detail. The outline makes it visually apparent where
information fits. You only need to assess your supporting
points to be sure they're authoritative and directly relevant to
the main points they should support.

   A component of a full-sentence outline that isn't a concern
of the working outline is the inclusion of transition
statements. Sometimes transitions seem troublesome, and
that's not surprising. We often omit them when we have
informal conversations. Our conversation partners understand
what we mean because of our gestures and vocal strategies.
However, others might not understand what we mean, but
think they do, and so we might never know whether they
understood us. Even when we include transitions, we don't
652 | 11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES

generally identify them as transitions. In a speech, however, we
need to use effective transitions as a gateway from one main
point to the next. The listener needs to know when a speaker is
moving from one main point to the next.

   In the next type of outline, the full-sentence outline, pay
extra attention to the transitions and see how they make the
listener aware of the shifting focus to the next main point.

Full-Sentence Outline

Your full-sentence outline is properly named because it should
only contain complete thoughts and a fully developed sentence
structure. There are several reasons why this kind of outline is
important. First, you have a full plan of everything you intend
to say to your audience, so that you will not have to struggle
with wordings or examples. Second, you have a clear idea of
how much time it will take to present your speech. Third, it
contributes to a fundamental ingredient of good preparation,
part of your ethical responsibility to your audience. Last, and
probably the least important but practical to students like you,
this is most likely the outline your professor will want you
to turn in as part of your grade. This is how a full-sentence
outline looks:

   Topic: Smart dust
   General Purpose: To inform
   Specific Purpose: To inform a group of science students
about the potential of smart dust.
   Main Ideas:

   Smart dust is an assembly of microcomputers.
   Smart dust could be an enormous asset in covert military

      operations.
   Smart dust could also have applications to daily life.

Introduction: (Grabber) In 2002, famed science fiction writer,
Michael Crichton, released his book Prey, which was about
a swarm of nanomachines that were feeding off living tissue.
The nanomachines were solar powered, self-sufficient, and
intelligent. Most disturbingly, the nanomachines could work
together as a swarm as it took over and killed its prey in its
need for new resources. The technology for this level of
sophistication in nanotechnology is surprisingly more science
fact than science fiction. In 2000, three professors of electrical
engineering and computer Science at the University of
California at Berkeley, Kahn, Katz, and Pister, hypothesized
in the Journal of Communications and Networks that wireless
networks of tiny microelectromechanical sensors, or MEMS;
robots; or devices could detect phenomena including light,
temperature, or vibration. By 2004, Fortune Magazine listed
654 | 11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES

"smart dust" as the first in their "Top 10 Tech Trends to Bet
On."

   (Thesis Statement) Thus far researchers hypothesized that
smart dust could be used for everything from tracking patients
in hospitals to early warnings of natural disasters and as a
defense against bioterrorism.

   (Preview) Today, I'm going to explain what smart dust is
and the various applications smart dust has in the near future.
To help us understand the small of it all, we will first examine
what smart dust is and how it works. We will then examine
some military applications of smart dust. And we will end
by discussing some nonmilitary applications of smart dust.
(Transition) To help us understand smart dust, we will begin
by first examining what smart dust is.

   Main Point I: Dr. Kris Pister, a professor in the robotics lab
at the University of California at Berkeley, originally conceived
the idea of smart dust in 1998 as part of a project funded by
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

   According to a 2001 article written by Bret Warneke,
      Matt Last, Brian Liebowitz, and Kris Pister titled "Smart
      Dust: Communicating with a Cubic-Millimeter
      Computer" published in Computer, Pister's goal was to
      build a device that contained a built-in sensor,
      communication device, and a small computer that could
      be integrated into a cubic millimeter package.

   For comparison purposes, Doug Steel, in a 2005 white
                                                   11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES | 655

      paper titled "Smart Dust" written for C. T. Bauer
      College of Business at the University of Houston, noted
      that a single grain of rice has a volume of five cubic
      millimeters.
   Each individual piece of dust, called a mote, would then
      have the ability to interact with other motes and
      supercomputers.
   As Steve Lohr wrote in the January 30, 2010, edition of
      the New York Times in an article titled "Smart Dust?
      Not Quite, But We're Getting There," smart dust could
      eventually consist of "Tiny digital sensors, strewn
      around the glove, gathering all sorts of information and
      communicating with powerful computer networks to
      monitor, measure, and understand the physical world in
      new ways."

(Transition) Now that we've examined what smart dust is, let's
switch gears and talk about some of the military applications
for smart dust.

   Main Point II: Because smart dust was originally
conceptualized under a grant from DARPA, military uses of
smart dust have been widely theorized and examined.

   According to the smart dust website, smart dust could
      eventually be used for "battlefield surveillance, treaty
      monitoring, transportation monitoring, scud hunting"
      and other clear military applications.
656 | 11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES

   Probably the number one benefit of smart dust in the
      military environment is its surveillance abilities.

   Major Scott Dickson, in a Blue Horizons paper written
      for the US Air Force Center for Strategy and
      Technology's Air War College, sees smart dust as helping
      the military in battlespace awareness, homeland security,
      and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) identification.

   Furthermore, Major Dickson also believes it may be
      possible to create smart dust that has the ability to defeat
      communications jamming equipment created by foreign
      governments, which could help the US military not only
      communicate among itself, but could also increase
      communications with civilians in military combat zones.

   According to a 2010 article written by Jessica Griggs in
      new Scientist, one of the first benefits of smart dust
      could be an early defense warning for space storms and
      other debris that could be catastrophic.

(Transition) Now that we've explored some of the military
benefits of smart dust, let's switch gears and see how smart
dust may be able to have an impact on our daily lives.

   Main Point III: According to the smart dust project
website, smart dust could quickly become a common part of
our daily lives.

   Everything from pasting smart dust particles to our
      finger tips to create a virtual computer keyboard to
                                                   11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES | 657

      inventory control to product quality control have been
      discussed as possible applications for smart dust.
   Steve Lohr, in his 2010 New York Times article, wrote,
      "The applications for sensor-based computing, experts
      say, include buildings that manage their own energy use,
      bridges that sense motion and metal fatigue to tell
      engineers they need repairs, cars that track traffic
      patterns and report potholes, and fruit and vegetable
      shipments that tell grocers when they ripen and begin to
      spoil."
   Medically, according to the smart dust website, smart
      dust could help disabled individuals interface with
      computers.
   Theoretically, we could all be injected with smart dust,
      which relays information to our physicians and detects
      adverse changes to our body instantly.
   Smart dust could detect the microscopic formations of
      center cells or alert us when we've been infected by a
      bacterium or virus, which could speed up treatment and
      prolong all of our lives.

(Transition) Today, we've explored what smart dust is, how
smart dust could be utilized by the US military, and how smart
dust could impact all of our lives in the near future.

   Conclusion: While smart dust is quickly transferring from
science fiction to science fact, experts agree that the full
potential of smart dust will probably not occur until 2025.
658 | 11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES

Smart dust is definitely in our near future, but swarms of smart
dust eating people as was depicted in Michael Crichton's 2002
novel, Prey, isn't reality. However, as with any technological
advance, there are definite ethical considerations and worries
related to smart dust. Even Dr. Kris Pister's smart dust project
website admits that as smart dust becomes more readily
available, one of the trade-offs will be privacy. Pister responds
to these critiques by saying, "As an engineer, or a scientist,
or a hair stylist, everyone needs to evaluate what they do in
terms of its positive and negative effect. If I thought that the
negatives of working on this project were greater than or even
comparable to the positives, I wouldn't be working on it. As it
turns out, I think that the potential benefits of this technology
far outweigh the risks to personal privacy."

When you prepare your full-sentence outline carefully, it may
take as much as 1  hours to complete the first part of the
outline from your name at the top through the introduction.
When you've completed that part, take a break and do
something else. When you return to the outline, you should
be able to complete your draft in another 1  hours. After
that, you only need to do a detailed check for completeness,
accuracy, relevance, balance, omitted words, and consistency.
If you find errors, instead of being frustrated, be glad you can
catch these errors before you're standing up in front of your
audience.

   You will notice that the various parts of your speech, for
instance, the transition and main points, are labeled. There are
compelling reasons for these labels. First, as you develop your
message, you will sometimes find it necessary to go back and
look at your wording in another part of the outline. Your labels
help you find particular passages easily. Second, the labels work
as a checklist so that you can make sure you've included
660 | 11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES

everything you intended to. Third, it helps you prepare your
speaking outline.

   You'll also notice the full references at the end of the outline.
They match the citations within the outline. Sometimes while
preparing a speech, a speaker finds it important to go back to
the original source to be sure the message will be accurate. If
you type in your references as you develop your speech rather
than afterward, they will be a convenience to you if they are
complete and accurate.

   Don't think of the references as busywork or drudgery.
Although they're more time consuming than text, citations are
good practice for the more advanced academic work you will
do in the immediate future and supports academic integrity of
your work.

Speaking Outline

Your full-sentence outline prepares you to present a clear and
well-organized message, but your speaking outline will include
far less detail. Whenever possible, you will use key words and
phrases, but in some instances, an extended quotation will
need to be fully written on your speaking outline.

   Resist the temptation to use your full-sentence outline as
your speaking outline. The temptation is real for at least two
reasons. First, once you feel that you've carefully crafted every
sequence of words in your speech, you might not want to
sacrifice quality when you shift to vocal presentation. Second,
                                                   11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES | 661

if you feel anxiety about how well you will do in front of an
audience, you may want to use your full-sentence outline as
a "safety net." In our experience, however, if you have your
full-sentence outline with you, you will end up reading, rather
than speaking, to your audience. The subject of reading to
your audience will be taken up in Chapter 14 "Delivering the
Speech" on speech delivery. For now, it is enough to know you
shouldn't read, but instead, use carefully prepared notecards.

   Your speech has five main components: introduction, main
point one, main point two, main point three, and conclusion.
Therefore, we strongly recommend the use of five slide notes
or cards: one for each of those five components. There are
extenuating circumstances that might call for additional slide
notes or cards but begin with five only.

   How will five slide notes or cards suffice in helping you
produce a complete, rich delivery? Why can't you use the full-
sentence outline you labored so hard to write? First, the
presence of your full-sentence outline will make it appear that
you don't know the content of your speech. Second, the
temptation to read the speech directly from the full-sentence
outline is nearly overwhelming; even if you resist this
temptation, you will find yourself struggling to remember the
words on the page rather than speaking extemporaneously.
Third, it's easier to lose your place using the full outline.
Finally, slide notes or cards just look better. Carefully prepared
slide notes or cards, together with practice, will help you more
than you might think.
662 | 11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES

   Plan to use five slides with notes or cards. If using physical
cards, use 4  6 cards because the smaller 3  5 cards are too
small to provide space for a visually organized set of notes.
With five, you will have one for the introduction, one for each
of the three main points, and one for the conclusion.
Numbering your physical cards is helpful if you happen to
drop your cards, and writing on only one side means that
the audience is not distracted by your handwritten notes and
reminders to yourself while you are speaking. Each card should
contain key words and key phrases but not full sentences.
While most students will not choose to use cards, the same
formatting is helpful for slide notes.

   Some speeches will include direct or extended quotations
from expert sources. Some of these quotations might be highly
technical or difficult to memorize for other reasons, but they
must be presented correctly. This is a circumstance in which
you could include an extra card in the sequence of notecards
or put the quote on the slide and read it directly to assure
accuracy. This is the one time you may read fully from a card
or slide. If your quotation is important and the exact wording
is crucial, your audience will understand that.

   How will notes on slides or cards be sufficient? When they
are carefully written, your practice will reveal that they will
work. If, during practice, you find that one of your notes
doesn't work well enough, you can rewrite and revise.

   Using a set of carefully prepared, sparingly worded notes
(slides or cards) will help you resist the temptation to rely
                                                  11.2 TYPES OF OUTLINES | 663

on PowerPoint slides to get you through the presentation.
Although they will never provide the exact word sequence of
your full-sentence outline, they should keep you organized
during the speech.

   The "trick" to selecting the phrases and quotations for your
notes is to identify the labels that will trigger a recall sequence.
For instance, if the phrase "more science fact" brings to mind
the connection to science fiction and the differences between
the real developments and the fictive events of Crichton's
novel Prey, that phrase on your notes will support you through
a fairly extended part of your introduction.

   You must discover what works for you and then select words
that tend to help your recall. Having identified what works,
make a preliminary set of no more than five slide notes or cards
(written on one side only), and practice with them. Revise and
refine them as you would any outline.

   The following is a hypothetical set of notes for the smart
dust speech. While each of the "cards" below are labelled as
such, remember that the same formatting can be used when
adding notes to your favorite computer-generated visual aid
application:

You will end up reading a sequence of words to your audience

11.3 USING OUTLINING
FOR SUCCESS

   Jonathan Woodall

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand five basic principles of outline creation.
 2. Use AI as a conversation partner in the process of

      evaluating an outline that advances the thesis and
      adheres to the five basic principles.

As with any part of the speech process, there are some pretty
commonly agreed upon principles for creating an outline.
Now that we've examined the basics of outline creation, there
are some important factors to consider when creating a logical
and coherent outline: singularity, consistency, adequacy,
balance, and parallelism. Remember that you can copy your
outline into the prompt area of an AI tool and ask for an
evaluation of these principles of a great outline.

Singularity

For the sake of clarity, make sure your thesis statement
                                11.3 USING OUTLINING FOR SUCCESS | 669

expresses one idea only. Only in this way will it be optimally
useful to you as you build your outline. If you have narrowed
your topic skillfully, you can readily focus the thesis statement
as one central point. For instance, if you have a thesis statement
that says the Second Amendment protects gun ownership
rights, but most people are unaware of the responsibility
involved, you have a thesis statement focusing on two different
issues. Which focus will you follow? It's crucial to choose just
one, saving the other perhaps for a different speech.

   The same holds true for your three main points: they should
each express one clear idea. For the sake of your audience,
maintain clarity. If many different ideas are required in order
to build a complete message, you can handle them in separate
sentences with the use of such transitions as "at the same
time," "alternately," "in response to that event," or some other
transition that clarifies the relationship between two separate
ideas.

Consistency

The entire point of framing a thesis with one clear focus is
to help you maintain consistency throughout your speech.
Beyond the grammatical requirements of subject-verb
agreement, you will want to maintain a consistent approach.
For instance, unless your speech has a chronological structure
that begins in the past and ends in the future, you should
choose a tense, past or present, to use throughout the speech.
670 | 11.3 USING OUTLINING FOR SUCCESS

If you want to use second person to directly address your
audience by using you, as this textbook does, then you should
maintain that voice throughout and make sure you don't
switch to third person. Similarly, you should choose language
and use it consistently. For instance, use humanity instead of
mankind or humans, and use that term throughout.

   Similarly, define your terms and use those terms only to
designate the meanings in your definition. To do otherwise
could result in equivocation and confusion. For instance, if
you use the word "right" in two or three different senses, you
should change your language. The word "right" can be
applicable to your right to a good education; the ethical
difference between right and wrong; and the status of a
statement as right, or accurate and correct. By the same token,
in a health care setting, saying that a medical test had a positive
outcome can be confusing. Does the patient test positive for
the presence of disease, or does the test reveal some good news?
If you find yourself using the same word to mean different
things, you will need to spend extra time in your speech
explaining these meanings very clearly--or avoid the problem
by making other word choices.

Adequacy

To make sure your audience understands your speech, you
must set aside the assumption that what is obvious to you
is also obvious to your audience. Therefore, pay attention to
                                 11.3 USING OUTLINING FOR SUCCESS | 671

adequacy in two ways: definitions of terms and support for
your main points.

   You should use concrete language as much as you can. For
instance, if you use the word "community," you're using an
abstract term that can mean many things. You might be
referring to a suburban neighborhood; to a cultural group,
such as the Jewish community; to an institutional setting that
includes an academic community; or to a general sense of
overarching mainstream community standards for what
materials should or should not be broadcast on television, for
instance. You may not find any definition of "community"
that conveys your meaning. Therefore, you will need to define
for your audience what you mean by "community."

   Adequacy is also a concern when you use evidence to
support your main points. Evidence of the right kind and the
right weight is needed. For instance, if you make a substantial
claim, such as that all printed news sources will be obsolete
within ten years, you need expert sources. This means you
need at least two well-known experts from the institutions that
provide news (newspapers, television news, or news radio).
They should be credible sources, not sources with extreme
views whose contact with reality is questioned. This will give
you the right kind of evidence, and a large enough amount of
evidence.
672 | 11.3 USING OUTLINING FOR SUCCESS

Balance

A full sentence outline readily shows whether you are giving
"equal time" to each of your three main points. For example,
are you providing three pieces of evidence to support each
main point? It should also show whether each main point is
directly related to the thesis statement.

Parallelism

Parallelism refers to the idea that the three main points follow
the same structure or make use of the same kind of language.
For instance, in the sample outline we used previously, you see
that each of the main points emphasizes the topic, smart dust.

   Parallelism also allows you to check for inconsistencies and
self-contradictory statements. For instance, does anything
within main point two contradict anything in main point one?
Examining your text for this purpose can strengthen the clarity
of your message. For instance, if main point one claims that
computer crime leaves an electronic trail, but main point two
claims that hackers often get away with their crimes, you have
some explaining to do. If an electronic trail can readily lead to
the discovery of the electronic felon, how or why do they get
away with it? The answer might be that cybercrime does not
fall within the jurisdiction of any law enforcement agency or
that the law lags behind technology. Perhaps there are other
reasons as well, and you must make sure you don't leave your
                                 11.3 USING OUTLINING FOR SUCCESS | 673

audience confused. If you confuse them, you will sound
confused and lose credibility. There is no doubt that a full-
sentence outline provides the most useful opportunity to
examine your message for the details that either clarify or
undermine your message.

   Finally, your conclusion should do two things. First, it
should come "full circle" in order to show the audience that
you have covered all the territory you laid out in your preview.
Second, it should provide satisfying, decisive, psychological
closure. Your audience should know when your speech is over.
You should not trail off nor should not have to say, "That's it."
Your audience should not have to wait to see whether you're
going to say anything else. At the right time, they should feel
certain that the speech is over and then clap.

Using AI for a Successful Outline

Using the full sentence outline from this chapter, we can create
a prompt to ask AI to assess the outline's singularity,
consistency, adequacy, balance, and parallelism. When done
for the outline provided about star dust, the response from
Copilot is shared below:

This image contains a structured table with three columns:
Principle, Status, and Notes, under the heading " Summary
of Assessment." It evaluates five principles used in structuring
a presentation or piece of writing. Each principle is rated as
Strong, Moderate, or Needs Improvement, with specific
improvement suggestions in the Notes column.
Text Transcription
Summary of Assessment

   Principle | Status | Notes
   Singularity | Strong | Clear, focused points
                                 11.3 USING OUTLINING FOR SUCCESS | 675

   Consistency | Strong | Uniform structure and transitions
   Adequacy | Moderate | Slightly expand the first main point
   Balance | Moderate | Add depth to the definition section
   Parallelism | Needs improvement | Reword main points for
structural alignment

In addition to this very useful chart of the strengths and
weaknesses of the full-sentence outline, Copilot offered
suggestions for strengthening the adequacy, balance and
parallelism of the work. Regarding adequacy, AI suggested
these changes, "The definition section (Main Point I) could
benefit from a bit more explanation of how smart dust actually
works (e.g., how it communicates, powers itself, or is
deployed). A brief mention of current prototypes or
limitations would also help round it out." Depending on the
audience, AI's suggestion to define smart dust might not be
applicable to your situation. Defining something for a group
already familiar with it could be seen as talking down to the
audience disrespecting their prior knowledge. As we have
stated before, as the speaker you have the ultimate
responsibility to communicate clearly and effectively to the
audience.

   Regarding balance, AI reported, "Consider expanding the
first section slightly to match the depth of the others--perhaps
by including a brief timeline of development or mentioning
current research institutions working on smart dust." Note
that AI points us to the place that needs work and offers some
676 | 11.3 USING OUTLINING FOR SUCCESS

suggestions of how to make it stronger. This suggestion can
be followed by more conversations with Copilot AI. Lastly,
regarding parallelism, Copilot offered the following
assessment:

   "Your main points are not fully parallel: 1. Smart dust is
an assembly of microcomputers (definition) - 2. Smart dust
could be an enormous asset in covert military operations
(application) - 3. Smart dust could also have applications to
daily life (application)."

   The suggestion provided to fix the unparallel main points is
to reword the first point to match the structure of the others,
so main point 1 would read, "Smart dust could revolutionize
computing through micro-scale technology" or "Smart dust
could serve as a foundational technology for future
applications." AI suggests options, but it is up to you as the
speaker to choose the right one for this speech.

11.4: CONCLUSION:
OUTLINING

   Jonathan Woodall

Outlining is far more than a step in the drafting process. It
is where intention becomes structure. The outline represents
your bridge between invention and delivery, transforming
ideas into an organized sequence that an audience can follow
in real time. By testing the scope, logic, and balance of your
main points, you ensure your speech remains both coherent
and purposeful. By shaping supporting ideas with precision,
you elevate your credibility and deepen the audience's trust
in your reasoning. And by translating the full outline into a
concise speaking guide, you move beyond memorization and
into authentic, connected communication.

   In the broader spirit of Beyond the Podium, outlining
reminds us that effective speaking begins long before words
are spoken aloud. It is an act of audience-centered design, a
process of anticipating how listeners will think, feel, and
respond. AI tools can assist in this process by acting as a
reflective partner, helping you visualize structure, test clarity,
and anticipate potential misunderstandings. Yet, the artistry
remains human: your judgment, empathy, and ethical
678 | 11.4: CONCLUSION: OUTLINING

awareness give shape to meaning that no algorithm can
replicate.

   As we move to the next chapter, The Importance of
Language, we shift from structure to style and from and from
how ideas are arranged to how they are expressed. If outlining
is the skeleton of your speech, language is its living voice.
Together, they allow you to not only inform and persuade but
also to connect and to step fully beyond the podium and into
the shared space of understanding with your audience.

          Key Takeaways

           Outlines help you stay focused on your thesis
             and test the scope, logic, and relevance of
             your content.

           A full-sentence outline improves clarity and
             ensures your main points and supporting
             ideas align.

           Organizational patterns help audiences follow
             your reasoning and flow of ideas.

           Using AI as a conversation partner can help
             you check focus, structure, and clarity--but
             you are the final editor.

           A clear, balanced outline also helps you
             prepare effective speaking notes that
                                          11.4: CONCLUSION: OUTLINING | 679

OF LANGUAGE:
INTRODUCTION

   Jacqueline M. Gianico

Public speaking is more than a passionate performance behind
a podium. It is a dynamic conversation that can extend beyond
the conclusion of the speech, potentially moving audiences to
think or behave differently. At the heart of this connection
between speaker and audience is language. The words you
choose don't just fill the air and evaporate; they stir emotions,
shape notions, and set actions in motion. Language is
your bridge to the audience, your tool for building trust and
engagement.

   In this chapter, you'll explore how language works
differently when spoken aloud than when written on a page.
Understanding these differences is your first step toward
making effective word choices for your speeches. You'll learn
how to choose words that are not only clear and precise, but
also appropriate and inclusive, reaching everyone in the room,
not just a few. When your words reflect the diversity of your
audience, your message becomes more powerful, more
personal, and more persuasive. By tuning into the nuances of

up until the final few minutes of

the series finale! Furthermore,

while there are thousands of languages spoken around the

world today, not all of them have developed a written form.

Before we delve into the differences between oral and written

language, to help us understand the importance of language,

we will first look at the basic functions of language.

Basic Functions of Language

Language is any formal system of gestures, signs, sounds, and
symbols used or conceived as a means of communicating
thought. Language is ultimately important because it is the
primary means through which humans have the ability to
688 | 12.1: ORAL VERSUS WRITTEN LANGUAGE

communicate and interact with one another. Some linguists go
so far as to suggest that the acquisition of language skills is the
primary advancement that enabled our prehistoric ancestors
to flourish and succeed over other hominid species (Mayell,
2003).

   In today's world, effective use of language helps us in our
interpersonal relationships at home and at work. Using
language effectively also will improve your ability to be an
effective public speaker. Because language is an important
aspect of public speaking that many students don't spend
enough time developing, we encourage you to take advantage
of this chapter.

   One of the first components necessary for understanding
language is to understand how we assign meaning to words.
Words consist of sounds (oral) and shapes (written) that have
agreed-upon meanings based on concepts, ideas, and
memories. When we write the word "blue," we may be
referring to a portion of the visual spectrum dominated by
energy with a wavelength of roughly 440-490 nanometers.
You could also say that the color in question is an equal
mixture of both red and green light. While both of these are
technically correct ways to interpret the word "blue," we're
pretty sure that neither of these definitions is how you thought
about the word. When hearing the word "blue," you may have
thought of your favorite color, the color of the sky on a spring
day, or the color of a really ugly car you saw in the parking
lot. When people think about language, there are two different
                           12.1: ORAL VERSUS WRITTEN LANGUAGE | 689

types of meanings that people must be aware of: denotative
and connotative.

Denotative & Connotative
Meaning

Denotative meaning is the specific meaning associated with
a word. We sometimes refer to denotative meanings as
dictionary definitions. The definitions provided above for the
word "blue" are examples of definitions that might be found
in a dictionary. The first dictionary was written by Robert
Cawdry in 1604 and was called Table Alphabeticall. This
dictionary of the English language consisted of three thousand
commonly spoken English words. Today, the Oxford English
Dictionary contains more than 200,000 words (Oxford
University Press, 2011).

   Connotative meaning is the idea suggested by or associated
with a word. In addition to the examples above, the word
"blue" can evoke many other ideas:

   State of sadness (feeling blue)
   A sudden event (out of the blue)

We also associate the color blue with the sky and the ocean.
Maybe your school's colors or those of your archrival include
blue. There are also various forms of blue: aquamarine, baby
blue, navy blue, royal blue, and so on. Colors tend to be
690 | 12.1: ORAL VERSUS WRITTEN LANGUAGE

innocuous, so let's imagine a more compelling situation: how
would you feel if someone called you obstinate, meaning
stubborn? While you might agree that there is a stubborn
personality trait that runs in your family, you'd probably prefer
being called determined or persistent, which has a more
positive connotation.

   Some miscommunication can occur over denotative
meanings of words. A new gym in town launched a marketing
campaign with the phrase "Opening Soon!" displayed on
banners, social media, and their website. Over several months,
the gym continued to use phrases like "Opening in late
summer" without providing specific dates. While the
denotative meaning of "late summer" could technically extend
to the end of September, many community members
interpreted it connotatively to mean August or early
September. As delays continued, potential customers grew
frustrated. One Reddit reviewer commented, "They keep
saying they are `opening in late summer,' which I guess is
technically until the end of September?"--highlighting the
growing skepticism and irritation. The vague language, while
technically accurate, created a perception of dishonesty or
poor planning, which likely damaged the gym's credibility and
trust with the public. In fact, one of the author's of this
textbook became fed up and decided not to join the gym
(which eventually opened a year later!)

analysis, discussed earlier in this book, is critically important.
692 | 12.1: ORAL VERSUS WRITTEN LANGUAGE

By conducting effective audience analysis, you can know in
advance how your audience might respond to the
connotations of the words and ideas you present. Connotative
meanings can not only differ between individuals interacting
at the same time but also differ greatly across time periods
and cultures. Ultimately, speakers should attempt to have a
working knowledge of how their audiences could potentially
interpret words and ideas to minimize the chance of
miscommunication.

Challenge

Activity Introduction: Words have both literal definitions
and emotional associations. In public speaking, knowing the
difference helps you avoid misunderstandings and choose
language that supports your message. In this activity, you'll
practice telling denotative and connotative meanings apart by
sorting examples into the correct category.

Wrap Up: Miscommunication often happens when people
assign different connotations to the same words. By
recognizing these differences, you can choose language that
supports clarity and builds trust with your audience. Use this
reflection to help you become more intentional with your
word choices in everyday communication.

that oral language (used in public speaking) and written
language (used for texts) does not function the same way. Try
a brief experiment. Take a textbook, maybe even this one, and
read it out loud. When the text is read aloud, does it sound
conversational? Probably not. Public speaking, on the other
hand, should sound like a conversation. McCroskey, Wrench,
and Richmond (2003) highlighted the following twelve
differences that exist between oral and written language. Oral
language employs:

   At the clausal level--

   shorter sentences.
   more qualifying statements (clauses beginning with

      because, unless and except).

At the word level--
694 | 12.1: ORAL VERSUS WRITTEN LANGUAGE

   smaller variety of words.
   words with fewer syllables.
   fewer quantifying terms or precise numerical words.
   more colloquial and nonstandard words.
   more self-reference words (I, me, mine).
   more pseudo quantifying terms (many, few, some).
   more extreme and superlative words (none, all, every,

      always, never).
   more interjections ("Wow!," "Really?," "No!," "You're

      kidding!").

At the sound level--

 more repetition.
 more contractions.

                      primarily because people listen to

Wrap Up: Adapting written language for speaking helps you
shape a message that's easier for listeners to understand and
remember. As you continue preparing speeches, try reading
your words aloud to see where phrasing feels too formal or
too complicated. The more natural your language sounds, the
stronger your connection with your audience will be.

Appropriate for the Speaker

To maintain authenticity, as a speaker you should use language
in a speech that fits with your own speaking pattern or style.
Not all language choices are appropriate for all speakers. The
language you select should be suitable for you, not someone
else. If you're a first-year college student, there's no need to
force yourself to sound like an astrophysicist even if you are
giving a speech on new planets. If English is not your first
language, there's no need to worry about having impeccable
grammar or sounding like a native speaker. One of the biggest
mistakes novice speakers make is thinking that they must use
"smart-sounding" words. Remember, in spoken language,
simpler tends to be the norm, so using complicated words will
probably make you uncomfortable as a speaker. Also, it may be
difficult for you or the audience to understand the nuances of
meaning when you use such words, so using them can increase
the risk of denotative or connotative misunderstandings.

   Also important here is using language that you are familiar
and comfortable with. If you are not comfortable with the
terminology you've chosen, then you might be more nervous
and less confident, which will definitely have an impact on
how your audience receives your speech. You may have a hard
time speaking genuinely and sincerely if you use unfamiliar
language, and this can impair your credibility. Furthermore,
you want to make sure that the language you are using is
familiar to your listeners, which leads to the next point.
700 | 12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY

Appropriate for the Audience

The second aspect of appropriateness asks whether the
language you are choosing is appropriate for your specific
audience. Let's say that you're an engineering student. If
you're giving a presentation in an engineering class, you can
use language that other engineering students will know. On
the other hand, if you use that engineering vocabulary in a
public speaking class, many audience members might not
understand you. As another example, if you are speaking about
the history of communication technology to an audience of
young adults, you can't assume they will know the meaning
of terms like "party line", "operator," or "long-distance call"
which would be familiar to an audience born before the 1990s.
You don't have to avoid using these terms altogether but
defining them with relevant, appropriate terms would be
necessary. In other chapters of this book, we have explained the
importance of audience analysis; once again, audience analysis
is a key factor in choosing the language to use in a speech.

     Voices from the field

     "I had a close relationship with my supervisor, we
     could talk informally, sharing frustrations about
     clients. But of course, when I spoke directly with
     clients, I was professional and respectful. You want
                                  12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY | 701

     to maintain a positive relationship with the client.
     What you say is important. Especially when you
     need them to address a problem."
     Jackie Braze, retired data engineer and content asset
     manager

Appropriate for the Context

The next question about appropriateness is whether the
language you will use is suitable or fitting for the context itself.
The language you may employ if you're addressing a student
assembly in a high school auditorium will differ from the
language you would use at a business meeting in a hotel
ballroom. If you're giving a speech at an outdoor rally, you
likely will not use the same language you would use in a
classroom. Recall that the speaking context includes the
occasion, the time of day, the mood of the audience, and other
factors in addition to the physical location. Take the entire
speaking context into consideration when you make the
language choices for your speech.

Appropriate for the Topic

The final consideration when evaluating your language is
whether it suits your specific topic and audience. For instance,
702 | 12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY

if you're giving a presentation on the rise of social media
activism, would it make sense to describe influencers as
"demagogues" or "orators of the digital age"? While those
terms might technically apply, they could come off as overly
dramatic or even confusing. On the other hand, if your topic
is something more technical--like quantum computing or
CRISPR gene editing--then using precise, field-specific
terminology is not only appropriate but expected. The goal
is to strike a balance between sounding informed and staying
accessible to your audience. That said, you may need to use a
term the audience may not be familiar with, especially when
using language particular to your field. In these instances, you
may use definition or restatement to ensure understanding.

word" and not on your message.

Use Vivid Language

After appropriateness, the second main guideline for using
language is to use vivid language. Vivid language helps your
listeners create strong, distinct, clear, and memorable mental
images. Strong vivid language usage helps an audience member
truly understand and imagine what a speaker is saying. Two
common ways to make your speaking more vivid are through
the use of imagery and rhythm.

Imagery                                  AI Insight

   Imagery is the use of language   AI can generate
to represent objects, actions, or   metaphors or
ideas. The goal of imagery is to
help an audience member create a
mental picture of what a speaker
is saying. A speaker who uses
imagery successfully will tap into

                  abstract theories and ideas. The

                  goal of concreteness is to help you,

as a speaker, show your audience something instead of just

telling them. Imagine you've decided to give a speech on the

importance of freedom. You could easily stand up and talk

about the philosophical work of Rudolf Steiner, who divided

the ideas of freedom into freedom of thought and freedom of

action. In addition to defining what those terms mean and

discussing the philosophical merits of Steiner, you should use

real examples where people's freedom to think or freedom to

behave has been stifled. For example, Afghani women under

the Taliban are forced to adhere to rigid interpretations of

Islamic law that functionally limit their behavior. Since the

Taliban return to power in 2021, Afghani women have been

denied the right to attend school run and run businesses,
                                  12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY | 705

despite often being the family's primary breadwinner (Noack,
2025). Some beauty salon owners continue to run their
business in secret to continue to support their families. This
example makes things more concrete for audience members
and thus easier to remember. Ultimately, the goal of
concreteness is to show an audience something instead of
talking about it abstractly.

Simile

The second form of imagery is simile. As you probably learned
in English courses, a simile is a figure of speech in which two
unlike things are explicitly compared. Speakers use similes to
help an audience understand a specific characteristic being
described within the speech. The following are some examples:

   The thunderous applause was like a party among the
      gods.

   After the revelation, she was as angry as a raccoon caught
      in a cage.

   Love is like a battlefield.

When we look at these two examples, you'll see that two words
have been italicized: "like" and "as." All similes contain either
"like" or "as" within the comparison. In the first example, we
are connecting the type of applause being heard to something
supernatural, so we can imagine that the applause was huge
706 | 12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY

and enormous. Now think how you would envision the event
if the simile likened the applause to a mime convention--your
mental picture changes dramatically, doesn't it?

   To effectively use similes within your speech, first look for
instances where you may already be finding yourself making
a comparison. For example, when you say, "Her fit is giving
royalty," you can make the simile, "She was dressed like a
queen." When you find situations where you are comparing
two things using "like" or "as," examine what it is that you are
comparing. In the queen example, consider what exactly about
her outfit looks regal. Lastly, once you see what two ideas you
are comparing, check the mental picture for yourself. Are you
getting the kind of mental image you desire? Is the image too
strong? Is the image too weak? You can always alter the image
to make it stronger or weaker depending on what your aim is.
Remember to avoid cliches and overused expressions.

Metaphor

The other commonly used form of imagery is the metaphor,
or a figure of speech where a term or phrase is applied to
something in a nonliteral way to suggest a resemblance. In the
case of a metaphor, one of the comparison items is said to
be the other (even though this is literally or realistically not
possible). Let's look at a few examples:

   Love is a battlefield.
                                  12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY | 707

   Upon hearing the charges, the accused clammed up and
      refused to speak without a lawyer.

   Every year a new crop of activists are born.

In these examples, the comparison word has been italicized.
Let's think through each of these examples. In the first one, the
comparison is the same as one of our simile examples except
that the word "like" is omitted--instead of being like a
battlefield, the metaphor states that love is a battlefield, and it
is understood that the speaker does not mean the comparison
literally. In the second example, the accused "clams up," which
means that the accused refused to talk in the same way a clam's
shell is closed. In the third example, we refer to activists as
"crops" that arise anew with each growing season, and we use
"born" figuratively to indicate that they come into
being--even though it is understood that they are not
newborn infants at the time when they become activists.

   To use a metaphor effectively, first determine what you are
trying to describe. For example, maybe you are talking about
a course's webpage, for example on Canvas, Google classroom,
or Blackboard. Second, identify what it is that you want to
say about the object you are trying to describe. Depending on
whether you want your audience to think of the course page
as good or bad, you'll use different words to describe it. Lastly,
identify the other object you want to compare the first one to,
which should mirror the intentions in the second step. Let's
look at two possible metaphors:
708 | 12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY

   We fumbled our way through the maze of links and
      assignments on Canvas.

   We flew through the menu of links and assignments on
      Canvas.

While both of these examples evoke comparisons with the
course catalog, the first example is clearly more negative and
the second is more positive. Take a look at the second example
again. The word menu might not seem like a metaphor. With
long term usage, the origin of this word as a figure of speech is
forgotten.

   One mistake people often make in using metaphors is to
make two incompatible comparisons in the same sentence or
line of thought. Here is an example:

   "That's awfully thin gruel for the right wing to hang
      their hats on" (Nordquist, 2009).

This is known as a mixed metaphor, and it often has an
incongruous or even hilarious effect. Unless you are aiming
to entertain your audience with fractured use of language, be
careful to avoid mixed metaphors.

Rhythm

Our second guideline for effective language in a speech is to use
rhythm. When most people think of rhythm, they immediately
                                 12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY | 709

think about music. What they may not realize is that language
is inherently musical; at least it can be. Rhythm refers to the
patterned, recurring variance of elements of sound or speech.
Whether someone is striking a drum with a stick or standing
in front of a group speaking, rhythm is an important aspect
of human communication. Think about your favorite public
speaker. If you analyze his or her speaking pattern, you'll
notice that there is a certain cadence to the speech. While much
of this cadence is a result of the nonverbal components of
speaking, some of the cadence comes from the language that
is chosen as well. While delivery is important for all aspects
of speaking, it is especially important when using figures of
speech like simile and metaphor. Remember to vary your rate
and your volume to emphasize and enhance the impact of
those comparisons.

   Let's examine four types of rhythmic language: parallelism,
repetition, alliteration, and assonance.

Parallelism

When listing items in a sequence, audiences will respond more
strongly when those ideas are presented in a grammatically
parallel fashion, which is referred to as parallelism or parallel
structure. For example, look at the following two examples and
determine which one sounds better to you:

   "Give me liberty or I'd rather die."
710 | 12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY

   "Give me liberty or give me death."

Technically, you're saying the same thing in both, but the
second one has better rhythm, and this rhythm comes from
the parallel construction of "give me." The lack of parallelism
in the first example makes the sentence sound disjointed and
ineffective.

Repetition

As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, one of the major
differences between oral and written language is the use of
repetition. Because speeches are communicated orally,
audience members need to hear the core of the message
repeatedly. Repetition as a linguistic device is designed to help
audiences become familiar with a short piece of the speech as
they hear it over and over again. By repeating a phrase during
a speech, you create a specific rhythm. Probably the most
famous and memorable use of repetition within a speech is
Martin Luther King Jr.'s use of "I have a dream" in his speech
at the Lincoln Memorial on August 1963 during the March
on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. In that speech, Martin
Luther King Jr. repeated the phrase "I have a dream" eight
times to great effect. A more contemporary example is Lin-
Manuel Miranda's acceptance speech at the 2016 Tony
Awards, delivered shortly after the Pulse nightclub shooting
in Orlando. In an emotional tribute, Miranda repeated the
                                   12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY | 711

phrase "love is love"--coincidentally repeating the word love
eight times--using the cadence and rhythm of repetition to
emphasize the enduring power of love in the face of hate and
violence. The phrase became instantly iconic, not just for its
poetic structure, but for how it captured a collective emotional
truth in a moment of national grief.

Alliteration & Assonance

Another type of rhythmic language is alliteration, or using two
or more words in a series that begin with the same consonant.
In the Harry Potter novel series, the author uses alliteration
to name the four wizards who founded Hogwarts School for
Witchcraft and Wizardry: Godric Gryffindor, Helga
Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. There
are two basic types of alliteration: immediate juxtaposition and
nonimmediate juxtaposition. Immediate juxtaposition occurs
when the consonants clearly follow one after the other--as we
see in the Harry Potter example. Nonimmediate juxtaposition
occurs when the consonants are repeated in nonadjacent
words (for example, "It is the poison that we must purge from
our politics, the wall that we must tear down before the hour
grows too late") (Obama, 2008). Sometimes you can actually
use examples of both immediate and nonimmediate
juxtapositions within a single speech. The following example is
from Bill Clinton's acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic
National Convention: "Somewhere at this very moment, a
712 | 12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY

child is being born in America. Let it be our cause to give that
child a happy home, a healthy family, and a hopeful future"
(Clinton, 2005). Be wary, however, of overusing alliteration
which can inadvertently turn your speech into a tongue
twister.

   Assonance is similar to alliteration, but instead of relying
on consonants, assonance gets its rhythm from repeating the
same vowel sounds with different consonants in the stressed
syllables. The phrase "how now brown cow," which elocution
students traditionally used to learn to pronounce rounded
vowel sounds, is an example of assonance. While rhymes like
"free as a breeze," "mad as a hatter," and "no pain, no gain" are
examples of assonance, speakers should be wary of relying on
assonance because when it is overused it can quickly turn into
bad poetry.

Use Inclusive Language

Language can either inspire your listeners or turn them off
very quickly. One of the fastest ways to alienate an audience
is using non-inclusive language. Inclusive language is language
that avoids placing any one group of people above or below
other groups while speaking. Let's look at some common
problem areas related to language about gender, ethnicity,
sexual orientation, and disabilities.
        12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY | 713

Gender

The first common form of non-inclusive language is language
that privileges male gender. There are three common problem
areas that speakers run into while speaking: using "he" as
generic, using "man" to mean all humans, and gender typing
jobs.

   The generic "he" happens when a speaker labels all people
within a group as "he" when in reality there is a mixed gender
group involved. Consider the statement, "Every morning
when an officer of the law puts on his badge, he risks his life
to serve and protect his fellow citizens." In this case, we have
a police officer that is labeled as male four different times in
one sentence. Obviously, both men and women police officers
risk their lives when they put on their badges. A better way
to word the sentence would be, "Every morning when officers
of the law put on their badges, they risk their lives to serve
and protect their fellow citizens." Notice that in the better
sentence, we made the subject plural ("officers") and used
neutral pronouns ("they" and "their") to avoid the generic
"he."

   Traditionally, speakers of English have used terms like
"man," "mankind," and (in casual contexts) "guys" when
referring to both females and males. In the second half of the
twentieth century, as society became more aware of gender
bias in language, organizations like the National Council of
Teachers of English developed guidelines for nonsexist
714 | 12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY

language (National Council of Teachers of English, 2002). For
example, instead of using the word "man," you could refer to
the "human race." Instead of saying, "hey, guys," you could
say, "OK, everyone." By using gender-fair language you will be
able to convey your meaning just as well, and you won't risk
alienating half of your audience.

   The last common area where speakers get into trouble with
gender and language has to do with job titles. It is not unusual
for people to assume, for example, that doctors are men and
nurses are women. As a result, they may say "she is a female
doctor" or "he is a male nurse" when mentioning someone's
occupation, perhaps not realizing that the statements "she is
a doctor" and "he is a nurse" already inform the listener as to
the sex of the person holding that job. Table 12.1 "Language
for occupations" lists some common gender- specific jobs titles
along with more inclusive versions of those job titles.
            Table 12.1 Language for Occupations

Waiters             Wait staff / servers

Mailman             Mail carrier / postal worker
716 | 12.2 USING LANGUAGE EFFECTIVELY

Ethnic Identity

Another type of inclusive language relates to the categories
used to highlight an individual's ethnic identity. Ethnic
identity refers to a group an individual identifies with based
on a common culture. For example, within the United States
we have numerous ethnic groups, including Italian Americans,
Irish Americans, Japanese Americans, Vietnamese Americans,
Cuban Americans, and Mexican Americans. As with the
earlier example of "male nurse," avoid statements such as "The
committee is made up of four women and a Vietnamese man."
Instead, say, "The committee is made up of four women and
a man" or, if race and ethnicity are central to the discussion,
"The committee is made up of three European American
women, an Israeli American woman, a Brazilian American
woman, and a Vietnamese American man." In recent years,
there has been a trend toward steering inclusive language away
from broad terms like "Asians" and "Latinos" because these
terms are not considered precise labels for the groups they
actually represent. If you want to be safe, the best thing you
can do is ask a couple of people who belong to an ethnic group
how they prefer to label themselves.

heterosexism.  Heterosexism                  Beyond the

case, it also assumes that everyone

will label their significant others as

either "husbands" or "wives."

Although some members of the

community will use these terms,

others prefer for more gender-

neutral terms like "spouse" and

"partner." Moreover, legal obligations for same-sex couples

may be very different from those for heterosexual couples.
Notice also that we have used the phrase "members of the
gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender/transexual community"
instead of the more clinical- sounding term "homosexual."

Disability

The last category of exclusive versus inclusive language that
causes problems for some speakers relates to individuals with
physical or mental disabilities. Table 12.2 "Inclusive Language

versus inclusive language.

12.3 FIVE ELEMENTS OF
LANGUAGE

   Jacqueline M. Gianico

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand the five elements of language important for
      public speakers.

 2. Utilize the five elements of language in your own public
      speeches.

Language is a very important aspect of anyone's public
speaking performance. Whether a speaker uses lots of
complicated words or words most people have in their
vocabularies, language will determine how an audience
experiences the speech. To help you think through your
language choices, we are going to talk about five important
elements of language and how they affect audience
perceptions.

Clarity

The first important element of language is clarity, or the use
                                   12.3 FIVE ELEMENTS OF LANGUAGE | 721

of language to make sure the audience understands a speaker's
ideas in the way the speaker intended. While language, or
verbal communication, is only one channel we can use to
transmit information, it is a channel that can lend itself to
numerous problems. For example, as discussed earlier, if
people have different connotative definitions for words, the
audience can miss the intended meaning of a message.

   The clearer your language, the more likely your audience is
to stay engaged and understand your message. Imagine you're
listening to a speaker who uses the phrase, "Rapidly prepared,
mass-produced culinary commodities," or "An aspirational
socio-economic construct rooted in Western ideals of
prosperity, individual achievement, and upward mobility." If
you're like most people, these phrases might leave you
scratching your head. To clarify, the first refers to fast food,
and the second is a verbose way of saying the American
Dream. Notice how the overly complex versions are far less
clear than the commonly understood terms.

Accessibility

Obscure language and jargon are two terms that closely relate
to each other. Obscure language refers to language choices
that are not typically understood or known by most of your
audience. Imagine you're listening to a speech and the speaker
says, "Today I've given you a plethora of ideas for greening
your workplace." While you may think the word "plethora" is
722 | 12.3 FIVE ELEMENTS OF LANGUAGE

commonly known, we can assure you that many people have
no idea that plethora means many or an abundance of
something. Similarly, you may think most people know what
it means to "green" a workplace, but in fact many people do
not know that it means to make the workplace more
environmentally friendly, or to reduce its impact on the
environment. In the case of this example, plethora simply
means the speaker has given many ideas for greening the
workplace. You can still use the word "plethora," but you
should include a definition so that you're sure all will
understand.

   Jargon, on the other hand, refers to language that is
commonly used by a highly specialized group, trade, or
profession. For example, there is legal jargon, or the language
commonly used by and understood by lawyers. There is also
medical jargon, or the language commonly used by and
understood by health care practitioners. Every group, trade, or
profession will have its own specific jargon. The problem that
occurs for many speakers is not realizing that jargon is group,
trade, or profession specific and not universal. One common
form of jargon is the acronym, a word formed by taking the
first letters or groups of letters of words, such as NASDAQ
(National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations), PET (positron emission tomography) scan, or
IHOP (International House of Pancakes). Another form of
jargon is initialism, formed by pronouncing the initials rather
than the name of an organization or other entity. For example,
                                   12.3 FIVE ELEMENTS OF LANGUAGE | 723

CDC stands for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, fMRI stands for Functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging, and B of A stands for Bank of America. In political
discussions, you may come across various CFRs, or Codes of
Federal Regulations. If you are going to use a specific acronym
or initialism within your speech, you need to explain it the first
time you use it. For example, you could say,

   "According to the United States Code of Federal
Regulations, or CFR, employment discrimination in the
Department of Homeland Security is not allowed based on
biological sex, religion, sexual orientation, or race.
Furthermore, the US CFR does not permit discrimination in
receiving contracts based on biological sex, religion, sexual
orientation, or race."

   By defining the jargon upon first mention, we are
subsequently able to use the jargon because we can be certain
the audience now understands the term.

   While you probably wouldn't intentionally make your
speech harder to understand by using such convoluted
language, this example shows how important it is to use clear,
direct wording. This is also related to the next important
element of language: economy.

Economy

A mistake among new public speakers is thinking that more
words are more impressive. On the contrary, fewer or more
724 | 12.3 FIVE ELEMENTS OF LANGUAGE

carefully selected words are usually the preference. When
people ramble on and on without making a point, audiences
become bored and distracted, or even annoyed. To avoid this
problem, we recommend word economy, or the use of only
those words necessary to accurately express your idea. If the
fundamental idea you are trying to say is, "that stinks," then
saying something like "while the overall outcome may be
undesirable and definitely not recommended" becomes
overkill. We do have one caveat here: you want to make sure
that your language isn't so basic that it turns off your audience.
If you are speaking to adults and use vocabulary appropriate
for school children, you'll end up offending your audience.
So, while economy is important, you don't want to become so
overly basic that you are perceived as "talking down" to your
audience.

Power

Power is an individual's ability to influence another person
to think or behave in a manner the other person would not
have otherwise done. DeVito examined how language can be
used to help people gain power over others or lose power over
others (DeVito, 2009). Table 12.3 "Powerful and Powerless
Language" provides examples of both powerful language and
powerless language a speaker can use during a speech.
Powerless language should generally be avoided in public
                                   12.3 FIVE ELEMENTS OF LANGUAGE | 725

speaking because it can damage audience perceptions of the
speaker's credibility.

Variety

   The last important aspect of language is variety, or a
728 | 12.3 FIVE ELEMENTS OF LANGUAGE

speaker's ability to use and implement a range of different
language choices. In many ways, variety encompasses all the
characteristics of language previously discussed in this chapter.
You have probably heard of the clich, variety is the spice of
life. You don't want your speech to be bland! Your audience
will stop listening. Using a variety of language tools ensures
that your speech is interesting. Be careful, though. Often
speakers find one language device and then beat it into the
ground like a railroad spike. Unfortunately, when a speaker
starts using the same language device too often, it will start
to lose the power that it may have had. For this reason, we
recommend that you always think about the language you plan
on using in a speech and make sure that you use a range of
language choices.

12.4: CONCLUSION: THE
IMPORTANCE OF
LANGUAGE

   Jacqueline M. Gianico

Language is more than the medium of your message. It is the
experience of your message. The words you choose, the
imagery you create, and the rhythm you craft all work together
to help your audience listen, feel, and understand. As you've
seen throughout this chapter, effective speakers make
intentional decisions about language: they choose words that
match their purpose, adapt their phrasing to the needs of their
audience, lean on vivid images to make ideas memorable, and
select inclusive language that honors the diverse people
listening.

   Mastering public speaking does not mean sounding perfect.
It means sounding attentive, thoughtful, and curious about
how your words will land. When you pay attention to
denotations and connotations, when you distinguish between
oral and written language, and when you shape your message
around the people in the room, you earn something far more
important than applause because you earn trust.

   As you continue practicing and preparing your speeches,
730 | 12.4: CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF LANGUAGE

notice how even small adjustments in wording can transform a
message from confusing to clear, from generic to vivid, or from
exclusive to welcoming. These choices matter not only in class,
but everywhere you communicate. Language can build bridges
or barriers; it can clarify or distort; it can open conversations
or shut them down. When you choose your words with care,
you're not just improving a speech. You're strengthening your
relationships, enhancing your credibility, and contributing to
a more thoughtful and inclusive public sphere.

          Key Takeaways

           Using appropriate language means that a
             speaker's language is suitable or fitting for
             themselves, as the speaker; our audience; the
             speaking context; and the speech itself.

           Vivid language helps listeners create mental
             images. It involves both imagery (e.g.,
             concreteness, simile, and metaphor) and
             rhythm (e.g., parallelism, repetition,
             alliteration, and assonance).

           Inclusive language avoids placing any one
             group of people above or below other groups
             while speaking. As such, speakers need to
             think about how they refer to various groups
12.4: CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF LANGUAGE | 731

    within society.
  Language is important in every aspect of our

    lives because it allows people to communicate
    in a manner that enables the sharing of
    common ideas.
  Denotative definitions are the agreed-upon
    meanings of words that are often found in
    dictionaries, whereas connotative definitions
    involve what an individual conceives of when
    they think of the word.
  Misunderstandings commonly occur when the
    source of a message intends one denotative
    or connotative meaning and the receiver of
    the message applies a different denotative or
    connotative meaning to the same word or
    words.
  Oral language is designed to be listened to
    and to sound conversational, which means
    that word choice must be simpler, more
    informal, and more repetitive. Written
    language uses a larger vocabulary and is more
    formal.
  Five common language features that impact
    public speakers are clarity, accessibility,
    economy, power, and variety.
732 | 12.4: CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF LANGUAGE

           When public speakers prepare, they need to
             make sure that their speeches contain clear
             language, define uncommon terms, use as
             few words as possible to get their point
             across, employ powerful language, and
             include variety.

                    "across the miles" and "across the

Speaking in public has more formality than talking. During

a speech, you present yourself professionally. This doesn't

mean you must always wear a suit or "dress up" (unless your

instructor asks you to or the person inviting you to give the
13.1: TECHNIQUES AND METHODS OF SPEECH DELIVERY | 741

presentation indicates that there is a professional attire

required for the event), but it does mean making yourself

presentable by being well-groomed and wearing clean,

appropriate clothes. It also means being prepared to use

language correctly and appropriately for the audience and the

topic, to make eye contact with your audience, to include non-

verbals correctly, and to know your topic well. You will recall

from an earlier chapter that these elements form what is often

called the "ethos"--the spirit that gives the speaker--that's

you--credibility!

In other words, your presentation must be researched,

planned and practiced, thereby enhancing your credibility and

reinforcing your expertise on the topic on which you are

presenting.

Impromptu Speaking

Impromptu speaking is the presentation of a short message
without advance preparation. Impromptu speeches often
occur when someone is asked to "say a few words" or give
a toast on a special occasion. You have probably done
impromptu speaking many times in informal, conversational
settings without even realizing the impromptu. In this speech
class in which you are enrolled, you speak impromptu when
the instructor asks you a question for which you are to provide
the answer. Self-introductions in group settings are other
examples of impromptu speaking: "Hi, my name is Steve, and
746 | 13.1: TECHNIQUES AND METHODS OF SPEECH DELIVERY

I'm a volunteer with the Homes for the Brave program."

Another example of impromptu speaking occurs when you

answer a question such as, "What did you think of the

documentary?"

The advantage of this kind of speaking is that it's

spontaneous and responsive in an animated group context.

The disadvantage is that you are given little or no time to

contemplate the central theme of the message and be able to

prepare organized and supported main points of a speech. As

a result, the message may be disorganized and difficult for

listeners to follow. Impromptu speeches are generally most

successful when they are brief and focus on a single point.

Extemporaneous Speaking

Extemporaneous speaking is the presentation of a carefully
planned and rehearsed speech, spoken in a conversational
manner, using brief notes. By using brief notes rather than a
full manuscript, the extemporaneous speaker can establish and
maintain eye contact with the audience and assess how well
the audience is understanding the speech as it progresses. The
opportunity to assess is also an opportunity to restate more
clearly any idea or concept that the audience seems to have
trouble grasping.
748 | 13.1: TECHNIQUES AND METHODS OF SPEECH DELIVERY

                   example to illustrate the idea.

                   Then you can resume your

                   message, having clarified an

                   important concept without

                   disconnecting the audience from

your message.

Speaking extemporaneously has advantages. It promotes the

likelihood that you, the speaker, will be perceived as

knowledgeable and credible. In addition, your audience is
      13.1: TECHNIQUES AND METHODS OF SPEECH DELIVERY | 749

likely to pay better attention to the message because you are
engaging the audience verbally and you are including
nonverbal gestures at key points of the presentation. The
disadvantage of extemporaneous speaking is that it requires a
great deal of preparation for both the verbal and the nonverbal
components of the speech. Adequate preparation cannot be
achieved the day before or the day of your scheduled
presentation. One key warning here: if you are given only a
day or two to prepare for a speech and you are not certain that
you can be adequately prepared for the occasion, you should
politely decline the opportunity for another time when you
have more time to prepare. Being thrust into a situation where
your credibility is at stake and where the audience's
expectations are high can prove disastrous. Extemporaneous
speaking is a most popular mode of delivery and it should be
given the time and focus out of respect for the audience and
you, too!

   Because extemporaneous speaking is the style used in the
great majority of public speaking situations, most of the
information in this chapter is targeted to this kind of speaking.

Speaking from a Manuscript

Manuscript speaking is the word-for-word delivery of a written
message. In a manuscript speech, the speaker maintains his or
her attention on the printed page except when using visual aids
750 | 13.1: TECHNIQUES AND METHODS OF SPEECH DELIVERY

needing to direct the audience's attention to something else

that accompanies the speech, such as a prop used for emphasis.

The advantage to reading from a manuscript is the exact

repetition of original words. As we mentioned at the

beginning of this chapter, in some circumstances, this can be

extremely important. For example, reading a statement about

your organization's legal responsibilities to customers may

require that the original words be exact. This means that you

still need to practice reading the manuscript to avoid

mispronouncing unfamiliar words or phrases or names.

                     However, there are challenges

                     involved in manuscript speaking.

audiences are created equal. Keep

in mind that manuscript speaking

does not preclude using eye

contact. Take the opportunity to look at the audience at

various times during your reading of the manuscript: before

important points for emphasis, at the end of paragraphs, and

between transitions from parts of the speech, such as between

the main points and just before the conclusion.

It is worth noting that professional speakers, actors, news

reporters, and even elected officials often read from an autocue

device called a Teleprompter, especially when appearing on

television, where eye contact with the camera is crucial.

However, using this device does not come without extensive

practice so that it appears the person is not reading but that

it almost appears as if the reporter or actor or official knows

the content by memory. With practice, a speaker can achieve

a conversational tone and give the impression of speaking

extemporaneously while using an autocue device. However,

success in this medium depends on two factors: (1) the speaker

is already an accomplished public speaker who has learned to

use a conversational tone while delivering a prepared script,
752 | 13.1: TECHNIQUES AND METHODS OF SPEECH DELIVERY

and (2) the speech is written in a style that sounds
conversational.

   In conclusion, manuscript delivery, especially for students
just beginning to sharpen their speaking skills, should only be
used for short speeches, such as a wedding or anniversary toast

Speaking from Memory

Memorized speaking is the direct recitation of a written

message that the speaker has committed to memory. Actors,

of course, recite from memory whenever they perform from a

script in a stage play, television program, or movie scene. When

it comes to speeches, however, memorization can be useful

when the message needs to be exact and the speaker doesn't

want to be confined by notes.

                               The  advantage  to

difficult to find your place and keep going, all of which impacts

      situations

The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his famous "I
Have a Dream" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial
at a civil rights rally on an August afternoon in 1963. His
lectern was bristling with microphones placed there for news
coverage and for recording the historic event. His audience,
estimated to number a quarter of a million people, extended
as far as the eye could see. He was the last speaker of the day,
delivering his speech after more than a dozen civil rights leaders
756 | 13.2: LOGISTICS, DETAILS THAT IMPACT DELIVERY,
COMBATTING ANXIETY, AND THE USE OF HUMOR

and world-famous performers such as singer/songwriter, Joan
Baez, opera superstar, Mahalia Jackson, and various popular
actors and actresses of the time, including Harry Belafonte and
Diahann Carroll, had occupied the stage (Ross, 2007). King
gave us his speech in the assertive ringing tones of inspired
vision. Nothing less would have worked that day.

   Most of us will never speak to so many people at once. Even
an appearance on television will probably command a much
smaller audience than the crowd that heard King's speech.
Even though you don't expect an audience of such size or
a setting of such symbolic importance, you should still be
prepared to adapt to the setting in which you will speak and
adapt your delivery to that setting.

   Our audiences, circumstances and physical contexts for
public speaking will vary. At some point in your life you may
run for public office or you may rise to a leadership role in a
business or community nonprofit organization. Or you may
be responsible for informing coworkers about a new policy,
regulation or opportunity. You may be asked to deliver
remarks in the context of a worship service, wedding or
funeral. You may be asked to introduce a keynote speaker or
simply make an important announcement in some context
related to your job or even related to another course or class
or training scenario. Sometimes you will speak in a familiar
environment, while at other times you may be faced with an
unfamiliar location and very little time to get used to speaking
with a microphone. We call these contexts and situations that
    13.2: LOGISTICS, DETAILS THAT IMPACT DELIVERY, COMBATTING
                                   ANXIETY, AND THE USE OF HUMOR | 757

impact how we deliver the presentations and we will delve into
them in detail here.

First, Ask for Logistical
Information

While you may already have read in this book that you need
to ask for specifics about the venue in which you are speaking,
it bears repeating here, because speaking logistics play directly
into how you eventually deliver your presentation. Remember
to make a checklist and ask about:

   Purpose of the gathering
   How many people are expected to attend
   Format--time limits and agenda of the meeting in

      which you are speaking
   What precedes and follows your presentation (meals,

      other speakers, videos)
   Anything special about the day, week, month, event
   Physical conditions of the room (size, podium/lectern

      available, microphone, lighting, audio/visual
      availabilities)
   Visuals and/or props you need and having easy access to
      where you are speaking
   Water to refresh your voice
758 | 13.2: LOGISTICS, DETAILS THAT IMPACT DELIVERY,
COMBATTING ANXIETY, AND THE USE OF HUMOR

Using a Lectern or Podium

A lectern is a small, raised surface, usually with a slanted top,
where a speaker can place notes during a speech. While a
lectern adds a measure of formality to the speaking situation,
it allows speakers the freedom to do three things: to come out
from behind the lectern to establish more immediate contact
with the audience, to use both hands for gestures, and to also
serve as a place for your speaker notes.

   A podium is a larger version of the lectern, and it may have a
built-in light to illuminate your notes, it may also have a built-
in microphone, and, sometimes, it has a sign or seal on the
front that highlights the logo of the venue in which you are
speaking.

   However, for new speakers who feel anxious, it is all too
tempting to grip the edges of the lectern or podium with both
hands for security. You might even wish you could hide behind
it. Be aware of these temptations so you can manage them
effectively and present yourself to your audience in a manner
they will perceive as confident and knowledgeable. One way to
achieve this is by limiting your use of the lectern or podium
to simply serve as a place to rest your notes. Try stepping to
the side or front of the lectern or podium when speaking to
free your hands so you can gesture to enhance your speech
content, only occasionally standing behind it to consult your
notes. This will enhance your eye contact with the audience.

Speaking in a Small or Large
Physical Space

If you are accustomed to being in a classroom of a certain size,
you will need to make adjustments when speaking in a smaller
or larger space than what you are used to experiencing while
speaking. While not all classrooms are created equal, speaking
in a classroom is good practice for when you do have to move
to a more professional and public setting outside of the college
or university.

   A large auditorium can be intimidating, especially for
speakers who feel shy and "exposed" when facing an audience.
However, the maxim that "proper preparation prevents poor
performance" is just as true here as anywhere. If you have
prepared and practiced well, you can approach a large-venue
speaking engagement with confidence. In terms of practical
adjustments, be aware that your voice may echo is a cavernous
space, so you will want to speak more slowly than usual and
make use of pauses to mark the ends of phrases and sentences.
Similarly, your facial expressions and gestures should be larger
so that they are visible from farther away. If you are using
visuals or props, they need to be large enough to be visible
from the back of the auditorium. Be aware that your slides
should be simple and not complex, as too much information
on a slide will be hard to read by the audience from the back of
a large room or venue.

   Limited space is not as disconcerting for most speakers as
760 | 13.2: LOGISTICS, DETAILS THAT IMPACT DELIVERY,
COMBATTING ANXIETY, AND THE USE OF HUMOR

enormous space, but it has the advantage of minimizing the
tendency to pace back and forth while you speak. A small
space also calls for more careful management of notecards and
visuals and props, as your audience will be able to see up close
what you are doing with your hands. Do your best to minimize
fumbling with your visuals. You can avoid this by arriving early
to your venue and determining how to organize your materials
in the physical space. Proper use of slides and other visuals will
be discussed in a future chapter in this book.

Speaking Outdoors

Outdoor settings can be charming and quite unique, but they
are prone to distractions. If you're giving a speech in a setting
that is picturesquely beautiful, it may be difficult to maintain
the audience's attention. If you know this ahead of time, you
might plan your speech to focus more on mood than
information, and perhaps to make reference to the lovely view.

   More typically, outdoor speech venues can pose challenges
with weather, sun glare, and uninvited guests, such as bugs
and birds and other wildlife. If the venue is located near a
busy highway or near an airport, it might be difficult to make
yourself heard over the ambient traffic noise. You might lack
the usual accommodation, such as a lectern or podium or
table. Whatever the situation, you will need to use your best
efforts to project your voice clearly without sounding like
    13.2: LOGISTICS, DETAILS THAT IMPACT DELIVERY, COMBATTING
                                   ANXIETY, AND THE USE OF HUMOR | 761

you're yelling. Hopefully, in this type of scenario, you can
request a microphone.

Using a Microphone

Most people today are familiar with microphones that are built
into video recorders and other electronic devices like a
smartphone, but they may be new at using a microphone to
deliver a speech or presentation. One overall principle to
remember is that a microphone only amplifies a voice, it does
not clarify or provide vocal volume. If you are not enunciating
clearly or if you speak softly, the microphone will merely
enable your audience to hear amplified mumbling or just a
soft voice. Also, if you have the tendency to speak softly, the
microphone will not make you sound louder, but instead, it
will make your speaking more focused on the softness in your
voice.

   Microphones come in a wide range of styles and sizes.
Generally, the easiest microphone to use is the clip-on style
worn on the front of your shirt or jacket. If you look closely
at many television personalities and news anchors, you will
notice these tiny microphones clipped to their clothing. They
require very little adaptation. You simply have to avoid looking
down and attempting to talk into it. It is omnidirectional, so it
can pick up your voice from all angles, and your voice will be
adequately amplified.

   Lectern and podium microphones and handheld
762 | 13.2: LOGISTICS, DETAILS THAT IMPACT DELIVERY,
COMBATTING ANXIETY, AND THE USE OF HUMOR

microphones require more adaptation. If they're too close to
your mouth, they can screech. If they're too far away, they
might not pick up your voice and they may not pick up all
of your words. Some microphones are directional, meaning
that they are only effective when you speak directly into them.
If there is any opportunity to do so, ask for tips about how
to use a particular microphone and practice with it for a few
minutes while you have someone listen from a middle row in
the audience and signal whether you can be heard well. The
best plan, of course, would be to have access to the microphone
for practice ahead of the speaking date. Always ask to check
the audio-visual capabilities in the venue in which you are
speaking. Again, arrive early to look at the venue and to adapt,
as necessary.

   Often a microphone is provided just because it is attached
to a podium or because it is kept in the venue space, even when
it isn't necessary. If the room is small or the audience is close to
you, do not feel obligated to use the microphone. Sometimes
an amplified voice can feel less natural and less compelling than
a direct voice. However, if you do not use the microphone,
make sure to speak loudly enough for all audience members to
hear you--not just those in the front of the room. Anytime
you think that the audience may not be able to hear you, use a
microphone. It can be your speaker's tool best friend!

Audience Size

A small audience is an opportunity for a more intimate,
minimally formal tone. If your audience has fewer than two
dozen people, you can usually generate greater audience
contact. You do not have to revamp your speech just because
the audience is small. When the presentation concludes, there
will most likely be opportunities to answer questions and have
individual contact with your listeners.

   Your classroom audience may need to be in a virtual
modality from time to time. Let's say you have as many as 20
to 30 students. The format for an audience of this size is still
formal but conversational. Depending on how your instructor
structures the class, you may or may not be asked to leave time
after your speech for questions and answers.

   Some audiences are much larger. If you have an audience
that fills an auditorium, or if you have an auditorium with only
a few people in it, you still have a clearly formal task, and you
should be guided as much as possible by your preparation. A
good strategy with a small audience in a large room is to ask
everyone to move closer to you in the front of the room. Most
people will respond favorably and move.

Navigating the Virtual
Presentation

Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, more presentations
have gone to a virtual format, thereby permitting less travel
to speaking venues and easier control of your speech content.
However, the planning and preparation for a virtual
presentation is no different than if you were going to be
presenting at an auditorium or a smaller conference-style
meeting room. The elements of voice, content, use of visuals,
and engagement with the audience is even more important.
While these virtual presentations are live (and sometimes, you
are recorded for playback later to people who were unable to
hear you speak in a "virtual live" modality) you still need to
avoid reading your notes. While the camera is on, the virtual
audience can see your eyes move around the screen as you are
reading. Your voice needs to remain strong, without shouting,
because the microphone is likely built into your computer or
laptop. Your slide presentation needs to be easy to follow as
you speak, and, most important, you need to show enthusiasm
and knowledge about your topic. Nothing is more boring than
having a virtual presentation where the speaker sounds bored,
lacks excitement and interest in informing the audience about
the topic, or if the technology does not work. Take time to
test your slides and your camera and the Internet connection.
Do not trade convenience of the presentation for lack of
professionalism in all aspects of the presentation.
    13.2: LOGISTICS, DETAILS THAT IMPACT DELIVERY, COMBATTING
                                   ANXIETY, AND THE USE OF HUMOR | 765

   Take note of your surroundings, especially if you are
presenting from a home office. Opt for a neutral background
to avoid distractions. Make certain that you have good lighting
on your face so you can be seen clearly. Increase the volume
on your computer or laptop and minimize background noise
by closing open windows and shutting doors that may lead to
other parts of your presentation space. And while it may seem
funny to some people, make sure any pets or small children
are not accessible to your space while you are presenting. Dress
professionally, too, for the virtual. Delivery is all about the
verbals AND your non-verbals, too, especially in a virtual
environment.

rooms, small rooms, outdoors, or virtual spaces requires
different delivery adaptations. This activity helps you
recognize which strategies work best in different speaking
settings.

                   An interactive H5P element has been
                   excluded from this version of the text. You

Wrap up: Understanding how context shapes delivery helps
you adapt confidently and maintain audience engagement
across all environments.

Channeling Anxiety into Positive
Energy

Being nervous or having anxiety and worry before a major
speech, whether it is in your classroom or at a venue to which
you have been invited, is absolutely normal. Know that anxiety
if a healthy and natural response when you are preparing to
speak in front of people you do not know (and, sometimes, in
front of people you do know!) You can channel that energy to
your advantage just by being prepared and knowing your topic
"inside and out," "backwards and forwards," as the old saying
goes. That helps to reduce the fear of public speaking.

   Always remember, too, that your audience wants you to do
well. These people have come to hear you speak and to learn
something from you. That is a true compliment to your ability
to present professionally.
    13.2: LOGISTICS, DETAILS THAT IMPACT DELIVERY, COMBATTING
                                   ANXIETY, AND THE USE OF HUMOR | 767

   Here is a quick checklist of things you can do to help create
positive energy before any speech:

   Know your audience--feel free to talk to people before
      your speech--welcome them to the room and even
      introduce yourself to people you do not know

   Memorize the open and close of your speech--while the
      recommendation is to not memorize an entire speech,
      sometimes you can memorize your attention getter at
      the start and your powerful close that can bring about
      confidence.

   Visualize yourself successfully giving the speech and the
      audience responding favorably.

   Relaxation exercises, such as deep breathing, shoulder
      rolls and walking outside your speech venue helps
      alleviate tension

   Smile--Nothing exudes positivity than having someone
      smile back at you!

What About The Use of Humor in
Delivery?

Humor that produces a few chuckles from the audience can
reinforce your speech and add to the friendliness between you
and the audience. Humor in the form of a personal story or
anecdote or humorous quotation should always relate to your
presentation and should not be used simply to try to engage
768 | 13.2: LOGISTICS, DETAILS THAT IMPACT DELIVERY,
COMBATTING ANXIETY, AND THE USE OF HUMOR

the audience. This is not a nightclub comedy routine you are
presenting--it is an important speech! Humor that is
misplaced or derogatory in nature or disrespectful of people,
cultures, beliefs, or offensive to anyone or anything should
never be used. If you question your use of humor or are not
comfortable with using humor, then refrain from using it in
your speech.

 1. Know how to use notecards to free you from your

 3. Understand how to develop effective notecards for a
      speech

It's a great deal of work to prepare a good speech or other
presentation, and you want to present it effectively and
memorably so that your audience will benefit as much as
possible from your knowledge and expertise. We've already
said that extemporaneous speaking provides the best
opportunity for speaker-audience contact and that speaking
extemporaneously means you do not have your full
770 | 13.3: TAKE NOTE! DO NOT SPEAK WITHOUT NOTES/LEARN
TO USE THEM EFFECTIVELY

manuscript or outline with you. Instead, you will use
notecards. The cards should have notes/keywords/bullet
points that help you remember what is to follow. The notes do
not contain the full text of your speech. If you practice your
presentation, the keywords on notecards help to "jog your
memory" so you recall what you need to say next.

   Do not forget to number your notecards. If, for some
reason, you drop them on the floor, trying to remember their
order can be problematic if you are up against the starting time
of the speech.

   You can select the best way to use your notes during a
presentation. Sometimes people use five or six notecards with
the key points and subpoints noted on each card. Avoid the
temptation of typing out a full manuscript and then "cutting
and pasting" the sentences on the notecards. Guaranteed, you
will READ what you have included and that will disengage
you from your audience, drop your voice because you have to
look down to read the notecards, and, in short, this will detract
from your professionalism and credibility around your topic.

   Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to put
your entire speech on cards in little tiny writing. You will end
up reading words to your audience instead of telling them your
meaning, and the visual aspect of your speech will be spoiled
by your need to squint to read your cards.

   For many people, this does not sound like nearly enough
note cards. Again, practice and preparation are what will give
      13.3: TAKE NOTE! DO NOT SPEAK WITHOUT NOTES/LEARN TO

you the speaking ease for which you have been requested to
present.

   Another tip to help with notes is to color code the notecards
for each section of your speech. Since most well-prepared
speeches require three to five key points of content, perhaps
each notecard is a different color so you know when the points
change in the content of your speech.

   One caveat about the use of notecards: do not hold them in
your hands so that they become part of your nonverbals and
so that they distract the audience. In other words, lay them
on the lectern or podium and slide them across or stack them
once you complete the points on each card. The notecards are
never meant to be part of your nonverbals of any speech or
presentation. What then, is their true purpose, besides making
more work for you? Read on!

The Purpose of Speaker Notes

Using notes adds to your credibility (that ethos term you read
about earlier) as a speaker. If you depend on a full manuscript
to convey the content of your speech, your listeners might
believe you don't know the content of your speech. Second,
the temptation to read the entire speech directly from a
manuscript, even if you're only carrying it as a safety net, is
nearly overwhelming. It can distract you, too, from really
presenting the content and your own passion and enthusiasm
for the topic. Third, well-prepared, brief notecards are more
772 | 13.3: TAKE NOTE! DO NOT SPEAK WITHOUT NOTES/LEARN
TO USE THEM EFFECTIVELY

gracefully handled than sheets of paper, and they don't rattle
and shake if your hands tremble from nervousness.

   Finally, cards look better than sheets of paper which can
distract the audience. Five or six carefully prepared cards,
together with practice, will help you more than you might
think as you navigate throughout your presentation.
Notecards are small and will not distract the audience from
your important speech message!

Key Tips for Using Notes

Plan on using just five cards, written on one side only. Get 4
 6 cards. Larger cards can be unwieldy. If you think you can
include more information on a larger card, do not be mistaken!
Larger cards, like full sheets of paper as noted above, can be
distracting to you and your audience. Use one card for the
introduction, one card for each of your three to five main
points, and one card for the conclusion.

Include Only Key Words to Help Your
Memory

Your cards should include key words and phrases, not full
sentences. The words and phrases should be arranged in order
so that you can stay organized and avoid forgetting important
points.

   One exception to the key word guideline would be an
      13.3: TAKE NOTE! DO NOT SPEAK WITHOUT NOTES/LEARN TO
                                                   USE THEM EFFECTIVELY | 773

extended or highly technical quotation from an authoritative
source. If it is critically important to present an exact
quotation, you may add one additional card that will contain
the direct quotation, word-for-word, together with its citation
(i.e., "According to research from the American Medical
Association...") If you plan to use such a quotation, make sure
it has central importance in your speech. Quotations used in
presentations for the sake of using quotations and because you
may think they make you sound authoritative, are just a waste
of time and add nothing substantive to your speech.

Hold Your Notes Naturally, Not Like a
Prop

Notes are a normal part of giving a presentation. You do not
need to conceal them from the audience. In fact, trying to
hide and use your notes at the same time tends to be very
awkward and distracting. Some speakers recommend that you
avoid gesturing with your notes on the grounds that nervous
shaking is more noticeable if you are holding your notes in
your hand. If this is the case for you, practice gesturing with
your free hand, or put your cards down on the lectern/podium
if you need to use both hands. Other professional speakers
recommend treating notecards as a natural extension of your
hand, as they believe it is distracting to put your notes down
and pick them up multiple times. Whichever "rule" you
follow, remember that the goal is for your use of notecards
774 | 13.3: TAKE NOTE! DO NOT SPEAK WITHOUT NOTES/LEARN
TO USE THEM EFFECTIVELY

to contribute to your overall appearance of confidence and
credibility. They are to enhance your presentation, not detract
from it.

   Just one more note about using notes: if there is no lectern/
podium for your use during your presentation, then hold your
notecards at waist-level. You can still gesture but the notecards
will not detract from what you have to say.

Prepare Notecards to Trigger Recall

The "trick" to selecting the words to write on your cards is to
identify the keywords that will trigger a recall sequence from
your original speech preparation and detail. For instance, if the
word "Fukushima" brings to mind the nuclear power plant
meltdown that followed the earthquake and tsunami that hit
Japan in 2011, then that one word on your notecard should
propel you through a sizable sequence of points and details.
Once you have delivered that material, perhaps you'll glance at
your card again to remind yourself of the key word or phrase
that comes next.

   You must discover what works for you and then select those
words that tend to "jog your recall." Remember, you are not
memorizing all of the content from a speech manuscript. The
notecards and brief keywords are words you have chosen that
help you in your delivery. Having identified what works for
you, start to make a preliminary set of five or six cards, written
on one side only. Number the cards, and practice with them.
      13.3: TAKE NOTE! DO NOT SPEAK WITHOUT NOTES/LEARN TO
                                                   USE THEM EFFECTIVELY | 775

Revise and refine them the way you would an outline for an
English essay or term paper. If you must, rewrite an entire
card to make it work better, and then test it the next time you
practice.

   Because your presentation has a set time, you can write time
cues on your notecards, as well as pictures and Emojis that
remind you to smile, look at the entire audience, remember to
gesture to reinforce your content. Consider your notecards like
"cue cards" in a stage production. The key words and images
will help you along the way to including all that you want to
share with the audience.

   Always practice with your notecards--and with any visuals
and props you plan to use. Practicing is also the best way to
find out what kinds of things might go wrong with your notes
in the presented speech and what steps you should take to
make things go smoothly.

Write in Large Letters

You should be able to read something on your card by
glancing, not peering at it. A few key words and phrases,
written in large, bold print with plenty of white space between
them, will help you. If the lighting in your speech location is
likely to have glare, be sure to write your notes in ink, as pencil
can be hard to read in poor lighting. If you are using a podium
or lectern, ask someone if there is a built-in light and make sure
776 | 13.3: TAKE NOTE! DO NOT SPEAK WITHOUT NOTES/LEARN
TO USE THEM EFFECTIVELY

it is turned on so that your notecards are easy for you to see
during your presentation.

Practice Using Notecards
Effectively

If you use as much care in developing your notecards as you
do your speech, they should serve you well. If you lose your
place or go blank during the speech, you will only need a few
seconds to find where you were, based on the keywords on
your notecards, and then you can get going again. For instance,
if you know that you presented the introduction and the first
main point, which centers on the Emancipation Proclamation,
you can readily go to your second card and remind yourself
that your next main point is about the Thirteenth
Amendment to the US Constitution.

   In addition, the use of your notecards allows you to depart
from the exact prepared wordings in a manuscript. In your
recovery from losing your place, you can transpose a word
or phrase to make your recovery graceful. It allows you to
avoid feeling pressured to say every single word exactly as it
may have been written in a detailed manuscript. Again, this
comes from also having a well-planned, well-rehearsed speech.
DO NOT sacrifice the need to practice by just thinking that
your notecards will give you all you need. You need to be the
professional and be prepared before, during and after your
presentation.

   There is no foolproof recipe for good delivery. Each of us
is unique and we each embody different experiences and
interests. This means each person has an approach, or a style,
that is effective for that person. This further means that anxiety
can accompany even the most carefully researched and
interesting message. Even when we know our messages are
strong and well-articulated on paper, it is difficult to know
for sure that our presentation will also be good. This is what
worries most student speakers, but know that anxiety or worry
when giving a speech is completely normal and there are ways
to combat that anxiety, which we will review here.
   We are still obligated to do our best out of respect for the
audience and their needs. Fortunately, there are some tools
that can be helpful to you even the very first time you present
a speech. You will continue developing your skills each time
you put them to use and can experiment to find out which
combination of delivery elements is most effective for you.
Just as with anything, the more speeches and presentations
you give--either inside or outside of the classroom
                  13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A

environment--the more accomplished and professional you
will be when addressing an audience.

   Time is a valuable commodity. Failing to prepare and deliver
a speech within the time allotted to you wastes an audience's
time, shows disrespect for the people who invited you to speak
(and that includes your professors and your co-workers), and
detracts from your credibility as a speaker.

What Makes Good Delivery

The more you care about your topic, the greater your
motivation to present it well. Good delivery is a process of
presenting a clear, coherent message in an interesting way.
Communication scholar Stephen E. Lucas tells us:

   Good delivery...conveys the speaker's ideas clearly,
interestingly, and without distracting the audience. Most
audiences prefer delivery that combines a certain degree of
formality with the best attributes of good
conversation--directness, spontaneity, animation, vocal and
facial expressiveness, and a lively sense of communication
(Lucas, 2009).

   Many writers on the nonverbal aspects of delivery have cited
the findings of psychologist Albert Mehrabian, asserting that
the bulk of an audience's understanding of the message is
based on nonverbal communication. Specifically, Mehrabian
is often credited with finding that when audiences decoded
a speaker's meaning, the speaker's face conveyed 55 percent
782 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

of the information, the vocals/verbals conveyed 38 percent,
and the words themselves conveyed just 7 percent (Mehrabian,
1972). Although numerous scholars, including Mehrabian
himself, have stated that his findings are often misinterpreted
(Mitchell), scholars and speech instructors do agree that
nonverbal communication and speech delivery are extremely
important to effective public speaking.

   In this section of the chapter, we will explain six elements
of good delivery: conversational style, conversational quality,
eye contact, vocalics, physical manipulation, and variety. And
since delivery is only as good as the practice that goes into it, we
conclude with some tips for effective use of your practice time.

Conversational Style

Conversational style is a speaker's ability to sound expressive
and to be perceived by the audience as natural. It's a style that
approaches the way you normally express yourself in a much
smaller group than your classroom audience. This means that
you want to avoid having your presentation come across as
academic, stilted or overly exaggerated. You might not feel
natural while you're using a conversational style, but for the
sake of audience preference and receptiveness, you should do
your best to appear natural. It might be helpful to remember
that the two most important elements of the speech are the
message and the audience. You are the conduit with the
important role of putting the two together in an effective way.
                  13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
                                        PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION | 783

Your audience should be thinking about the message, not your
delivery.

   Stephen E. Lucas defines conversational quality as the idea
that "no matter how many times a speech has been rehearsed, it
still sounds spontaneous" [emphasis in original] (Lucas, 2009).
No one wants to hear a speech that is so well rehearsed that it
sounds fake or robotic. This means you need to strike a balance
between the two--knowing the content but still presenting
it with passion, enthusiasm and professionalism. One of the
hardest parts of public speaking is rehearsing to the point
where it can appear to your audience that the thoughts are
magically coming to you while you're speaking, but in reality
you've spent a great deal of time thinking through each idea.
When you can sound conversational, people pay attention and
respect your credibility.

Eye Contact--Staying Connected to
the Audience

Eye contact is a speaker's ability to have visual contact with
everyone in the audience. Your audience should feel that you're
speaking to them--speaking to each of them individually, even
though you are speaking to the group-not simply uttering
main and supporting points. If you are new to public speaking,
you may find it intimidating to look audience members in the
eye, but if you think about speakers you have seen who did not
maintain eye contact, you'll realize why this aspect of speech
784 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

delivery is important. Without eye contact, the audience
begins to feel invisible and unimportant, as if speakers are just
speaking to hear their own voices. Eye contact lets your
audience feel that your attention is on them, not solely on the
notes you may have in front of you.

   Learn the 80/20 rule for speeches and presentations:
practice speaking as many words as possible without looking at
your notes. Strive for 80% engaging with the audience and 20%
referring to your notes. This is supported by your ability to
actually know your opening and closing remarks by memory
so that the audience connects with you immediately and at the
end, remembers you positively!

   If you find the gaze of your audience too intimidating, you
might feel tempted to resort to "faking" eye contact with them
by looking at the wall just above their heads or by sweeping
your gaze around the room instead of making actual eye
contact with individuals in your audience until it becomes
easier to provide real contact. The problem with fake eye
contact is that it tends to look mechanical. Another problem
with fake attention is that you lose the opportunity to assess
the audience's understanding of your message. Know this:
audiences know when you are avoiding their focus. If you are
looking off to the back of the room where there is no audience,
people who are sitting in the front of the room will take notice.
You cannot avoid the eye contact, no matter how hard you try!

   Sustained eye contact with your audience is one of the most
important tools toward effective delivery. O'Hair, Stewart, and
                  13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
                                        PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION | 785

Rubenstein note that eye contact is mandatory for speakers
to establish a good relationship with an audience (O'Hair,
Stewart, & Rubenstein, 2001). Whether a speaker is speaking
before a group of five or five hundred, the appearance of eye
contact is an important way to bring an audience into your
speech. Eye contact can be a powerful tool. It is not simply
a sign of sincerity, a sign of being well prepared and
knowledgeable, or a sign of confidence; it also has the power
to convey meanings. Arthur Koch tells us that all facial
expressions "can communicate a wide range of emotions,
including sadness, compassion, concern, anger, annoyance,
fear, joy, and happiness" (Koch, 2010).

   One key tip to engage with the audience and retain eye
contact is to pick out a person in each section of the audience
and deliver your speech to each of those individuals. This keeps
your eyes moving about the audience and helps to sustain
audience engagement because it appears that you are looking
at everyone in the group. Try this the next time you give a
speech. The more you speak in front of larger audiences, the
more comfortable you will be with maintaining eye contact
that eventually you will be able to gaze throughout the room
with comfort and ease in delivering your speech.

LIVE ROOM
   ZOOM PRESENTATION

This is not to say that you may never look at your notecards.
On the contrary, one of the skills in extemporaneous speaking
is the ability to alternate one's gaze between the audience and
one's notes. Rehearsing your presentation in front of a few
friends should help you develop the ability to maintain eye
contact with your audience while referring to your notes.
When you are giving a speech that is well prepared and well
rehearsed, you will only need to look at your notes
occasionally. This is an ability that will develop even further
with practice. Your public speaking course is your best chance
to get that practice.

Effective Use of Vocalics

Vocalics, also known as paralanguage, is the subfield of
nonverbal communication that examines how we use our
voices to communicate orally. This means that you speak
loudly enough for all audience members (even those in the
back of the room) to hear you clearly, and that you enunciate
788 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

clearly enough to be understood by all audience members
(even those who may have a hearing impairment or who may
be English-language learners.) If you tend to be soft-spoken,
you will need to practice using a louder volume level that may
feel unnatural to you at first. For all speakers, good vocalic
technique is best achieved by facing the audience with your
chin up and your eyes away from your notecards and by setting
your voice at a moderate speed. Effective use of vocalics also
means that you make use of appropriate:

   Pitch
   Pauses
   Vocal Variety
   Pronunciation
   Enunciation
   Articulation
   Rate
   Volume

If you are an English-language learner/English as a second
language learner and feel apprehensive about giving a speech in
English, there are two things to remember: first, you can meet
with a reference librarian to learn the correct pronunciations
of any English words you are unsure of; and second, the fact
that you have an accent means you speak more languages than
most Americans, which is an accomplishment of which you
should be proud.

   If you are one of the many people with a stutter or other
speech challenge, you undoubtedly already know that there are
numerous techniques for reducing stuttering and improving
speech fluency and that there is no one agreed-upon "cure."
The Academy Award-winning movie The King's Speech did
much to increase public awareness of what a person with a
stutter goes through when it comes to public speaking. It also
prompted some well-known individuals who stutter, such as
television news reporter John Stossel, to go public about their
stuttering (Stossel, 2011). If you have decided to study public
speaking in spite of a speech challenge, we commend you for
your efforts and encourage you to work with your speech
instructor to make whatever adaptations work best for you.
These adaptations may require extra time for speech and
presentation preparation, simple slides that enhance your
presentation and do not overwhelm your audience, and a
microphone to help you gain additional volume in your words.

Volume

Volume refers to the loudness or softness of a speaker's voice.
As mentioned, public speakers need to speak loudly enough
to be heard by everyone in the audience. In addition, volume
is often needed to overcome ambient noise, such as the hum
of an air conditioner or the dull roar of traffic passing by the
space in which you are speaking. In addition, you can use
volume strategically to emphasize the most important points
in your speech. Select these points carefully; if you emphasize
790 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

everything, nothing will seem important. You also want to
be sure to adjust your volume to the physical setting of the
presentation. If you are in a large auditorium and your
audience is several yards away, you will need to speak louder. If
you are in a smaller space, with the audience a few feet away,
you want to avoid overwhelming your audience with shouting
or speaking too loudly.

   Remember, too, that a microphone can help with amplify
your words, but it will not bring more volume to softness in
your voice. That is related to pitch.

Pitch

Pitch refers to the highness or lowness of a speaker's voice.
Some speakers have deep voices and others have high voices.
As with one's singing voice range, the pitch of one's speaking
voice is determined to a large extent by physiology (specifically,
the length of one's vocal folds, or cords, and the size of one's
vocal tract). We all have a normal speaking pitch where our
voice is naturally settled, which is the pitch where we are most
comfortable speaking. Most professional speakers advise
speaking at the pitch that feels natural to you.

   While our voices may be generally comfortable at a specific
pitch level, we all have the ability to modulate, or move, our
pitch up or down. In fact, we do this all the time. When we
change the pitch of our voices, we are using inflections. Just
as you can use volume strategically, you can also use pitch
inflections to make your delivery more interesting and
                  13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
                                         PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION | 791

emphatic. If you ordinarily speak with a soprano voice, you
may want to drop your voice to a slightly lower range to call
attention to a particular point. How we use inflections can
even change the entire meaning of what we are saying.

   For example, try saying the sentence "I love public speaking"
or "I did not say you hurt my feelings," with a higher pitch or
stronger emphasis on one of the words, a different word, each
time you say the sentences. First raise the pitch on "I," then say
it again with the pitch raised on "love" or "did not," and so on.
"I love public speaking" conveys a different meaning from "I
love public speaking," or "I did not say you hurt my feelings" is
different from "I did not say YOU hurt my feelings." Makes a
difference, doesn't it?

   There are some speakers who don't change their pitch at all
while speaking, which is called speaking in a monotone. Have
you seen this happen when you were in the audience listening
to a speaker? Unfortunately, it is quite common. While very
few people are completely monotone, some speakers slip into
monotone patterns because of nerves or from reading their
notes. One way to ascertain whether you sound monotone is
to record your voice and see how you sound. If you notice that
your voice doesn't fluctuate very much, you will need to be
intentional in altering your pitch to ensure that the emphasis
of your speech isn't completely lost on your audience.

   Finally, resist the habit of pitching your voice "up" at the
ends of sentences or trailing off your voice at the end of your
sentences. It makes them sound like questions instead of
792 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

statements or the full meaning of what you are trying to say
gets lost on the audience because they cannot hear you. This
habit can be disorienting and distracting, interfering with the
audience's ability to focus entirely on the message. The speaker
sounds uncertain or sounds as though they are seeking the
understanding or approval of the listener. It hurts the speaker's
credibility and it needs to be avoided. The effective use of pitch
is one of the keys to an interesting delivery that will hold your
audience's attention.

Rate or Speed at Which You Speak

Rate is the speed or pace at which you are speaking. To keep
your speech delivery interesting, your rate should vary but not
so fast or not so slow that the audience gets lost in what you
are saying. If you are speaking extemporaneously, your rate
will naturally fluctuate. If you're reading a manuscript, your
delivery is less likely to vary. Because rate is an important tool
in enhancing the meanings in your speech, you do not want
to give a monotone drone or a rapid "rushed staccato-style"
delivery. Your rate should be appropriate for your topic and
your points. A rapid, lively rate can communicate such
meanings as enthusiasm or urgency. A slower, moderated rate
can convey respect, seriousness, or careful reasoning. By
varying rapid and slower rates within a single speech, you can
emphasize your main points and keep your audience
interested.

Effective Use of Pauses While Avoiding the
Uhs and Ums and Filler Words

Pauses are brief breaks in a speaker's delivery that can show
emphasis and enhance the clarity of a message. In terms of
timing, the effective use of pauses is one of the most important
skills to develop but sometimes you may find it uncomfortable
to have silence in the room during a pause. Some speakers
become uncomfortable very quickly with the pause and then
they feel the need to fill the silence with what is often called
"vocal graffiti": uhs, and ums and filler words like "like," "such
as," "you know," "all that stuff," and overuse of the word
"that," just to keep the sound going forward from you, the
speaker, and to avoid the dead air" that speakers often thing
pauses can cause. If the speaker is uncomfortable, the
discomfort can transmit itself to the audience. public speaking
is avoiding the use of verbal surrogates or "filler" words used as
placeholders for actual words. You might be able to get away
with saying "um" as many as two or three times in your speech
before it becomes distracting, but the same cannot be said of
"like," "you know" and the others listed here.

   All of this does not mean that you should avoid using
pauses. Your ability to use them confidently will increase with
practice. Some of the best comedians use the well-timed pause
to powerful and hilarious effect in their stand-up comedy
routines. Although your speech will not be a comedy routine,
pauses are still useful for emphasis, especially when combined
794 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

with a lowered pitch and rate to emphasize the important
point you do not want your audience to miss.

Vocal Variety to Keep the Audience
Engaged

Vocal variety has to do with changes in the vocalics we have
just discussed: volume, pitch, rate, and pauses. No one wants
to hear the same volume, pitch, rate, or use of pauses over and
over again in a speech. That is just boring and monotonous!
When you think about how you sound in a normal
conversation, your use of volume, pitch, rate, and pauses are all
done spontaneously. If you try to over-rehearse your vocalics,
your speech will end up sounding artificial. Vocal variety
should flow naturally from your wish to speak with expression.
In that way, it will animate your speech and invite your
listeners to understand your topic the way you do. Good vocal
variety can also help you maintain a conversational tone and
pace that keeps your audience engaged with what you have to
say.

Pronunciation and Enunciation and
Articulation

These three elements of vocalization are often confused with
one another, but, in essence, they are relatively interconnected.
Pronunciation refers to how a word is spoken, including
specific sounds and patterns. Correct pronunciation ensures
that the word is recognized and understood, as intended. This
is especially important when pronouncing the names of
cities--which may be pronounced a specific way due to
796 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

regional accents by the people who live in that area. Never
assume the pronunciation of a city or town or even the name
of a person. Always take the time to double-check the
pronunciation. the conventional patterns of speech used to
form a word.

   Word pronunciation is important for two reasons: first,
mispronouncing a word your audience is familiar with will
harm your credibility as a speaker; and second,
mispronouncing a word they are unfamiliar with can confuse
and even misinform them. If there is any possibility at all that
you don't know the correct pronunciation of a word, find
out. Check into the way words are pronounced in the local
community. Double-check by researching through a library or
online through a reputable website. College libraries have a
variety of credible sources from which you can work. Many
online dictionaries provide free sound files illustrating the
pronunciation of words.

   Enunciation is the clarity and distinctness with which
words are spoken. It is the opposite of mumbling and slurring
words and syllables.

   Finally, articulation involves the physical production of
speech sounds and how the mouth and throat produce those
sounds. Proper articulation is necessary for clear and precise
speech, impacting both pronunciation and enunciation.

   People have often commented on the mispronunciation of
words by highly-educated public speakers, including elected
officials, celebrities and even TV reporters who might be new
                  13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
                                        PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION | 797

to a certain media market. There have been speech class
examples, as well. For instance, a student giving a speech on the
Greek philosopher Socrates mispronounced his name at least
eight times during her speech. This mispronunciation created
a situation of great awkwardness and anxiety for the audience
which knew the pronunciation was incorrect. Everyone felt
embarrassed and the teacher, opting not to humiliate the
student in front of the class, could not say anything out loud,
instead providing a private written comment at the end of
class.

   Remember, never assume that you think you can figure out
the pronunciation, articulation or enunciation of words and
phrases. Always ask for clarification while you are preparing
your speech because the obvious may not be so obvious.

Effective Non Verbals and Body
Language to Enhance a Presentation

In addition to using your voice effectively, a key to effective
public speaking is physical manipulation, or the use of the
body and face to emphasize meanings or convey meanings
during a speech. While we will not attempt to give an entire
discourse on nonverbal communication, we will discuss a few
basic aspects of physical manipulation: posture, body
movement, facial expressions, and dress. These aspects add up
to the overall physical dimension of your speech, which we
call self-presentation. Studies have shown that if verbals and
798 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

nonverbals--like facial expressions and gestures--conflict, the
audience will likely believe the nonverbals versus the actual
speech content. Always practice them both in preparation for
any speech. Using nonverbals helps the audience to understand
and remember your message.

Posture

"Stand up tall! Look confident and professional!" You have
likely heard this statement from a parent or a teacher at some
point in your life. The fact is, posture is actually quite
important. When you stand up straight, you communicate to
your audience, without saying a word, that you hold a position
of power and take your position seriously. If however, you are
slouching, hunched over, or leaning on something (including
that lectern or podium) you could be perceived as ill-prepared,
anxious, lacking in credibility, or not serious about your
responsibilities as a speaker. You also show lack of respect for
your audience which has come to hear what you have to say.
While speakers often assume more casual posture as a
presentation continues (especially if it is a long one, such as
a ninety-minute class lecture), it is always wise to start by
standing up straight and putting your best foot forward.
Position yourself toward the audience. Remember, you only
get one shot at making a first impression, and your body's
orientation is one of the first pieces of information audiences
use to make that impression.
                  13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
                                        PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION | 799

Body Language and Nonverbal Emphases

Unless you are stuck behind a podium or lectern because of
the need to use a non-movable microphone, you should never
stand in one place during a speech. However, movement
during a speech should also not resemble pacing the floor.
Movement should have meaning to what you are presenting.
As speakers, we must be mindful of how we go about moving
while speaking. One common method for easily integrating
some movement into your speech is to take a few steps any
time you transition from one idea to the next. By only moving
at transition points, not only do you help focus your
audience's attention on the transition from one idea to the
next, but you also are able to increase your nonverbal
immediacy by getting closer to different segments of your
audience.

   Body movement also includes gestures. These should be
neither overdramatic nor subdued. They should be
meaningful and help to enhance the elements of your speech.
At one extreme, arm-waving and fist- pounding will distract
from your message and reduce your credibility. At the other
extreme, refraining from the use of gestures is the waste of
an opportunity to suggest emphasis, enthusiasm, or other
personal connection with your topic. Even gesturing toward
your slides as they are projected on a screen during your
presentation can be a strong nonverbal form of movement
800 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

during that helps the audience to follow along and further
understand what you are saying.

   There are many ways to use gestures. The most obvious
are hand gestures, which should be used in moderation at
carefully selected times in the speech. If you overuse gestures,
they lose meaning. Many late-night comedy parodies of
political leaders include patterned, overused gestures or other
delivery habits associated with a particular speaker. However,
the well-placed use of simple, natural gestures to indicate
emphasis, direction, size is usually effective. Normally, a
gesture with one hand is enough. Rather than trying to have a
gesture for every sentence, use just a few well-planned gestures.
It is often more effective to make a gesture and hold it for a few
moments than to begin waving your hands and arms around
in a series of gestures.

   Finally, just as you should avoid pacing aimlessly around the
room during your speech, you will also want to avoid other
distracting movements when you are speaking. Many speakers
have unconscious mannerisms such as twirling their hair,
putting their hands in and out of their pockets, jingling their
keys, licking their lips, playing with a paper clip or clicking a
pen while speaking. As with other aspects of speech delivery,
practicing in front of others will help you become conscious of
such distractions and plan ways to avoid them.

Facial Expressions as Effective NonVerbals

Faces are amazing things and convey so much information. As
                  13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
                                        PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION | 801

a speaker, you should always be acutely aware of what your face
looks like while speaking. Often the only way you can critically
evaluate what your face is doing while you are speaking is to
watch a recording of your speech. Use a smart phone to record
yourself or stand in front of a mirror and watch yourself
practice your speech. If your campus has a video studio,
schedule a time to have your presentation recorded so you can
view it to critique yourself.

   This is especially important during virtual presentations.
You are on the screen for a rather lengthy period of time, so
having an expressionless talking head of yourself in a box on
the screen can certainly cause your virtual audience to "log
out." Facial expressions are front and center in a virtual
presentation, as often the expressions are the only form of
nonverbals that accompany the content of your speech because
you rarely have the ability to use full body movements while
you are seated before the camera on your computer or laptop.

   Now, that said, be careful of two EXTREMEs to avoid no
matter the modality of your speech: no facial expression and
over-animated facial expressions. First, you do not want to
have a completely blank face while speaking, whether virtually,
as just noted here, but especially when you are standing in
front of a crowded room with an eager audience. Some people
just do not show much emotion with their faces naturally, but
this blankness is often increased when the speaker is nervous.
Audiences will react negatively to the message of such a
speaker because they will sense that something is amiss. If a
802 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

speaker is talking about the joys of a summer vacation and
the face doesn't show any excitement, the audience is going to
be turned off to the speaker and the message. On the other
extreme end is the speaker whose face looks like that of an
exaggerated cartoon character. Instead, your goal is to show a
variety of appropriate facial expressions while speaking. Relate
your expressions to the content of the speech.

   Like vocalics and gestures, facial expression can be used
strategically to enhance meaning. A smile or pleasant facial
expression is generally appropriate at the beginning of a speech
to indicate your wish for a good transaction with your
audience. However, you should not smile throughout a serious
speech topic such as a health and medical speech, a speech
on a serious community issue of an environmental problem.
An inappropriate smile creates confusion about your meaning
and may make your audience feel uncomfortable. On the other
hand, a serious scowl might look hostile or threatening to
audience members and become a distraction from the message.
If you keep the meaning of your speech foremost in your
mind, you will more readily find the balance in facial
expression.

   Another common problem some new speakers have is
showing only one expression. If you are excited in a part of
your speech, you should show excitement on your face. On the
other hand, if you are at a serious part of your speech, your
facial expressions should be serious.

804 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A

Attire as A Form of Presentation

While there are no clear-cut guidelines for how you should
dress for every speech you'll give, dress is still a very important
part of how others will perceive you (again, it's all about the
first impression). If you want to be taken seriously, you must
present yourself seriously. While you may not need to dress up
every time you give a speech, there are definitely times when
wearing a suit is appropriate.

   One general rule you can use for determining dress is the
"step-above rule," which states that you should dress one step
above your audience. If your audience is going to be dressed
casually in shorts and jeans, then wear nice casual clothing such
as a pair of neatly pressed slacks and a collared shirt or blouse.
If, however, your audience is going to be wearing "business
casual" attire, then you should probably wear a sport coat, a
dress, or a suit. The goal of the step-above rule is to establish
yourself as someone to be taken seriously. On the other hand,
if you dress two steps above your audience, you may put too
much distance between yourself and your audience, coming
across as overly formal or even arrogant.

   Another general rule for dressing is to avoid distractions
in your appearance. Overly tight or revealing garments, over-
the-top hairstyles or makeup, jangling jewelry, or a display of
tattoos and piercings can serve to draw your audience's
attention away from your speech. Remembering that your
message is the most important aspect of your speech, so keep
                  13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
                                        PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION | 805

that message in mind when you choose your clothing and
accessories. Dressing appropriately, even during a virtual
presentation, enhances your speech and gives you the charisma
and credibility that is encompassed in the "ethos" that we
noted earlier in this chapter and in this book.

Self-Presentation As A Form of
Professionalism

When you present your speech, you are also presenting
yourself. Self-presentation, sometimes also referred to as poise
or stage presence, is determined by how you look, how you
stand, how you walk to the lectern, and how you use your voice
and gestures. Your self-presentation can either enhance your
message or detract from it. Worse, a poor self-presentation can
turn a good, well- prepared speech into a forgettable waste
of time. You want your self-presentation to support your
credibility and improve the likelihood that the audience will
listen with interest.

   Your personal appearance should reflect the careful
preparation of your speech. Your personal appearance is the
first thing your audience will see, and from it, they will make
inferences about the speech you're about to present.

Variety Is the Spice of Every Speech

One of the biggest mistakes novice public speakers make is
806 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

to use the same gesture over and over again during a speech.
While you don't want your gestures to look fake, you should
be careful to include a variety of different nonverbal
components while speaking. You should make sure that your
face, body and words are all working in conjunction with each
other to support your message. Movement should always have
meaning!

Practice Effectively and Practice
Often

You might get away with presenting a hastily practiced speech
for one of your college classes, but the speech will not be as
good as it could be if you had taken the time to practice.
In order to develop your best speech delivery, you need to
practice--and use your practice time effectively. Practicing
does not mean reading over your notes, mentally running
through your speech, or even speaking your speech aloud over
and over. Instead, you need to practice with the goal of
identifying the weaknesses in your delivery, improving upon
them, and building good speech delivery habits.

   When you practice your speech, place both your feet in full,
firm contact with the floor to keep your body from swaying
side to side. Some new public speakers find that they don't
know what to do with their hands during the speech. Your
practice sessions should help you get comfortable. When
you're not gesturing, you can rest your free hand lightly on a
                  13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
                                        PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION | 807

lectern or simply allow it to hang at your side. Since this is not
a familiar posture for most people, it might feel awkward, but
in your practice sessions, you can begin getting used to it.

Seek Input from Others

Because we can't see ourselves as others see us, one of the best
ways to improve your delivery is to seek constructive criticism
from others. This, of course, is an aspect of your public
speaking course, as you will receive evaluations from your
instructor and possibly from your fellow students. However,
by practicing in front of others before it is time to present
your speech, you can anticipate and correct problems so that
you can receive a better evaluation when you give the speech
"for real." Be careful, however, that your classroom colleagues
are not just giving you positive feedback because they do not
want to be critical of your presentation. They should be honest
with you and you with them when you are evaluating their
speeches, too. Ask: what did you do well...where can you
improve...was the message lost through the use of incorrect
nonverbals that did not complement the speech content...were
the vocals strong and clear?

   If your practice observers seem reluctant to offer useful
criticisms, ask questions. How was your eye contact? Could
they hear you? Was your voice well modulated? Did you
mispronounce any words? How was your posture? Were your
gestures effective? Did you have any mannerisms that you
808 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A
PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION

should learn to avoid? Because peers are sometimes reluctant
to say things that could sound critical, direct questions are
often a useful way to help them speak up and share input.

   If you learn from these practice sessions that your voice
tends to drop at the ends of sentences, make a conscious effort
to support your voice as you conclude each main point. If you
learn that you have a habit of clicking a pen, make sure you
don't have a pen with you when you speak or that you keep
it in your pocket. If your practice observers mention that you
tend to hide your hands in the sleeves of your shirt or jacket,
next time wear short sleeves or roll your sleeves up before
beginning your speech. If you constantly put your hands in
your pockets, avoid wearing clothing with pockets. If you learn
through practice that you tend to sway or rock while you
speak, you can consciously practice and build the habit of not
swaying.

   When it is your turn to give feedback to others in your
group, assume that they are as interested in doing well as you
are. Give feedback in the spirit of helping their speeches be as
good as possible.

   Be prepared, too, for audiences to complete surveys of
speeches given at conferences or luncheons or other programs
where you may be the speaker. The feedback audiences provide
can be extremely valuable for the next time you are expected to
give a speech on the same topic.

Record Yourself

Technology has made it easier than ever to record yourself and
others using the proliferation of electronic devices people are
likely to own. Video, of course, allows you the advantage of
being able to see yourself as others see you, while audio allows
you to concentrate on the audible aspects of your delivery. As
we mentioned earlier in the chapter, if neither video nor audio
is available, you can always observe yourself by practicing your
delivery in front of a mirror.

   After you have recorded yourself, it may seem obvious that
you should watch and listen to the recording. This can be
intimidating, as you may fear that your performance anxiety
will be so obvious that everyone will notice it in the recording.
But students are often pleasantly surprised when they watch
and listen to their recordings, as even students with very high
anxiety may find out that they "come across" in a speech much
better than they expected.

   A recording can also be a very effective diagnostic device.
Sometimes students believe they are making strong contact
with their audiences, but their cards contain so many notes
that they succumb to the temptation of reading. By finding
out from the video that you misjudged your eye contact, you
can be motivated to rewrite your notecards in a way that
doesn't provide the opportunity to do so much reading.

   It is most likely that in viewing your recording, you will
810 | 13.4: HOW PRACTICE AND PREPARATION MAKE FOR A

benefit from discovering your strengths and finding weak areas
you can strengthen.

Good Delivery Is a Habit,
Well-Timed

Luckily, public speaking is an activity that, when done
conscientiously, strengthens with practice. As you become
aware of the areas where your delivery has room for
improvement, you will begin developing a keen sense of what
"works" and what audiences respond to.

   It is advisable to practice out loud in front of other people
several times, spreading your rehearsals out over several days.
To do this kind of practice, of course, you need to have your
speech finalized well ahead of the date when you are going

to give it. During these practice sessions, you must also time
your speech to make sure it lasts the appropriate length of
time. The last thing you want to do is to give a speech and be
oblivious to its length. If you are asked to speak for 10 minutes,
practice timing yourself and respect the audience--give them
10 minutes, not five minutes and certainly not 15 minutes.
Speakers who do not respect the time allotted for them to
speak are projecting a rude and callous disregard for the
audience. Guaranteed the audience will not remember the
speech content, but the audience will certainly remember a
speech that went far too long beyond the allocated time.

   Your practice sessions will also enable you to make
adjustments to your notecards to make them more effective
in supporting your contact with your audience. This kind of
practice is not just a strategy for beginners; it is practiced by
many highly-placed public figures with extensive experience in
public speaking.

   Your public speaking course is one of the best opportunities
you will have to manage your performance anxiety, build your
confidence in speaking extemporaneously, develop your vocal
skills, and become adept at self-presentation. The habits you
can develop through targeted practice are to build
continuously on your strengths and to challenge yourself to
find new areas for improving your delivery. By taking
advantage of these opportunities, you will gain the ability to
present a speech effectively whenever you may be called upon
to speak publicly.

Delivery is where your message becomes human. Throughout
this chapter, you explored the many factors that shape how an
audience experiences your ideas. From the method you choose
(impromptu, manuscript, memorized, or extemporaneous) to
the logistics of the room, your vocal tone, facial expression,
posture, and pacing, all of these have an impact on your
message getting across well. These elements may seem
technical at first, but together they form the heartbeat of your
credibility. Delivery is the space where preparation meets
presence, where your knowledge meets your character, and
where your message meets the people you hope to reach.

   Beyond the podium, delivery is an act of attention and care.
When you adjust your tone, make eye contact, choose
purposeful movement, or take a calming breath before
speaking, you are signaling to your audience that they matter.
814 | 13.5: CONCLUSION: COMMANDING THE AUDIENCE FOR
ULTIMATE UNDERSTANDING

In a world full of noise, distraction, and rushed
communication, a speaker who is intentional, who slows
down, prepares with integrity, listens to the moment, and
communicates with clarity, stands out. Delivery is not about
performing perfection. It is about showing up authentically
and respectfully in front of others.

   This chapter also showed that strong delivery requires more
than technique. It requires self-awareness. Managing anxiety,
adapting to different environments, practicing thoughtfully,
and using humor appropriately are all habits that help you
stay grounded and present. These habits also serve you outside
public speaking, whether you're interviewing, leading a
meeting, advocating for a cause, or participating in civic
dialogue. Delivery, in this sense, becomes a lifelong
communication skill, not just an academic exercise.

            Key Takeaways

           There are four primary methods of
             delivery--impromptu, manuscript, memorized,
             and extemporaneous--each suited to
             different speaking situations.

           Effective delivery balances preparation with
             presence, creating a conversational but
             structured experience for listeners.

           Logistics such as room setup, lighting, pacing,
             and vocal variety significantly influence how
             audiences understand and remember a
             message.

           Managing speaking anxiety requires
             intentional preparation, realistic mindset
             strategies, and steady practice.

           Humor, when used thoughtfully and
             appropriately, can strengthen rapport and
             support message clarity.

           Strong delivery relies on vocalics, eye contact,
             posture, gestures, and facial expressions that
             reinforce--not distract from--your message.

           Practicing delivery is an ethical responsibility
             to your audience and a key factor in
             professional credibility.

Learning Objectives

 1. Define presentation aids.
 2. Explain the role of presentation aids in helping a speaker

      communicate more effectively.
 3. Identify ways presentation aids can help an audience

      understand and remember key ideas.
 4. Describe how audience-centered communication

      involves accessibility considerations.

It may seem strange to begin a chapter about presentation aids
by talking about something that is not, in fact, a presentation
aid. However, by doing so, we hope to make clear not only
what presentation aids really are but also why they can be so
useful to speakers and audiences alike.

What Are Presentation Aids?

Imagine that you are preparing to speak at your
820 | 14.0: THE ROLE OF PRESENTATION AIDS

commencement. First, congratulations on your graduation!
You have been informed that you will be assigned a certified
American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter for your speech
at the event. Sign language interpreters use their hands and
facial expressions to translate the meaning and intent, words
and tone of voice into visual-manual language. Interpreters
certified by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf abide by
a Code of Professional Conduct that emphasizes skill, respect,
and ethics. Specifically, ASL interpreters are expected to
"render the message faithfully by conveying the content and
spirit of what is being communicated, using language most
readily understood by consumers, and correcting errors
discreetly and expeditiously" (Registry of Interpreters for the
Deaf, 2005). The interpreter's responsibility here is twofold: to
translate your spoken message into a different communication
mode for the audience and to ensure that the message is
perceived as clearly and accurately as you intended it. While
the interpreter plays a vital communicative role, their work is
not a presentation aid. Rather than supporting your message
directly as part of your rhetorical strategy, the interpreter
mediates (conveys between parties) your message to ensure
access for audience members who would not otherwise be able
to perceive it.

   Our non-presentation aid scenario above offers us two key
insights into how we should think about actual presentation
aids. First, effective communication is audience-centered. For
communication to succeed, an audience needs to perceive it. A
                              14.0: THE ROLE OF PRESENTATION AIDS | 821

spoken message reaches those who can hear it; a signed message
reaches those who can see it. Neither form is more or less valid,
but each must be matched to the perceptual abilities of the
audience to succeed. Second, communication is multimodal.
The interpreter's presence demonstrates that a single message
can be communicated through more than one form of
meaning--spoken words or signed language, sound or gesture.
Meaning can actually be constructed in many forms: speech,
sound, body, object, image, text, and even space (Kalantzis &
Cope, 2025). Every speech already involves multiple modes.
Audiences hear us, see us, and often take in more than we
realize. Presentation aids allow us to build on that inherent
multimodality by intentionally adding to or enhancing how
meaning is communicated.

   These insights now help us define what presentation aids
actually are. Presentation aids are speaker-directed
materials that support how an audience perceives and
makes sense of a message. Presentation aids are not mere
decorations or filler, nor are they simply tools to assist the
speaker or translate a message, as we saw in our interpreter
scenario. Instead, they are communication strategies that a
speaker intentionally uses to help audiences see, hear, or grasp
a message more clearly.

   With our definition in mind, let's turn to what that means
for you as a speaker. We'll next examine how audiences receive
messages across different sensory channels, what makes that
822 | 14.0: THE ROLE OF PRESENTATION AIDS

perception possible, and why presentation aids are a matter of
both rhetorical strategy and responsibility.

Why Use Presentation Aids?

When we think about public speaking, it's easy to focus only
on what we're going to say. Without words, of course, there
is no speech to begin with. But communication isn't merely
about what we say; it's also about what audiences receive.
While an audience listens to our voice, they're also taking in
other sensory information: what they see, how they feel, where
they are, and what's happening around them. As these sensory
inputs come in, the brain begins sorting them. Some
information is filtered out, and other signals move on for
further processing. Different types of input engage different
regions of the brain, so when speakers use images or movement
in addition to words, they activate multiple processing
pathways in their listeners at once. Engaging more
channels--visual, auditory, spatial--gives an audience more
than one way to receive and process your message.

   Now that we've explored how audiences take in
information, let's consider how you can apply that knowledge
through the use of presentation aids. Presentation aids help
you intentionally create a multisensory experience. When used
alongside your spoken words, they can reinforce key points,
clarify complex ideas, and reduce cognitive load, which is the
mental effort it takes for your audience to absorb and organize
                             14.0: THE ROLE OF PRESENTATION AIDS | 823

new information. Aids can also help audiences follow the flow
of your ideas by highlighting structure or showing a clear
sequence. In some cases, a multisensory experience can also
support an emotional connection, especially when the content
is designed to connect with an audience's values or experiences.

   A multisensory experience is especially powerful when you
pair visual elements with spoken explanation, a process known
as dual-channel processing. According to the Cognitive
Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 2009), people learn
better when information is presented in both visual and
auditory channels. This theory was developed in the context of
classroom learning, but it applies directly to public speaking.
Whatever your rhetorical purpose, your goal is to help your
audience understand and remember what you're saying.
Combining words with visuals gives the audience more than
one path to understanding. Aids like graphs, images, objects,
or simple diagrams can also make your content more
memorable and help sustain attention. In short, well-chosen
presentation aids are purposeful strategies for strengthening
communication. Table 14.1 below summarizes what
presentation aids do and how they can help an audience.

Audience-Centered
Communication

Audience-centered communication means planning your
message with your listeners' needs, abilities, and perspectives
in mind. It's not just about expressing ideas; it's about making
sure an audience can receive them. Different people experience
presentations in different ways. Some may have difficulty
hearing what you are saying. Others may have difficulty seeing
your slides remotely on a small screen. Because differences such
as these can affect how the message is perceived, audience-
centered speakers make intentional choices to communicate
clearly to as many people as possible. When it comes to
826 | 14.0: THE ROLE OF PRESENTATION AIDS

presentation aids, that means selecting formats, visuals, and
delivery methods that help everyone access and understand the
presentation.

   Making content--and the ideas behind it--available to
different kinds of audiences is central to the goal of
accessibility. When something is accessible, it can be used by
people with a wide range of abilities. In digital
communication, accessibility is guided by recommendations
developed by the World-Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an
international organization that promotes web usability for all
people. W3C publishes the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG, pronounced "wuh-cag"), which help
make online content more accessible. The W3C's Web
Accessibility Initiative (WAI) maintains these guidelines and
offers regularly updated resources on accessibility principles
and practices (W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, 2025).
WCAG guidelines are organized around four principles for
digital media, often remembered by the acronym POUR:
Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. In simple
terms, POUR means materials should be presented in ways
people can see or hear, navigate using different tools,
understand clearly, and access across devices or platforms.

When chosen with care, presentation aids reinforce key ideas,

clarify complex points, and help audiences stay focused and

engaged. But when presentation aids aren't planned with the

audience in mind, they can get in the way of understanding or

make it harder for people to engage with the message. It is our

responsibility as speakers to use presentation aids that support

rather than compete with our speech content.

When we think beyond the podium, we begin to see

communication as more than what is said out loud. It's the

slides we show, the visuals we create, the materials we share,

and the choices we make to help others engage with our

message. Presentation aids extend our reach across senses,

across formats, and sometimes beyond the moment of the

speech itself. Planning them with purpose is part of being a

thoughtful, audience-aware communicator.

Learning Objectives

 1. Explain how presentation aids can be categorized based
      on sensory perception.

 2. Identify the primary characteristics of visual, auditory,
      tactile, and multisensory presentation aids commonly
      used in classroom settings.

 3. Distinguish between presentation aids that engage a
      single sense and those that engage multiple senses.

 4. Describe how a single presentation aid might function
      differently depending on how it's used.

We've discussed what presentation aids are and why they
matter, and we have seen that communication can take many
forms and engage multiple senses. Now, we take a closer look
at how audiences perceive presentation aids by grouping them
according to sensory experience and considering examples of
each. We'll also examine multisensory aids, which leverage two
832 | 14.1: TYPES AND EXAMPLES OF PRESENTATION AIDS

or more sensory pathways in a single format. This framework
gives us a way to identify and talk about presentation aids
based on how they're perceived and experienced by the
audience.

Visual Presentation Aids

Visual presentation aids are materials that communicate
information through what an audience can see. They support
a message by presenting content in a visual format such as
images, text, symbols, and the spatial relationships among
those visual elements. Visual presentation aids help an
audience see key information clearly and in context during
a speech. They are often created as digital materials that are
projected on screens or shared online, but they can also appear
in printed formats such as posters, handouts, or drawings.
Some are static, like photographs or charts; others may be
dynamic, such as slides with timed animations or
demonstrations.

   For example, a speaker might use a graph to show changes
in economic data over time or a map to highlight regional
differences in access to clean water. A photograph of
volunteers distributing supplies after a hurricane can add
emotional or historical depth, while a timeline that traces
milestones in vaccine development clarifies sequence. A
diagram of bicycle components or the stages of the digestive
process can illustrate how parts of a system interact, and a
           14.1: TYPES AND EXAMPLES OF PRESENTATION AIDS | 833

slide deck with keyword text and images keeps main points
visible. A screen demonstration can walk the audience through
a scheduling application step by step.

Auditory Presentation Aids

Auditory presentation aids are materials that communicate
information through what an audience can hear. These aids
support a message by adding or emphasizing sound-based
content beyond the speaker's own voice. They may include
music, recorded speech, sound effects, or environmental audio
(background sounds that represent a particular place, setting,
or activity). Auditory aids can be played as recordings through
speakers, embedded into other digital media, or even created
live by the speaker. Auditory aids are experienced through
sound, which unfolds over time. Unlike visual aids, which can
often be seen as a whole at a glance, auditory materials are
heard moment by moment.

   In addition to the spoken words of their speech, speakers
may use auditory presentation aids to intentionally support
their message. A short audio clip from a historical speech could
connect to a topic on civic life. A music excerpt might support
a talk on hip hop's global reach. A portion of a recorded
interview could bring an expert's voice into a presentation
about space exploration. In a presentation about digital
culture, a sound effect like a phone notification might help
illustrate a point about attention. A speaker might even create
a sound, such as tapping a pencil on the podium to
demonstrate a common classroom distraction.

Tactile Presentation Aids

Tactile presentation aids are materials that communicate
information through what an audience can physically touch
or manipulate. These aids support a message by allowing the
audience to experience texture, shape, or structure directly.
Tactile aids may include everyday objects as well as materials
designed specifically for touch-based interaction such as
models, textured graphics, or items that can be assembled or
manipulated. Tactile aids may be passed around during a
speech, distributed for individual use, or involve the audience
engaging with objects or sensations already within reach such
as the texture of their clothing.

   For example, a 3D model of a molecule can help explain
structure in a chemistry presentation. A fabric sample, like a
838 | 14.1: TYPES AND EXAMPLES OF PRESENTATION AIDS

swatch of recycled material, might be used to support a talk
about sustainable fashion. A raised-relief map can
communicate topography in a speech about hiking the
Appalachian Trail. A puzzle that can be assembled during the
presentation might help illustrate a process or sequence. A
speaker might also invite the audience to engage with
something already available to them, such as tracing the veins
on their own hands during a speech about human anatomy.

Other Sensory Presentation Aids

While most presentation aids rely on what an audience sees,
hears, or touches, other sensory experiences may support
communication in certain settings and for some topics. These
include aids that engage smell, taste, or body movement.
Olfactory aids use scent to connect with memory, emotion,
or the environment, such as the smell of a particular spice
in a speech about cultural cooking traditions. Gustatory aids
involve taste, such as offering a food sample during a talk about
regional cuisine. Kinesthetic aids ask the audience to move in
some way, such as standing, mirroring a gesture, or tracing a
pattern in space during a presentation on posture or physical
awareness. These aids may not be practical or permitted in all
speaking settings. Though less common, these types of aids
serve as reminders that communication can engage many
senses.

Multisensory Presentation Aids

     Beyond the     Multisensory presentation aids
Podium Insight   are materials that engage more
                 than one sense at the same time.
                 These aids combine elements
                 from different sensory categories
                 such as sight and sound or touch
                 and movement into a single

Even a slide deck with carefully timed animations and
842 | 14.1: TYPES AND EXAMPLES OF PRESENTATION AIDS

synchronized voice-over can function as a multisensory aid
when it supports more than one sensory channel at once.

Sense Perception in Practice

In this section, we explored presentation aids based on how
audiences perceive them. While these categories are useful for
understanding the different ways presentation aids can
support communication, they aren't fixed. The same object
might serve more than one purpose depending on how it's
used. A baseball glove, for example, might function as a visual
aid when held up for the audience to see, a tactile aid if passed
around for them to feel, an auditory aid when it is snapped
closed for emphasis or effect, and even an olfactory aid if the
audience is invited to smell the leather.

   This flexibility reminds us that perception is shaped not just
by the aid itself but by how it is designed into the speech.
Presentation aids are not limited to a predefined list. They
can and should reflect your creativity, your purpose, and the
experience you want your audience to have. Thinking of
presentation aids as part of an audience experience rather than
simply materials to show can lead to more intentional and
engaging choices. The same visual or object might have a
different impact depending on how and when it's introduced.

   A well-chosen aid can spark curiosity, invite reflection, or
create a moment that sticks with your listeners long after the
speech ends. Some aids may even be accessed after the
           14.1: TYPES AND EXAMPLES OF PRESENTATION AIDS | 843

presentation, such as in a recording or handout, which extends
the reach and impact of your message. What the audience
perceives is shaped not only by the content of the aid, but also
by how that content is framed, timed, and integrated into your
message. Not every message requires a presentation aid, but
when used with purpose, they become part of how the speech
is experienced and remembered.

   Now that we have a framework for identifying and
describing presentation aids based on sensory experience, we're
ready to take the next step: deciding when, how, and why to
use them. In the next section, we'll look at how to choose
and plan presentation aids that support your message, your
audience, and your goals as a speaker.

14.2: PLANNING AND
CHOOSING
PRESENTATION AIDS

   Lee Ann Dickerson

Learning Objectives

 1. Apply the PACT framework (Purpose, Audience,
      Context, and Tools) to guide decisions about whether
      and how to use a presentation aid.

 2. Integrate AI-generated presentation aids effectively to
      enhance audience understanding.

Not every speech or every moment within a speech benefits
from a presentation aid. Effective speakers make strategic
decisions based on a combination of factors. Here, we examine
four key considerations to guide your planning: Purpose,
Audience, Context, and Tools. Together, these form a
PACT--a framework for making thoughtful, audience-
centered choices about whether and how to use an aid. These
elements are not steps in a fixed sequence. Instead, they are
interdependent aspects of a single decision-making process
that helps you choose aids that serve your rhetorical goals.
846 | 14.2: PLANNING AND CHOOSING PRESENTATION AIDS

Purpose

Presentation aids are most effective when they serve a clear
purpose that emerges directly from your message. What are
you trying to accomplish with your speech? If your message
would be clearer, more memorable, or more engaging with
support from a perceptual channel beyond your spoken words
(e.g., auditory or visual), then a presentation aid may be
helpful.

       When planning, ask yourself: What do I want
       this aid to help my audience do that my words
       alone might not?

Section 14.1 introduced seven core functions that presentation
aids can serve. These functions reflect the rhetorical goals
speakers often have at key moments in a speech. In Table 14.2
below, we revisit those goals with examples to help you reflect
on whether an aid could support your content. These
examples aren't rules; they're possibilities. Identifying your
purpose can help you determine whether an aid adds real value
to your message.

These goals often overlap. A single presentation aid might
support memory while also clarifying a complex idea or
helping sustain attention. What matters most at this stage is
identifying your intent. Be intentional. The aid should serve
a clear purpose in helping your audience engage with and
understand your message.
848 | 14.2: PLANNING AND CHOOSING PRESENTATION AIDS

Audience

A presentation aid works only if an audience can perceive and
make sense of it. Your audience analysis has already helped
you think about who your listeners are and what they might
need. Now, apply that thinking to perception. A presentation
aid that works well for one audience may not be perceivable
in the same way by another. Audience members differ in how
they see, hear, think, and process information. Some may have
limited vision or hearing. Others may experience information
differently because of cognitive differences.

   The goal isn't to predict every individual need, but to plan
with awareness and flexibility. Accessibility doesn't require
that every audience member has the same experience.
Accessibility means making meaning available in more than
one way. If some audience members may not be able to see
or hear a particular aid clearly, consider whether it can be
supported through more than one sensory channel. There's
no single solution, just thoughtful choices that match your
audience's needs.

       When planning, ask yourself: Will my audience
       be able to perceive and interpret this aid in the
       way I intend?
         14.2: PLANNING AND CHOOSING PRESENTATION AIDS | 849

Perception, however, is only part of the picture. Audiences
don't simply receive meaning--they interpret it. What makes
sense to you might be unfamiliar, confusing, or even alienating
to someone else. A joke, reference, image, or metaphor may
carry different meanings for different people depending on
a person's background, values, knowledge, or expectations.
Every aid carries assumptions. The more aware you are of those
assumptions, the more intentional your choices can be.

   Intentional planning doesn't mean you can anticipate
everything, but it does mean thinking beyond your own
perspective. Effective speakers choose presentation aids that
avoid overlooking relevant perspectives and consider what
their audience is likely to know or expect. Presentation aids
offer opportunities to connect, clarify, and engage, but only if
they're designed with the audience in mind.

Context

Even the most purposeful and audience-aware presentation aid
won't be effective if it doesn't work within the conditions of
your speaking environment. Context includes the space, time,
technology, and constraints that surround your delivery. These
may be physical, virtual, or a combination of both. These
factors shape what kinds of aids will be practical, perceivable,
and effective in the moment of your speech.

   Delivery settings vary. In a live room, the size of the space,
the seating arrangement of the audience, and the availability
850 | 14.2: PLANNING AND CHOOSING PRESENTATION AIDS

of equipment may affect whether your visuals can be seen or
your audio heard. In a virtual setting, device differences and
connectivity issues may limit access to media. Hybrid settings,
in which some people are present and others are joining
remotely, may introduce additional challenges, especially if not
all audience members can engage with the aid in the same way.
If your aid depends on technology (e.g., a sound clip, video, or
interactive element), consider whether it will work smoothly in
real time and whether it's accessible to everyone present.

       When planning, ask yourself: Will this aid work
       in the space I'm speaking in, under real-time
       conditions, without distracting from my
       message?

Timing is part of your context, too. If your speech is short,
consider whether you have time to present the aid clearly,
explain its relevance, and return to your message without
disrupting the flow. Some aids may require transitions, setup,
or explanation that pull attention away from your central idea.
In those cases, it may be worth simplifying the format or
integrating the content in a different way. Aids should support
your delivery and not slow it down.
          14.2: PLANNING AND CHOOSING PRESENTATION AIDS | 851

access later, such as linked documents or recordings. Whatever
the format, your choice of tools should be guided by what
makes your message perceivable, understandable, and usable
for your audience.

   AI tools can support your planning process by helping you
explore, generate, and refine presentation aid options. For
example, you might use them to draft visual examples,
summarize complex text for a slide, or experiment with layout
and sequencing. These tools can help you make early creative
decisions, test possibilities, and prototype materials more
efficiently. However, using AI effectively still requires
judgment.

       When planning, ask yourself: Which tools will
       help me create and deliver this aid clearly,
       effectively, and responsibly?

Like any presentation aid, AI-generated content should be
evaluated through the PACT framework. Its usefulness
depends on how well it serves your purpose and your audience,
as well as how well it fits the conditions of your speaking
context and functions reliably with your chosen tools. AI can
streamline your design process, but it doesn't replace the need
for thoughtful, audience-centered decision-making. You are
         14.2: PLANNING AND CHOOSING PRESENTATION AIDS | 853

responsible for ensuring that any AI-assisted content is
accurate, relevant, accessible, and aligned with your message.

Presentation Aid Planning
Protocol

Deciding whether and how to use an aid requires thoughtful
planning. The following planning protocol is built around the
four elements of your PACT: Purpose, Audience, Context,
and Tools. These elements reflect the understanding that using
a presentation aid is more than a deign choice. It's a kind of
pact between you and your audience. By thinking carefully
about what you want to communicate, who you're speaking
to, where the speech is taking place, and how your tools
function, you can make informed decisions that support your
message.

When your decisions are grounded in purpose, responsive to
your audience, suited to your context, and supported by the
right tools, a presentation aid can elevate the impact of your
message. If you plan to share your presentation materials in
digital form, such as sharing slides or posting a recording, you
may need to also meet accessibility standards. As noted in
Section 14.1, guidelines like WCAG apply to digital content
and help ensure it can be used by a wide range of audiences.
In the next section, we'll look more closely at what those
standards involve and how to apply them when creating digital
presentation aids for distribution.

Learning Objectives

 1. Design presentation aids that are clear and easy for your
      audience to understand.

 2. Use presentation aids smoothly during your speech.
 3. Make your presentation aids accessible to different

      audiences.
 4. Acknowledge the sources of any images, media, or AI-

      generated content used in your presentation aids.

You've determined that a presentation aid will enhance your
speech. Now it's time to make that aid work--for your
message, your audience, and your delivery context. Here, we
consider practical strategies to help you move from planning
to execution. You'll learn how to design presentation aids that
support comprehension, deliver them smoothly in real time,
and prepare them for distribution in ways that meet
accessibility expectations.
858 | 14.3: DESIGNING AND DELIVERING PRESENTATION AIDS

Designing for Clarity and
Comprehension

Designing a presentation aid is both a creative task and a
continuation of your rhetorical strategy. Now that you've
identified what kind of aid will support your message, the
next step is to make intentional design choices that help your
audience process and understand the material. Whether you're
working with slides, handouts, or visuals, your design should
guide attention, reduce unnecessary effort, and clarify meaning
in the moment of the speech.

   Table 14.3 identifies common design strategies and pairs
each one with reflective questions to help you evaluate
whether your aid is focused, accessible, and easy to understand.
Use these questions as part of your design process to ensure
that your aid supports and doesn't compete with your
message.

Delivering Aids in Real Time

Presentation aids used during a live speech are experienced
synchronously--they're seen, heard, or interacted with at the
same time the speaker is delivering the message. These
synchronous aids are part of the live communication moment.
Whether you're showing a slide, playing a sound clip, or
holding up a physical object, the way you introduce and use
the aid matters just as much as how it was designed.

   Your goal is to make the aid feel like an integrated part of
your message, not an interruption. To do that, you need to
plan how the aid will appear, how you'll reference it, and how
you'll transition smoothly back into your speech.

   Table 14.4 below outlines key strategies for using
presentation aids during a live speech, along with reflective
questions to guide your preparation and rehearsal.

issues.

Synchronous delivery also depends on your presence as a
speaker. The way you gesture, pause, or shift your tone can
help guide your audience's attention toward the aid and back
to your words. Practicing with the aid is essential--not just the
timing, but the physical interaction. Test every movement, cue,
or device so you will be confident when it counts.
862 | 14.3: DESIGNING AND DELIVERING PRESENTATION AIDS

   In the moment of the speech, your aids should feel like
an extension of your message. Used well, they can enhance
attention, support understanding, and help your audience
follow along without ever stealing the spotlight from the ideas
you have to share.

Preparing Aids for Distribution

Some presentation aids are designed not just to support a live
speech, but to be shared--before, during, or after the speech
itself. These distributed aids may take the form of slide decks,
handouts, infographics, short videos, or linked documents.
They may be posted to a course site, displayed on-screen
during a presentation, or submitted for review. What they have
in common is that they're made available for others to access
on their own.

   Distribution changes how the aid functions. Even if the
material was originally created for use during a live speech, it
takes on a different role once it's distributed. The audience
may view it before the speech, revisit it afterward, or encounter
it without your voice or gestures to guide them. In these cases,
the aid needs to be clear enough to be understood
independently, even if it wasn't designed to stand alone.

   That doesn't mean a distributed presentation aid has to
repeat everything you said or become a full substitute for the
speech itself. But it does mean considering how well your
materials communicate when they're separated from the
       14.3: DESIGNING AND DELIVERING PRESENTATION AIDS | 863

moment of delivery. Could someone looking at your handout
or slides later recall your key points? Could they follow the
meaning of a chart without your voice explaining it?

   Distribution of digital presentation aids introduces new
technical considerations. Digital materials may be accessed on
different devices, by people with different perceptual needs,
or in different environments. A slide that worked well in the
room may not read clearly on a small screen. A video played
aloud in class may not be audible when posted online. These
shifts affect not just visibility or format. They affect whether
your message is accessible to all.

   When materials are shared in digital form, they also carry
added responsibilities. Next, we'll look at how to prepare
digital aids in ways that meet accessibility expectations and
support a wide range of users.

Designing for Digital Accessibility

When you share a presentation aid in digital form, whether it's
a slide deck, infographic, handout, or video, you're extending
your message beyond the live moment. That means your aid
has to work on its own. It also means it has to be usable by
a wide range of audiences, including those who may navigate
it with limited bandwidth or experience it read aloud or
converted to braille by screen readers, which are assistive tools
used by people with visual impairments to access digital
content.

       14.3: DESIGNING AND DELIVERING PRESENTATION AIDS | 865

   When you distribute a static aid, you're asking your
audience to engage with it on their own. If that aid is
distributed digitally, it needs to be clear, well-organized, and
usable for people who may be reading it on different devices or
using assistive technologies like screen readers. You don't need
to apply every accessibility feature or tool, but you do need to
think intentionally about how your design choices affect access
and understanding.

   When working with text:

   Keep things in a clear order. Place titles and content
      in a top-to-bottom layout that's easy to follow. In
      PowerPoint, you can check the reading order using the
      accessibility checker. In Google Slides, reading order
      follows the order you added things, so build slides in a
      logical sequence.

   Use clear, descriptive headings. Give each slide or
      section a unique title that tells the audience what it's
      about. For example, instead of just "Slide 3" or
      "Conclusion," give a slide a meaningful title like
      "Recycling Trends by Dorm."

   Choose easy-to-read text. Use a plain font (like Arial
      or Calibri) that's big enough to read on a screen. Avoid
      decorative fonts or light-colored text on a light
      background.

   Don't use color alone to show meaning. If you're
      using color to highlight or group elements, also use
866 | 14.3: DESIGNING AND DELIVERING PRESENTATION AIDS

      labels, patterns, or symbols so the meaning is still clear
      for people who can't see color differences.

Accessibility for visual content such as photos, diagrams,
illustrations, and charts begins with description. Alternative
text (alt text) is a brief written description of what an image
shows and why it matters. It's not a visible caption--it's read
by screen readers to describe the image to people who can't see
it. Most tools, like PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Word, let
you add alt text by right-clicking on the image and selecting
"Alt Text."

   If an image adds meaning, describe what it shows and what
the audience should take from it. For example, instead of
writing "a pie chart," you might write, "Pie chart showing
45% of waste is food-related," which tells the audience both
what's in the image and why it matters. If the image is purely
decorative and doesn't contribute meaning, you can mark it as
decorative so screen readers skip it.

   Some visuals such as detailed graphs, infographics, or
diagrams need more than a single sentence. In those cases,
write a long description in a slide note, caption, or
accompanying document. Your alt text can say something like:
"Line graph showing recycling rates for Dorms A, B, and C.
Long description provided." Then provide a summary of the
key information someone would need to interpret the visual:
"Dorm A's rate increases steadily from 2019 to 2023. Dorm B
       14.3: DESIGNING AND DELIVERING PRESENTATION AIDS | 867

peaks in 2021, then declines. Dorm C remains flat. All three
start below 25% and end above 40%."

   You don't need to describe every color or data point in a
visual, just what contributes meaning. If the image is already
explained in your speech or surrounding text, your alt text can
say: "Image described in text."

   These small changes go a long way toward making your
static aids usable in more contexts and for more people. They
also encourage you to think more clearly about what the image
is meant to show--clarity that benefits all of your audience.

presentations, but without effective alt text, important
information is lost to some audiences. In this activity, you'll
practice matching images to the most accurate alt text to see
how accessibility strengthens communication.

Wrap Up: Clear, concise alt text ensures that all viewers can
870 | 14.3: DESIGNING AND DELIVERING PRESENTATION AIDS

engage with your content, regardless of ability. By making
static media accessible, you not only follow best
practices--you also create presentations that are inclusive and
meaningful for every audience member.

Accessible Time-Based Media

Time-based media includes content that unfolds over time,
such as audio, video, or a combination of both. If you use
a podcast clip, record your own speech, or embed a video in
your slides or online materials, you're working with time-based
media. These formats present unique challenges because they
may rely on sound, visuals, or both, and if someone can't hear
or see part of the message, they need another way to access that
content.

   That's where accessibility practices come in. By providing
a text-based alternative, you make the information available
to more people, including those who are hearing or visually
impaired or who are accessing your content in an environment
not conducive to seeing or hearing.

   The type of alternative depends on the kind of media:

   Audio-only (like a podcast or recorded narration):
      Provide a transcript, which is a written version of all
      spoken words and important sounds for audiences who
      cannot hear it.

   Video-only (like a silent animation or visual
       14.3: DESIGNING AND DELIVERING PRESENTATION AIDS | 871

      demonstration): Provide a descriptive transcript that
      explains what's happening on screen for audiences who
      cannot see it.
   Video with audio (like a recorded speech): Use
      captions and, if needed, a descriptive transcript to cover
      both the spoken content and any visual elements that
      carry meaning for audiences who cannot see or hear it.

Captions are synchronized text that appears on screen during
a video, showing what's being said as it's said. They also
include speaker names when needed for clarification and non-
speech sounds that matter for understanding--like [applause],
[laughter], or [music playing]. Many platforms offer automatic
captions, but those often need editing for accuracy and usually
include only spoken words, missing important context like
sound cues or speaker clarification. For classroom or
assignment use, it's fine to start with auto-captions and review
and revise them as needed.

   Transcripts are separate text documents that include the
full spoken content of an audio or video file. A transcript of an
audio clip should include speaker names, all spoken content,
and any important sounds that contribute to meaning. For
video with audio, a descriptive transcript adds another layer of
detail by describing what is shown visually, especially if those
visuals aren't explained in speech.

   Table 14.5, below, shows a simple format for a descriptive
transcript of a student speech:
872 | 14.3: DESIGNING AND DELIVERING PRESENTATION AIDS

"This orange slice is food    The orange segment of the pie chart is
waste."                       highlighted.

Audio description is a separate audio track that narrates the
visual elements of a video for people who are blind or have
low vision. It's required for full accessibility under WCAG
guidelines when key content is conveyed visually but not
described in speech. (For an interactive list of sample audio
descriptions, visit Samples of Audio Description from the
Audio Description Project from the American Council of the
Blind.) Most student projects don't require a separate audio
description track--especially if visuals are already explained
during the speech or included in a transcript. But it's helpful
to know that this option exists, especially if you're preparing
materials for a broader public audience or contributing to
university-level digital content.

   When sharing time-based media digitally, include captions
for spoken content and a descriptive transcript if important
visuals aren't explained in the speech. Making time-based
media accessible may take a few extra steps, but it's part of
communicating with care. It shows that you've thought about
how your audience will experience your message--and it
makes your work stronger, clearer, and more inclusive.

Using Presentation Aids
Responsibly

Designing and delivering a presentation aid is more than a

technical task. It's part of how you communicate with your

audience--and that comes with responsibilities. A well-

designed slide or video can clarify your message, but if it's

confusing, inaccurate, inaccessible, or used without proper

credit, it can also undermine your credibility.

Applying What You've Learned

Your next speech is a chance to apply what you've learned.
Whether you're using slides, a handout, an object, or a short
video, your presentation aid should help your audience see and
understand your message more clearly.

to be perfect. But you do need to be intentional. A thoughtful
presentation aid can sharpen your ideas, connect with your
audience, and bring your message to life. This chapter has
given you strategies. Now it's your turn to use them well.
876 | 14.4: CONCLUSION: PRESENTATION AIDS

14.4: CONCLUSION:
PRESENTATION AIDS

   Lee Ann Dickerson

Presentation aids are powerful tools, but only when they serve
the audience and the message. They should never distract,
overwhelm, or substitute for your ideas. Instead, they help
create clarity, reduce cognitive effort, sustain attention, and
make ideas memorable. Thoughtful use of presentation aids
reflects your awareness of audience diversity, accessibility
needs, and the multimodal ways people make meaning.

   Beyond the podium, this chapter reminds us that
communication happens through many channels. The images,
sounds, and materials we choose speak alongside our words,
and they sometimes carry a message long after the speech ends.
Effective presentation aids show respect for the audience,
responsibility in design, and creativity in delivery.

   In the next chapter, we shift from designing aids that support
your message to the challenge of designing the message itself.
Chapter 16: Informative Speaking explores how to build
clarity, structure, and depth into your speeches so audiences
don't just see and hear your ideas but leave truly understanding
them.
                14.4: CONCLUSION: PRESENTATION AIDS | 877

Key Takeaways

 Presentation aids are purposeful
   communication strategies that help audiences
   see, hear, or grasp ideas more clearly.

 Effective aids are multimodal and audience-
   centered, engaging multiple senses to
   reinforce memory, clarify complex ideas, and
   sustain attention.

 Accessibility is central: presentation aids must
   be perceivable, usable, and meaningful for
   diverse audiences across live, virtual, and
   distributed contexts.

 Planning aids with the PACT
   framework--Purpose, Audience, Context, and
   Tools--ensures they serve rhetorical goals
   rather than distract from them.

 Responsible use means designing with clarity,
   integrating aids smoothly in delivery, and
   giving credit to sources, including AI-assisted
   materials.

 Thoughtfully chosen and designed
   presentation aids extend communication
   beyond the podium, allowing messages to
   resonate across formats, moments, and
878 | 14.4: CONCLUSION: PRESENTATION AIDS

             audiences.

SPEAKING GOALS

   Brooke Lyle

Learning Objectives

 1. Explain the importance of accuracy, clarity, and listener
      interest in informative speaking.

 2. Discuss why speaking to inform is important. Identify
      strategies for making information clear and interesting
      to your speaking audience.

A good informative speech conveys accurate information to
the audience in a way that is clear and that keeps the listener
interested in the topic. Achieving all three of these
goals--accuracy, clarity, and interest--is the key to your
effectiveness as a speaker. If information is inaccurate,
incomplete, or unclear; it will be of limited usefulness to the
audience. There is no topic about which you can give complete
information, and therefore, we strongly recommend careful
narrowing. With a carefully narrowed topic and purpose, it is
possible to give an accurate picture that isn't misleading.

Part of being accurate is making sure that your information

is current. Even if you know a great deal about your topic

or wrote a good paper on the topic in a high school course,

you need to verify the accuracy and completeness of what you

know. Most people understand that technology changes

rapidly, so you need to update your information almost

constantly, but the same is true for topics that, on the surface,

may seem to require less updating. For example, the American

Civil War occurred over 150 years ago, but contemporary

research still offers new and emerging theories about the causes

of the war and its long-term effects. So even with a topic that

seems to be unchanging, you need to carefully check your

information to make sure it's accurate and up to date.

Why We Speak to Inform

Informative speaking is a means for the delivery of knowledge.
In informative speaking, we avoid expressing opinions.
888 | 15.1 INFORMATIVE SPEAKING GOALS

   This doesn't mean you may not speak about controversial
topics. However, if you do so, you must deliver a fair statement
of each side of the issue. If your speech is about standardized
educational testing, you must honestly represent the views
both of its proponents and of its critics. You must not take
sides, and you must not slant your explanation of the
information in order to influence the opinions of the listeners.
Informative speaking is an important part of persuasive
speaking but making sure to not cross the line into persuasive
speaking is imperative for your audience members. You are
simply and clearly defining the information. If you watch the
evening news on a major network television (ABC, CBS, or
NBC), you will see newscasters who undoubtedly have
personal opinions about the news but are trained to avoid
expressing those opinions through the use of loaded words,
gestures, facial expressions, or vocal tone. Like those
newscasters, you are already educating your listeners simply by
informing them. Let them make up their own minds. This is
probably the most important reason for informative speaking.
The audience should leave an informative speech with
information hunger; wanting to learn more about the topic
that you presented.

             AI Insight
                                  15.1 INFORMATIVE SPEAKING GOALS | 889

    AI tools can help speakers explore multiple
    perspectives on a controversial topic without
    inserting personal bias. When used
    strategically, AI can generate summaries of
    opposing viewpoints, helping you ensure
    balanced, neutral representation while still
    maintaining clarity.

          Beyond the Podium Insight

    Creating "information hunger" mirrors what
    excellent educators, leaders, and
    communicators do daily--spark curiosity that
    motivates people to learn more. Developing
    this skill strengthens your ability to
    communicate in classrooms, communities, and
    professional environments.

Making Information Clear and
Interesting for the Audience

A clear and interesting speech can make use of description,
890 | 15.1 INFORMATIVE SPEAKING GOALS

causal analysis, or categories. With description, you use words
to create a picture in the minds of your audience. You can
describe physical realities, social realities, emotional
experiences, sequences, consequences, or contexts. For
instance, you can describe the mindset of the Massachusetts
town of Salem during the witch trials. You can also use causal
analysis, which focuses on the connections between causes and
consequences. For example, in speaking about health care
costs, you could explain how a serious illness can put even
a well-insured family into bankruptcy. You can also use
categories to group things together. For instance, you could
say that there are three categories of investment for the future:
liquid savings, avoiding debt, and acquiring properties that
will increase in value.

   There are a number of principles to keep in mind as a
speaker to make the information you present clear and
interesting for your audience. Let's examine several of them.

Adjust Complexity to the
Audience

If your speech is too complex or too simplistic, it will not hold
the interest of your listeners. How can you determine the right
level of complexity? Your audience analysis is one important
way to do this. Will your listeners belong to a given age group,

                 explains, "You cannot assume

                 they will know what you mean.

                 Rather, you must be sure to

explain everything so thoroughly that they cannot help but

understand" (Lucas, 2004). Define terms to help listeners

understand them the way you mean them to. Give

explanations that are consistent with your definitions and

show how those ideas apply to your speech topic. In this way,

you can avoid misunderstandings.

Similarly, be very careful about assuming there is anything

that "everybody knows." Suppose you've decided to present

an informative speech on the survival of the early colonists

of New England. You may have learned in elementary school

that their survival was attributable, in part, to the assistance

of Squanto. Many of your listeners will know which states are

in New England, but if there are international students in the

audience, they might never have heard of New England. You

should clarify the term either by pointing out the region on

a map or by stating that it's the six states in the American

northeast. Other knowledge gaps can still confound the

effectiveness of the speech. For instance, who or what was

Squanto? What kind of assistance did the settlers get? Only a

few listeners are likely to know that Squanto spoke English and
                                  15.1 INFORMATIVE SPEAKING GOALS | 893

that fact had greatly surprised the settlers when they landed. It
was through his knowledge of English that Squanto was able
to advise these settlers in survival strategies during that first
harsh winter. If you neglect to provide that information, your
speech will not be fully informative.

   Beyond the opportunity to help improve your delivery, one
important outcome of practicing your speech in front of a live
audience of a couple of friends or classmates is that you can
become aware of terms that are confusing or that you should
define for your audience.

Avoid Unnecessary Jargon

If you decide to give an informative speech on a highly
specialized topic, limit how much technical language or jargon
you use. Loading a speech with specialized language has the
potential to be taxing on the listeners. It can become too
difficult to "translate" your meanings, and if that happens,
you will not effectively deliver information. Even if you define
many technical terms, the audience may feel as if they are being
bombarded with a set of definitions instead of useful
information. Don't treat your speech as a crash course in an
entire topic. If you must introduce one specialized term and
carefully define and explain it to the audience. Define it in
words and then use a concrete and relevant example to clarify
the meaning.

   Some topics, by their very nature, are too technical for a
894 | 15.1 INFORMATIVE SPEAKING GOALS

short speech. For example, in a five-minute speech you would
be foolish to try to inform your audience about the causes
of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear emergency that occurred in
Japan in 2011. Other topics, while technical, can be presented
in audience-friendly ways that minimize the use of technical
terms. For instance, in a speech about Mount Vesuvius, the
volcano that buried the ancient cities of Pompeii and
Herculaneum, you can use the term "pyroclastic flow" as long
as you take the time to either show or tell what it means.

Create Concrete Images

As a college student, you have had a significant amount of
exposure to abstract terms. You have become comfortable
using and hearing a variety of abstract ideas. However, abstract
terms lend themselves to many interpretations. For instance,
the abstract term "responsibility" can mean many things.
Among other meanings, it can mean duty, task, authority, or
blame. Because of the potential for misunderstanding, it is
better to use a concrete word. For example, instead of saying,
"Helen Worth was responsible for the project," you will
convey clearer meaning when you say, "Helen Worth was in
charge of the project," "Helen Kimes made the project a
success," or "Helen Worth was to blame for the failure of the
project."

   To illustrate the differences between abstract and concrete
language, let's look at a few pairs of terms:
                15.1 INFORMATIVE SPEAKING GOALS | 895

          Table 15.1: Abstract and Concrete Language Examples

Abstract        Concrete

transportation  air travel

success         completion of project

discrimination  exclusion of women

profound        knowledgeable

By using an abstraction in a sentence and then comparing
the concrete term in the sentence, you will notice the more
precise meanings of the concrete terms. Those precise terms
are less likely to be misunderstood. In the last pair of terms,
"knowledgeable" is listed as a concrete term, but it can also be
considered an abstract term. Still, it's likely to be much clearer
and more precise than "profound."

Keep Information Limited

When you developed your speech, you carefully narrowed
your topic in order to keep information limited yet complete
and coherent. If you carefully adhere to your own narrowing,
you can keep from going off on tangents or confusing your
audience. If you overload your audience with information,
they will be unable to follow your narrative. Use the
definitions, descriptions, explanations, and examples you need
in order to make your meanings clear, but resist the temptation
896 | 15.1 INFORMATIVE SPEAKING GOALS

to add tangential information merely because you find it
interesting.

Make It Memorable

If you've already done the preliminary work in choosing a
topic, finding an interesting narrowing of that topic,
developing and using presentation aids, and working to
maintain audience contact, your delivery is likely to be
memorable. Now you can turn to your content and find
opportunities to make it more vivid. You can do this by using
explanations, comparisons, examples, or language.

   Let's say that you're preparing a speech on the United
States' internment of Japanese American people from the San
Francisco Bay area during World War II. Your goal is to paint
a memorable image in your listeners' minds. You can do this
through a dramatic contrast, before and after. You could say,
"In 1941, the Bay area had a vibrant and productive
community of Japanese American citizens who went to work
every day, opening their shops, typing reports in their offices,
and teaching in their classrooms, just as they had been doing
for years. But on December 7, 1941, everything changed.
Within six months, Bay area residents of Japanese ancestry
were gone, transported to internment camps located hundreds
of miles from the Pacific coast."

   This strategy rests on the ability of the audience to visualize
the two contrasting situations. You have alluded to two sets
         15.1 INFORMATIVE SPEAKING GOALS | 897

of images that are familiar to most college students, images

that they can easily visualize. Once the audience's imagination

is engaged in visualization, they are likely to remember the

speech.

Your task of providing memorable imagery does not stop

after the introduction. While maintaining an even-handed

approach that does not seek to persuade, you must provide

the audience with information about the circumstances that

triggered the policy of internment, perhaps by describing the

advice that was given to President Roosevelt by his top

advisers. You might depict the conditions faced by Japanese

Americans during their internment by describing a typical day

one of the camps. To conclude your speech on a memorable

note, you might name a notable individual--an actor, writer,

or politician--who is a survivor of the internment.

Such a strategy might feel

instead of simply saying that he was very famous during his

lifetime, remind your audience that he was so prominent that

their own great-grandparents likely knew of his work and had

strong opinions about it. In so doing, you've connected your

topic to their own forebears.
                                  15.1 INFORMATIVE SPEAKING GOALS | 899

Personalize Your Content

Giving a human face to a topic helps the audience perceive it as
interesting. If your topic is related to the Maasai rite of passage
into manhood, the prevalence of drug addiction in a particular
locale, the development of a professional filmmaker, or the
treatment of a disease, putting a human face should not be
difficult. To do it, find a case study you can describe within the
speech, referring to the human subject by name. This conveys
to the audience that these processes happen to real people.

   Make sure you use a real case study, though--don't make
one up. Using a fictional character without letting your
audience know that the example is hypothetical is a betrayal of
the listener's trust, and hence, is unethical.

 Silicon chip      Seattle's Space Needle
 Spruce Goose      Malta
 Medieval armor
 DDT insecticide
 Soy inks
 NAACP

You will find it necessary to narrow your topic about an object
because, like any topic, you can't say everything about it in a
single speech. In most cases, there are choices about how to
                             15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES | 903

narrow the topic. Here are some specific purpose statements
that reflect ways of narrowing a few of those topics:

   To inform the audience about the role of soy inks in
      reducing toxic pollution

   To inform the audience about the current uses of the
      banned insecticide DDT

   To inform the audience about what we've learned from
      the Hubble telescope

   To inform the audience about the role of the NAACP in
      the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964

   To describe the significance of the gigantic Spruce
      Goose, the wooden airplane that launched an airline

These specific purposes reflect a narrow, but interesting,
approach to each topic. These purposes are precise, and they
should help you maintain your focus on a narrow but deep
slice of knowledge.

People

This category applies both to specific individuals and also to
roles. The following are some of these topics:

   Dalai Lamas
   Astronauts
   Tsar Nicholas II
904 | 15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES

   Modern midwives
   Mata Hari
   Catherine the Great
   Navajo code talkers
   Mahatma Gandhi
   Justice Thurgood Marshall
   Madame Curie
   Leopold Mozart
   Aristotle
   The Hemlock Society
   Sonia Sotomayor
   Jack the Ripper

There is a great deal of information about each one of these
examples. In order to narrow the topic or write a thesis
statement, it's important to recognize that your speech should
not be a biography, or time line, of someone's life. If you
attempt to deliver a comprehensive report of every important
event and accomplishment related to your subject, then
nothing will seem any more important than anything else. To
capture and hold your audience's interest, you must narrow to
a focus on a feature, event, achievement, or secret about your
human topic.

   Here are some purpose statements that reflect a process of
narrowing:

   To inform the audience about the training program

                   topics must be carefully narrowed

                   speech. Failure to do so will result
                   in a shallow speech. Here are a few
                   ways to narrow the purpose:

   Causal Topical

This visual highlights four common organizational
patterns--chronological, spatial, causal, and topical--using
simple icons to help speakers quickly identify the structure
that best fits their content. (Image created by Richard Kreider)

   There are many ways to approach any of these and other
topics, but again, you must emphasize an important
dimension of the event. Otherwise, you run the risk of
producing a time line in which the main point gets lost. In a
speech about an event, you may use a chronological order, but
if you choose to do so, you can't include every detail.

     Example:
     Specific Purpose: To inform the audience about the
     purpose of the Iditarod dogsled race.
     Central Idea: The annual Iditarod commemorates the
     heroism of Balto, the sled dog that led a dog team
     carrying medicine 1150 miles to save Nome from an
     outbreak of diphtheria.
     Main Points:

           Diphtheria broke out in a remote Alaskan
             town.

           Dogsleds were the only transportation for
910 | 15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES

             getting medicine.
           The Iditarod Trail was long, rugged, and under

             siege of severe weather.
           Balto the dog knew where he was going,

             even when the musher did not.
           The annual race commemorates Balto's

             heroism in saving the lives of the people of
             Nome.

     In this example, you must explain the event.
     However, another way to approach the same event
     would describe it. The following is an example:
     Specific Purpose: To describe the annual Iditarod
     Trail Sled Dog Race.
     Central Idea: It's a long and dangerous race.
     Main Points:

           The 1150-mile, ten- to seventeen-day race
             goes through wilderness with widely spaced
             checkpoints for rest, first aid, and getting
             fresh dogs.

           A musher, or dogsled driver, must be at least
             fourteen years old to endure the rigors of
             severe weather, exhaustion, and loneliness.

           A musher is responsible for his or her own
                              15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES | 911

             food, food for twelve to sixteen dogs, and for
             making sure they don't get lost.
           Reaching the end of the race without getting
             lost, even in last place, is considered
             honorable and heroic.
           The expense of participation is greater than
             the prize awarded to the winner.

By now you can see that there are various ways to approach a
topic while avoiding an uninspiring time line. In the example
of the Iditarod race, you could alternatively frame it as an
Alaskan tourism topic, or you could emphasize the enormous
staff involved in first aid, search and rescue, dog care, trail
maintenance, event coordination, financial management, and
registration.

Concepts

Concepts are abstract ideas that exist independent of whether
they are observed or practiced, such as the example of social
equality that follows. Concepts can include hypotheses and
theories.

   The glass ceiling
912 | 15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES

   Ethnocentrism
   Honor codes
   Autism
   Karma
   Wellness
   Fairness theory
   Bioethics
   The American Dream
   Social equality

Here are a few examples of specific purposes developed from
the examples:

   To explain why people in all cultures are ethnocentric
   To describe the Hindu concept of karma
   To distinguish the differences between the concepts of

      wellness and health
   To show the resources available in our local school

      system for children with autism
   To explain three of Dr. Stephen Suranovic's seven

      categories of fairness

     Here is one possible example of a way to develop
     one of these topics:
                       15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES | 913

Specific Purpose: To explain why people in all
cultures are ethnocentric.
Central Idea: There are benefits to being
ethnocentric.
Main Points:

      Ethnocentrism is the idea that one's own
        culture is superior to others.

      Ethnocentrism strongly contributes to
        positive group identity.

      Ethnocentrism facilitates the coordination of
        social activity.

      Ethnocentrism contributes to a sense of
        safety within a group.

      Ethnocentrism becomes harmful when it
        creates barriers.

In an example of a concept about which people
disagree, you must represent multiple and
conflicting views as fully and fairly as possible. For
instance:
Specific Purpose: To expose the audience to three
different views of the American Dream.
Central Idea: The American Dream is a shared dream,
914 | 15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES

     an impossible dream, or a dangerous dream,
     depending on the perspective of the individual.

     Main Points:

           The concept of the American Dream describes
             a state of abundant well-being in which an
             honest and productive American can own a
             home; bring up a family; work at a permanent,
             well-paying job with benefits; and retire in
             security and leisure.

           Many capitalists support the social pattern of
             working hard to deserve and acquire the
             material comforts and security of a
             comfortable life.

           Many sociologists argue that the American
             Dream is far out of reach for the 40 percent of
             Americans at the bottom of the economic
             scale.

           Many environmentalists argue that the
             consumption patterns that accompany the
             American Dream have resulted in the
             depletion of resources and the pollution of air,
             water, and soil.

Processes

If your speech topic is a process, your goal should be to help
your audience understand it, or be able to perform it. In either
instance, processes involve a predictable series of changes,
phases, or steps.

   Soil erosion
   Cell division
   Physical therapy
   Volcanic eruption
   Paper recycling
   Consumer credit evaluations
   Scholarship money searches
   Navy Seal training
   Portfolio building
   The development of Alzheimer's disease

For some topics, you will need presentation aids in order to
make your meaning clear to your listeners. Even in cases where
you don't absolutely need a presentation aid, one might be
useful. For instance, if your topic is evaluating consumer
credit, instead of just describing a comparison between two
different interest rates applied to the same original amount of
debt, it would be helpful to show a graph of the difference.
This might also be the sort of topic that would strongly serve
the needs of your audience before they find themselves in
916 | 15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES

trouble. Since this will be an informative speech, you must
resist the impulse to tell your listeners that one form of
borrowing is good and another is bad; you must simply show
them the difference in numbers. They can reach their own
conclusions.

   Organizing your facts is crucially important when
discussing a process. Every stage of a process must be clear and
understandable. When two or more things occur at the same
time, as they might in the development of Alzheimer's disease,
it is important to make it clear that several things are occurring
at once. For example, as plaque is accumulating in the brain,
the patient is likely to begin exhibiting various symptoms.

     Here's an example of the initial steps of a speech
     about a process:
     Specific Purpose: To inform the audience about how
     to build an academic portfolio.
     Central Idea: A portfolio represents you and
     emphasizes your best skills.
     Main Points:

           A portfolio is an organized selection
             containing the best examples of the skills you
             can offer an employer.
                             15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES | 917

           A portfolio should contain samples of a
             substantial body of written work, print and
             electronically published pieces, photography,
             and DVDs of your media productions.

           A portfolio should be customized for each
             prospective employer.

           The material in your portfolio should be
             consistent with the skills and experience in
             your rsum.

In a speech about the process of building a portfolio, there
will be many smaller steps to include within each of the main
points. For instance, creating separate sections of the portfolio
for different types of creative activities, writing a table of
contents, labeling and dating your samples, making your
samples look attractive and professional, and other steps
should be inserted where it makes the most sense, in the most
organized places, in order to give your audience the most
coherent understanding possible.

   You've probably noticed that there are topics that could
be appropriate in more than one category. For instance, the
1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helen's could be legitimately handled
as an event or as a process. If you approach the eruption as
an event, most of the information you include will focus on
human responses and the consequences on humans and the
918 | 15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES

landscape. If you approach the eruption as a process, you will
be using visual aids and explanations to describe geological
changes before and during the eruption. You might also
approach this topic from the viewpoint of a person whose life
was affected by the eruption. This should remind you that
there are many ways to approach most topics, and because
of that, your narrowing choices and your purpose will be the
important foundation determining the structure of your
informative speech.

Developing Your Topic for the
Audience

One issue to consider when preparing an informative speech is
how best to present information to enhance audience learning.
Katherine Rowan suggests focusing on areas where your
audience may experience confusion and using the likely
sources of confusion as a guide for developing the content
of your speech. Rowan identifies three sources of audience
confusion: difficult concepts or language, difficult-to-envision
structures or processes, and ideas that are difficult to
understand because they are hard to believe (Rowan, 1995).
The following subsections will discuss each of these and will
provide strategies for dealing with each of these sources of
confusion.

Difficult Concepts or Language

Sometimes audiences may have difficulty understanding
920 | 15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES

information because of the concepts or language used. For

example, they may not understand what the term "organic

food" means or how it differs from "all-natural" foods. If an

audience is likely to experience confusion over a basic concept

or term, Rowan suggests using an elucidating explanation

composed of four parts. The purpose of such an explanation is

to clarify the meaning and use of the concept by focusing on

essential features of the concept.

The first part of an elucidating explanation is to provide

a typical exemplar, or example that includes all the central

features of the concept. If you are talking about what is fruit,

an apple or orange would be a typical example.

The second step Rowan suggests is to follow up the typical

exemplar with a definition. Fruits might be defined as edible

plant structures that contain the seeds of the plant.

                    After providing a definition,

                    you can move on to the third part

       AI Insight   of the elucidating explanation:

                                   struggle as well.

Difficult-to-Envision Processes or
Structures

A second source of audience difficulty in understanding,
according to Rowan, is a process or structure that is complex
and difficult to envision. The blood circulation system in the
body might be an example of a difficult-to-envision process.
To address this type of audience confusion, Rowan suggests
a quasi-scientific explanation, which starts by giving a big-
picture perspective on the process.

                   describing the bones in the body

                   with lines such as, "the hip bone's

                   connected to the thigh bone; the

                   thigh bone's connected to the

                   knee bone." Making the

                   connections            between

                   components helps the audience to

                   remember and better understand

                   the process.

because It's Hard
to Believe

A third source of audience confusion, and perhaps the most
difficult to address as a speaker, is an idea that's difficult to
understand because it's hard to believe. This often happens
when people have implicit, but erroneous, theories about how
the world works. For example, the idea that science tries to
disprove theories is difficult for some people to understand;
after all, shouldn't the purpose of science be to prove things?
In such a case, Rowan suggests using a transformative
explanation. A transformative explanation begins by
discussing the audience's implicit theory and showing why it is
plausible. Then you move to showing how the implicit theory
is limited and conclude by presenting the accepted explanation
and why that explanation is better. In the case of scientists
disproving theories, you might start by talking about what
science has proven (e.g., the causes of malaria, the usefulness
of penicillin in treating infection) and why focusing on science
as proof is a plausible way of thinking. Then you might show
how the science as proof theory is limited by providing
examples of ideas that were accepted as "proven" but were later
found to be false, such as the belief that diseases are caused
by miasma, or "bad air"; or that bloodletting cures diseases by
924 | 15.2 TYPES OF INFORMATIVE SPEECHES

purging the body of "bad humors." You can then conclude
by showing how science is an enterprise designed to disprove
theories and that all theories are accepted as tentative in light of
existing knowledge.

   Rowan's framework is helpful because it keeps our focus
on the most important element of an informative speech:
increasing audience understanding about a topic.

Ethics

SPEAKING

   Brooke Lyle

Informative speaking asks you to do more than assemble facts.
It requires you to actively guide your audience toward clearer
understanding. Throughout this chapter, you explored how
to choose accurate information, adapt complexity to the
audience, and organize ideas into meaningful patterns. You
learned to create "information hunger," to make ideas
memorable, and to distinguish among the many types of
informative speeches. Most importantly, you discovered how
Rowan's explanatory models help transform complicated or
unfamiliar material into something your audience can
genuinely grasp.

   Beyond the podium, these skills matter because clear
explanation is one of the most powerful communication tools
you can develop. Whether you are helping a coworker
troubleshoot a process, explaining a difficult topic to a friend,
teaching others in a professional role, or presenting in
academic and civic settings, your ability to articulate
information accurately and ethically builds trust. In a world
                       15.3: CONCLUSION: INFORMATIVE SPEAKING | 929

where misinformation spreads quickly and attention is
limited, speakers who communicate with clarity and
responsibility stand out.

   Ethics also remain at the heart of informative speaking.
Being honest about evidence, selecting appropriate supporting
material, checking for accuracy, and acknowledging the limits
of your own knowledge are not just academic
expectations--they are essential habits of credible
communicators. When you commit to ethical explanation,
you model the kind of communication that strengthens
workplaces, communities, and public life.

            Key Takeaways

           One important reason for informative
             speaking is to provide listeners with
             information so that they can make up their
             own minds about an issue.

           Informative speeches must be accurate, clear,
             and interesting for the listener.

           Strategies to make information clear and
             interesting to an audience include adjusting
             the complexity of your information to the
             audience, avoiding jargon, creating concrete
             images, limiting information only to what is
930 | 15.3: CONCLUSION: INFORMATIVE SPEAKING

             most relevant, linking information to what the
             audience already knows, and making
             information memorable through language or
             personalization.
           A variety of different topic categories are
             available for informative speaking.
           One way to develop your topic is to focus on
             areas that might be confusing to the
             audience. If the audience is likely to be
             confused about language or a concept, an
             elucidating explanation might be helpful. If a
             process is complex, a quasi-scientific
             explanation may help. If the audience already
             has an erroneous implicit idea of how
             something works then a transformative
             explanation might be needed.

 1. Define and explain persuasion.
 2. Explain how the three theories of persuasion, namely

      social judgment theory, cognitive dissonance theory, and
      the elaboration likelihood model, can be applied to
      strengthen a persuasive message.

In his text The Dynamics of Persuasion: Communication and
Attitudes in the 21st Century, Richard Perloff noted that the
study of persuasion today is extremely important for several
reasons:

 1. The sheer number and reach of persuasive
      communications have grown exponentially.

 2. Persuasive messages travel faster than ever before, aided
      by digital technologies.

 3. Persuasion has become institutionalized.
 4. Persuasive communication has become more subtle and
934 | 16.1 PERSUASION - AN OVERVIEW

      devious.
 5. Persuasive communication is more complex and

      mediated.

Additionally, social media and the Internet have democratized

persuasive discourse, blurred boundaries, and change the

contours of persuasion. (Perloff, 2017).

                   The first type of persuasive public

                   speaking involves a change in

someone's attitudes, values, and beliefs. An attitude is defined

as an individual's general predisposition toward something as

being good or bad, right or wrong, or negative or positive. You

might believe it's unwise that some states do not mandate

annual vehicle safety inspections, and you want to persuade

others to view such laws negatively.

You can also attempt to persuade an individual to change

how he or she values something. Value refers to an individual's

perception of the usefulness, importance, or worth of
                                     16.1 PERSUASION - AN OVERVIEW | 937

something. We can value a college education or technology or
freedom. Values, as a general concept, are fairly ambiguous and
tend to be very lofty ideas. Ultimately, what we value in life
actually motivates us to engage in a range of behaviors. For
example, if you value technology, you are more likely to seek
out new technology or software on your own. Conversely, if
you do not, you are less likely to do so unless someone, or some
circumstance, requires you to.

   Lastly, you can attempt to get people to change their
personal beliefs. Beliefs are propositions or positions that an
individual holds as true or false without positive knowledge or
proof. Typically, beliefs are divided into two basic categories:
core and dispositional. Core beliefs are beliefs that people have
actively engaged in and created over the course of their lives
(e.g., belief in a higher power, belief in extraterrestrial life
forms). Dispositional beliefs, on the other hand, are beliefs that
people have not actively engaged in but rather judgments that
they make, based on their knowledge of related subjects, when
they encounter a proposition. For example, imagine that you
were asked the question, "Can stock cars reach speeds of one
thousand miles per hour on a one-mile oval track?" Even
though you may never have attended a stock car race or even
seen a live race on TV, you can make split-second judgments
about your understanding of automobile speeds and say with
a fair degree of certainty that you believe stock cars cannot
travel at one thousand miles per hour on a one-mile track.

sign a petition opposing a tuition increase, or drink tap water

instead of bottled water are all behavior-oriented persuasive

speeches. In all these cases, the goal is to change the behavior of

individual listeners.

Why Persuasion Matters

Frymier and Nadler enumerate three reasons why people
should study persuasion (Frymier & Nadler, 2017). First,
when you study and understand persuasion, you will be more
successful at persuading others. If you want to be a persuasive
public speaker, then you need to have a working
understanding of how persuasion functions.

   Second, when people understand persuasion, they will be
better consumers of information. As previously mentioned,
we live in a society where numerous message sources are
constantly fighting for our attention. Unfortunately, most
people just let messages wash over them like a wave, making
16.1 PERSUASION - AN OVERVIEW | 941

little effort to understand or analyze them. As a result, they are

more likely to fall for half- truths, illogical arguments, and lies.

When you start to understand persuasion, you will have the

skill set to actually pick apart the messages being sent to you

and see why some of them are good and others are simply not.

Lastly, when we understand how persuasion functions,

we'll have a better grasp of what happens around us in the

world. We'll be able to analyze why certain speakers are

effective persuaders and others are not. We'll be able to

understand why some public speakers can get an audience

eating out of their hands, while others flop.

Furthermore, we believe it is an

ethical imperative in the twenty-

machine.              Thankfully, a number of

                      researchers have created theories

                      that help explain why people are

persuaded. While there are numerous theories that help to

explain persuasion, we are only going to examine three here:

social judgment theory, cognitive dissonance theory, and the

elaboration likelihood model.

Social Judgment Theory

Muzafer Sherif and Carl Hovland created social judgment
theory in an attempt to determine what types of
communicative messages and under what conditions
communicated messages will lead to a change in someone's
behavior (Sherif & Hovland, 1961). In essence, Sherif and
Hovland found that people's perceptions of attitudes, values,
beliefs, and behaviors exist on a continuum including latitude
                                     16.1 PERSUASION - AN OVERVIEW | 943

of rejection, latitude of noncommitment, and latitude of
acceptance (Figure 16.1).

 Figure 16.1: Latitudes of Judgements

audience attitudes fall into three zones: rejection,

are giving your speech on

majoring in a foreign language,

people who are in favor of majoring in a foreign language are

more likely to positively evaluate your message, assimilate your

advice into their own ideas, and engage in desired behavior. On

the other hand, people who reject your message are more likely

to negatively evaluate your message, not assimilate your advice,

and not engage in desired behavior.

In an ideal world, we'd always be persuading people who

agree with our opinions, but that's not reality. Instead, we

often find ourselves in situations where we are trying to

persuade others to attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors with

which they may not agree. To help us persuade others, what we

need to think about is the range of possible attitudes, values,

beliefs, and behaviors that exist. For example, in our foreign
946 | 16.1 PERSUASION - AN OVERVIEW

language case, we may see the following possible opinions from
our audience members:

   Complete agreement. Let's all major in foreign
      languages.

   Strong agreement. I won't major in a foreign language,
      but I will double major in a foreign language.

   Agreement in part. I won't major in a foreign
      language, but I will minor in a foreign language.

   Neutral. While I think studying a foreign language can
      be worthwhile, I also think a college education can be
      complete without it. I really don't feel strongly one way
      or the other.

   Disagreement in part. I will only take the foreign
      language classes required by my major.

   Strong disagreement. I don't think I should have to
      take any foreign language classes.

   Complete disagreement. Majoring in a foreign
      language is a complete waste of a college education.

These seven possible opinions on the subject do not represent
the full spectrum of choices, but give us various degrees of
agreement with the general topic. So what does this have to
do with persuasion? Well, we're glad you asked. Sherif and
Hovland theorized that persuasion was a matter of knowing
how great the discrepancy or difference was between the
speaker's viewpoint and that of the audience. If the speaker's
                                     16.1 PERSUASION - AN OVERVIEW | 947

point of view was similar to that of audience members, then
persuasion was more likely. If the discrepancy between the idea
proposed by the speaker and the audience's viewpoint is too
great, then the likelihood of persuasion decreases dramatically.

persuasion when a message moderately differs from their
current views--not too little, not too much.

your complete end goal, it's better than getting nowhere at all.

Cognitive Dissonance Theory

In 1957, Leon Festinger proposed another theory for
understanding how persuasion functions: cognitive
dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957). Cognitive dissonance is
an aversive motivational state that occurs when an individual
entertains two or more contradictory attitudes, values, beliefs,
or behaviors simultaneously. For example, your roommate
values environmental protection but purchases an iced latte
sold in a disposable cup several times a week. In this case,
protecting the environment and frequent consumption of
disposable plastic cups are inconsistent with each other. The
goal of persuasion is to induce enough dissonance in listeners
that they will change their attitudes, values, beliefs, or
behaviors.

   Frymier and Nadler noted that for cognitive dissonance to
work effectively, there are three necessary conditions: aversive
consequences, freedom of choice, and insufficient external
justification (Frymier & Nadler, 2017). First, for cognitive
dissonance to work, there needs to be a strong enough
aversive consequence, or punishment, for not changing one's
attitudes, values, beliefs, or behaviors. For example, maybe
                                     16.1 PERSUASION - AN OVERVIEW | 951

you're giving a speech on why people need to use reusable
drinkware instead of disposable cups. If your aversive
consequence for continuing to use disposable cups is that your
audience is polluting the ocean, then most people will simply
not be persuaded, because the punishment isn't severe enough
to be personally relevant. Instead, for cognitive dissonance to
work, the punishment associated with not using reusable
drinkware needs to be significant enough to change behaviors.
If you convince your audience that traces of disposable plastics
have now entered human bodies by way of drinking water and
seafood, they might fear the aversive consequences enough to
change their behavior.

   The second condition necessary for cognitive dissonance to
work is that people must have freedom of choice. If listeners
feel they are being coerced into doing something, then
dissonance will not be aroused. They may alter their behavior
in the short term, but as soon as the coercion is removed, the
original behavior will reemerge. It's like the driver who slows
down when a police officer is nearby but ignores speed limits
once the officer is no longer present. As a speaker, if you want
to increase cognitive dissonance, you need to make sure that
your audience doesn't feel coerced or manipulated, but rather
that they can clearly see that they have a choice of whether to
be persuaded.

argument: (a) "Dependence on

personal vehicles inevitably leads

to higher expenses, traffic

congestion, and increased carbon emissions"-- or (b) "If you

think of yourself as an environmentally conscious and

responsible citizen, you'll choose public transportation to

reduce your impact"? With the first argument, you have

provided external justification for using public transportation

(i.e., negative consequences will occur if you keep driving

everywhere). Listeners who reject this external justification

(e.g., who don't believe these consequences are inevitable or

significant) are unlikely to change their behavior. With the

second argument, however, if your listeners think of

themselves as environmentally conscious and responsible

citizens and they currently drive everywhere, the conflict

between their self-image and their behavior will elicit cognitive

dissonance. To reduce this cognitive dissonance, they are likely

to seek internal justification for the view of themselves as

responsible citizens by changing their behavior (i.e., taking

public transportation more often). In this case, according to

cognitive dissonance theory, the second persuasive argument

would be the one more likely to lead to a change in behavior.
954 | 16.1 PERSUASION - AN OVERVIEW

Elaboration Likelihood Model

The last of the three theories of persuasion discussed here is the
elaboration likelihood model created by Petty and Cacioppo
(Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). Elaboration refers to "the extent
to which a person thinks about the issue-relevant arguments
contained in a message." The deeper an audience member
processes the information related to an argument, the higher
the elaboration. There are also two pathways for processing the
information in support of an advocacy, the central route or the
peripheral route, and persuasion can take place through either
route. In an ideal world, everyone would process information
through the central route by identifying strong or weak
arguments. Unfortunately, many people often use the
peripheral route without ascertaining the arguments
presented. Instead of evaluating the argument in the persuasive
message and thinking about its implications, bias, and values,
peripheral information processing relies on simple cues in the
persuasion context, such as the appeal of the communicator,
the format of the message, or the speaker's style, to decide if the
persuasion is acceptable.

For researchers of persuasion, the question then becomes: how
do people select one route or the other when attending to
persuasive messages? Petty and Cacioppo noted that there are
two basic factors for determining whether someone centrally
processes a persuasive message: ability and motivation. First,
audience members must be able to process the persuasive
message. If the language or message is too complicated, then
people will not engage in high elaboration because they will
not understand the persuasive message. Motivation, on the
other hand, refers to whether the audience member chooses to
elaborate on the message. Frymier and Nadler discussed several
factors that can lead to high elaboration. We discuss a few
of them below: personal relevance and personal involvement,
personal responsibility, incongruent information, and need for
cognition.
958 | 16.1 PERSUASION - AN OVERVIEW

Personal Relevance and Personal
Involvement

The first reason people are motivated to take the central route
or use high elaboration when listening to a persuasive message
involves personal relevance and involvement. Personal
relevance refers to whether the audience member feels that
he or she is actually directly affected by the speech topic. For
example, if someone is listening to a speech on why vaping
is just as harmful as smoking cigarettes, and that listener has
never used tobacco products or intended to, he or she may
think the speech topic simply isn't relevant. Obviously, as a
speaker you should always think about how your topic is
relevant to your listeners and make sure to drive this home
throughout your speech. Personal involvement, on the other
hand, asks whether the individual is actively engaged with the
issue at hand: sends letters of support, gives speeches on the
topic, fundraises for the cause, and so forth. If an audience
member has witnessed the harm of tobacco products, then he
or she would be highly involved (i.e., would engage in high
elaboration) in a speech that attempts to persuade listeners
that vaping is harmful.

Personal Responsibility

When people feel that they are going to be held responsible,
for the evaluation or the outcome of a message, they are more
                                     16.1 PERSUASION - AN OVERVIEW | 959

likely to critically think through the message using the central
route. For example, if you are selected to serve as a juror, it's
your responsibility to carefully evaluate the case based on the
information presented during the trial and arrive at a verdict.
You are unlikely to invest the same amount of time or energy
if you are not the juror and just learn about the case from the
news.

   A series of research has also shown that the greater the
responsibilities an individual holds for evaluating an issue,
such as serving as the sole evaluator vs. one of the ten
evaluators, the more likely he/she is willing to put in the
mental effort. When people feel that their evaluation is
important, they take more responsibility and are more likely to
engage in high elaboration. (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986).

Incongruent Information

Some people are motivated to centrally process information
when it does not adhere to their own ideas. For example, if you
believe that the earth is overly populated and natural resources
are running out, a speech on how problem-solving through
innovation will continue to keep the planet endlessly
abundant will very likely catch your attention. The
incongruence between your belief and what the speech
advocates is in direct contrast. As such, you are interested in
listening to the speech, especially in looking for flaws in the
speaker's argument.

Learning Objectives

 1. Differentiate among the four types of persuasive claims.
 2. Explain how the four types of persuasive claims serve the

      different types of persuasive speeches.
 3. Explain the two goals of policy claims.

Obviously, there are many different persuasive speech topics
you could select for a public speaking class. Anything from
localized claims, such as changing a specific college or
university policy, to broader societal claims, such as increasing
enforcement against the trafficking of women and children
in the United States, can make for an interesting persuasive
speech. You'll notice in the previous sentence that we referred
to the two topics as claims. In this use of the word "claim," we
are declaring the goodness or positivity of an attitude, value,
belief, or behavior that others may dispute. As a result of the

attitude, value, belief, or behavior and the perceptions of
                              16.2 TYPES OF PERSUASIVE SPEECHES | 963

others, we attempt to support the claim we make using
evidence and logic as we attempt to persuade others. There are
four common claims that can be made: definitional, factual,
policy, and value.

Definitional Claims

The first common types of claims that a persuasive speaker
can make are definitional or classification claims. Definitional
claims are claims over the denotation or classification of what
something is. In essence, we are trying to argue for what
something is or what something is not. Most definitional
claims fall to a basic argument formula:

   X is (or is not) a Y because it has (or does not have) features
A, B, or C.

   For example, maybe you're trying to persuade your class that
while AI can be used as a tool to help with studying, it is not
just another tool like a calculator. You could start by explaining
what a calculator does and then what AI does. You could even
point out that AI differs from a calculator because (1) the
same input can generate different responses, including wrong
answers, (2) the responses are often conversational rather than
strictly numerical, and (3) AI is capable of performing a wide
range of tasks such as image creation, reasoning, coding, and
writing prompted by a variety of inputs, including text, image,
and audio. By highlighting these distinctions, you can
964 | 16.2 TYPES OF PERSUASIVE SPEECHES

demonstrate that AI is fundamentally different from a
calculator in both capability and scale.

Factual Claims

Factual claims set out to argue the truth or falsity of an
assertion. Some factual claims are simple to answer: Simone
Biles became the most decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast in
2024; the tallest man in the world, Robert Wadlow, was eight
feet and eleven inches tall; Facebook wasn't profitable until
2009. All these factual claims are well documented by evidence
and can be easily supported with a little research.

   However, many factual claims cannot be answered
absolutely. Some factual claims are simply hard to determine
the falsity or truthfulness because the final answer on the
subject has not been discovered (e.g., when is censorship good,
what rights should animals have, when does life begin).
Probably the most historically interesting and consistent
factual claim is the existence of a higher power, God, or other
religious deity. The simple fact of the matter is that there is
not enough evidence to clearly answer this factual claim in any
specific direction, which is where the notion of faith must be
involved in this factual claim.

   Other factual claims that may not be easily answered using
evidence are predictions of what may or may not happen. For
example, you could give a speech on the future of climate
change or the future of terrorism in the United States. While
                              16.2 TYPES OF PERSUASIVE SPEECHES | 965

there may be evidence that something will happen in the
future, unless you're a psychic, you don't actually know what
will happen in the future.

   When thinking of factual claims, it often helps to pretend
that you're putting a specific claim on trial, and as the speaker
your job is to defend your claim as a lawyer would defend a
client. Ultimately, you want to be more persuasive than your
audience members who act as both opposition attorneys and
judges.

Policy Claims

The third common claim often seen in persuasive speeches is
the policy claim--a statement about the nature of a problem
and the solution that should be implemented. Policy claims
are probably the most common form of persuasive speaking
because we live in a society surrounded by problems and
people who have ideas about how to fix these problems. Let's
look at a few examples of possible policy claims:

   The United States should stop capital punishment.
   The United States should become independent from the

      use of foreign oil.
   Human cloning for organ donations should be legal.
   Nonviolent drug offenders should be sent to

      rehabilitation centers and not prisons.
   The tobacco industry should be required to pay 100
966 | 16.2 TYPES OF PERSUASIVE SPEECHES

      percent of the medical bills for individuals dying of
      smoking-related cancers.
   The development of AI-powered counterfeit human
      beings should be banned to protect the erosion of trust.

        AI Insight     Each of these claims has a clear

                    audience to do anything to enact
              16.2 TYPES OF PERSUASIVE SPEECHES | 967

the policy. For example, maybe

your speech is on why Congress         brainstorm or
should restrict social media use       outline speeches
for teens under 16. Your goal as a

speaker is to get your audience to

agree that it is in our best interest

as a society to protect teens from social media addiction at a

young age. But, you are not seeking to have your audience run

out and call their senators or congressmen or even sign a

petition. Often the first step in larger political change is simply

getting a massive number people to agree with your policy

perspective.

Let's look at a few more passive agreement claims:

 Racial profiling of individuals suspected of belonging to
   known terrorist groups is a way to make America safer.

 Requiring American citizens to "show their papers" is a
   violation of democracy and resembles tactics of Nazi
   Germany and communist Russia.

 Colleges and universities should require students to take
   AI literacy classes in place of up to 2 general education
   courses.

In each of these claims, the goal is to sway one's audience to a
specific attitude, value, or belief, but not necessarily to get the
audience to enact any specific behaviors.
968 | 16.2 TYPES OF PERSUASIVE SPEECHES

Prompt Immediate Action

The alternative to merely winning passive agreement is to
prompt immediate action by persuading your audience to
engage in a specific behavior. Many passive agreement topics
can become immediate action-oriented topics as soon as you
tell your audience what behavior they should engage in (e.g.,
sign a petition, call a senator, vote). While it is much easier to
elicit passive agreement than to get people to do something,
you should always try to get your audience to act and do so
quickly. A common mistake that speakers make is telling
people to enact a behavior that will occur in the future. The
longer it takes for people to engage in the action you desire, the
less likely it is that your audience will engage in that behavior.

   Here are some examples of good claims with immediate calls
to action:

   College students should eat more fruits, so I am
      encouraging everyone to eat the apple I have provided
      you and start getting more fruits in your diet.

   Teaching a child to read is one way to ensure that the
      next generation will be stronger than those that have
      come before us, so please sign up right now to volunteer
      one hour a week to help teach a child to read.

   The United States should reduce its nuclear arsenal by
      20 percent over the next five years. Please sign the letter
      provided encouraging the president to take this
                              16.2 TYPES OF PERSUASIVE SPEECHES | 969

      necessary step for global peace. Once you've signed the
      letter, hand it to me, and I'll forward it to the White
      House today.

Each of these three examples starts with a basic claim and then
tags on an immediate call to action. Remember, the more
quickly you can get people to engage in a behavior the more
likely they actually will.

Value Claims

The final type of claim is a value claim, or a claim where the
speaker is advocating a judgment claim about something (e.g.,
it's good or bad, it's right or wrong, it's beautiful or ugly, moral
or immoral).

   Let's look at three value claims. We've italicized the
evaluative term in each claim:

                 your criteria for making the

                 evaluative statement. For

example, when we examine the SUV claim, if your criteria for

the term "gas guzzling monstrosity" are ecological impact,

safety, and gas consumption, then your evaluative statement

can be more easily understood and evaluated by your audience.

If, however, you state that your criterion is that SUVs bigger

than military vehicles shouldn't be on the road, then your
                               16.2 TYPES OF PERSUASIVE SPEECHES | 971

statement takes on a slightly different meaning. Ultimately,
when making a value claim, you need to make sure that you
clearly label your evaluative term and provide clear criteria for
how you came to that evaluation.

16.3: ORGANIZING
PERSUASIVE SPEECHES

   Qi Dunsworth

Learning Objectives

 1. Explain each of the three common organizational
      patterns for constructing a persuasive speech: Monroe's
      motivated sequence, problem-cause-solution, and
      comparative advantages.

 2. Use Monroe's motivated sequence to organize and
      construct a persuasive speech.

Previously in this book, we discussed general guidelines for
organizing speeches. In this section, we are going to look at
three organizational patterns ideally suited for persuasive
speeches: Monroe's motivated sequence, problem-cause-
solution, and comparative advantages.

Monroe's Motivated Sequence

One of the most commonly cited and discussed organizational
patterns for persuasive speeches is Alan H. Monroe's
974 | 16.3: ORGANIZING PERSUASIVE SPEECHES

motivated sequence. The purpose of Monroe's motivated
sequence is to help speakers "sequence supporting materials
and motivational appeals to form a useful organizational
pattern for speeches as a whole" (German et al., 2010).

   While Monroe's motivated sequence is commonly discussed
in most public speaking textbooks, we do want to provide
one minor caution. Thus far, almost no research has been
conducted that has demonstrated that Monroe's motivated
sequence is any more persuasive than other structural patterns.
In the only study conducted experimentally examining
Monroe's motivated sequence, the researchers did not find the
method more persuasive, but did note that audience members
found the pattern more organized than other methods
(Micciche, Pryor, & Butler, 2000). We wanted to add this
sidenote because we don't want you to think that Monroe's
motivated sequence is a kind of magic persuasive bullet; the
research simply doesn't support this notion. At the same time,
research does support that organized messages are perceived
as more persuasive as a whole, so using Monroe's motivated
sequence to think through one's persuasive argument could
still be very beneficial.

   Table 16.1 lists the basic steps of Monroe's motivated
sequence and the subsequent reaction a speaker desires from
his or her audience.

Attention

The first step in Monroe's motivated sequence is the attention
step, in which a speaker attempts to get the audience's
attention. To gain an audience's attention, we recommend that
you think through three specific parts of the attention step.
First, you need to have a strong attention-getting device. As
previously discussed in Chapter 8 "Introductions Matter:
How to Begin a Speech Effectively", a strong attention getter
at the beginning of your speech is very important. Second, you
need to make sure you introduce your topic clearly. If your
audience doesn't know what your topic is quickly, they are
976 | 16.3: ORGANIZING PERSUASIVE SPEECHES

more likely to stop listening. Lastly, you need to explain to
your audience why they should care about your topic.

Needs

In the need step of Monroe's motivated sequence, the speaker
establishes that there is a specific need or problem. In Monroe's
conceptualization of need, he talks about four specific parts of
the need: statement, illustration, ramification, and pointing.
First, a speaker needs to give a clear and concise statement of
the problem. This part of a speech should be crystal clear for
an audience. Second, the speaker needs to provide one or more
examples to illustrate the need. The illustration is an attempt
to make the problem concrete for the audience. Next, a speaker
needs to provide some kind of evidence (e.g., statistics,
examples, testimony, narratives, definitions, analogies) that
shows the ramifications or consequences of the problem.
Lastly, a speaker needs to point to the audience and show
exactly how the problem relates to them personally.

Satisfaction

In the third step of Monroe's motivated sequence, the
satisfaction step, the speaker sets out to satisfy the need or solve
the problem. Within this step, Monroe (1935) proposed a five-
step plan for satisfying a need:
                          16.3: ORGANIZING PERSUASIVE SPEECHES | 977

   Statement
   Explanation
   Theoretical demonstration
   Reference to practical experience
   Meeting objections

First, you need to clearly state the attitude, value, belief, or
action you want your audience to accept. The purpose of this
statement is to clearly tell your audience what your ultimate
goal is.

   Second, you want to make sure that you clearly explain to
your audience why they should accept the attitude, value,
belief, or action you proposed. Just telling your audience they
should do something isn't strong enough to actually get them
to change. Instead, you really need to provide a solid argument
for why they should accept your proposed solution.

   Third, you need to show how the solution you have
proposed meets the need or problem. Monroe calls this link
between your solution and the need a theoretical
demonstration because you cannot prove that your solution
will work. Instead, you theorize based on research and good
judgment that your solution will meet the need or solve the
problem.

   Fourth, to help with this theoretical demonstration, you
need to reference practical experience, which should include
examples demonstrating that your proposal has worked
978 | 16.3: ORGANIZING PERSUASIVE SPEECHES

elsewhere. Research, statistics, and expert testimony are all
great ways of referencing practical experience.

   Lastly, Monroe recommends that a speaker respond to
possible objections. As a persuasive speaker, one of your jobs is
to think through your speech and see what counterarguments
could be made against your speech and then rebut those
arguments within your speech. When you offer rebuttals for
arguments against your speech, it shows your audience that
you've done your homework and educated yourself about
multiple sides of the issue.

Visualization

The next step of Monroe's motivated sequence is the
visualization step, in which you ask the audience to visualize
a future where the need has been met or the problem solved.
In essence, the visualization stage is where a speaker can show
the audience why accepting a specific attitude, value, belief, or
behavior can positively affect the future. Not to be confused
with employing visual aids to strengthen your argument, the
visualization step helps people to picture the future. The more
concrete your visualization is, the easier it will be for your
audience to see the possible future and be persuaded by it. You
also need to make sure that you clearly show how accepting
your solution will directly benefit your audience.
16.3: ORGANIZING PERSUASIVE SPEECHES | 979

   According to Monroe,                       AI Insight
visualization can be conducted in
one of three ways: positive,          Audiences today

980 | 16.3: ORGANIZING PERSUASIVE SPEECHES

Action

The final step in Monroe's motivated sequence is the action
step, in which a speaker asks an audience to approve the
speaker's proposal. For understanding purposes, we break
action into two distinct parts: audience action and approval.
Audience action refers to direct physical behaviors a speaker
wants from an audience (e.g., flossing their teeth twice a day,
signing a petition, wearing seat belts). Approval, on the other
hand, involves an audience's consent or agreement with a
speaker's proposed attitude, value, or belief.

   When preparing an action step, it is important to make
sure that the action, whether audience action or approval, is
realistic for your audience. Asking your peers in a college
classroom to donate one thousand dollars to charity isn't
realistic. Asking your peers to donate one dollar is considerably
more realistic. In a persuasive speech based on Monroe's
motivated sequence, the action step will end with the speech's
concluding device. As discussed elsewhere in this text, you
need to make sure that you conclude in a vivid way so that
the speech ends on a high note and the audience has a sense of
energy as well as a sense of closure.

   Now that we've walked through Monroe's motivated
sequence, let's look at how you could use Monroe's motivated
sequence to outline a persuasive speech:
                   16.3: ORGANIZING PERSUASIVE SPEECHES | 981

Specific Purpose: To persuade my classroom peers
that the United States should have stronger laws
governing the use of for-profit medical experiments.

Main Points:

      Attention: Want to make nine thousand
        dollars for just three weeks of work lying
        around and not doing much? Then be a
        human guinea pig. Admittedly, you'll have to
        have a tube down your throat for most of
        those three weeks, but you'll earn three
        thousand dollars a week.

      Need: Every day, many uneducated and
        lower socioeconomic-status citizens are
        preyed on by medical and pharmaceutical
        companies for use in for-profit medical and
        drug experiments. Do you want one of your
        family members to fall prey to this evil
        scheme?

      Satisfaction: The United States should have
        stronger laws governing the use of for-profit
        medical experiments to ensure that
        uneducated and lower-socioeconomic-status
        citizens are protected.

      Visualization: If we enact tougher
982 | 16.3: ORGANIZING PERSUASIVE SPEECHES

             experiment oversight, we can ensure that
             medical and pharmaceutical research is
             conducted in a way that adheres to basic
             values of American decency. If we do not
             enact tougher experiment oversight, we could
             find ourselves in a world where the lines
             between research subject, guinea pig, and
             patient become increasingly blurred.
           Action: In order to prevent the atrocities
             associated with for-profit medical and
             pharmaceutical experiments, please sign this
             petition asking the US Department of Health
             and Human Services to pass stricter
             regulations on this predatory industry that is
             out of control.

This example shows how you can take a basic speech topic and
use Monroe's motivated sequence to clearly and easily outline
your speech efficiently and effectively.

   Table 16.2 "Monroe's Motivated Sequence Checklist" also
contains a simple checklist to help you make sure you hit all the
important components of Monroe's motivated sequence.

Problem-Cause-Solution

   Another format for organizing a persuasive speech is the
problem-cause-solution format. In this specific format, you
discuss what a problem is, what you believe is causing the
problem, and then what the solution should be to correct the
problem.

Specific Purpose: To persuade my classroom peers
that our campus should adopt a zero-tolerance
policy for hate speech.

Main Points:

      Demonstrate that there is distrust among
        different groups on campus that has led to
        unnecessary confrontations and violence.

      Show that the confrontations and violence are
        a result of hate speech that occurred prior to
        the events.
                         16.3: ORGANIZING PERSUASIVE SPEECHES | 985

           Explain how instituting a campus-wide zero-
             tolerance policy against hate speech could
             stop the unnecessary confrontations and
             violence.

In this speech, you want to persuade people to support a new
campus-wide policy calling for zero-tolerance of hate speech.
Once you have shown the problem, you then explain to your
audience that the cause of the unnecessary confrontations and
violence is prior incidents of hate speech. Lastly, you argue that
a campus-wide zero-tolerance policy could help prevent future
unnecessary confrontations and violence. Again, this method
of organizing a speech is as simple as its name: problem-cause-
solution.

Comparative Advantages

The final method for organizing a persuasive speech is called
the comparative advantages speech format. The goal of this
speech is to compare items side-by-side and show why one of
them is more advantageous than the other. For example, let's
say that you're giving a speech on which smartphone is better:
Google Pixel 9 or iPhone 16. Here's how you could organize
this speech:
986 | 16.3: ORGANIZING PERSUASIVE SPEECHES

     Specific Purpose: To persuade my audience that the
     Google Pixel 9 is a better choice than the iPhone 16
     for customers looking into purchasing a new phone
     of a similar price.
     Main Points:

           The Google Pixel 9 has 12GB of RAM, a
             significantly larger memory than iPhone 16's
             8GB.

           The Google Pixel 9 comes with many AI
             integration features compared to iPhone 16's
             limited AI features yet to be released.

           The Google Pixel 9 is equipped with a 48MP
             ultra-wide camera, whereas the iPhone 16 has
             a 12MP ultra-wide camera.

As you can see from this speech's organization, the simple goal
of this speech is to show why one thing has more positives
than something else. Obviously, when you are demonstrating
comparative advantages, the items you are comparing need to
be functional equivalents--or, as the saying goes, you cannot
compare apples to oranges.

    Beyond the Podium Insight

The structure you choose signals how you see
the problem and your audience.
Problem-cause-solution frames you as a
diagnostician. Comparative advantages frames
you as a guide. Monroe frames you as a

not just organizational.

16.4: CONCLUSION:
PERSUASIVE SPEAKING

   Qi Dunsworth

Persuasion is one of the most powerful tools you will develop
as a speaker. It is also one of the most important to use
ethically. In this chapter, you explored persuasion as an
attempt to influence attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors
while still honoring your audience's freedom to choose. You
examined why persuasion matters in a world saturated with
messages competing for your attention and learned that being
"persuasively literate" helps you both construct stronger
arguments and resist manipulative ones. You also encountered
three key theories: social judgment theory, cognitive
dissonance theory, and the elaboration likelihood model.
Theses theories explain how and why audiences are persuaded,
giving you a roadmap for crafting messages that your listeners
are more likely to seriously consider.

   You then explored four common types of persuasive claims:
definitional, factual, policy, and value. Each one shapes the
structure and purpose of a persuasive speech. Policy claims, in
particular, highlighted the difference between winning passive
agreement and prompting immediate action, reminding you
                        16.4: CONCLUSION: PERSUASIVE SPEAKING | 989

that sometimes the goal is to change how people think, and
other times it is to change what they do. Finally, you learned
three organizational patterns. Monroe's motivated sequence,
problem-cause-solution, and comparative advantages can
help you translate theory into practice by arranging your ideas
in ways that are clear, compelling, and audience-centered.

   Beyond the podium, these skills prepare you to navigate
everyday persuasion in workplaces, communities, and digital
spaces, from evaluating a viral post to advocating for policy
change on your campus.

            Key Takeaways

           Persuasion is an intentional attempt to
             influence beliefs, attitudes, values, or behavior
             while allowing audiences the freedom to
             choose.

           Studying persuasion helps us recognize
             persuasive attempts, become more effective
             persuaders, and better understand the world
             around us.

           Social judgment theory explains that the
             audience responds to persuasive messages on
             a continuum - the latitude of judgments, from
             acceptance, noncommitment, or rejection.
990 | 16.4: CONCLUSION: PERSUASIVE SPEAKING

           Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that
             when conditions are right, people are
             motivated to reduce the discomfort caused by
             holding conflicting ideas.

           The elaboration likelihood model asserts that
             engaging with high elaboration and
             processing persuasive messages through the
             central route leads to longer-lasting attitude
             or behavioral changes than processing the
             same information through the peripheral
             route.

           There are four types of persuasive claims:
             definition (what something is), factual
             (whether something is true), policy (what
             should be done to solve a problem), and value
             (judgments of good/bad or right/wrong).

           Effective persuasive strategies vary with the
             type of claim. Policy claims seek either passive
             agreement (accepting a policy only) or
             immediate action (prompting specific
             behaviors).

           The three common organizational patterns for
             persuasive speeches are: Monroe's motivated
             sequence, problem-cause-solution, and
             comparative advantage.
                         16.4: CONCLUSION: PERSUASIVE SPEAKING | 991

           Monroe's motivated sequence uses five
             stages--attention, need, satisfaction,
             visualization, and action--to guide audiences
             through an affective journey of persuasion.

           The problem-cause-solution pattern explains
             an issue, identifies its causes, and proposes a
             solution.

           The comparative advantage pattern compares
             options and demonstrates why one is
             superior to the others.

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand the purpose of entertaining
      speeches.

 2. Explain the four ingredients of a good entertaining
      speech.

In broad terms, an entertaining speech is a speech designed to
captivate an audience's attention and regale or amuse them
while delivering a message. Like more traditional informative
or persuasive speeches, entertaining speeches should
communicate a clear message, but the manner of speaking
used in an entertaining speech is typically different.
Entertaining speeches are often delivered on special occasions
(e.g., a toast at a wedding, an acceptance speech at an awards
banquet, a motivational speech at a conference), which is why
they are sometimes referred to as special-occasion speeches.
However, they can also be given on more mundane occasions,
996 | 17.0: UNDERSTANDING SPEECHES TO ENTERTAIN

where their purpose is primarily to amuse audience members

or arouse them emotionally in some way. Remember, when

we use the word "entertain," we are referring not just to

humor but also to drama. The goal of an entertaining speech

is to stir an audience's emotions while delivering a message.

You will probably be called upon to deliver speeches to

entertain more than any other type of speech. Remember that

purposes of speeches overlap, and thus speeches to entertain

contain elements of informing and persuading. Often you will

be speaking beyond the podium, called upon to give brief

remarks celebrating a person, marking an occasion, or

highlighting an accomplishment. The hallmarks of speeches

to entertain, highlighting values through praise and using

celebratory language including stylistic devices, will serve you

well on said occasions.

                  ingredients:  preparation,

                  adaptation to the occasion,

adaptation to the audience, and mindfulness about the time.

Be Prepared

First, and foremost, the biggest mistake you can make when
standing to deliver an entertaining speech is to underprepare
or simply not prepare at all. We've stressed the need for
preparation throughout this text, so just because you're giving
a wedding toast or a eulogy doesn't mean you shouldn't think
through the speech before you stand up and speak out. If the
situation is impromptu, even jotting some basic notes on a
napkin is better than not having any plan for what you are
going to say. Remember, when you get anxious, as it inevitably
happens in front of an audience, your brain doesn't function
               17.0: UNDERSTANDING SPEECHES TO ENTERTAIN | 999

as well as when you are having a relaxed conversation with
friends. In fact, it is helpful to view speechmaking as a formal
conversation. This characterization emphasizes the need for
oral style and the helpfulness of selecting a few audience
members to focus on when delivering your speech. Having
too many notes, writing out the speech word for word, leads
to poor delivery through minimal eye contact, racing through
the speech, and failing to adapt extemporaneously if needed.
Concurrently, having too few notes leads to poor organization,
not emphasizing key points, and forgetting information. Note
that even in a manuscript speech, as is often the case with
speeches to entertain, you should use oral, not written, style
and insert pauses to emphasize key points and establish eye
contact.

Part of the speaker's job is to ensure the listener remembers
what was said. The audience remembers your use of stylistic
devices, also known as figures of speech. The following table
provides examples of useful stylistic devices that you may want
to use in your speeches to entertain.

Stylistic devices--like metaphor, alliteration, or
antithesis--add sparkle to entertaining speeches. This
challenge helps you evaluate and refine AI-generated examples.

Wrap Up: As you saw, AI can generate devices, but they're
often clich. Beyond the podium, originality and
authenticity are what make stylistic choices resonate.

   Manuscript speeches require revision. When writing,
start from an outline with main points and intended
support. In a speech to entertain the most effective support
is usually examples and testimony. Once you have this first
draft, rewrite to eliminate unnecessary words (clutter) and
add stylistic devices.

   It is helpful to keep in mind what each stylistic device
is especially good for. For example, a series of examples
(cumulation) can highlight a specific value. Negation is
excellent for highlighting what something is not and
therefore calling attention to opposing qualities. Note that
the use of stylistic devices often combines more than one.
Series and repetition and parallelism are often used in
combination with other devices. Note also that it is critical
that stylistic devices bring new perspectives. Using stylistic
devices that are overused, in other words cliches or trite
expressions, diminishes your effectiveness as a speaker. It
is characteristic of a speaker's style to use certain stylistic
              17.0: UNDERSTANDING SPEECHES TO ENTERTAIN | 1005

devices. At the same time, speakers should take care not to
overuse certain devices. Too much alliteration, for example,
will turn your speech into a tongue twister.

Be Adaptive to the Occasion

Not all content is appropriate for all occasions. If you are asked
to give a speech commemorating Holocaust Remembrance
Day, then obviously using humor and telling jokes wouldn't
be appropriate. But some decisions about adapting to the
occasion are less obvious. Consider the following examples:

   You are the maid of honor giving a toast at the wedding
      of your sister.

   You are receiving a Most Valuable Player award in your
      favorite sport.

   You are an after-dinner speaker addressing a business
      with declining sales.

   You are an alumni speaking at graduation to a campus
      scheduled to close.

How might you adapt your message and speaking style to
successfully entertain these various audiences?
Remember that being a competent speaker is about being
both personally effective and socially appropriate. Different
occasions will call for different levels of social appropriateness.
One of the biggest mistakes entertaining speakers can make is
1006 | 17.0: UNDERSTANDING SPEECHES TO ENTERTAIN

to deliver one generic speech to different groups without
adapting the speech to the specific occasion. In fact,
professional speakers always make sure that their speeches are
tailored for different occasions by getting information about
the occasion from their hosts. When we tailor speeches for
special occasions, people are more likely to remember those
speeches than if we give a generic speech. This mistake is often
evident at memorials, with representatives of the church
failing to note the personal characteristics of the deceased.

Be Adaptive to Your Audience

Once again, we cannot stress the importance of audience
adaptation enough in this text. Different audiences will
respond differently to speech material, so the more you know
about your audience the more likely you'll succeed in your
speech. Graduation speakers often make two mistakes in their
failure to adapt: first, focusing on themselves and touting their
accomplishments to the neglect of their immediate audience;
and second, relying on formulaic tropes including roads less
traveled and mountains yet to climb.

Be Mindful of the Time

The last major consideration for delivering entertaining
speeches successfully is to be mindful of your time. Different
              17.0: UNDERSTANDING SPEECHES TO ENTERTAIN | 1007

entertaining speech situations have their own conventions and
rules with regard to time. Acceptance speeches and toasts, for
example, should be relatively short (typically under five
minutes). A speech of introduction should be extremely
brief--just long enough to tell the audience what they need
to know about the person being introduced in a style that
prepares them to appreciate that person's remarks. In contrast,
commencement speeches and speeches to commemorate
events can run ten to twenty minutes in length.
It's also important to recognize that audiences on different
occasions will expect speeches of various lengths. For example,
although it's true that graduation commencement speakers
generally speak for ten to twenty minutes, the closer that
speaker heads toward twenty minutes the more fidgety the
audience becomes. To hold the audience's attention and fulfill
the goal of entertaining, a commencement speaker would do
well to make the closing minutes of the speech the most
engaging and inspiring portion of the speech. If you're not
sure about the expected time frame for a speech, either ask the
person who has invited you to speak or do some quick
research to see what the average speech times in the given
context tend to be.

Learning Objectives

 1. Identify the different types of ceremonial
      speaking.

 2. Describe the different types of inspirational speaking.

Many entertaining speeches fall under the category of special-
occasion speeches. All the speeches in this category are given
to mark the significance of particular events. Common events
include weddings, bar mitzvahs, awards ceremonies, funerals,
and political ceremonies There are two groups of special
occasion speeches: ceremonial speaking and inspirational
speaking.

Ceremonial Speaking

Ceremonial speeches are speeches given during a ceremony or
a ritual marked by observance of formality or etiquette. These
ceremonies tend to be very special for people, heightening the
                                  17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES | 1009

importance of delivering a meaningful speech. Let's examine
each of the eight types of ceremonial speaking: introductions,
presentations, acceptances, dedications, toasts, roasts, eulogies,
and farewells.

Speeches of Introduction

The first type of speech is the speech of introduction, which is
a short speech given by the host of a ceremony that introduces
another speaker. Few things are worse than when the
introducer of a speaker stands up and says, "This is Joe Smith,
he's going to talk about stress." While we did learn the
speaker's name and the topic, the introduction falls flat.
Audiences won't be the least bit excited about listening to Joe's
speech.

   Just like any other speech, a speech of introduction should
be a complete speech and have a clear introduction, body, and
conclusion--and you should do it all in under two minutes.
This brings up another "few things are worse" scenario: an
introductory speaker who rambles on for too long or who
talks about himself or herself instead of focusing on the person
being introduced.

   For an introduction, think of a hook that will make your
audience interested in the upcoming speaker. Did you read
a news article related to the speaker's topic? Have you been
impressed by a presentation you've heard the speaker give in
the past? You need to find something that can grab the
1010 | 17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES

audience's attention and make them excited about hearing the
main speaker.

   The body of your introductory speech should be devoted to
telling the audience about the speaker's topic, why the speaker
is qualified, and why the audience should listen (notice we
now have our three body points). First, tell your audience in
general terms about the overarching topic of the speech. Most
of the time as an introducer, you'll only have a speech title and
maybe a paragraph of information to help guide this part of
your speech. That's all right. You don't need to know all the
ins and outs of the main speaker's speech; you just need to
know enough to whet the audience's appetite. Next, you need
to tell the audience why the speaker is a credible speaker on the
topic. Has the speaker written books or articles on the subject?
Has the speaker had special life events that make him or her
qualified? Lastly, you need to briefly explain to the audience
why they should care about the upcoming speech.

   The final part of a good introduction is the conclusion,
which is generally designed to welcome the speaker to the
lectern. Many introducers will conclude by saying something
like, "I am looking forward to hearing how Joe Smith's advice
and wisdom can help all of us today, so please join me in
welcoming Mr. Joe Smith." We've known some presenters
who will even add a notation to their notes to "start clapping"
and "shake speakers hand" or "give speaker a hug" depending
on the circumstances of the speech.
                                   17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES | 1011

   Now that we've walked through the basic parts of an
introductory speech, let's see one outlined:

     Specific Purpose: To entertain the audience while
     preparing them for Janice Wright's speech on rituals.
     Introduction: Mention some common rituals
     people in the United States engage in (Christmas,
     sporting events, legal proceedings).
     Main Points:

           Explain that the topic was selected because
             understanding how cultures use ritual is an
             important part of understanding what it
             means to be human.

           Janice Wright is a cultural anthropologist who
             studies the impact that everyday rituals have
             on communities.

           All of us engage in rituals, and we often don't
             take the time to determine how these rituals
             were started and how they impact our daily
             routines.

     Conclusion: I had the opportunity to listen to Dr.
     Wright at the regional conference in Springfield last
     month, and I am excited that I get to share her with
     all of you tonight. Please join me in welcoming Dr.
1012 | 17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES

     Wright (start clapping, shake speaker's hand, exit
     stage).

Speeches of Presentation

The second type of common ceremonial speech is the speech
of presentation. A speech of presentation is a brief speech
given to accompany a prize or honor. Speeches of presentation
can be as simple as saying, "This year's recipient of the
Schuman Public Speaking prize is Wilhelmina Jeffers," or
could last up to five minutes as the speaker explains why the
honoree was chosen for the award.

   When preparing a speech of presentation, it's always
important to ask how long the speech should be. Once you
know the time limit, then you can set out to create the speech
itself. First, you should explain what the award or honor is and
why the presentation is important. Second, you can explain
what the recipient has accomplished in order for the award
to be bestowed. Did the person win a race? Did the person
write an important piece of literature? Did the person mediate
conflict? Whatever the recipient has done, you need to clearly
highlight his or her work. Lastly, if the race or competition was
conducted in a public forum and numerous people didn't win,
you may want to recognize those people for their efforts as well.
                                  17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES | 1013

While you don't want to steal the show away from winner, you
may want to highlight the work of the other competitors or
nominees.

Speeches of Acceptance

The complement to a speech of presentation is the speech
of acceptance. The speech of acceptance is a speech given by
the recipient of a prize or honor. There are three typical
components of a speech of acceptance: thank the givers of the
award or honor, thank those who helped you achieve your
goal, and put the award or honor into perspective. First, you
want to thank the people who have given you the award or
honor and possibly those who voted for you. We see this done
every year during the Oscars, "First, I'd like to thank the
academy and all the academy voters." Second, you want to give
credit to those who helped you achieve the award or honor.
No person accomplishes things in life on his or her own. We all
have families and friends and colleagues who support us and
help us achieve what we do in life, and a speech of acceptance
is a great time to graciously recognize those individuals. Lastly,
put the award in perspective. Tell the people listening to your
speech why the award is meaningful to you.
1014 | 17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES

Speeches of Dedication

The fourth ceremonial speech is the speech of dedication. A
speech of dedication is delivered when a new store opens, a
building is named after someone, a plaque is placed on a wall,
a new library is completed, and so on. These speeches are
designed to highlight the importance of the project and
possibly those to whom the project has been dedicated. Maybe
your great-uncle has died and left your college a significant
amount of money, so the college has decided to rename one of
the dorms after your great-uncle. In this case, you may be asked
to speak at the dedication.

   When preparing the speech of dedication, start by
explaining how you are involved in the dedication. If the
person to whom the dedication is being made is a relative, note
the relationship. Second, you want to explain what is being
dedicated. If the dedication is a new building or a preexisting
building, you want to explain what is being dedicated and the
importance of the structure. You should then explain who was
involved in the project. If the project is a new structure, talk
about the people who built the structure or designed it. If the
project is a preexisting structure, talk about the people who
put together and decided on the dedication. Lastly, explain
why the structure is important for the community where it's
located. If the dedication is for a new store, talk about how the
store will bring in new jobs and new shopping opportunities.
If the dedication is for a new wing of a hospital, talk about how
                                  17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES | 1015

patients will be served and the advances in medicine the new
wing will provide for the community.

Toasts

At one time or another, almost everyone is going to be asked

to deliver a toast. A toast is a speech designed to congratulate,

appreciate, or remember. First, toasts can be delivered for the

purpose of congratulating someone for an honor, a new job,

or getting married. You can also toast someone to show your

appreciation for something they've done. Lastly, we toast

people to remember them and what they have accomplished.

When preparing a toast, the

first goal is always to keep your

remarks brief. Toasts are generally       Beyond the
given during the middle of some
kind of festivities (e.g., wedding,  Podium Insight
retirement party, farewell party),
and you don't want your toast to     A joke that
take away from those festivities     unites can build
for too long. Second, the goal of a  trust, but a joke
toast is to focus attention on the   that divides can
person or persons being              close off
toasted--not on the speaker. As      dialogue.
such, while you are speaking you     Beyond the
need to focus your attention on      podium,
                                     speakers must

                  physically looking at them and by

consider whether  keeping your message about
their humor       them. You should also avoid any
uplifts or        inside jokes between you and the
alienates.        people being toasted because
                  toasts are public and should be

                  accessible for everyone who hears

                  them. This prohibition against

inside jokes applies to all public speeches, and it is wise to

remember to you use caution when using all forms of humor.

Safe humor, aka "Dad" jokes, is fine. Ribald humor is not.

To conclude a toast, simply say something like, "Please

join me in recognizing Joan for her achievement" and lift

your glass. When you lift your glass, this will signal to

others to do the same and then you can all take a drink,

which is the end of your speech.

Humor can connect or divide. Ethical speakers choose

strategies that include, uplift, and respect their audience.

Roasts

The roast speech is a very interesting and peculiar speech
because it is designed to both praise and good-naturedly insult
a person being honored. Generally, roasts are given at the
conclusion of a banquet in honor of someone's life
achievements. The television station Comedy Central has
been conducting roasts of various celebrities for a few years.

   A good example is Stephen Colbert's roast of President
George W. Bush, which you can view online. In this clip, you'll
notice that the humor doesn't pull any punches. The goal of
the roast is to both praise and insult in a good-natured manner.
You'll also see that the roaster, in this case Stephen Colbert, is
standing behind a lectern while the roastee, President George
W. Bush, is clearly on display for the audience to see, and
periodically you'll see the camera pan to President Bush to take
in his reactions. Half the fun of a good roast is watching the
roastee's reactions during the roast, so it's important to have
the roastee clearly visible by the audience.

   How does one prepare a roast? First, you want to really
think about the person who is being roasted. Do they have
any strange habits or amusing stories in their past that you can
discuss? When you think through these things you want to
make sure that you cross anything off your list that is truly
1020 | 17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES

private information or will really hurt the person. The goal of
a roast is to poke at them, not massacre them. Second, when
selecting which aspects to poke fun at, you need to make sure
that the items you choose are widely known by your audience.
Roasts work when the majority of people in the audience can
relate to the jokes being made. If you have an inside joke with
the roastee, bringing it up during roast may be great fun for the
two of you, but it will leave your audience unimpressed. Lastly,
end on a positive note. While the jokes are definitely the fun
part of a roast, you should leave the roastee knowing that you
truly do care about and appreciate the person.

Eulogies

A eulogy is a speech given in honor of someone who has died.
(Don't confuse "eulogy" with "elegy," a poem or song of
mourning.) Unless you are a minister, priest, rabbi, imam, or
other form of religious leader, you'll probably not deliver too
many eulogies in your lifetime. However, when the time comes
to deliver a eulogy, it's good to know what you're doing and
to adequately prepare your remarks. Then-Senator Barack
Obama's eulogy at the funeral of civil rights activist Rosa Parks
in November of 2005 is an example of a well-written eulogy,
delivered well (you can find it online on YouTube). In this
eulogy, Senator Obama emphasizes Rosa Parks' importance
and legacy in American history.

   When preparing a eulogy, first you need to know as much
                                  17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES | 1021

information about the deceased as possible. The more
information you have about the person, the more personal
you can make the eulogy. While you can rely on your own
information if you were close to the deceased, it is always a
good idea to ask friends and relatives of the deceased for their
memories, as these may add important facets that may not
have occurred to you. Of course, if you were not very close
to the deceased, you will need to ask friends and family for
information. Second, although eulogies are delivered on the
serious and sad occasion of a funeral or memorial service for
the deceased, it is very helpful to look for at least one point to
be lighter or humorous. In some cultures, in fact, the friends
and family attending the funeral will expect the eulogy to be
entertaining and amusing. While eulogies are not roasts, one
goal of the humor or lighter aspects of a eulogy is to relieve the
tension that is created by the serious nature of the occasion.
Lastly, remember to tell the deceased's story. Tell the audience
about who this person was and what the person stood for
in life. The more personal you can make a eulogy, the more
touching it will be for the deceased's friends and families. The
eulogy should remind the audience to celebrate the person's
life as well as mourn their death.

   Excellent eulogies you can view online and read their
manuscripts include Ted Kennedy Jr.'s eulogy of his father,
Senator Ted Kennedy, Reagan's eulogy of the Challenger
astronauts, and Princess Diana's eulogy delivered by her
brother, Charles Spencer. There are two TED talks that
1022 | 17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES

highlight the significance and functions of eulogies: Andrea
Driessen's "Eulogies for the Living," and Susan Ann Koenig's
"The Energy of Eulogy."

Speeches of Farewell

A speech of farewell allows someone to say good-bye to one
part of his or her life as he or she is moving on to the next part
of life. Maybe you've accepted a new job or you're graduating
from college and entering the workforce. Whatever the case
may be, periods of transition are often marked by speeches
of farewell. One example is Derek Jeter's 2008 speech saying
farewell to Yankee Stadium, built in 1923, before the New
York Yankees moved to the new stadium that opened in 2009.
In this speech, Derek Jeter is not only saying good-bye to
Yankee Stadium but also thanking the fans for their continued
support.

   When preparing a speech of farewell, the goal should be to
thank the people in your current position and let them know
how much you appreciate them. In Derek Jeter's speech, he
starts by talking about the history of the 1923 Yankee Stadium
and then thanks the fans for their support. Second, you want
to express to your audience how much the experience has
meant to you. A farewell speech is a time to commemorate and
think about the positive experiences you've had. As such, you
should avoid negativity during this speech. Lastly, you want to
make sure that you end on a high note. Derek Jeter concludes
                                  17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES | 1023

his speech by saying, "On behalf of this entire organization, we
just want to take this moment to salute you, the greatest fans
in the world!" at which point Jeter and the other players take
off their ball caps and hold them up toward the audience.

Inspirational Speaking

The goal of an inspirational speech is to elicit or arouse an
emotional state within an audience. In Section 18.2.1
"Ceremonial Speaking", we looked at ceremonial speeches.
Although some inspirational speeches are sometimes tied to
ceremonial occasions, there are also other speaking contexts
that call for inspirational speeches. For our purposes, we are
going to look at two types of inspirational speeches: speeches
to ensure goodwill and speeches for commencements.

Speeches to Ensure Goodwill

Goodwill is an intangible asset that concerns the reputation of
an individual or organization. Speeches of goodwill are often
given in an attempt to get audience members to view the
person or organization more favorably. Although speeches of
goodwill are clearly persuasive, they try not to be obvious
about the persuasive intent and are often delivered as
information-giving speeches that focus on an individual or
organization's positive attributes. There are three basic types
1024 | 17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES

of speeches of goodwill: public relations, justification, and
apology.

Speeches for Public Relations

In a public relations speech, the speaker is speaking to enhance
one's own image or the image of his or her organization. You
can almost think of these speeches as cheerleading speeches
because the ultimate goal is to get people to like the speaker
and what he or she represents. It is imperative to balance the
public interest and the private interest in these situations. If
your organization has truly erred, an apology is necessary and
should be accompanied by corrective actions. As an additional
critical point, the head of an organization should address the
situation and often visit the site. Presidents, for example, are
expected to address the nation during crises and visit the scene.
One such situation is the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
The CEO of British Petroleum spoke to reporters about his
organization's actions, emphasizing their efforts to correct the
problem.

Speeches of Justification

The second common speech of goodwill is the speech of
justification, which is given when someone attempts to defend
why certain actions were taken or will be taken. In these
                                  17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES | 1025

speeches, speakers have already enacted (or decided to enact)
some kind of behavior and are now attempting to justify the
behavior's appropriateness. Presidential speeches often
illustrate this type of speech. For example, President Bill
Clinton discussed his decision to bomb key Iraqi targets after
uncovering a plot to assassinate former President George H.
W. Bush and outlined his reasons for bombing Iraq to the
American people and the world. Sincerity is key; rationalizing
should be avoided.

Speeches of Apology

The final speech of goodwill is the speech of apology. Whether
our more ever-present media exposes more faux-pas or people
are truly behaving more reprehensibly, these speeches have
become more commonplace. In fact, the speech of apology has
quickly become fodder for humor as well. One such speech
was delivered by professional golfer Tiger Woods.

   When you need to make an apology speech, there are three
elements that you need to include: be honest and take
responsibility, say you're sorry, and offer restitution. First, a
speaker needs to be honest and admit to doing something
wrong. The worst apology speeches are those in which the
individual tries to sidestep the wrongdoing. Even if you believe
you didn't do anything wrong, it is often best to take
responsibility from a public perception perspective. Second,
say that you are sorry. People need to know that you are
1026 | 17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES

remorseful. One of the problems many experts saw with Tiger
Woods's speech is that he didn't seem remorseful. While the
words coming out of his mouth are appropriate, he looks like
a robot forced to read from a manuscript written by his press
agent. Remember that nonverbal communication is the
primary channel for emotions, and your facial expressions and
tone of voice need to match the substance of your speech.
Lastly, you need to offer restitution. Restitution can come in
the form of correcting your mistakes or a promise not to
engage in such behavior in the future. People in society are very
willing to forgive and forget when they are asked.

Speeches for Commencements

The second type of inspirational speech is the speech of
commencement, which is designed to recognize and celebrate
the achievements of a graduating class. Nearly all of us have sat
through commencement speeches and you've heard good ones
and bad ones. The good ones convey a meaningful message
for the graduates and for the audience, and the bad ones are
trite and commonplace or fail to address the occasion. One
well-thought-out commencement speech was given by famed
Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling at Harvard University in
2008, having the perfect balance of humor and inspiration
which are two of the main ingredients of a great
commencement speech. Henry Winkler's Commencement
speech at Georgetown in 2025 is a second great example.
                                  17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES | 1027

   If you're ever asked to deliver a commencement speech,
there are some key points to think through when deciding on
your speech's content.

   If there is a specific theme for the graduation, make sure that
your commencement speech addresses that theme. If there is
no specific theme, come up with one for your speech. Some
common commencement speech themes are commitment,
competitiveness, competence, confidence, decision making,
discipline, ethics, failure (and overcoming failure), faith,
generosity, integrity, involvement, leadership, learning,
persistence, personal improvement, professionalism, reality,
responsibility, and self-respect. The theme of Winkler's
commencement address is "All Things are Possible."

   Talk about your life and how graduates can learn from your
experiences to avoid pitfalls or take advantage of life. How can
your life inspire graduates in their future endeavors?

   Make the speech humorous. Commencement speeches
should be entertaining and make the audience laugh.

   Be brief! Nothing is more painful than a commencement
speaker who drones on and on. Remember, the graduates are
there to get their diplomas; their families are there to watch the
graduates walk across the stage.

   Remember, while you may be the speaker, you've been
asked to impart wisdom and advice for the people graduating
and moving on with their lives, so keep it focused on them.

   Place the commencement speech into the broader context
of the graduates' lives. Show the graduates how the advice and
1028 | 17.1: SPECIAL-OCCASION SPEECHES

wisdom you are offering can be used to make their own lives
better.

   Remember to avoid trite themes and overused expressions.
A speech is effective to the extent that it stimulates thought,
and thus it should present information from a fresh
perspective.

   Overall, it's important to make sure that you have fun when
delivering a commencement speech. Remember, it's a huge
honor and responsibility to be asked to deliver a
commencement speech, so take the time to really think
through and prepare your speech.

Learning Objectives

 1. Understand the purpose of keynote speeches in society.
 2. Explain the basic objective of an after-dinner speech.
 3. Describe the purpose and the types of motivational

      speeches.
 4. Assess the appropriateness and emotional resonance of

      AI-generated ceremonial speeches.

The last type of entertaining speech we will examine is the
keynote speech. A keynote speech is delivered to set the
underlying tone and summarize the core message of an event.
Keynotes are often given at the end of an event; there can
also be a number of keynote speeches delivered throughout
a longer event that lasts for several days. People who deliver
keynote speeches are typically experts in a given area who are
invited to speak at a conference, convention, banquet, or
meeting. Some keynote speakers will be represented by a
speaker's bureau, an agency that represents celebrity and
1030 | 17.2: KEYNOTE SPEAKING

professional speakers. One important organization for aspiring
keynote speakers is the National Speaker's Association. NSA
also publishes a widely respected magazine for professional
speakers called Speaker magazine, which can be accessed for
free from their website.

   In the world of professional public speaking, there are two
common types of keynotes: after-dinner speeches and
motivational speeches. Let's look at each of these unique
speeches.

After-Dinner Speaking

After-dinner speaking gets its name from the idea that these
speeches historically followed a meal. After-dinner speakers are
generally asked to speak because they have the ability both to
speak effectively and to make people laugh. First and foremost,
after-dinner speeches are speeches and not stand-up comedy
routines. All the basic conventions of public speaking
previously discussed in this text apply to after-dinner speeches,
but the overarching goal of these speeches is to be entertaining
and to create an atmosphere of amusement.

   After-dinner speaking is probably the hardest type of
speaking to do well because it is an entertaining speech that
depends on the successful delivery of humor. People train for
years to develop comic timing, or the verbal and nonverbal
delivery used to enhance the comedic value of a message. But
after-dinner speaking is difficult, not impossible. Here is the
                                                 17.2: KEYNOTE SPEAKING | 1031

method we recommend for developing a successful after-
dinner speech.

   First, use all that you have learned about informative or
persuasive speeches to prepare a real informative or persuasive
speech roughly two-thirds the length of what the final speech
will become. That is, if you're going to be giving a ten-minute
speech, then your "real" informative or persuasive speech
should be six or seven minutes in length.

   Next, go back through the speech and look for
opportunities to insert humorous remarks. Table 18.1 "Forms
of Verbal Humor" lists various forms of verbal humor that are
often used in the textual portion of a speech.

Each of these is a possible humor device that could be
implemented in a speech. Mark Twain's speech on his
seventieth birthday is a good example of an after-dinner speech
and can be readily found online.

   Once you've looked through your speech, examining places
for verbal humor, think about any physical humor or props
that would enhance your speech. Physical humor is great if you
can pull it off without being self-conscious. One of the biggest
mistakes any humorist makes is to become too aware of what
1034 | 17.2: KEYNOTE SPEAKING

his or her body is doing because it's then harder to be free and
funny. As for props, after-dinner speakers have been known to
use everything from oversize inflatable baseball bats to rubber
clown noses. The goal for a funny prop is that it adds to the
humor of the speech without distracting from its message.

   Last, and probably most important, try the humor out on
real, live people. This is important for three reasons.

   First, the success of humor depends heavily on delivery, and
especially timing in delivery. You will need practice to polish
your delivery so that your humor comes across. If you can't
make it through one of your jokes without cracking up, you
will need to either incorporate the self-crackup into your
delivery or forgo using that joke.

   Second, just because you find something unbelievably
funny in your head doesn't mean that it will make anyone
else laugh. Often, humor that we have written down on paper
just doesn't translate when orally presented. You may have a
humorous story that you love reading on paper but find that
it just seems to drone on once you start telling it out loud.
Furthermore, remember there is a difference between written
and verbal language, and this also translates to how humor is
interpreted.

   Third, you need to make sure the humor you choose will be
appropriate for a specific audience. What one audience finds
funny, another may find offensive. Humor is the double-edged
sword of public speaking. On one side, it is an amazing and
powerful speaking tool, but on the other side, few things will
                            17.2: KEYNOTE SPEAKING | 1035

alienate an audience more than offensive humor. If you're ever

uncertain about whether a piece of humor will offend your

audience, don't use it.

Motivational Speaking

The second common form of keynote speaking is motivational

speaking. A motivational speech is designed not only to make

an audience experience emotional arousal (fear, sadness, joy,

excitement) but also to motivate the audience to do something

with that emotional arousal. Whereas a traditional persuasive

speech may want listeners to purchase product X or agree with

ideology Y, a motivational speech helps to inspire people in a

broader fashion, often without a clearly articulated result in

mind. As such, motivational speaking is a highly specialized

form of persuasive speaking commonly delivered in schools,

businesses, religious, and club or group contexts. The

Toastmasters International Guide to Successful Speaking lists

four types of motivational speeches: hero, survivor, religious,

and success (Slutsky & Aun, 1997).

                               The hero speech is a

considered heroes or role models.

example you can find online is

cancer survivor Becky Olsen, who

travels the country talking with and motivating fellow

survivors to beat the odds.

The religious speech is fairly self-explanatory; it is designed

to incorporate religious ideals into a motivational package to

inspire an audience into thinking about or changing aspects of

their religious lives. One highly sought-after religious speaker

in the United States is Joel Osteen, head minister at Lakewood

Church in Houston, Texas. Often Osteen uses the theme of

finding and retaining joy in life. In addition, Osteen stresses
1038 | 17.2: KEYNOTE SPEAKING

the importance of learning how to take responsibility for one's
own life and letting others take responsibility for their lives.

   The final type of motivational speech is the success speech,
which is given by someone who has succeeded in some aspect
of life and is giving back by telling others how they too can be
successful. One such speaker is CEO of Xerox, Anne Mulcahy,
addressing students at Dartmouth College discussing the spirit
of entrepreneurship and leadership lessons.

Artificial Intelligence and
Speeches to Entertain

Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing tool that can be
of tremendous help to speakers. The key to using artificial
intelligence wisely is to recognize its legitimate uses and to
avoid unethical uses that are most often plagiarism. A speech
is effective for presenting information in a useful way. It is
the speaker's job to ensure that the audience remembers what
was said. Listening for broad themes buttressed by credible
support is the audience's task. The speaker must craft a speech
that engages the audience, inspires them, and is entertaining.
It is the speaker's message, information, and organization that
makes a speech their own. An interesting speaker has
something to say and says it in their own way. Like any tool,
artificial intelligence is only as good as the person who uses
it. Crafting precise, detailed prompts is the most important
element in wise use. Prompts reflect elements in the speech. In
                                                 17.2: KEYNOTE SPEAKING | 1039

a speech to entertain, the occasion, the subject of the speech,
themes and key points are all starting points for prompts.

     Here is an example of the product of AI with a
     prompt for a eulogy:

     Prompt: Write a four-minute eulogy honoring a
     grandfather, crafted with 20 figures of speech and
     emphasizing the values of intelligence, honesty, and
     independence:

            Today, we gather not in the shadow of
            sorrow, but in the light of a life well-
            lived--a life that burned bright like a
            lighthouse guiding ships through stormy
            seas. My grandfather was that
            lighthouse. He was our compass when
            the path grew dim, our steady hand
            when the world tilted.
            He was a man of intelligence--razor-
            sharp and deep-rooted, like an oak tree
            whose roots drank from the well of
            wisdom. Conversations with him were
1040 | 17.2: KEYNOTE SPEAKING

            not just exchanges of words; they were
            treasure hunts, where every story was a
            clue, every memory a map.

            His mind was a library of logic and
            laughter. He'd quote Shakespeare one
            moment and solve a crossword puzzle in
            ink the next. His intelligence wasn't loud
            or showy--it was the quiet fire that
            warmed the room, not the lightning bolt
            that demanded attention. (Simile,
            metaphor)

            But more than his mind, it was his
            honesty that etched itself into our hearts.
            He wore truth like a well-fitted
            coat--never too tight, never too loose,
            always just right. He spoke plainly, like
            the morning sun parting the fog. You
            never had to wonder where he stood; his
            word was as solid as bedrock. (Simile,
            personification)

            He didn't sugarcoat the truth, but neither
            did he serve it bitter. He was a craftsman
            of clarity, whittling down falsehoods with
            the chisel of integrity. When he said
                                 17.2: KEYNOTE SPEAKING | 1041

"yes," you could set your watch by it.
When he said "no," it meant the bridge
was out and you best find another way.
(Metaphor, alliteration)

Independence was the tune to which his
soul danced. He was a one-man
symphony, playing by his own score. Not
out of stubbornness, but out of strength.
Like a mountain that stands alone, he
didn't ask the wind for directions. He
forged his own trails, even if it meant
walking alone. (Simile, metaphor,
alliteration)

He taught us that true independence
isn't about walking away, but about
walking upright. He didn't lean--he led.
He didn't follow trends--he followed
truth. And in doing so, he taught us to
listen not to the noise of the crowd, but
to the whisper of conscience.
(Personification, parallelism)

My grandfather wasn't loud, but he
thundered with presence. He wasn't fast,
but he moved with purpose. He didn't
1042 | 17.2: KEYNOTE SPEAKING

            chase the spotlight, but somehow, it
            always found him. (Antithesis,
            metaphor)

            Even now, as we gather in the stillness,
            his voice echoes in the chambers of our
            memory. Like a well-written book, his
            chapters may be closed, but the story
            remains forever open in our hearts.
            (Simile, metaphor)

            In the book of life, some pages bend,
            some tear, but his were gold-
            edged--shining with wit, truth, and
            strength. He left behind no unfinished
            sentences, only lasting impressions.
            (Metaphor, imagery)

            So let us not say goodbye, but rather
            "until we meet again"--because a spirit
            like his doesn't vanish, it simply changes
            form, like the moon disappearing behind
            clouds only to shine again. (Euphemism,
            simile)

            He was our sage, our sentinel, our spark.
            And though today we mourn, we also
                                17.2: KEYNOTE SPEAKING | 1043

marvel--at the gift of knowing him, and
the legacy he leaves behind.
Thank you, Grandpa. For showing us that
the mind can be sharp, the heart can be
honest, and the soul can be free.

17.3: CONCLUSION:
UNDERSTANDING
SPEECHES TO
ENTERTAIN

   Delia Conti

Speaking to entertain is never "just for fun." It is a reminder
that audiences crave connection as much as they crave
information. Humor, story, and lighthearted moments are not
distractions from communication. They are part of its power.
Beyond the podium, entertaining speech builds trust, creates
shared experiences, and keeps meaning alive long after the
moment has passed.

   But entertainment also carries responsibility. A joke that
connects can affirm community; a story that uplifts can give
hope. At the same time, careless words can alienate or divide.
To speak with impact is to recognize that laughter and delight
are not trivial but instead are civic tools that shape how we see
ourselves and others.

   As we move forward, remember speaking to entertain is not
the end point. It is one more way to engage audiences with
purpose, building bridges of memory and belonging. In the
1050 | 17.3: CONCLUSION: UNDERSTANDING SPEECHES TO
ENTERTAIN

next chapter, we turn from laughter to persuasion, exploring
how speakers invite audiences not only to listen and enjoy, but
to believe, decide, and act.

          Key Takeaways

           Entertainment is purposeful. Humor and
             stories are not distractions but powerful
             rhetorical tools for creating shared meaning.

           Audiences remember emotion. Laughter
             and delight help messages linger long after
             facts fade.

           Ethics matter. Entertaining content should
             uplift and connect, not divide or manipulate.

           Digital spaces are stages. Podcasts,
             livestreams, and TikToks are also platforms
             where "speaking to entertain.

PEER REVIEW
STATEMENT

Beyond the Podium: AI, Speech, and Civic Engagement was
produced with support and funding from the Sally W. Kalin
Early Career Librarianship for Learning Innovations. A core
commitment of this project was ensuring the book meets high
standards of quality and serves the diverse needs of students.

   To support this goal, the book underwent a formal peer
review process involving 14 subject-matter experts, with each
chapter reviewed by two reviewers. The review process focused
on the intended audience and evaluated the accuracy,
relevance, and comprehensiveness of the content, as well as
the integration of AI literacy objectives. Feedback and
recommendations provided by reviewers were carefully
considered and incorporated by the chapter authors and
editorial team.

   The editors (Tiffany Petricini and Sherry Rice) and authors
(Erika Berlin, Delia Conti, Lee Ann Dickerson, Qi
Dunsworth, Janie Harden Fritz, Jacqueline M. Gianico,
Brooke Lyle, Rosemary Martinelli, Stephanie Morrow, Angela
Pettitt, Terri Stiles, and Jonathan Woodall) extend their sincere
appreciation to the reviewers for their time, expertise, and
commitment to this project. Peer review represents a
