This is a text that has been designed for you, the student. You may notice that the presentation
and style/tone of my writing is different than other textbooks you've run into. You've probably also
noticed that the price is different too! All of this is interrelated. Since I've had the total freedom to
design this text without the oversight of a publisher looking to make as much money as possible off
my work, I've been free to write the way I'd like and in the voice I'd like.

My goal with this text has been to provide you insights into what I see as the fundamental skill sets
you need in technical writing. For me, technical writing is almost a way of seeing the world. It isn't
based on specific concrete decisions that you always make the same way, but instead it is based on
having an approach to researching situations and responding to them as a writer that is concerned
with the usefulness and impact of the work they're doing.

This text is designed to give you the pieces you need to create your own approach to technical writ-
ing, and I wish you success in that goal!
                    A Note to Instructors

Hi there. Thank you for taking the time to consider this text for your course in technical writing. As
you'll see in the student section of this text, I've designed this material to be as student-centered as
possible, right down to the very conversational tone of the text. For you an instructor, it will probably
be useful to understand my goals behind the text.

In this text, I try to present technical writing as an approach to researching and carrying out writing
that centers on technical subject matter. As part of this, each and every chapter is devoted to helping
students understand that good technical writing is situationally-aware and context-driven. Technical
writing doesn't work off knowing the one true right way of doing things--there is no magic report
template out there that will always work. Instead, I've focused on offering students a series of ap-
proaches they can use to map out their situations and do research accordingly.

Because of this approach, the text try to dictate exact moves that much, especially when it comes
to particular genres like white papers and the like. This is entirely by design. Nothing specific that I
could write here would have any amount of a lifespan with a particular genre, so I've opted instead to
provide a research framework and some specific tips and tricks with each genre. For researching and
teaching a particular genre, I would recommend focusing on the method I suggest to research the
genre and then to build your class time around finding example texts and building your own image of
what the genre looks like.

Please understand as well that this textbook is the product of a very particular course and student
body at my own institution that simply doesn't look like the engineering-heavy group of students that
you might see at other institutions. This is not technical writing for engineers and engineers alone,
and it doesn't try to be.

When it comes to daily teaching, you may notice I don't have that many chapters. Each chapter is
fairly lengthy, and they are not intended to be covered in a single day. Instead, each chapter has major
chunks that can be assigned with suggested activities at the end of each major chunk. These activities
are provided to give you some direction in classroom exercises to help students internalize and make
use of the concepts covered in each section. You don't have to stop each class when a chunk of text
terminates with activities, but I've provided these spots to break up the chapters in ways that make
sense in my own mind.

As this is an open-access text, I hope to continue editing and growing the body of work here for some
time as my schedule allows. I am always open to suggestions and feedback on the text. If you'd like to
provide some, you can send emails to my email account for this book
@ opentechnicalwritingbook@gmail.com.

What is Technical Writing?
                                               Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

   What is Technical Writing?

       This is a textbook about technical writing. But, what is technical writing exactly? There are any num-
       ber of definitions of what exactly should or should not be technical writing, just like there are any
       number of definitions of what should or should not be just about anything that people care about.

       Some definitions are different because they are used by folks doing wildly different things. For exam-
       ple, what I consider running might be drastically different than what you consider running. For me,
       it's going 2-6 miles at a pace of around 12 minutes per mile. You might run considerably slower or
       faster, shorter or longer, meaning that your definition of running and my definition of running differ
       because we are simply doing things differently.

       Other definitions are different because the folks behind them have an agenda that they're looking to
       push. For example, some people will stick to their position that pineapple is not a legitimate pizza
       topping. They stick to that definition because it is meaningful to them. For them to win out and
       have their definition win out is to win widespread acceptance of their position that pineapple on a
       pizza is an abomination. (As your author, I have no strong feelings on the subject. Pizza can have a
       lot of toppings. However, crockpot pizza is not pizza and never will be. You have to draw the line
       somewhere).

       So, since definitions different wildly, our definition of technical writing either needs to be oddly
       specific to the type of work we're going to be doing in this textbook, or it needs to be fairly broad to
       encompass as many of technical writing's use cases as possible. Now, either direction is going to leave
       some folks feeling a bit disappointed in what we've come up with, but I think that the most pro-
       ductive approach is to define technical writing in a broad way that maximizes the types of work and
       people that can use the term productively. This textbook is after all being designed for a course that
       serves any number of majors, and it makes no sense for us to play favorites.

       Getting at Technical Writing

       Technical writing, as we will be defining it, is writing that conveys information that has to be accu-
       rate in order to be of use. This may seem like an overly broad approach to defining the subject, but
       bear with me and we'll tackle what exactly this means and how to unpack it, as well as some tradi-
       tional competing definitions of technical writing you may have heard of or may eventually encoun-
       ter.

       Let's start with an example to show how our definition can work. If I'm going to be baking a pizza
       crust recipe that you've shared with me, there are some things that simply have to be conveyed prop-
       erly or you'll end up with a terrible pizza. If I tell you to bake the pizza at 550 degrees for 10 min-
       utes, that is one thing. But, if you end up with a copy of the recipe that says to bake at 250 degrees
       for 10 minutes, you will not end up with my pizza at all. I doubt your pizza would even be edible.
       In this example, the technical information of how long and what temperature to bake the pizza was
       crucial. It could not be altered in any significant way without altering the outcome of the baking. It
       simply can't work without being accurate. In short, the recipe was technical writing.

       Going beyond our example, we can expect that almost any cooking recipe would also be technical

20
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

writing since you have to get things together as the recipe requests for the results to be what you're
expecting. Yes, you can alter things here or there (or make substitutions), but in doing so you are al-
tering the final outcome away from the expected one. You simply can't toss the recipe out the window
and expect it to work. In fact, you'll find that most folks that skillfully alter recipes are able to do so
because they understand what is happening in the original and understand what their modifications
are doing and how they are interacting with the original set of instructions and ingredients.
Now, before I go further, it should be pointed out that you can take our definition of technical
writing and think about things the wrong way. One common mistake that folks make with techni-
cal writing is to assume that since technical writing is about the finicky details that you simply need
to convey those details as plainly as possible and you're doing the best possible technical writing. In
their mind, you're going to be doing the best job when you simply give someone "the facts," and
nothing more. It is akin to packing something in a box and then sending it to someone else. You only
put "the facts" in the box, and when they open the box, all they get is "the facts."
Unfortunately, this idea is not only wrong-headed--it can cause us to be terrible technical writers.
The issue with a "just the facts" approach to technical writing is that the approach makes it seem that
the only thing that ever matters is the facts. You can simply package them up and send them along
to another person and as long as you managed to get those facts in there, everything is alright. The
problem is that this example breaks down whenever you start to question it in the slightest.
To explain what is wrong this mindset, we can actually use the same example from above with a few
tweaks. For one, the way a message is packaged impacts how we respond to it. Let's say that you
package up your facts in a box and send it to someone. If we take this example literally, then we need
to think about what the box looks like. Is it a plain brown box like this:
If it is a plain brown box, does that impact your way of thinking? Do you normally get a certain type

                     a plain box

of thing in a plain brown box? I actually do associate plain brown boxes with a particular vendor I

                                                                  21
                                               Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1
       use for one of my hobbies!
       If you get a box that is wrapped in pretty paper with a bow on it, what do you think about the con-
       tents? Do you expect to get a bill for $1250 from your last emergency room visit when you open that
       box? Probably not. And if you did get that, you'd likely be really upset and have trouble handling
       that information because the box was sending one message while the contents sent another. And
       you'd likely get kind of mad at whoever sent the box to you this way:
        (This is what happens when you get to write an open-access book but can't draw a bow to save your
       life)

                 A decorative box

       In the same way, the delivery mechanism of a message also impacts our perceptions. If we get a box
       that is wrapped up in a bow from a friend or relative, we expect that it is a present and likely take
       it gladly. If we're given the same box by someone we've never seen in our lives, it might not get the
       same reception. We might ask, "Who is this person? Why are they handing me this gift box?" We
       definitely wouldn't accept the box without some leeriness, and we might not trust whatever was in-
       side, if we even open it at all. The sender of a message matters as much as the packaging.
       Now, if we map these examples back onto technical writing, note that the same principles apply to
       "the facts." If you get a technical document from someone that you know and trust, you're likely
       going to treat those "facts" with more trust and confidence because you know the text comes from
       a reliable source. At the same time, if you get something from someone you don't trust, you may
       double-check all the information they've given you because you simply don't trust them. This can
       also apply to the way something is packaged. If you get a document that proclaims to be super-seri-

22
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

ous and the contents aren't, you may ignore what is included. At the same time, an official document
that looks overdone or fake may get discounted as junk! Both the sender and the way contents are
presented matter a great deal! (For example, awful box drawings like the one above may well get some
folks to discount open-access textbooks without reading them).

Before we move on to competing definitions of technical writing, I have one more point I want to
make, because even with our examples above it could be possible that you have a few misconceptions
about technical writing. In our examples below, we're always conveying "the facts," in our messages
or our boxes. And, in those examples, it would seem that no matter what we're still conveying "just
the facts" once we cut out all the extra cruft. The essential facts never change in those examples, but
when we do technical writing they very well can!

Think about it for a moment: do you explain how to use a new app the same way when you talk to a
friend and when you talk to an elderly person in your family? The answer is most likely no. There are
extra steps involved in one situation, and some steps are omitted entirely in the other. The "facts" of
the matter change depending on how well they're going to be understood. You can't simply say "this
is how it is" and let things end there with someone who is so wholly unprepared to understand your
instructions that they don't even know where to begin. You have to supplement things, add content,
and perhaps even alter the way you convey your points. You can't just rely on "the facts" as a stable
entity because you'll alter their contents depending on what your audience can understand and what
they know and don't know about a given situation.

With that cleared up, let's return to our definition of technical writing: it is writing and communica-
tion that conveys essential information that can't be changed without causing damage to the outcome
of using that information. But, we take that with the caveat that who shares that information, they
way they share that information, and who they share it to, all of these things will have an impact on
the final reception of the technical information. Technical writing then, is an act of translation. We
may have to alter a great many things so that our reader/recipient properly understands what we're
getting at, but we're still trying to get them to understand the same thing we started with. It just
may look a lot different after we've translated it for them, and they may treat it differently than they
would if someone else had shared it with them.

There is a fundamental shared value we're all working off of--we're not veering into total relativism
here. But, we're working with the understanding that what we know and how we use what we know
is colored by who we are and how we internalize information. For example, we can all operate with
the same cookie recipe, but depending on the person we cooked it with and the way they operated
their kitchen and the memories we associate with them, our own mental image of that recipe can be
much different than anyone else's. The same recipe may be Grandma's Secret Recipe, the recipe on
the back of the flour bag, and that recipe you found online. Same fundamental recipe, totally differ-
ent treatment of the recipe and use of it depending on your context and how you met the recipe.

As you maybe can tell, technical writing gets intense pretty fast--I mean, we're talking about cookies
and relativism in the first chapter...heavy stuff. But, that's what makes it so much fun to study and
practice--it isn't simple and it definitely isn't static!

Competing Technical Writings

                                                                  23
                                               Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

       At this point, I should note that the way we're defining technical writing may be different from other
       ways you've seen it defined or will see it defined. In my experience, our definition is perhaps overly
       broad compared to other versions of technical writing, but there is a reason for that broadness.

       Some folks like to say that technical writing is something that only belongs to technical fields like
       engineering or medicine. They might snort if you told them your grandmother's cookie recipe is
       technical writing just like their specs for a bridge under construction are technical writing. That's a
       problem because it limits the scope of what technical writing is and what we can study and who can
       study within the field. It closes off avenues of practice as much as it opens them up.

       Historically, folks have used definitions of what is or is not technical writing to control who has a
       seat at the table, so to speak, in the field. When someone wants to tell you what is or is not technical
       writing, they're making a power play. They are attempting to define the field in a particular way, usu-
       ally one that makes sense to them and gives them an advantage. Often times in history this has been
       used to keep, for example, the work of woman out of technical writing. We may at times be amazed
       (or maybe not so amazed) at the extent that people would go to in order to keep women or some
       other group out of a particular field, but it has happened time and time again. Again, definitions are
       powerful.

       So, our broad definition serves a definite purpose--to make sure that we're not excluding anyone or
       anything that should/could be part of technical writing. An added advantage to that move is that we
       get a lot more cool stuff to study that we'd be missing out on if we limited ourselves to engineering
       and closely related fields. Instead, we get to look at any number of texts that are conveying technical
       information, often in very sophisticated ways, that have been historically overlooked by rather nar-
       row definitions of the field. (Video game theory-crafting comes to mind as one interesting example).

    Section Break--Defining Technical Writing

      1. What exactly is technical writing? How would you define it in your own words?
      What are some examples of extreme versions of it?

      2. How do you define your major or field of study? What other definitions exist at
      other institutions? What difference do these differences in definition make? Did they
      impact your choice of this institution?

      3. Thinking about definitions, how are categories used negatively or positively in your
      hobby? Next, what is the most positive definition you can think of? How does each
      extreme police the hobby or field?

   Ethical Stakes in Technical Writing

       Having talked about what technical writing is and what it studies, I want to focus on perhaps the
       most important aspect of technical writing that we could possible discuss--the ethical stakes of tech-
       nical writing and communication. To examine the ethical stakes, we're going to first define ethical

24
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

stakes, then look at the way those stakes manifest in the people that use our writing, the laws and
regulations that govern our writing, and finally by looking at how ethical stakes operate in institu-
tions and organizations.

What are ethical stakes anyway?

When we talk about ethics, it is worth taking a moment to address the elephant in the room--how
do we differentiate morals and ethics? Aren't they the same thing? Why is a course on writing trying
to get into moral behavior with me? Look below for my response.

Ethics are rules or regulations that govern behavior. They are usually part of a professional organiza-
tion's code of conduct, the rules that govern a particular industry or profession, or even the laws of
the land. They can also extend into rules and practices in religious texts. But, in each of these cases,
the key to ethics is that they are codified--they're written down and standardized for practical appli-
cation.

Morals, on the other hand, are your own internal compass of right and wrong. They are that little
voice in the back of your head that tells you that eating your roommates' donuts while they oversleep
breakfast might not be the nicest thing to do. They are individualized and aren't something you can
always expect everyone to agree on. Some folks feel strongly about eating certain foods, using certain
words, or doing certain things. Those feelings are part of their own moral compass and not some-
thing open to universal application or critique.

So, when we're doing technical writing we're mainly concerned with discussing ethical stakes--those
rules and regulations that govern what is appropriate behavior and actions in professional or orga-
nized settings. Just like with our definition of technical writing, our definition of professional or
organized settings can be very broad. After all, we have to account for folks swapping recipes or swap-
ping talent builds and folks who are passing along specs for the material tolerances of a new bridge.
In each case, people are being impacted and are working with, ideally, a shared understanding of
what ethical behavior is and what is expected of each participant.

Now, with that said I do want to return to morals for one moment. We aren't going to be diving
into morals much in this text, but I do want to lay out thing out very clearly--morals do matter
in technical writing practice. You should stay true to your moral compass in your professional life.
If something make you uneasy or feels wrong, there is a very good chance it is! Technical writing
has been used for some very unsavory and downright evil activities simply due to how and where it
works--in institutional settings. Just because someone you're working with claims something is eth-
ical and alright doesn't make it so. Ethical codes change over time and evolve, and sometimes they're
just wrong. Use common sense and your own morals to guide you. Don't buy into the idea that if the
organization or boss says it's alright, it's alright.

Technical Writing and People

Technical writing at its core is writing that helps people do stuff, and doing stuff involves some level
of risk and responsibility. If you're writing instructions on how to fold an origami boat, then the risk
is that you may mess up a piece of paper--relatively low stakes. But, what if you're doing something

                                                                  25
                                               Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

       much more dangerous and involved? If you're operating a heavy piece of farming equipment, good
       technical documentation could be the difference between a harvested field and a funeral service--
       stakes that are life or death.

       Since our writing is being used to help folks do stuff, we have to always keep those folks in mind and
       keep in mind our impact on them. A little bit later in the text we'll get into the business of audience
       analysis--understanding who we are writing to and what their needs are. Having a firm idea of who
       our audience is and what they are going to need from our text and what they're already going to
       know is an important starting point for any good technical writing--even a good cookie recipe!

       Suffice it to say for now that ethical writing regarding people hinges on matching up our text to
       those individuals' needs and expectations. Good and ethical technical writing makes things easy for
       folks to safely carry out whatever activity the technical writing is mediating. Unethical technical writ-
       ing puts up barriers for the sake of creating barriers or simply doesn't take into account the user at
       all. (Often times this comes from writing for the writer and not the reader--you make choices that
       are easy for you, but not easy for the person using your text, a production-centered mindset that we'll
       talk about later).

       It's possible you've already encountered technical writing that was unethical, or at least edging its way
       into that space. Sometimes unethical writing can be difficult to recognize if you're not the target of
       the particular strategy. If you know, for example, how a process is supposed to work, then you're not
       going to notice if a few minor but important steps are omitted (unless you're attempting to follow
       the steps literally). If you're used to the language of a particular discipline or workplace, you may not
       notice when discipline-specific terms are used in public-facing documents in order to prevent layper-
       sons for understanding what is being said and the implications.

       Unethical technical writing can be sneaky, so we have to keep an eye out for it. Sometimes you could
       do some of the above things without setting out to be unethical--you just aren't thinking or you are
       just taking the easy way out. In other cases, you may encounter folks with an open agenda to disen-
       franchise or impede others through technical writing. Keep your eyes open and think about what a
       text looks like from multiple points of view.

       Technical Writing and Laws and Regulations

       Laws and regulations are a huge part of technical writing, and for good reason. Technical writing is
       only useful if it can be understood, and a large part of how we write is regulated with that in mind.
       Regulations and laws serve different purposes for technical writing, but both have ethical compo-
       nents that impact the way that we write and work.

       Regulations and standards are one way that we impose order on the work we do. Standards can be
       as basic and universal as making sure that your kilogram and my kilogram are the same weight, but
       they can be much more idiosyncratic. For example, you have the ASTM standards for skateboard
       helmets that are different than the standard certification for bicycle helmets due to the different level
       of impact and types of impacts involved. Someone cruising on their bike is going to have a different
       set of impacts than someone trying to rock-to-fakie in a massive bowl; the standard recognizes that.

26
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

Standards also exist for materials that are used in construction and industry. In fact, a lot of the
traditional technical writing associated with engineering came about from the process of standardiza-
tion! When the steel industry, among other industries, was first coming into its own, you had a lot
of mystery behind what made for good or bad steel. If one batch failed and another batch was fine,
no one could be sure why that happened. Wanting to maintain consistency and avoid bad steel that
could get people killed, engineers took to documenting their processes and measuring their products
to develop a durable standard. All of the documentation around this crucial process was technical
writing, and it was one of the ways that technical writing and engineering became closely linked.

When we write as technical writers, we have to take into account any relevant regulations and laws
that might impact our practice and make changes accordingly. For example, if you're working in a
real estate setting and you're listing a house, there are regulations from the U.S. government that you
have to follow in order to have a legal listing. Let's say the person that you're working for wants to
list their house as great for families with young kids. That's all well and good, but it's also illegal to
put into a listing. Housing regulations prevent sellers from promoting a particular type of buyer or
avoiding a particular type of buyer for their property. (Though, they haven't always...and the impact
of those past choices are still shaping where we live and who we know). If you're writing for real
estate, you simply can't talk about the type of family/person that would be a good fit for a home in
your listing; it's against the law.

Another example of regulations coming into play would be financial products. You could be writing
ad copy for a particular financial product and think, "This is such a great fund--you'll never lose
money with this!" That is great and all, but you can't legally say that. Any type of non-guaranteed
product in the financial market can't be sold to potential buyers as risk-free when it actually isn't. You
can't guarantee things without having a mechanism to ensure what you're guaranteeing.

As writers, we need to be aware of the industries we are writing in and their particular rules and
relevant legal regulations. Every industry will be different, but we're required to know the rules of
the road when we're writing professionally. For example, if you're teaching you need to have a strong
understanding of FERPA regulations. If you're a nurse or medical professional, you need to under-
stand how HIPAA works and what your employer interprets as a violation. (And yes, each of these
rules are open to interpretation by specific employers). If you don't make yourself aware of these rules
and regulations, you risk opening up your employer or yourself to legal action or fines while simul-
taneously sharing private information without permission, something that often has serious personal
consequences.

Now, some of these regulations and laws may seem burdensome. Sometimes they can be burden-
some. But, they are in place for a reason. FERPA exists so that your grades and records are protected.
Does it make sharing information about grades more difficult? Yes, yes it does. But, that is the price
that we pay to make sure your educational records are safe. Privacy and information security aren't
free or automatic. As you work through writing that has burdensome legal regulations around it, try
to keep in mind that the extra writing you're doing does have a purpose and that in fulfilling your
legal and ethical duties you're likely making the world a safer or better place for the folks being pro-
tected by the regulations and laws you're following.

Technical Writing and Organizations

                                                                  27
                                               Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

       When you're writing in an organizational setting, be aware that you may have yet another level of
       scrutiny and regulation put onto your work. Organizations have their own standards and their own
       processes to make sure that things come out the door in a way that is consistent with their desired
       public-facing image. For example, you might end up using a visual or editorial style guide when you
       write copy for marketing purposes to make sure that your visuals and your language sync up with the
       newest campaign that your company/organization is making use of.

       With that said, one thing you need to be aware of is that within organizations there can be situations
       where you may be asked to cut corners or ignore ethical guidelines. You might wonder why in the
       world someone would create technical writing about an unethical choice or series of actions, but
       the history of technical writing is littered with corporate scandals that were unearthed via mundane
       technical writing. From the Ford Pinto to the Challenger explosion to the Volkswagen Emissions
       Scandal, technical writing and communication goes hand in hand with unethical choices as often as
       it does ethical ones. Like any tool, you can use it for good or evil.

       When you're writing in an organization, there can be enormous pressure to do what's right by the
       company rather than what's the legal and ethical choice. As a technical writer, and as an individual, it
       is up to you to make the right choice in these situations. History is full of folks that said, "Okay, I'll
       do it," in the face of an unethical ask. Be one of the folks that say no. They sleep better at night.

   Professional Voice and Technical Communication

       Another fundamental aspect of being a good professional and technical writer is developing a profes-
       sional voice. One of the things that I tell all my students, graduate and undergraduate, is that there
       is a clear and fundamental difference between knowing what you're talking about and sounding like
       you know what you're talking about. The difference between these two is often the presence or lack
       of a professional persona or professional voice.

       What exactly is a professional voice? Well, we could probably spend an entire semester working on
       just that. Entire books have been written and will be written on style, but for our purposes I define
       professional voice thus: writing with appropriate authority, allowing sources to back you up rather

28
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

than speak for you. That may seem subtle, and in a way it is, but placing yourself in the position
of authority is a cornerstone of both coming across as a professional as well as owning up to your
responsibilities in a professional setting.

Often times when we're writing as grade school or even high school students, we're put into a posi-
tion with research where the research itself becomes the focus of our writing. You write a term paper
that needs 10 sources, and those sources are the term paper; you're simply creating a vessel for them
to be shared with the world. While that type of investigative writing can be useful, the presentation
that it lends itself to is not.

When we present ourselves as professionals, we are the ones who have done the research, who know
the relevant background information and sources need. If you know it, write and talk that way! (And
if you don't, do that work so that you don't end up being one of those folks that sound like they
know what they're talking about when they are in fact clueless). Below you'll find a couple of example
sentences that lay out the differences I'm conveying. See if you can guess which is professional voice:

Example 1:

      There are a couple of things that apply when we decide whether to build a coal or natural gas
      plant. According to the Guide to Greenhouse Emissions by Lora Fitts (2015), "there is a large
      difference between the emissions generated by coal and by natural gas production" (p. 159).
      Elsewhere, Boris Johnson (2017) writes in Energy Choices for the Future that "building for coal
      at this point in history is a backwards point of view for any forward-facing organization" (p.
      257).

Example 2:

      The research available does not support the choice to build a coal-powered plant on campus.
      Recent work studying emissions shows that coal has a much more aggressive pollution profile
      vs. natural gas (Fitts 2015), and the general consensus among experts is that coal is at best a
      backwards choice for any new construction (Johnson 2017).

Looking at these two examples, you should be able to see a marked difference in the way that the
author tackles the subject matter at hand and its presentation. The first example maps to the classic
"this is what I read" approach where you simply repeat the wording of your sources verbatim, often
while naming the exact book/journal/article that you're drawing on. Now, that is not to say there is
not a place for this type of research (there is), but for the most part when you put all of this informa-
tion in the text, you're overloading the reader with content they really don't need. The Works Cited
page of your text is the place for most of this information in a normal setting, and what you're doing
is taking the decision-making process and offloading it to experts rather than owning the choice
yourself. Even in situations where your job is simply to inform, you should own the collection and
presentation of the data you've found!

Notice that in example 2, the author makes a clear point (we should not build a coal plant) and then
backs it up with strong statements that are supported by relevant citations. The author isn't hiding
behind sources and isn't asking the reader or the sources to make a decision. Instead, the author has

                                                                  29
                                               Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

       decided what they want to say and is simply telling you what they've found out from research. This
       is the essence of professional voice--doing the homework and the research and then presenting your
       point of view accordingly. Instead of talking about your sources, you talk for them and let them back
       you up. Note that the author doesn't go beyond the sources quoted in the first example, but simply
       uses them as the backing for their own representation.

       Metaphorically speaking, Example 1 represents you, the author, hiding behind your sources. Instead
       of showing your work and what you think, you throw up the sources and hope for the best. Example
       2 takes a different course, using the sources as a backing to make a statement that you feel is correct.
       In Example 2, you're the one making a firm statement, and if someone wants to question that choice,
       they can go to the sources you've cited. You've done the homework and now you're telling folks what
       you think.

       For professional settings, Example 2 is often the way to go. One of the more common complaints
       about student writing is that it often doesn't communicate clearly and directly. Taking ownership
       of the text and the points, allowing sources to back you up rather than hiding behind them, tackles
       that problem head-on. Now, that isn't to say that you will never need to write the way Example 1 is
       framed, but that isn't going to be as common.

       Even in a literature review setting, you're being asked to take ownership of the text in a way that sim-
       ply repeating sources doesn't. A literature review, if you think about it, is the product of you reading
       all of the relevant literature on a subject and then presenting that research to an audience. You are
       the one making the call on what belongs and doesn't, and you are the one that is naming the various
       camps, setting up their arguments, and explaining how they interrelate. That's a lot of work for you,
       the author, even though you're primarily telling someone what other people have said! It is your liter-
       ature review after all, and you need to own that for better or worse.

       So, when it comes to professional voice and technical writing and communication, keep in mind
       that you're the expert, the one doing the research and the presentation. Own that role, and make
       your points with your sources doing the backing. Don't use them as a shield, but use them instead
       as backup when you make your points. One day, you may not need to use them at all, once you've
       become the expert in a given area. Think about someone like the late Neil Armstrong--who would
       realistically question his description of walking on the moon? In a situation where he has explained
       what that is like, he is the source. He's the expert because an ever-shrinking number of people are
       primary sources that have actually been on the moon and returned to tell us about it! And eventual-
       ly, you may be in a similar position in your own niche area of study and professional practice. Until
       then, use other sources to make your points with appropriate authority.

class?

3. What is the difference between sounding like a student and sounding like a professional?

Signposting and Taxonomy

For our final subject in Chapter 1, I want to mention a crucial duo central to effective technical writ-
ing: signposting and taxonomy. These two subjects are closely related, in that signposting relies on a
taxonomy of sorts to operate, and is an expression of taxonomy, but they are worth treating individu-
ally as well as jointly. In a nutshell, these two tools are used to shape your text so that it has a definite
structure that can be seen, ideally, at a glance. We'll get more into the idea of taxonomy a bit later
in the text, and in many ways the Cardsorting resource in the back of the text is entirely about these
two subjects, viewed through the lens of potential users. We'll look at signposting first before moving
to taxonomy and then back between the two.

Basic Textual Signposting

Signposting is at its core telling your reader what is happening in your text. This signposting hap-
pens at two different levels, and both are important to readers in their own ways. The first way that
signposting happens is via the text itself. When you use terms like "firstly," "second," "next," and
"finally," you are using signposting embedded within the text in a basic way. In addition to this basic
approach, you can also do higher level signposting, but let's unpack the basic approach first before
adding complexity.

Basic signposting with order-based terms tells your readers a few things, and you need to be aware
that you're telling your reader those things! Nothing is worse than when someone is signaling some-
thing while not realizing they're signaling anything at all, or when they think they're signaling some-
thing else entirely. If you've learned a foreign language, you've run into this issue with the subject of
false cognates, terms that sound like words in your home language that mean something drastically
different in the language you're now speaking.

When you say something like "next' to your reader, you are indicating that you're working through
a series of steps or ideas, and that you are now transitioning from one such idea/step to another.
Being aware of this transition and taking advantage of it makes you a more effective technical writer
and communicator. These terms are crucial in technical writing because many times the information
we are conveying is quite complex. We don't want to be adding to that complexity with even more
complexity in our text. When we do so, we're in effect creating two levels of understanding the reader
needs to master: they need to master our text and our odd dialect/presentation and they need to
master the actual information we're presenting to them. For example, attempting to learn how to put
together a set of furniture with instructions written in Middle English presents two challenges at the
same time.

Now, I'm mentioning the two levels of understanding that readers have to deal with as separate
entities to make a point, but in reality they are not so simple to break apart. Your "facts" can't be

                                                                  31
                                               Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

       separated from your presentation. "Just the facts" as an approach to technical writing, as we discussed
       previously, leads to a situation where you simply ignore the impact of your position as the author, of
       the format you choose for your facts, and even the impact of the medium you've chosen.

       To use a metaphor, think about your signposting and textual decisions as one ingredient to a text
       or recipe. You also have outside information you're including in the text as well, and these different
       ingredients react to each other while also having their own preparations that impact the way they are
       expressed. You can simply insert a table of data into a paper in the same way you add a stick of cold
       butter to a recipe. This impacts the way it works and how you will proceed and how your reader will
       proceed. You can also take the data from that table and instead of simply pasting the table, you can
       explain one bit at a time to the reader in paragraph form. This might be the equivalent of melting
       butter down and clarifying it before use. You have the same ingredient, but it's being processed in
       different ways with different effects.

       The signposts you add are like yet another ingredient, something perhaps like salt or yeast in a
       dough. To an extent, they are simply altering the way the recipe is going to be operate. More yeast,
       more rising. But, at the same time, they impart a flavor to the recipe. Yeast bread tastes fundamental-
       ly different than non-yeast bread. The same works with signposting in that terms like "next" impact
       the overall flow of the text and how someone reads it, but at the same time they add a distinct flavor
       to the text, signaling that this is going to be the sort of text where you get these types of aids, and
       that in the future you should look for them and depend on them.

       Simple, order-based signposts are also an authorial aid--they help you think through your own
       series of steps and content. You need to know when you're transitioning to use "next" effectively. You
       need to have an idea of steps to be able to assign points one, two, and three. In thinking about these,
       ideally you do so through the dual lenses of what you intend to say and who you intend to read your
       content, tailoring your choices based on those two elements at a minimum.

       Advanced Signposting and Document Maps

       To make the most out of simple signposting, you need to have a larger level of signpost that you can
       sync up with at the section level as well as at the document level. This is where signposting really
       shines!

       Top-level signposting usually involves a section or document map of some sort. A document map
       functions just like the name suggests--it provides readers with a list of topics that will be covered
       or sections that will be present, and it usually does so while mirroring the order found in the text.
       You may have noticed a few maps in this document already, and if not, look for something with the
       following format:

       In the next section, we'll be looking at the shape of the material, the properties of the alloys that
       make up the material, and the relationship between these two elements and the friction forces the
       material creates.

       In this example, you have a basic map that is connected to a larger map while also containing a
       section-specific map. First, you have the connection to a larger map with the terms, "In the next

32
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

section." This phrase lets us know that we're moving from one major section to another, likely linking
up to a larger list of sections that was introduced at the start of the text or the start of this series of
sections. Next, you have the specific map for this section of text with the list of different aspects of
the material that will be discussed. This list allows readers to know what will be coming up next, and
as they transition through each of these steps, they'll be able to mentally check their progress through
the section based on this map. At the same time, they also realize this progression is the next in a
larger series of progressions that make up the entirety of a given text.

Don't underestimate the power of this approach! Document maps are essential for almost all techni-
cal writing that is more than a couple of paragraphs (and even then, I'd argue they are useful). Using
a map, you provide the reader with a clear expectation of what content will be found and what order
it will be found in. You can then use this in concert with basic signposting to move between sections/
points, or you can combine it with maps in each section listed to provide even more detail to the
reader.

And, in larger documents that have a table of contents, all of this can sync up to that table and pro-
vide the reader a global view of the document map and the section maps.

Signposting Format or Why Headings Are Important

Having discussed basic and advanced signposting, I need to pause for a moment to discuss what this
can look like in a visual sense. You could, and many people do, simply do all of this work in the text
itself. You can locate the maps and the directional signposts in the text and when the reader encoun-
ters those maps, they can then use them accordingly. With that said, if you want your reader to get
the most out of all your work creating maps of sections and sub-sections, you need to use headings.

Headings like the numerous headings you've encountered in this text already, are the key to making
signposts really work for the reader. It is one thing to run into a map and to be able to then identify
through the text when the next section has arrived. It is something entirely different to be able to
see sections change by browsing through the text and noting the various textual landmarks the map
has identified via bolded or italicized or colored headings and subheadings. These headings allow the
reader to skim through your text to quickly locate a section they may want to read alone or reread.

In the context of usage, headings can help someone find content in a text that isn't meant to be read
as a narrative. Think about car manuals or recipe books. Neither of these texts really shines when you
read them front-to-back. Yes, you can do that (and you might when you first get the text), but these
texts are essentially a reference for someone who needs a slice of the data in the text. That's also true
in report settings where someone only wants the highlights of your text, or they want to see one par-
ticular part because of their role in an organization. We'll discuss this more when we get to audience
and use and again when we get to genre.

Taxonomy and Signposting

When we use the term taxonomy in technical writing, we're referring to the way that we divide some-
thing in parts or sections. The study of taxonomy is really the study of how you divide something up
and the impact of that division. You may wonder how that can be useful in a writing setting, or any

                                                                  33

       setting at all, so let's dive into how taxonomy can be used in specific scenarios.
       How does taxonomy work?
       One simple example of taxonomy you may not be aware of is the way that you organize apps on the
       home screen of your phone. A taxonomy requires items and it requires groupings of those items as
       well as depth to those groupings, something the interface on your phone provides via pages of apps
       as well as folders. Take a look at the example of the iPad Pro interface I'm currently using as I write
       this chapter:

          An example interface taxonomy

       In the example above, I've got a rather terrible taxonomy that needs some work. I have three major
       groupings, some are useful and some are not. The overall order of the page seems to have no real
       sense to it. Why does Tips come first? What is the significance of Messenger next to Create? To be
       honest, there is no purpose here to those choices. I've simply left them in the order they were in-
       stalled. All of these form the top level of the taxonomy's hierarchy (we will ignore the shortcut bar for
       this example, though it does wonderfully compliment the discussion).
       When I open up the iPad, these are my choices. I can navigate to the one I want via memory or via
       reading the various choices available. The advantage of the folders grouping things together is that
       I'm allowed to have more choices on the same page without muddling things up and at the same
       time I simplify the choices available. I can make the global choice, Office Tools, when I want to
       do something Office related. When I want to do something with Adobe, I can use that folder. This

34
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

allows me to see those choices as a global choice alongside Tips and Messenger. It is a way of viewing
and sorting the content on my iPad. As I said, it is not a very good way of doing this (I've not put a
lot of thought and time into it), but it is a way of doing the content sorting.

Taxonomy really does come down to mundane things like my iPad Pro's interface--how do we orga-
nize things and how do we label them and the groups we put them into? When it comes to phones
and other devices, this impacts the way we use things and the way we find things. The principle also
applies to physical workplaces with idiosyncratic stacking and filing methods. Taxonomy is nearly
universal, but for the most part we'll focus from this point onward on the impact it has on technical
writing.

Taxonomy and Documents

When you create sections and sub-sections in a text, you are creating a taxonomy in/for your docu-
ment. You are saying that this major heading describes the content contained within, and that certain
sub-sections make sense in certain places. Not everyone will agree with every taxonomy you create,
but that isn't the point. The point is that you're putting a sense of structure and hierarchy into place.
This can be enormously powerful!

One thing to keep in mind about taxonomies, especially the top level of a taxonomy, is what the
taxonomy you've created makes visible and what it hides. Top-level choices are given a great deal of
importance and they may be the only level someone ever really reads or considers before diving into
your text or passing on it altogether. You need to calculate what you say very carefully to make sure
folks know what to find where and what to expect.

If you've ever tried to evaluate four or give different programs at the college level using the respec-
tive programs' websites, you know the pain of awful taxonomy choices. One school might choose to
put the major plan under "Advising," while another will put it under "New Students," and another
will place it under "Academics." Where you will find it on a given website is anyone's guess since the
taxonomy is not regularized (this is one of the reasons the standards we discussed previously can be
useful--a taxonomy can be universal) or is simply poorly thought out. In many cases with websites
you can get to the information quicker by doing a web search with the terms and the university name
than actually diving into the site. This isn't an ideal solution, but it is often one bad taxonomy forces
on us. (Card Sorting research is one way to fix this, so take a peak at that section in our last chapter
for more).

You may wonder how taxonomy and power interrelate. We are after all just naming categories--why
would we care about the top level? Well, it comes down to representation and access. Taxonomies
have an implicit power structure. Top level content is all of equal importance. Secondary content is
less important than top level content, and in theory it is all of equal importance. If there is a tertiary
level, it in theory is less important than the secondary level and all content at that level is ideally of
the same importance. This is basically how an outline works with Roman numerals:

      I. Topic 1

         a. Sub-Topic 1

                                                                  35
                                               Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

                         i. Sub-Sub-Topic 1

                b. Sub-Topic 2

             II. Topic 3

             III.Topic 4

       Because of the weight given to the top level, and it's immediately visibility, it provides a level of
       prestige that the sub-levels don't have. Think about how this can impact something as simple as an
       organizational chart. Does a unit deserve to stand alone as part of its own subdivision of the organi-
       zation, or does it get nested under another unit? These are functional as well as political questions.
       (Office politics gets really interesting around these issues).

       Ethics and Taxonomy/Signposting

       For us, we want to make sure that we're using a taxonomy system that both respects the subject mat-
       ter and makes content easy to find. Doing both isn't always easy, but if effective communication was
       something that was relatively easy, everyone would be doing it! Writing and communication classes
       exist for a reason.

       You want to group categories in a way that makes sense to your readers, even if it isn't your natural
       way to categorize. This sometimes involves research, and we'll cover that later in the text, but it is
       almost always worth the work. Connect research on how readers classify content with your signposts
       in the text, sync those road maps up with your document map, and the next thing you know you've
       got a text that will serve readers well.

       Regarding respecting content, you want to make sure that you're treating content with the same
       level of respect as your readers, and that you're respecting the importance of content when viewing
       it through an ethical lens. Practically speaking, this often means making sure that you aren't tuck-
       ing important information that might make your case less persuasive in hard-to-find places. You
       shouldn't have safety warnings or hidden price tags for projects in places folks are not likely to look
       or very likely to overlook. Doing so betrays your audience by actively preventing them from accesses
       the information they would want to see when they are making decisions about your text.

       Wrapping it Up

       In short, this chapter has been about the big picture of technical writing. What is it? Why does it
       matter? What are some of the simple-yet-important things we need to keep in mind when writing
       texts on technical subject matter? From this point on, we'll be expanding our knowledge in particu-
       lar areas regarding technical writing. But, we'll rely on this chapter and the content covered to move
       forward.

1. How does taxonomy work in your major? Are there different expressions of the major, or does the
major rely on minors for flavor?
2. What taxonomies break up your student body? What are the universal taxonomies, and what tax-
onomies emerge that are tied to your institution?
3. Study the taxonomy of your major's website. Does it agree with other majors in the institution?
Does it agree with other majors at other institutions? Using the Card Sorting research method in the
last chapter, take the major sections and sub-sections of the website and test it with folks in the class.
How does their ordering of the content differ from your major's website? Which do you prefer? Why?

Chapter Two:

               The User
    Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

    In the first chapter, we focused a great deal on big-picture questions about what technical writing is,
    how it works, where it comes from, and spent a bit of time on some solid tips to follow regarding
    organization. In the second chapter, we're going to move away from looking at technical writing as
    something the writer/author works on, and instead look at the folks who are actually being served by
    the technical writing we're doing. We'll start by looking at the idea of audience and use, before fo-
    cusing specifically on use and questions of use and how users impact our drafting process. Next, we'll
    look at usability studies and participatory and user-centered design as a way to approach the question
    of use. After that, we'll talk about sources and research in technical writing and how those relate to
    our users and their expectations. Finally, we'll talk about writing in large organizations or institutions
    and how use differs in those cases.

    Technical Writing and the Audience

    In many ways, the audience or user of technical writing is the most important facet of everything we
    do (if the first chapter didn't clue you into this fact already). Technical writing is all about conveying
    complex information to new environments and audiences, and being able to convey information to a
    new place involves knowing where it will be going and who will be using it there. It is fairly difficult
    to be an effective technical writer if you don't know who is going to be using your work. The idea
    that there is some ideal technical writing level that we can all use and understand at the most ideal
    level is absolutely wrong, as we've discussed before and will discuss again. The audience matters!

    Now, you may have noticed that while I'm mentioning audience a lot, the title of this chapter is de-
    voted to users. That may seem like a simple swap, a set of synonyms, but in reality the term user has
    important implications that audience doesn't always bring along for the ride. When we think about
    an audience, I would argue that our normal construction is a passive one. There is an audience for a
    play. There is an audience for a sporting event. There is an audience for a television show. In each of
    these cases, the audience primarily watches or reads (in the case of closet drama--a play meant to be
    read rather than acted) a text or event.

    Users, however, are not passive. In comparison to an audience, a user is someone doing something.
    They are going to use whatever it is that they've been given. They're not going to just leisurely stroll
    through a text--they have a purpose behind their engagement with it. Users use and depending on
    what they're using, they may have an easy time or a not-so-easy time. For example, one of my best
    friends is color blind. He uses a lot of video game interfaces as he's playing. Those interfaces are es-
    sential to him because he gets information from them to plan his playing. For many years, however,
    those interfaces have not catered to his ability to see color, and that has caused a great deal of grief for
    him. Thankfully, more and more modern games cater to users with color blindness and offer differ-
    ent interface color schemes to help users access information clearly using the colors they can see and
    distinguish between with ease.

    As may already be clear, viewing the folks who will be accessing our technical writer as users puts us
    in a better position to cater to their needs. When we think about users and use, we push ourselves
    past simply having someone read our text and think about how they might actually use our text to
    carry out some task or goal. Once we make that leap, we're suddenly asking a lot of really important
    questions we might not be asking otherwise if we just saw them as an audience. We're asking ques-
    tions about how our text is going to be used!

39                                                                                                                39
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       Having said all of this, I'm a hopeless waffler when I write about users and use and audience. You'll
       likely see me using all of these terms and some more in the rest of this text. Unless I'm making a
       clear usage of a particular facet of one of the definitions, orient all discussions of audience and users
       around potential use. Hopefully in the future I'll rewrite all of this and remove my waffling from the
       equation.

   Users and the Drafting Process

       Now that we've decided that use is going to be important in the way we treat our readers, now we
       need to dive into how to engage with users as we go through the process of drafting a text. First we'll
       look at the way that research goes into the drafting process before diving into the questions that we'll
       use to generate that research on use.

       Research and the Drafting Process

       Good technical writing doesn't come from the nether. You don't sit under a tree and wait for inspi-
       ration to strike you in order to create that next bit of amazing technical writing. Now, that isn't to
       say that technical writing is not creative--it is incredibly creative. However, technical writing is not
       writing that is built off of the writer's fancy. It is writing that is situated around information and
       users and use.

       In the writing process, this means that often your writing will be driven by research and directed by
       research. When asking yourself how you should write a given section, you won't simply be asking this
       question out loud and answering yourself with imaginary sequences of events. Instead, you should
       be basing your decisions in a good technical document based on what you know about the audience
       and how they plan on using your text.

       In order to make use of information about the audience in our drafting process, we need to fun-
       damentally integrate research into the way that we write. Anything less will result in an awful and
       inefficient process where we write what we think is needed, find out what is really needed, and then
       go back and try to reconcile the two before our pressing deadline is a missed deadline. In case you
       don't get the hint, that is not an ideal way to write.

       Now, writing can be a very idiosyncratic sort of thing and everyone has a system that they've de-
       veloped over time to do writing. Often the system is something like, "I'll do it tomorrow," "I'll do
       it tomorrow," "I'll do it tonight," "I'll do it in an hour," "I'm doing it now and have to beat the
       midnight deadline." This is a strategy that can sometimes work in college, but it is not conducive to
       ongoing professional success. Even if you do have a more evolved process of drafting, I would like to
       suggest a sequence of writing and research that may be useful. You don't have to adopt it entirely, but
       I'd ask that you at least consider some of the benefits to the approach and think about how it might
       be adapted to fit your system of writing.

Section Break--Audience and Use and

Research

1. What is the difference between an audience and a group of users? What situations might exist
where someone moves from being an audience member to a user?
2. Have you ever encountered a text where you were an audience, but you recognize you were not
the intended audience? How did you figure that out?
3. What document can you think of that was the worst-prepared for actual use that you've had to
make use of? Why was it so hard to use?

Technical Writing Research and Writing Process

Below, I'll be discussing what I see as seven phases of the writing process for technical writing. I use
the term phases because these are not really steps, but instead ways of viewing the project that you
go through. In general, you go through these phases in order. However, you may jump back to the
mindset of one phase or another without ever really leaving your current phase. (You might question
purpose, for example, while identifying document goals). Or, you might decide once you reach a
certain phase that you need to take what you've learned and revert to a previous phase or even the
first phase. That might sound horrifying, but some of the best writing comes from those types of re-
sponsible decisions. Trust me, if you think it might be best to start over and you don't, someone else
is going to eventually see your text and likely come to the exact same conclusion.

Writing Project Phases                    Phase 5c: Revision
                                          Phase 6: Proofing

                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

     Phase 1: Coming to a Purpose

       The first phase of a writing task is often coming to a purpose. Sometimes this phase, like all of the
       phases, can take a long time. Other times, you can get through the entire timeline in the space of a
       minute or two (such as when you're writing a work email).

       What usually controls the direct of the first phase is the origin of your writing task--is this some-
       thing you want to do or is this something you've been asked to do. If you're being asked to do
       something, you have much less control over the purpose that you're carrying out. If you're doing
       something on your own, you're going to be able to craft purpose with a bit more control.

     Identifying Your Purpose

        What am I doing?

        Who am I doing it for?

        How will they use it?

        What will it be about?

        When will it be used?

        Why am I being asked to do this?

       The answer to the above questions will give you a sense of your purpose. You don't always need to
       know all the answers to the above, and really you just want a sketch of the answers at this point. But,
       you need to know the general gist of each of these questions to have a clear idea of purpose. Once
       you've figured these questions out, you should have a clear idea of what you will be doing and who
       you will be doing it for.

       For an example, you might be asked to write a white paper on a new service your company is creat-
       ing. Below, you'll find the rundown for this project via the questions on purpose:

       What: I am drafting a white paper, an informational and persuasive text designed to education folks
       enough to know why they should want a service.

       Who: I am doing this work for my immediate supervisor, but really this is a service to the entire com-
       pany and getting new clients helps us keep the doors open.

       How: The reader should use this paper to understand our service and why it is valuable and worth
       having.

       What: It will be about our new service that provides on-site minor medical care for construction
       firms.

42
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

When: It will be used in the early part of the sales process. It may be used as a cold-call tool.

Why: I am a technical writer and familiar with the program and our sales process, so I am being
asked to write this document.

Notice in the example above, most of what I'm writing is coming from the writer's own understand-
ing of things. Understanding your purpose, ideally, shouldn't involve a ton of research. You just need
to know the parameters of your project and what is going to be required and what will be recognized
as success. These are primarily internal metrics, not external ones. Once you know these things, you
can move on to the real work of research in Phase 2.

Phase 2a: Identifying Research Goals

In Phase 2, we move away from the internal understanding of the project we started with in Phase 1
and expand to understand the project from outside perspectives. We'll also carry out research in this
phase, so we'll really be going past simply identifying. In doing all of this, we'll be trying to figure out
what we need to know to be effective writers in the situation we're currently in. This phase is a long
one, but it is one of the most important steps in good technical writing!

To identify research goals, we need to know what we don't know. I won't go into the full Donald
Rumsfeld quote on known-knowns and known-unknowns, but we do need to get a sense of what we
need to find out. This is a fairly natural course of events if you think about it--what would be the
purpose of research if we already knew what we were going to find out?

To help out in identifying what we need to find out, I like to work through a series of questions.
(You may be noticing a pattern at this point). Below, you'll find the first set of questions I often ask:

Identifying Research Goals

 Who is going to be the primary user of this text?

 Who might they consult when reading this text?

 Who might be interested in this text for secondary reasons?

 What laws and regulations will govern this text?

 Who in my organization is going to control the release of this text?

 What will they expect?

In each of the above questions, we're trying to get at the question of who. We need to figure out the
identity of the users of our documents, and we need to know who is going to be assisting them in
that use. At first, that might seem like an odd question, but if you examine your own use of import-
ant documents as well as workplace practices, it makes more sense.

                                                                  43
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       When you use an important document, you often ask folks that know more about specific parts of
       that text for assistance. For example, if you're looking over an application for a college, you might
       ask someone who has applied successfully to that college or another college for assistance in a partic-
       ularly tricky part. If you're in a business situation and you are reviewing a bid for a new service, you
       might ask one of your employees or coworkers with expertise in a particular part of the package you
       don't understand or know much about. In each case, these consultants are not the primary user, but
       they're using the text nonetheless.

       Once you've identified consultants and users, you're going to want to at least consider who might
       run into this text for secondary reasons. This might be someone who is a competitor--they want
       to see your text so they can make sure they're staying competitive with your offerings. It might be
       a news organization that wants to report on your business practices. It might even be an advocacy
       group that has decided you are their enemy! (For example, you might be building a new shopping
       development near a historic neighborhood full of folks who simply don't want your traffic in their
       streets).

       The next who you want to identify is the governmental who--which federal, state, and international
       laws might govern this text? What government agencies might you need to interact with? What will
       the expect? This question doesn't always come into play, but when it comes into play, it can be of the
       utmost importance. There is nothing quiet like running afoul of a governmental agency's paperwork
       demands.

       Finally, you're going to want to know who in your organization is going to control this text's release.
       This might be the person that tasked you with the purpose you're operating under. This might be the
       legal department. What matters is that you know who they are and what they want. If you've done
       your homework in assessing Purpose, this may well be the easiest bit of research.

     Phase 2b: Researching Context

       Once you've identified all of the relevant who answers, you'll need one more pass to do some actual
       research. Yep, it's time for another list of questions. For each of your who's, you'll need to answer the
       following questions:

     Research Context

        What does this user need from the text?

        What will be this user's attitude towards my text?

        What will this user appreciate in my text?

        How will this user's political situation impact their interaction with my text?

       In each question, we're going to be trying to find out what exactly we need to know when we're

                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

doing our writing of the text. With the question on need, we're trying to figure out what use is going
to look like for an individual user. With the question on attitude, we're trying to ascertain how we
need to present the information to get a good response. With the question of appreciation, we need
to know what will win over a particular user. With the idea of politics, we need to know the internal
stakes for each user when working with our text. (Note: when we discuss politics in this text, we're al-
most always talking about politics in the general sense--what groups exist and how will they respond
to our choices? We usually aren't talking about political parties and elections and the like.)

These questions likely make more sense when they're given some context. Below you'll find an exam-
ple of answering each one of these questions for a primary user in our example of the service white
paper:

Need: The user will need to know what we offer, how the service is carried out, what the cost of the
service will be, the benefits of the service for their business, and the competitive advantage the service
will offer them.

Attitude: As this will be drafted as a cold-call document, it will likely be met with some skepticism.
In order to get past this, we'll need to make the document quite informative for the users and make
sure it doesn't come across as a hard sell from page one.

Appreciation: The users will appreciate timely and up-to-date research on industry best practices.
Anything we can do to make the reader feel like they've got a better appreciation of what is current
and cutting edge in the business will be advantageous. If we can do this without coming across as
someone after a sale at all costs, we'll likely get a good response, even if we don't get a sale for this
service at this time. Building a solid relationship matters.

Politics: We will be sending these documents to the owners of the companies we want to address.
There will be generally fewer political hang ups over this because they will be the final decision mak-
er. However, there may be some political issues that arise if the employer already has a service provid-
er for healthcare. Additionally, there could be internal pressure from employees or external pressure
from governmental agencies to provide better healthcare for employees on the job site, so this may be
something we can take advantage of.

For each of your users, you'll want to answer questions just like the example above. As you can see,
hopefully, these questions are designed to push you to find out information and to put that informa-
tion on the page. You can also put these questions on a whiteboard for discussion purposes. Often
having generative questions can make group writing more effective because it gives you a way to get
the expertise out of each member's head and into the shared discussion space.

Gathering Research on Users and Context

Before we move further into the phases, we should pause to note that the questions above on the
context we're researching are fundamentally different than the internal-facing questions from Phase
1. In Phase 1, we could easily answer questions because they were from our own situation and our
own circumstances. In Phase 2, especially in 2b, we're looking at other people's circumstances--that's
a totally different animal. You can't just wing it when you're answering questions about other people

                                                                  45
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       because you aren't other people. You're you.

       To gather information on other people, you need to actually do some research. Some of this research
       can be research from academic sources and trade publications. Some of it can be from the experi-
       ences you've had as well as the experience of others you might be writing with. But, all of that is no
       substitute for actually interacting with the folks you're going to be writing with!

       In the back of this text, you'll find several smaller chapters on research methods. You'll likely need to
       consult at least one or two of these methods to gather information on the context of your audience/
       users. To start off, interviews might be a useful place to begin if you have access to the folks you will
       be writing for. Read through the various approaches' introductions and you'll get a feel for which
       might fit your situation best.

       After you've carried out your research, you'll be in a much better place to make decisions about your
       audience and writing for them. You'll be able to ask yourself questions and then have data to answer
       them instead of relying on suppositions, anecdotes, and hunches.

     Section Break--Purpose, Goals, and Context

       1. When you write a paper in a course, how do you assess the purpose of the assignment? What helps
       you in this process? What impedes you?

       2. What documents can you think of that, in your mind, represent a firm understanding of purpose
       but a poor understanding of context? Why?

       3. Create two short texts, each with the same purpose, but designed with different contexts. They
       might be a tweet or an email body message or a text. How do they differ and why?

     Phase 3a: Identifying Document Goals

       Once you've identified your research goals and done some research, you'll be ready to move on to the
       next phase of the writing process, the phase where we turn from users and audience to the structural
       makeup of our text.

       When we talk about document goals, you may be tempted to conflate that with coming to a purpose
       in Phase 1. While they do sound similar, the focus in Phase 3 is on the actual document--the key
       features of the text and the expectations that readers will have for it. The difference here is that we're
       looking at the ways that the actual document, its features and its structure and appearance, helps
       meet our purpose and satisfy the expectations of our audience. Again, they sound similar but have an
       altogether different focus.

       Document goals come in a couple of forms, each with their own focus and point of view. Some goals
       are focused on the document's genre--what kind of document is this supposed to be, and what does
       that kind of document look like? Others are focused on the way the document's structure will be
       oriented to meet the purpose of the text and the audience's needs and expectations. Taken together,

46
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

all of these goals help us plan out the drafting of our text to make sure we're as effective as possible in
our writing efforts.

Identifying Document Goals

 What genre will the document be?

 What topics will the document need to cover/convey?

 What types of information will need to be highlighted?

 What accommodations will be needed?

Each of the questions for this phase focus on identifying key aspects of our text's structure and con-
tent that will need to be researched to gain a clear understanding of what will be required. Some of
this research can be internal, and some may be external.

Document Genre

For the question of document genre, you will need to look to your internal and external expec-
tations. This may be a fairly simply step--your purpose may explicitly discuss what genre will be
required. If not, you'll need to do some primary research. Look for similar documents in the profes-
sional world that carry out the same goal as yours. What genre are the documents? Are they all the
same? Are they different? Identify one genre that you feel would best fit your current goals, or make a
mashup that meets your own internal goals.

Before we go further, we should at least address the question of genre in broad strokes. If you aren't
familiar with document genres, get ready to gain some familiarity. Genres in documents are just like
genres in other areas that we use the same term, be it music, television, games, or novels. In each
case, a genre is an approach to something that can be identified by certain characteristics and ap-
proaches that are shared by similar texts.

One example might be the police procedural television show. In these shows, the audience follows
along with police officers as they go about their daily work. Not all of these are framed the same way
of course, and older shows like Dragnet maintain a focus just on the cases, whereas newer shows may
focus more on the people doing the policing and their lives, sometimes even with some comedy add-
ed in with shows like Castle or Brooklyn 99. In each case, there are certain hallmarks that are echoed
by each show that places the show within the procedural genre. That doesn't mean that there are hard
and fast rules that must be followed--genres change all the time--but, there are expectations that
must be met or at least addressed.

Document genres work the same way. When you think about annual reports, tax returns, grant pro-
posals, or even memos, each of these texts play by a certain set of genre rules and expectations. Often
you can see similarities between the function of genre examples taken from any number of places,
even if the specifics of how the genre works will be tailored to a specific audience and organization.

                                                                  47
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       Fundamentally, document genres (and others really) represent an approach to working with a given
       text. A genre is the way that a textual problem has been solved. If the solution was effective, it was
       likely repeated. As time went by, the solution was tweaked to meet challenges the original approach
       didn't address. The genre continues onward as a way to meet a challenge until it faces one that it
       simply can't address. At that point the genre is either retired or fundamentally overhauled to meet
       the new situation.

       To research genre, you should first look to your purpose. Is there an already present genre in your
       organization you've been asked to create a text within? If you already have a standard format for
       something like an annual report, use that. You should never go searching for a new genre or a new
       approach simply because you're making a new text. Unless the genre is no longer solving the prob-
       lem, keep it as-is. Otherwise, you spend valuable time you could be writing your document trying to
       come up with a new approach when none is needed.

       If you don't have an in-house genre, you need to create one. Look at example documents that are
       doing the same thing your document is doing. What structural choices are present? What kind of
       language is used (informal vs formal)? Take notes about all of this and sketch out your own model
       based on the examples. It will be a bit shaky on the first go, but that's what happens anytime you
       create a new approach to a technical writing task. This is why versioning and revisions exist.

       Topics and Audience

       Once you've got an idea of genre, you need to think about the topics you need to cover. Look at the
       purpose of your text and look at your audience and their context. What will you need to cover in
       order to complete your purpose and satisfy your audience?

       For example, if you're being asked to write a series of instructions on how to upload video content
       to the web for grade schoolers, you will approach this much differently than if you were writing the
       same content for a retirement community looking to get their members more engaged with social
       media. In the first example, fundamental questions about video, the web, and social media wouldn't
       need to be addressed. Kids get those things. However, the elderly members of the retirement com-
       munity may not have a firm grasp of how the web works, how video hosting on the web works, and
       they may even distrust computers! With that said, both groups would likely benefit from a robust set
       of tips on privacy, so that isn't to say each group is totally different.

       Make a list of your topics and try to make a note next to each item explaining what you mean and
       why you think that topic needs to be included. You may think this level of documentation is silly
       (and it would be for something like a three-sentence email to arrange for your friend to meet you
       for lunch), but being able to look back and explain to your superiors why you've made the choices
       you did in a document based on research and evidence can be a powerful tool when your choices are
       called into question or someone wants to know why your work is so successful.

       Thinking About Types of Information

       We we ask about types of information, we're really thinking about formatting. What types of in-
       formation in your text will need to have custom formatting? Will there be keywords? Will there be

48
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

warnings? Will there be cautions? Will there be movies and books listed? Will you be using non-stan-
dard characters a lot, such as names in Arabic or Japanese? Each of these questions is a formatting
question.

You'll want to make a list of each of the types of information that will have a special format. If you
want to be exhaustive, you could even include numbers and symbols associated with chemical for-
mulas or mathematical equations. The goal here is to have a handle on what will be represented in
the text.

Once you have a list of these types of information, sketch out what your formatting for each will be
briefly. Will caution be yellow? Will warnings be red? Will formulas be inline or separate from text?
Sketch out those answers now. If you're not sure, do some research. Look at how others have present-
ed the same data in their texts. If you have an internal style guide, use it. If you have a normal way of
doing this in your own organization, use that. Otherwise, do the research and make your notes!

Thinking about Accommodations

When we think about accommodations, we're trying to identify alterations to the text that will be
necessary to make sure our users will be able to use it without unnecessary burdens being placed on
them. When we think about accommodations, you'll be thinking about things like the following list:

 Do we have users with special color needs for color-coding?

 Do we have users that will access the text via a screen-reader that will require image captions?

 Do we have users that will need the text translated into another language?

 Do we have users that will need the text written to a specific reading level?

These questions and others will help you identify any accommodations you might need to make.

Your goal here is to make sure you know any sort of need that will be have to be addressed by your or
your organization as you write. In some cases, you will have an office in the organization that handles
this type of content. In the US, this type of content usually falls under Section 508 rules and regula-
tions when dealing with government agencies. Other countries and organizations may differ in their
approaches.

By approaching accommodations early in the writing process, you'll be in a better position to ensure
your text will serve its audience well, regardless of the way they'll be reading it.

Phase 3b: Implementing Document Goals

Once we've identified document goals, we need to do some research and planning to get those goals
ready to draft. We need to explicitly identify what genre means for us in this context, we need to
connect our list of topics with a series of sections in the text, and we need to create a miniature style
guide for any special information and accommodations that will be needed.

                                                                  49
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       Genre Requirements for Drafting

       First, we need to explicitly write down how the genre of our text will work. This usually involves two
       steps: identifying the specific sections that will be needed, and identifying the voice used in the text.
       For the specific sections, we'll need to identify what sections are expected in our genre. Next, we'll
       need to make sure we have a consistent voice throughout--this may be casual, formal, or something
       in between.

       For example, if we're going to be working on an annual report, there may be some expected sections
       that will be present. Now, we're not getting to the point of topics and sub-topics here, but we need to
       know about major segments of the text. For an annual report, there may need to be a special execu-
       tive summary that will be present. Knowing that needs to be in the text helps us plan our our writing
       task. There might also be an expectation of appendices with hard data included. Knowing that helps
       us make sure the document meets the expectations given by the genre.

       When it comes to voice, we just need to make sure we know what voice we're using. This can be the
       start of our mini style guide. Simply describe the voice and how it should work. Will it be formal
       with no contractions? Will it be informal with a lot of "you" and other direct address use? Will it be
       silly? Jot down your goals and then use this later as a rubric for your own writing. This type of work
       is especially useful when you're working in a team environment where several writers need to use the
       same voice to write sections that will be combined into one larger document.

       Setting up Topics and Sections

       Next, you'll want to connect your topics that need to be covered with specific sections for the doc-
       ument. You'll want to sketch out the major sections and then map your content to each area. You'll
       rely on your research on the audience as well as your purpose here to craft a table of contents for
       your text.

       This will be a rough outline of the text and may look something like the list below:

          I. Introduction

             i. Salutation to readers (familiar customer for 10 years)

             ii. Background on project (reworking of a project by other contractor

             iii. Description of rest of text

          II. Project Approach

             i. Previous work (Current CEO ordered this work)

             ii. Current method (Focus on environmental factors)

          III. Project Staff

50
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

      i. Leadership structure (Emphasize experience)

      ii. Team member bios (Structure around leads)

   IV. Project Timeline

      i. Overall timeline (Focus on Earth Day deadline)

      ii. Possible delays and challenges (Highlight variables)

   V. Goals and Outcomes

      i. Overall project goals (Connect with ongoing relationship and with ongoing relationship
      and environment)

      ii. Rubric for measuring success (Use contract for detailed specifics)

   VI. Closing (Personal thanks and contact information)

In the above example, I've sketched out a potential structure for a project report that might be given
to a client at the outset of the project, presenting the reader with a simplified and accessible version
of the existing technical plans that emphasizes the why of what will be going on. In each case in
parenthesis are some notes that will be useful regarding the audience and the writing. For example,
when talking about previous work, there is a note that the current CEO ordered the infrastruc-
ture being replaced. Knowing this, we would want to be rather gentle with our critiques of what is
currently being done--there is no reason to throw our client under the bus, especially when that can
make the boss look bad to an entire organization.

In your own work, you may want to follow a structure like the above, or you might try something
altogether different. What matters is that you come up with a structure for the text that covers all the
content you've identified as necessary while creating sections that make sense within the genre you're
drafting, sections that will help this text meet your stated purpose. We're trying to put all the stuff we
now know into a plan that we can use for the actual writing work ahead of us.

Style and Accommodations

Last, you'll want to come up with a mini style guide addition that covers any content that needs
special formatting or accommodation. A style guide for our purposes is really just a list of things
that should be done in the document to maintain consistency. It doesn't have to be complicated, but
it does need to be clear and accessible those doing writing and editing. We'll get into this in much
more detail later when we talk about project management in a later chapter.

Think about the style guide as the place you go to answer any questions regarding how something
should look. When someone is writing a warning, the style guide should give them instructions on
how that should be formatted. When someone is including an image, the style guide should list any
special instructions for accommodations. The text will work as a reference for your writing, and a
living one at that.

                                                                  51
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       Style guides can and do grow over time. Anytime you have to spend more than a moment deciding
       what something should look like, make a new entry in your style guide. By doing this consistently,
       you'll make sure you have a record of the choices you're making and an explanation of those choices.
       In a group situation, this allows you to hash out your approach once and then maintain it consistent-
       ly across multiple authors and perhaps even multiple documents. In the world of coding, you often
       see a similar documentation alongside code, but also within code in the form of explanatory com-
       ments. In all of the situations above, you're trying to remain consistent and help future you remem-
       ber what past you wanted done.

       The style guide can be fairly simple, as you see in the below example:

       Style Guide for Green Infrastructure Project

       Voice: The overall voice of this document should be formal, though contractions will be allowed.
       Formal titles, names, and address should be used throughout.

       Major Sections: Each major section should be in Impact font, 14pt, bold. The color for each major
       section should be green (color code should be decided by end of project)

       Sub-Sections: Sub-sections should have titles in 12pt Times New Roman and should use italics. The
       color should be standard black.

       Images: All images should include descriptive captions that will be screen-reader accessible.

       Revision Log for Style Guide:

       Version 1.0 Original style guide added

       Version 1.1 Image caption guidelines stipulated to accommodate screen readers as client has several
       members of team that will be using these devices.

       Again, the style guide doesn't have to be too terribly complicated, but it should be a place you can
       go to make sure you're addressing document issues consistently throughout your writing. Making a
       decision once and then referring back to it makes life simpler.

     Section Break--Document Goals and Structure

       1. What is your favorite genre of television? What do you like about that genre, and how do you
       identify it? What boundaries can be broken? What boundaries do you consider to be firm?

       2. Pick a genre of text like a report or a memo. Find as many examples as you can within ten minutes
       of searching online. Quickly catalog the examples. What do the extremes look like?

       3. Find a style guide online. What types of information does the style guide contain? Why do you
       think it is there?

Phase 4: Drafting

Though you might have wondered if we'd ever get here, we're now at the phase of writing where they
actual document comes into shape--drafting. The drafting phase is the most important phase in that
this phase actually creates your text, but it can only be successful if it is built upon a firm foundation
of research from the previous phases. (And yes, this is even true of short emails with an abbreviated
version of the process).

When drafting, you'll be taking your style guide and section outline and fleshing out the content
you'll be creating. In each section, you'll want to draft a text based on your guidelines and your audi-
ence research. When you wonder how to approach a particular subject, think back to your research
on audience and purpose and genre. Any choices you make should be, whenever possible, grounded
in research and tied to your users.

When drafting, I find it is often helpful to skip the introduction of your text and to move directly
into the body. An introduction is designed to introduce a text, but that is fairly difficult if no text ex-
ists. By skipping your introduction and moving into your body you are able to get going on content
you can actually create without needing to know the entire document's content. Once you've finished
the text, go back and introduce it. It may seem counter-intuitive, but it helps quite a bit.

As you go, think a bit about how you're saving your text and how it is accessible. You'll likely want
to have at least one backup of your text, and you may even want to save versions as you go. This will
allow you to revert to an older copy or an earlier point in the process if you realize you've gone in the
wrong direction or realize an earlier draft of a section was better than the current one. Saving your
text can also be useful when accidents happen. If you lose the device with your text, accidentally
delete your current draft, or have a file that gets corrupted, backups make things much less stressful.

Collaborative Drafting

You'll also want to think about making your text accessible to any collaborators. I won't go through
the trouble of advocating for any particular type of solution to share with your collaborators--these
services change and morph all the time. But, I will say that it is ideal to use some platform that hosts
files with synchronized updates when you're doing a lot of work on the same document at once.

If you and your team need to be in the same text at the same time, use a platform that will host the
file natively--a platform that lets you edit in browser in real time. If you just need to have the files
available, you can use different options that will sync up as you need them to.

Above all, don't use email! Nothing in life is worse than trying to reconcile multiple files and mul-
tiple versions of a text into a final document from a chain of emails. Emailing files leads to poor
communication in highly collaborative texts. If you're editing, it's not a big deal. If you're actively
drafting, it can ruin your text, or at least your life for the duration of the project.

Finally, as you draft collaboratively, think about voice and tone. Make sure you've all got the same
supporting documentation to draw on. Make sure that you all have an idea of what the text is
supposed to sound like and how it is supposed to relate to the audience and subject. Life is not fun

                                                                  53
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       when you get a text with two to four authors and each author has written with a different tone and
       vocabulary. At the end of that process you're either rewriting the word choices or putting together
       a series of texts that simply don't belong together. Neither is fun. Create a style guide. Use the style
       guide. Love the style guide.

     Phase 5: Editing and Revision

       Alright, so you've finished your text. Congratulations. Next, you need to make some decisions based
       on your goals, timeline, and resources. You may wonder why editing comes first as you gaze at this
       list, as editing is normally treated as a secondary/final concern--you don't edit something you are go-
       ing to revise heavily. It all comes down to the decision you'll make based on the three topics I men-
       tioned at the start of this paragraph: goals, timeline, and resources.

       Goals

       In some cases, you will want to immediately jump into editing a text when it is finished. Why? Your
       goal may be to get the text out the door quickly and to respond to a pressing request. This would be
       a useful workflow if you're writing an email reply to an important client or member of your organiza-
       tion. You need to get information back quickly in this case, so editing immediately makes sense. You
       aren't going to spend too much time on this text because, frankly, it isn't a major document.

       Think about the level of importance of your text--is your goal a simple response or a durable doc-
       ument that will withstand continued scrutiny and use. Some documents just aren't worth as much
       time as others. That may feel a bit sacrilegious in a writing course, but it is true. If I'm texting some-
       one a quick reply, it is nowhere near as important as a formal assessment document for a graduate
       program I might be writing the same day. As such, I should set my goals accordingly.

       Timeline

       Another item to consider is the timeline you need to meet. Sometimes, you simply don't have a lot of
       time. In those cases, you may need to jump directly into editing. In those types of situations, I rec-
       ommend focusing much of your time on the first two pages. Most readers are going to set their men-
       tal image of your in the first few pages; if you have a ton of errors in that space, they are not going to
       like you very much. However, if your first two pages (or first page even) are immaculate, then you're
       going to get a less critical reader that will forgive more later in the text. In short, you don't want to
       trip the "gotcha" response in your reader. If you start out with tons of errors, then it almost becomes
       a game to find more. If you start out flawlessly, the text becomes a narrative rather than something to
       be read critically while looking for errors.

       In situations where you have ample amounts of time, do not edit first. To do so would be a colossal
       waste of resources and time. Editing is hard work and it takes a lot of focus and time. You don't want
       to spend an hour editing three pages that get deleted from the final text or entirely rewritten after
       testing. If you have more time than a few moments, save editing for last!

Resources

A final consideration is resources. You may note that in the middle of the next section is a testing
phase. Testing is an ideal step in any technical document that will be used. There is almost always a
gap between what happens in the writer's head and what happens when the text is used. Sometimes
that is a gap that has been created because the author is so familiar with a process they skipped a step.
Sometimes it is simply a mismatch in terminology between an interface and a document. In any case,
testing is very useful. But, it is not always something you have resources for.

Testing really can run a spectrum, something we'll talk about later and in the final segment of this
text with research method, but sometimes there just aren't any resources to carry out testing. That
may be because of budgets or timelines, but it can also be due to institutional views of the writing
process. Some organizations simply don't have testing on their radar as something that is done in
technical writing.

In cases where testing is not feasible, go through the text as closely as you can. Think about how
accurate the text will be for its intended use. Read the text aloud if at all possible--this catches more
errors than you'd realize because of the way we read texts of our own creation. Once this is done,
move along to revision or editing, depending on your timeline and goals.

Phase 5a: Editing

Editing, as we discussed previously, is going to be your last phase in virtually any writing context.
Even when you briefly look over a text before you send it, you are in essence editing. But, it comes
first in this list because many times when you are writing you will simply stop here. There won't be
time or need for testing or revision. And, as we discussed--that is okay.

When we talk about editing, we usually think about two types of editing--copyediting and compre-
hensive editing. In some situations, you'll just do copyediting. In other cases, you'll be doing com-
prehensive editing that goes much further. Think about your goals, timeline, and resources when you
make this choice.

Copyediting

Copyediting is simply looking for issues in the text related to grammar, structure, and content. Does
the text do what is says it will? Do the sections come in the correct order? Are terms used consistent-
ly? Is structure consistent? Is the grammar okay? Is the spelling consistent and regionally-situated?

In copyediting, you are looking at the text as a finalized document that needs some checking on the
textual level. In a fast-paced environment, this is a quick glance. In a slow-paced environment, this
may extend to checking terms in a style guide for consistency with institutional norms and spellings.
(For example, if you have British and American clients, you need to standardize color or colour). As
in everything, think about your goals, timeline, and resources.

When carrying out copyediting, you want to ask the following questions of the document before

                                                                  55
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       assessing the document via these questions' answers:

     Copyediting Questions

        What does the document say it does?

        What sections does the document say it contains?

        What is the voice of the document?

        How is the first section formatted?

       Once you have these answers, you can then assess the text. I recommend you move through the
       questions in the order listed above using the answers you've generated as a standard for testing.

       For example, if the document says it will teach you how to true a bicycle wheel, does it actually do
       that? Can you understand the process by reading through the text? If not, you need to revise accord-
       ingly. In cases where you are the author, this is simple. In cases where you are simply an editor, pass it
       back to the author with instructions on what to add.

       As another example, the text might reference an appendix that includes a conversion chart for con-
       verting dosing from milliliters to teaspoons. Does the text actually have that appendix? If it doesn't,
       that calls for revision as well. (Or maybe just locating the lost file).

       With something like voice or formatting or term use, you want to go by the start of the text versus
       the rest. (This is based on the assumption the author at least got the first bit the way they intend-
       ed--that isn't always true, but it can be a good strategy). If the document starts incredibly formal
       and then swaps randomly in one section to being informal, that requires revision. If the text has blue
       headings for the first half, it doesn't need to suddenly swap to green with no reason,. The same goes
       for calling a process by one name and then swapping to another. In technical writing, there is no real
       need for creative re-naming. Consistency and intelligibility are more important than keeping things
       fresh and new.

       Comprehensive Editing

       Comprehensive editing is much more involved than copyediting--make sure you have time and
       resources and it meets your goals. In addition, make sure you do the comprehensive work before you
       copyedit! Just like with editing as a whole, copyediting is listed first because many times that will be
       where you stop due to limits in time, resources, or a mismatch of goals with the process.

       Instead of looking at the details, comprehensive editing looks at the big picture. Does the document
       stand together? Does the order of the text make sense? Is the correct audience being targeted here?
       Should the current sections stay in the text, or should something be added or removed? All of these
       questions are fair game!

       With comprehensive editing, you want to query the document based on the purpose and audience.

56
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

This can be as wide ranging or as narrow as you have time/desire for. The following questions can be
useful in this process:

Comprehensive Editing Questions

 Who is the primary audience?

 How will their context impact their reading of the text?

 Who might be a consulting audience?

 What aspects of the text might need to be tailored to them?

 What is the purpose of this text?

 How does this text fit with other texts in the organization/genre?

Once you have these answers, you can start to comprehensively edit the text. Using these answers,
you have a rubric for grading the text's content, formatting, and style.

To narrow comprehensive editing to something that fits within this sub-section of the book--I teach
an entire course on editing--you can follow the following steps as you go through a comprehensive
editing:

1. Check to make sure the text has everything the audience is going to need. If the audience is made
up of novices, make sure the text has ample explanation of technical terms. If the audience may need
additional resources that will be hard to fine, provide them for the audience.

2. Make sure the text is appropriately ordered to carry out the task at hand. Sometimes when we
write texts, we don't always write in the best order for use. Think about the way the text develops.
Does it build from one section to another? Does one section later in the text need to be earlier for a
section to make sense? If so, consider moving it!

3. Analyze the voice of the text--does it make sense for the subject and audience? Think about who
your audience is and what they will think about your subject. Is the choice of voice appropriate? If
you have a skeptical audience, you likely don't want to have a super-excited voice that doesn't criti-
cally engage with your subject matter. On the other hand, if your audience already agrees with you
fully, it wouldn't make sense to be skeptical of everything.

4. If the text has multiple types of users, make sure they can stay in their lanes. Sometimes, a text will
have a variety of users that will have different skill levels. In those cases, you need to be wary of how
the text is formatted for their use. For example, if you have expert users that know terms and process-
es, you won't want to label each and every step and process--your expert users will get exasperated
quickly. Instead, think about how you can signal that content is for new users. With instructions,
you might have a bold, simple instruction for each step of a process that caters to advanced users or
those referencing the text. Under that bold text, you can include normal formatting in paragraph

                                                                  57
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       form or just a few sentences that explains what the step means in detail for those who are learning for
       the first time. Pretty meta, huh?

       Once you are done with copyediting, you'll want to revise. If you have time, editing again can be
       useful, though at some point you'll want to switch from comprehensive to copyediting. You can con-
       tinually comprehensively edit a text forever. Find a stopping place that honors your goals, timeline,
       and resources.

     Section Break--Editing and Drafting

       1. When does a document warrant comprehensive editing versus simple copyediting? Come up with
       some criteria to help judge when a document commands enough importance to require comprehen-
       sive editing.

       2. Rank the platforms you prefer for group writing, naming your top three. What influences your
       preference? What features matter when you're writing with others?

     Phase 5b: Testing

       Testing is the middle step of our process, though if you have a great deal of time, it may well be the
       first one--it depends on your purpose and audience for testing. Testing can have different permuta-
       tions depending on your resources and timeline. You might simply do internal testing with folks in
       your organization testing out your work. Alternatively, you could actively recruit testers in the gener-
       ic sense to go over your text. Or, you could get the actual users that will use your text to test it--and
       those could be internal or external, depending on what you're writing.

       If you are simply passing something along for internal testing, it is more likely that you might send it
       directly to testers after drafting, or perhaps after a quick edit. With internal testers, you don't have to
       be as concerned with the polish and finish as you might with external testers--they won't be judging
       your organization based on this text. However, in some cases where the politics of internal testing are
       fraught (such as cases where the testers see all of this work as silly), you may want to make sure the
       text is exceptionally polished.

       With external testers, you're going to be either finding folks that fit a generic profile of users or you'll
       be finding the actual users to test with. In each case, you'll want to make sure the text is polished and
       doesn't reflect badly on your organization. With a generic profile, you'll just want to find folks that
       will fit a certain set of parameters to test your text. These may be individuals with similar age ranges
       or skill levels as your users. Or, it could just be the general public. With actual users, something we'll
       cover later in this chapter in more detail, you'll be working with the folks who would be using your
       text to make sure it works as intended.

       Testers can be paid or unpaid, but in each case you need to treat their time and experience as valu-
       able. If you pass along a text riddled with errors that looks like a joke, you're going to be wasting
       your time and theirs. If you go through the trouble of testing a text with outside users, at least make
       sure you have a polished text!

Goals of Testing

When you're doing testing, you're asking folks to use texts as they are intended; in the process of
using them, you're hoping to find problems with the text. You might find that there are terms that
are unclear to the average user. You might find an important step is mislabeled or omitted entirely.
In each case, you're trying to figure out what happens when your text actually gets used the way it
would after it leaves your desk. It may seem like overkill, especially since you're reading this text in
a college classroom environment, but testing can save you and your organization time, money, and
reputation losses associated with sending an awful text out into the world that simply is not fit for
use, or in a worst-case scenario, dangerous.

Later in this chapter, and in the end of the text, we'll get into the specifics of testing. For now, here is
a general workflow you can use for testing:

Testing Workflow

 Identify what you want to learn from testing

 6Find users that will be testing your text

 Have the users make use of the text in ways that will help you learn what you want

 Record or observe this use, or have the users self-report

Take your findings into the revision process or editing process, depending on the changes needed

With the above workflow, you can get a rough idea of how you can update a text to better fit the
intended workflow it will be part of. Later, we'll dive into this with considerably more detail with
specific research methods.

Phase 5c: Revision

So, it has come to this. For many writers, revision is a bad word. Revision is failure to launch, failure
to generate a good text the first time. Nothing could be further than the truth. Revision is central to
the production of great writing--almost no one gets it right the first time. In fact, many of the most
trusted types of texts, such as peer-reviewed academic work or works published by major presses, are
produced in environments that are designed to lead to revision and reflection by the author!

Now, as a note--revision and editing are different in this text, and in general practice. Revision often
happens when an author reflects on a text. Editing usually happens when an outsider or a non-au-
thor reflects on the text. Sometimes revision will incorporate the suggestions of an editor and will be
guided by reviewer feedback. Other times, it is self-contained.

When it comes to revision, you can think about it on two levels: global and local revision. Global re-
vision comes first and involves looking at the big picture of your text; in many ways, it is the author's

                                                                  59
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       side of comprehensive editing. With global revision, you move paragraphs, you check to see if topic
       sentences are supported by the rest of a paragraph, you delete content or add content as needed.
       With local revision, you focus on small-scale stuff. Does this sentence sound right? Is this the correct
       word? How can I fix this comma splice?

       For carrying out revision, you want to first make sure you have ample time to actually revise, and
       you need to make sure you're doing it right. In regards to time, if you are pressed for time, you likely
       will need to focus more on local revision--large-scale changes to a text can create large-scale prob-
       lems. If you don't think you have time for a total overhaul, don't half-overhaul. Focus on fixing what
       is there rather than altering it dramatically. If you do have time, focus on global before local. As with
       comprehensive and copyediting, you don't want to fix something small that will be deleted later
       because the larger component it is part of has been removed from your text.

       Much of the work of revision maps on top of the work of editing--usually revision and editing are
       separate parts of a process. Editing identifies the issues, and revision fixes them. (Every editor varies
       in how much work they do and how much the author does. At the least in modern workflows you'll
       have to approve changes in your text). In the case of a single author, you often do both at the same
       time. Your global revision and comprehensive editing are one and the same. In larger organizations,
       this is broken up into individual roles with different folks doing different parts of the work.

       Carrying out revision effectively takes practice--you learn how to best respond to your own writing
       by responding to your own writing. There isn't one workflow that works best, but below I'll provide
       some checklists for global and local revision to give you a starting point. Not all of these suggestions
       will fit every situation, but consider them a good starting point that you can adapt to your own writ-
       ing. (For example, you might notice after a while that you tend to create a lot of extra "is" formula-
       tions where instead of saying "this takes practice," you say "this is something that takes practice." In
       cases like that, you'll want to focus on finding these "is" formulations because you know that is your
       kryptonite).

     Global Revision Checklist

        Is there a document map?

        Do the major sections follow the plan of the document map?

        Are there sections that shouldn't be in the document?

        Does each paragraph have a topic sentence?

        Does the rest of the paragraph match up with these topic sentences?

       In the above checklist, you focus almost entirely on how the document and paragraphs are struc-
       tured. The idea is that the document map is your starting point--it tells you what should be in the
       text and the order that those things should be in. You'll then audit the rest of the text based on that
       map before descending to the paragraph level and treating each paragraph's topic sentence as a doc-

60
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

ument map for that paragraph, auditing each paragraph's sentences to make sure they fit with that
text's purpose. You can add in some of the extra checklist items from comprehensive editing if you'd
like to make this more thorough.

Local Revision Checklist

 If you have time, read the document aloud.

 If you are pressed for time, read the first page aloud

 Search for errors you know that you often make

 Double-check terms that are important for the text

 Work on re-writing sections (important ones especially) that you feel have poor flow or read badly

In the second checklist, you're focusing almost entirely on small-scale issues. Reading the document
aloud is central to effective local editing (and copyediting many times), because it forces you to actu-
ally read each work. Often times when we read, we skim without realizing it. When we read our own
work, we tend to both skim and edit the text as we read; we read what we meant rather than what it
says. Reading aloud gets around both of these issues and helps with the problem most of us face--
we can't stand reading our own work. You can also have your word processor read to you, but I find
reading aloud keeps you more focused and able to catch errors.

Phase 6: Proofing

Proofing is a phase of the writing process that many guides and writers overlook, but it can be the
most important one when it comes to costly mistakes and embarrassing errors. You'll sometimes see
it called proofreading. Proofing involves the creation of proofs--samples of your final document with
all of the production choices and text choices put into the form they will have in publication.

Proofing is valuable because it can catch errors that won't show up in the drafting process alone. For
example, you might think that a certain color combination looks great with a certain type of paper
when you're drafting, but when you actually get the printed proof, it looks awful and the colors
clash. Or, you might have accidentally used an RGB color code when you should have used CMYK
and your text or document has colors that are nothing like what you expected and planned for. Or,
you might realize that a choice of font size or style simply doesn't allow for easy reading when placed
into a real-world document. Proofing helps you catch these errors before you've paid for an entire
run of a document.

In college writing, proofing is not something you run into that much. Most of your writing in classes
is often in an office-style program that will go to your professor. Most technical writing, however,
goes to outside audiences that will be using your texts. Whereas proofing doesn't usually make sense
in college settings because you rarely get something professionally printed and put together, it is a

                                                                  61
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       must in professional settings.

       Proofing can be very project-dependent, but a few suggestions can help when you're looking over a
       proof. We will cover proofing again when we discuss the production process later in the text.

     Proofing Checklist

        Do all of the images look correctly colored and free of pixelation?

        Are all fonts correct or have some fonts been substituted for incorrect ones?

        Are the colors accurate?

        Is the paper correct?

        Is all content on the page, or is some content cut off due to being too close to the binding or too close to the
       edge of the document (the bleed region)?

        Can the document be read easily

        Are there any errors in formatting or spelling or grammar?

       By following through with proofing after final revision, you can catch some last-minute errors and
       mismatches between what you hoped to find when you created your document and what you find
       in front of you. Again, proofing is about saving you money and embarrassment--you don't want to
       print a run of hundreds or thousands of pages with really awkward and obvious errors throughout.
       Even the best editor will miss some errors--proofing gives you a chance to catch and replace those
       before you pay money to get them printed and sent out to your users.

       If you want to take things to the next level, you can do some proofreading as well. Proofreading as
       part of the editing process involves taking the last version of the text that was editing and reading
       through it and the final proof concurrently, looking for situations where changes that should have
       been made didn't make it into the final document.

     Phase 7: Publication

       Congratulations--you did it. Publication is the final phase of the writing process, a process you may
       have thought would never end in this text. With publication, you are confident in your text and
       your proof and you're ready to send it out to the world. Often publication is a matter of logistics and
       delivery--you want to make sure the write amount of documents get out to the right people at the
       right time. We'll cover publication more in Chapter 6.

       For publication, you have a fairly simple checklist:

 Who needs a copy of the text?

 When do they need it?

Once you've made sure you've got your bases covered, the writing process for your document is over!
Congrats--it got published.

Section Break--Testing, Revision, Proofing, and Publishing

1. Carry out some basic testing on an institutional website of your choosing. Pick a website from
your institution you are familiar with and have someone else in the class that isn't familiar with the
site carry out some tasks. Make note of how they perform and where they have issues. Prepare a brief
report on the test that you could pass along to the webmaster.

2. Revision can be a struggle for almost any writer. What do you struggle with during revision? What
tactics do you use to avoid these struggles or to overcome them? Share with the rest of your class and
look for common ground and new strategies for succeeding.

Usability, Use, and Participatory Design

Having looked at the writing process and the way it relates to use and users, we're now ready to
tackle a much broader topic--usability, user-centered design, and participatory design. While the
writing process we've looked at is a fairly simple conception of the interaction between the user and
the author, this section will dive into a much more hands-on approach that we can and often should
use to make sure our work is going to match up with the needs of actual users. We have so much we
can learn from our users: they are the world's foremost experts on the tasks they carry out on a daily
basis.

Usability as an Approach to Writing and Design

Usability is entirely oriented around use--how easy to use is a device or a system or a building or a
text? Does it allow different types of use? Does it guide users to use it correctly? Is it open to users
with different accessibility issues? All of this and more come into usability, though the term gets
thrown around today in ways that more often than not imply a sleek design rather than a usable one.

For us, usability and user-centered design come down to putting users and use before produc-
tion-oriented concerns. This isn't always possible to the extent we'd like, but it is an ideal that we
should continually strive towards. After all, our documents are supposed to be used and should be
designed around that use rather than their production.

                                                                  63
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       What does production-centered design look like, and how is user-centered design different? Produc-
       tion-centered design is a design process where we write or design a document in a way that makes
       things as simple as possible for us, the person doing the writing, or our organization, the group
       putting the writing out into the world. What is easy for you is not always easy for users. Sometimes
       there are legitimate production-centered issues that impact users, such as two-factor authentication
       that makes logging into a service much safer, but also more of a hassle. However, most produc-
       tion-centered issues come to placing the author before the user.

       For example, you might use your own terms or disciplinary terms in a document that is meant for
       the general public. Production-centered design focuses on gets the text out the door with the most
       efficient and writer-centered choice available. Often, that choice is simply keeping complex terms.
       After all, if someone really wants to understand what is going on they'll do the research. Right?
       Unfortunately, internal or disciplinary terms can be an insurmountable barrier to some, or may turn
       some readers off a text entirely. Think about water quality reports and ingredient lists on packages--
       if you don't understand what the words mean, you've got to do a lot of digging to figure them out,
       and even if you figure them out, you may not know what the associated text means for you. Should
       I be worried about turbidity or anhydrous dextrose? Production-centered design leaves that question
       up to me and the Internet. That's an awful combination.

       User-centered design takes a different tack entirely. It asks what the reader needs from a text to make
       use of it effectively, often couching that question in actual research with users in the manner that
       we've discussed previously. While this is more work, it often results in documents that are more effec-
       tive and users that are much more fond of your organization and your work. While many organiza-
       tions talk about usability as part of their workflow, not very many actually go through the trouble of
       making their work user-centered as opposed to production-centered with some lip service to users at
       the tail end of the development process. You can think about user-centered design as a competitive
       advantage!

       What does usability as an approach look like? We can visualize it with a simple comparison of the
       two different approaches as competing workflows:

       Production-Centered Design

                1. Assess purpose

                2. Draft Document

                3. Edit Document

                4. Test Document with users (optional)

                5. Revise document lightly

                6. Publish

User-Centered Design

         1. Assess Purpose Internally

         2. Assess Purpose with users

         3. Finalize purpose weighing internal and external factors

         4. Draft document

         5. Edit document

         6. Test document with users

         7. Revise document as heavily as needed

         8. Publish

In the two cases, the difference is how quickly the user is consulted and how aggressive that consul-
tation is. The two permutations above are aggressively different, though user-centered design can
operate on a spectrum between highly involved and lightly involved. The main difference is that
users are taken into account from the start. At the extremes of production-centered design, users are
an afterthought at best. They are simply the people that make the document or system work, and the
document or system's effective circulation/operation is the most important consideration.

Now, sometimes we do have more production-oriented designs for special reasons such as security.
If you are writing documents that contain highly sensitive documentation, you may have a more pro-
duction-centered workflow that doesn't let you open up your text to users as much. Why? Because
things that would make the document easier for users would also comprise the security of the work-
flow. Sometimes we pay a price in ease of use for added security in technical writing settings. With
that said, a good technical writer goes to great lengths to minimize the impact on readers in such
situations.

The drafting process we sketched out earlier in this chapter you may note is closer to the produc-
tion-centered design end of the spectrum than the example above because purpose is primarily seen
as being an internal matter. Practically speaking, this is a concession to political realities--you often
are not given enough time and space to assess purpose with your users and your organization. In
an ideal world though, that is part and parcel of the design process. Note that you could easily add
external users to our process from earlier and make your process instantly more user-centered.

Participatory Design

At the extreme end of the user-centered design world is what is known as participatory design--
design where the user is a participant from the get-go, much like the example we just finished dis-
cussing. This kind of work is hard, but the benefits can be immense. The major difference between
user-centered and participatory design is agency. Participatory design gives the user agency and con-
trol over the design process rather than simply consulting them for more data to help make decisions

                                                                  65
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

       about the writing process.

       When it comes to letting users into the process of drafting a text at the start (and giving them
       agency), things can get tricky matter. There are ethical concerns--users might criticize their boss and
       their boss might find out! There are also logistical concerns--how do you end up getting good infor-
       mation from folks and getting them together with designers? And, there are political and financial
       concerns--how do you convince your organization to let users help you think through things and
       spend time that could be used drafting to communicate (and possibly compensate) your readers?

       With that said, participatory design can be a huge boon for your organization because your readers
       and users know more about what they need and want than anyone out there! Often times when users
       work, they work around bad workflows and bad documentation. How many times have you seen in
       a professional environment a situation where a document or piece of software is lightly used or mis-
       used? Think about a clinical setting where someone is putting information into a client management
       software system--many times huge sections of the system are skipped because they simply don't fit
       the need of the office, but the software wasn't customized to those needs so they are there anyway.
       How many times have you been handed a form and someone tells you, "don't worry about that--we
       never use it!"? In each of these cases you have documents being misused because they don't fit actual
       workflows or they impede them.

       By taking what users know about how things actually work and what they actually need, you can
       make a better document, build a better experience for users, and make everyone happier in the pro-
       cess ideally. You can remove content that isn't going to be needed, you can add content that is needed
       but not present, and you can build a relationship with the folks you interact.

       With all of this said, participatory design isn't a fit for every situation. In some cases, users want
       things that are not possible for legal reasons. In the case of real estate, the user might want to indicate
       the type of buyer they want for their home. That's illegal. In other cases, the benefits just aren't worth
       the cost. Participatory design is not for every situation, but for situations where your users are going
       to be incorporating a document heavily into the way they work and operate, it can be useful.

       Doing Participatory Design

       Having talked a great bit about participatory design, what does that workflow look like? An extreme
       commitment to participatory design can be seen below where I've sketched out what an example
       might look like where you commit from the front to back of a design process to working with users
       rather than for users. Again, this is not practical or even advantageous in every situation, but in the
       right circumstances it can be invaluable! (And, this is just one suggested workflow--it by no means
       represents the entirety of participatory design).

66

Participatory Design Workflow

1. Build relationship with users--find out what they like and dislike about documents
2. Come up with parameters for the design process--what will be the scope and timeline?
3. Arrange to work with users to brainstorm ideas on the document's purpose
4. Come to agreement internally and externally on purpose
5. Draft a skeletal outline of the document/system
6. Consult with users for feedback and comments
7. Revise the draft/skeleton
8. Consult with users for feedback and comments
9. Complete the document as envisioned
10. Test the document with users, soliciting feedback and suggestions
11. Revise the document as heavily as possible, potentially reverting to step 4
12. Test the document again
13. Revise the document as needed
14. Publish the document
15. Consult users regularly on the document's impact and unforeseen issues
16. Revise periodically with user's input and consultation
As I have mentioned, the above is a heavy investment into working with users. It isn't always the best
choice, but it can literally give you information that can be found nowhere else and can help you
find solutions to problems that you aren't even aware of that impact the way your organization and
those that use its documents operate.
When to use participatory design?
In an ideal world, I suppose you would use participatory design for every single major writing
project. After all, folks should have a say when things are going to impact how they work and live.
But, we don't live in that ideal world and we often have to work in environments that aren't open to
participatory design. So, when should you take the time to aim or participation? The checklist below
can help you think through this question:

                                                                  67
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

     Participatory Design Assessment

        Do my users operate with my document in ways that I don't understand?

        Do I often see users using documents in ways different than intended?

        Are there problems between the way forms are filled out and how my organization uses them?

        Do I have a relationship with the users that I can leverage?

        Can I have users participate in an ethical and legal way?

       Answering the questions above can give you an idea if you have enough benefits to start to make an
       argument for user-focused participatory design. If your organization doesn't already use participato-
       ry design, you may have to start with baby steps, working your way towards this process with some
       user-centered choices. In all such situations, be on the lookout for ways that you show the benefits
       of getting outside feedback--you need to be able to explain how working with users benefits the
       bottom line.

       What might things look like if your organization and your users are going to benefit from participa-
       tory design? One example might be the process of buying real estate. Buying a home or other type
       of property is often a dizzying task for many first-time buyers. You have to consult a bank, you have
       to find a realtor to work with, you have to tour properties, understand loan options, make bids and
       assessments of value, navigate inspections--all kinds of peril await! But, what if the process was full
       of documents that were designed in participatory ways?

       In such a scenario, a real estate group would consult with the types of first-time and recurring clients
       they operate with. They would ask the clients what types of things they do well, and what types of
       things they don' t do so well. They might focus on things like client education. When a real estate
       relationship starts, how much information is shared with the client? Perhaps a client is going to be
       buying a rural property that is eligible for federal grants for rural development. What does the client
       want to know? How would they use that information to assess things? Those are questions that only
       the real estate group could answer by workshopping with clients about what is valuable and not-so-
       valuable.

       With recurring clients, maybe more of the information revolves around getting loans and paying
       taxes when you are buying multiple properties, operating as an LLC or other legal construct, or
       operating across state lines. In those situations, the same type of workshopping with clients could
       be advantageous. You can identify what they need, what they ignore in current information, and the
       times and places they simply need questions answered that you either aren't answering or aren't being
       asked in the first place.

       The outcome of these workshops would likely be a draft of some informational documents for the
       clients, documents which could be tested with clients as they navigate the process, and documents
       that could be assessed at the end of real estate deals for suggestions to tweak them on an ongoing
       basis.

68
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2

The end result of all of this would be a series of real estate documents and a workflow for clients that
would likely go above and beyond what is found with other real estate groups. Yes, there would be a
cost, but the benefits would be immense with clients having a firmer understanding of their options
and a greater connection with the real estate group and appreciation for their efforts to make the
process as demystified and clear as possible.

Section Break--Usability and Users

1. Where do you see usability referenced in your daily life? How is it used? Do you think these repre-
sentations reflect on what we've discussed? Why or why not?

2. Think about your own institution: what systems on campus could benefit from a user-centered or
participatory design approach? Why do you think this would be beneficial? How would you argue
for this change with the upper administration in terms that they would appreciate?

Institutional Writing

Having looked at drafting and design and usability, we will close this chapter with a few notes about
writing in institutional settings. When you write in an institution, you operate differently than when
you write in your college classes or when you write on your own. The institution will have its own
conception of what it does, how it is seen, how it operates, and what it expects from documents. This
understanding will then be layered onto the hierarchy of the organization with your supervisors and
coworkers and subordinates all bringing their own understanding of the institution, their own un-
derstanding of how things work/don't work, and all the fun unwritten and written rules that pervade
such situations.

When you join an organization, one of the most important things you can do as a writer is to figure
out how things work and how they don't work. Many times this involves a savvy interrogation of
the written and unwritten rules, a process that can be daunting. To make sense of all of this, you can
append the following suggestions to your existing writing workflow:

Institutional Writing Questions

 What am I being asked to do? Who is asking?

 What does the document I'm creating normally look like?

 If I'm creating a new document, who will it need to make happy?

 How does the institutional normally communicate? What voice/terms are used?

 Is there a style guide? Does it apply to my document?

                                                                  69
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 2
       By asking the above questions, you can become more aware of the situation you are writing in with
       a new institution. In many cases, the secret to effective institutional writing is to simply take things
       slow. Watch what other people are doing. Think about what they're not doing that you might natu-
       rally do in your own writing. Take all of this into account as you slowly learn what is going to work
       for you as a new hire/member.

     Section Break--Institutional Writing

       1. What are the unwritten rules of communicating as a college student? Why do you think these
       rules exist?
       2. How does your institution express itself? Describe the institutional voice and the way that the
       institution talks in official channels and social media. For an added challenge, write a new text using
       this voice to announce an event or special occasion.

Visual Communication & Technical Writing
                                               Open Technical Writing  Chapter 1

       In our third chapter, we're going to be looking at the visual side of technical writing. It may seem
       a bit unusual that in a text on writing that we are going to be spending an entire chapter on visual
       design, but more and more the visual design of technical documents has become increasingly im-
       portant for authors and users. With that said, this is not document design--we will be talking about
       document design in the next chapter, and document design is as important as visual design. In some
       ways they are the same sort of process, but for our purposes we're going to talk about visual design
       first before diving into document design. To differentiate between the two, consider visual design
       anything that is primarily visual in nature added to a text--a graphic, an image, etc. Document de-
       sign, on the other hand, is the visual nature of the text itself--the formatting, the colors, the paper,
       etc.

       One advantage that we have over past practitioners of technical writing is that we can actually spend
       time on visual communication and carry it out without years of practice working on our skills at
       actually drawing the visuals we want to use. Desktop publishing technology has entirely changed the
       way visual design happens in technical communication over the last three decades by giving almost
       anyone the ability to design competent visuals. In the last several years, with the boom in infograph-
       ics and other design-heavy presentations of data, this process has only gotten easier and more friend-
       ly to newcomers, all the while become more advanced and powerful for those willing to put in the
       time to truly manipulate data and design.

       In addition, many technical deliverables are found in electronic form first, print form second. The
       advantage of this change in format conveys to visual design can't be understated. Printing in color,
       especially vibrant and heavily colored texts, isn't cheap (though it has gotten markedly cheaper and
       more accessible). Designing for the screen first grants us much more freedom to use visuals that have
       a robust palette of colors to indicate any amount of information--though if our text will also be
       printed in black and white it can add in new challenges.

       Why does visual design matter?
       One question that may be on your mind as you read this chapter intro is simply, why does visual
       design matter in technical writing? The answer is all around us really--more and more of our com-
       munication is visual. Think about how much time we spend on computers of any format--mostly
       phones these days. These devices are often almost entirely visual--there is very little tactile feedback
       outside of vibration.

       Concurrent with this rise in the visual is the rise in the prestige of certain visual designs. It isn't
       enough to have a phone--you need a phone looks awesome. Sometimes, even the manufacturers of
       these phones get caught up in this, embracing trendy choices without necessarily thinking about the
       usability of something like a fingerprint sensor on the back of phone or a notch carved out of the top
       of the screen. This can go even deeper than visuals--think about how small your phone's thickness is
       compared to a phone from five years ago. I wonder how much more battery life we'd all have if our
       phones were the same thickness but had the more advanced batteries we use today.

       The problem with visual design, as we've hinted at just now, is that what looks good isn't always what
       works well for users. Too many times a design is created because matches an existing trend or has
       visual appeal--not because it makes whatever task the visuals are draping easier to perform.

72
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

Now, just because visual design can become too central doesn't mean visual design is bad. Visual
design is vitally important because there is so much we can say with visuals that we can't say in a
compressed space with words. Think about the logo of your university's athletic teams--when you
see that logo, you see more than just the letters and images and colors, and what you see is controlled
by your circumstance and your situation. In addition to brevity, visual design can also bring clarity.
Sometimes you can more clearly see something than you can read about it, especially when you're
dealing with a very delicate task like soldering a resistor into just the right place on a circuit board.

Visuals can also have an ethical case--some folks can't read or can't read the language that your text
has been written in. With the use of visuals, you can make it more likely that someone will be able
to understand your text and act accordingly. If you doubt the usefulness of visuals that work across
cultures and languages, you've never had to go the restroom badly while visiting a country where you
don't speak the language.

How does visual communication work?

When we use visual communication, something happens that allows us to see the visual as more than
a simple collection of different components--we don't see a visual, we see the rhetoric embodied by
the visual. As hinted at earlier with our sports team example, visuals don't function as individual parts
or even as a simple sum of their individual parts. Visuals operate using complex rhetorical systems
that we'll be referring to from this point onward as visual conventions.

A rhetorical aside
Now, before we go further we should probably take a moment and unpack the whole idea of rhet-
oric. Much like our usage of technical writing, rhetoric is a term that means a lot to a lot of people.
By many definitions this entire textbook is a book about rhetoric, though I've not chosen to make
rhetoric the term that we use over and over again to talk about what we're doing. Rhetoric is, in our
terms, the available means of persuasion in a given situation. If there isn't any room for persuasion in
a situation, there isn't any room for rhetoric either.

To unpack this definition, rhetoric is looking for points where you can work to bring others around
to your way of looking at things, or at least the point of view or information you're advocating for.
Parents use rhetoric when they attempt to convince kids to eat a new food: "It tastes just like those
tacos we had last week!" Razor manufacturers use rhetoric to sell their newest blade: "Get an even
better shave than ever before!" Phone designers use rhetoric when they pitch something as the new-
est, the best, or as "magical."

In each of these cases, rhetoric is the identification of the audience, of what that audience values,
of how the message will impact the audience, and then ideally the use of that information to create
something that will appeal to the user/reader/hearer. Sounds a lot like our second chapter, doesn't it?
Thinking about the examples above, the parent is using their knowledge of the child's appreciation of
tacos to make a favorable comparison, to re-write the way the child sees a dish. The shaving example
playing off the doubts you may have about your current shave--could it be better? The phone design
is playing on your desire to have the best, the brightest, the shiniest, and to have the prestige (unspo-

                                                                  73
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

       ken in this case) of having a device with all of these attributes. Each of these approaches is a rhetor-
       ical approach, one based on research and considerable of where a text is going, where it is coming
       from, and what it is about.

       Other definitions of rhetoric you may be more familiar with usually revolve around something being
       "just rhetoric." These definitions are usually referring rhetoric's role in making a text or idea more
       palatable, making rhetoric like a costume, a style, or even a seasoning for your text/idea. None of this
       is wrong, per se, but the focus on rhetoric as window dressing cuts off the most valuable part of what
       rhetoric brings to the table as a lens to see the world. Rhetoric may be many things, but it excels at
       helping us think through ideas to make them worthwhile to others.

       As I noted earlier, much of our text is based on rhetoric, though we've not been using the term
       directly. As someone who was schooled in rhetoric from start to finish in my doctoral training, the
       approach is the most fundamental one I can imagine. With that said, rhetoric is a very broad field of
       study with any number of applications. As such, I use technical writing and technical-writing-based
       terms to discuss much of the content of this text. Audience analysis is very much rhetorical analysis,
       but I prefer audience analysis because it hews closer to the technical and the formulation makes us
       more aware of the transactional nature of our writing. We could use rhetoric, but that is a broader
       term and for our case I prefer the more focused one.

       Having said all of that, visual rhetoric really is the best term for what we're discussing right now be-
       cause it gets at exactly what we're talking about. We are looking at the available means of persuasion
       in the visual arena, looking at what visuals mean, what they do, and where the come from, and how
       we can use them to persuade and educate.

       Back to visual communication--how does it work?
       Much of the approach we'll be using in this chapter involves visual conventions, a rhetorical con-
       cept developed by Charles Kostelnick and Michael Hassett in their book Shaping Information:
       The Rhetoric of Visual Conventions (2003). For Kostelnick and Hassett, visual conventions are an
       inherently rhetorical communication style that relies on a bevy of hidden conventions and histories
       to make sense, conventions that will change and evolve over time, rising and falling in response to
       the course of history. Their book is awesome and I recommend it to anyone and everyone who does
       visual design.

       With any given visual design, what matters are the visual conventions that the design creates, re-
       defines, integrates, or ignores. These visual conventions are choices in the design process that have
       come to mean something to certain folks (sometimes even meaning different things to different
       people). These visual conventions have rhetorical effects--they move people to understand things a
       certain way, to treat information a certain way, and to see visuals as conveying a certain type of infor-
       mation or a certain type of authority or association.

       Sometimes a visual convention's meaning is mandated--think about the road sign that you follow
       on any given drive. There aren't really options when it comes to depicting the speed limit of a given
       stretch of road--the design is a convention that is used over and over again across the country. In
       each case when you see the speed limit sign, the combination of the white color, the shape of the

74
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

sign, and the font and wording on the sign all signal to you that this is an official government sign
informing you of the expected limit to your vehicle's speed on this stretch of road. Sometimes the
placement can vary to make the sign less effective for drivers (though perhaps more effective for offi-
cers giving tickets), but the sign always means the same thing because of the power of the visual con-
vention and because of the various laws and ordinances preventing competition with other designs
and information. In the case of these signs, the rhetorical weight of the national or state government
is behind each visual because of the associations with that government and the interactions those
signs can prompt with law enforcement because of their correlation with state and federal laws.

In other cases, a visual design can be subject to tweaking and manipulation. Think about the veri-
table industry that has popped up over the last several years drawing on t-shirt mashups of various
fandoms. The designs in those shirts often play on potentially obscure mashups of different elements
of pop culture fandoms, creating a shirt that is quite meaningful to those that get the reference.

Wearing a shirt with visual references is a rhetorical move--you're showing those around you, or
making the claim, that you are a part of a particular group with a particular mindset. When you put
on an "I'm With Her" t-shirt or a "Make American Great Again" hat--you bring with you every-
thing that anyone has ever associated with those visuals and invite classification of your political pref-
erences. In fact, the power of political clothing in particular is something so great that it has spawned
numerous laws and lawsuits related to voting and voter intimidation.

As you may be aware, or not, the printed page is also a visual convention, a bit of visual rhetoric.
When you see a printed page with black text and white paper and clear margins on each of the four
sides, you realize you are reading a printed page. That, in and of itself, has implications! How many
documents have you not read simply because they looked like a printed page rather than something
more interesting or quickly readable? Visual rhetoric gets complicated quickly.

What are these conventions saying to you that immediately makes you lack interest?

Using visual conventions

As technical writers, we want to ask ourselves--what do we need to convey visually in this situation?
The question of how to convey something visually can get complex quickly due to the multitude of
factors that impact how a visual is interpreted. To navigate the process effectively, you need to ask the
right questions and identify the issues that may pop up with your visual choices. There are risks and
rewards to using visuals heavily in a text, and the risks can multiply as you lean harder into your visu-
als to carry the weight of your meaning. Too many references, too many meanings, and your visuals
can become more complicated than a word-based text!

                                                                  75

       When you go to design visuals, try starting with the workflow/questions below to guide your visual
       design and thought process:

     Drafting Visual Rhetoric

       1. What is the goal/purpose of the visual?

       2. What needs to be conveyed?

       3. Who will be the audience and what visuals will they recognize?

       4. Are there any visuals that could be altered or integrated to fit the purpose?

       5. What will the visual look like?--Draft it.

       6. What associations, good and bad, come with the visuals?

       7. What legal guidelines, if any, impact the visuals?

       8. Will this visual be understood, or will it need to be explained?

       9. Finish it or return to a previous phase.

       1)What is the goal/purpose?
       First off, you need to decide your purpose and goal for the visual. If the visual is a stand-alone
       document, then this process is much more involved. If the visual is a part of a larger document, or a
       single document that is part of a larger campaign, then you often have less work before you when it
       comes to deciding what your goal and purpose are.

       The goal and purpose are going to be guiding principles for you, just like with the drafting process.
       You need to make sure that you keep your goal and principle in mind always--they are the rubric
       that you will use to grade your work and that you will use to judge the choices that are available.
       Never allow your design to take control of your drafting process! Your purpose is what matters--not
       the awesomeness of the design. There are a lot of awesome looking designs out there that are abso-
       lutely awful documents or experiences because the folks creating them became so enamored of their
       visual design that they forgot that people had to actually use the text. To quote Dr. Ian Malcolm,
       "[they] were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they
       should."

       2)What needs to be conveyed?
       Going along with the question of purpose, we need to figure out what exactly the visual is going to
       be doing--what is it going to convey? To answer this question, you need to ask whether the visual
       will be carrying all of the weight or simply part of the weight of your project. If it is the sole doc-
       ument, then it will convey all of your information. If it is part of a document...well...you get the
       picture. Make a list of everything the visual needs to convey, and then run that list by your purpose

76
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

and weed out things that don't fit the criteria of your purpose.

Once you have an idea of what you'll be conveying, try to get specific. What particular values are go-
ing to be conveyed? What specific data? Go beyond simple typology and get into how much data will
be there and what format it will have. These considerations matter a great deal. During this process
don't be afraid to doubt the creation of your text--sometimes a visual needs help and that is okay.

3)Who will be the audience and what will they recognize?
Once you have an idea of what information you should be conveying and your purpose, you need to
run this all past your audience and what they're going to need and understand. This might seem a bit
backwards, but you want to at least have a firm idea of your own goals before you hit the audience
angle. You don't want to have this project/visual spiral out of control.

At this point, you may need to add some information if your audience needs some help--that is al-
right. But, always keep your purpose in mind. Your text doesn't need to do everything your audience
could ever desire and want. It needs to complete the goals you've set for it. Sometimes you need to
expand what you thought the text would be to do that, but you make that expansion with your goals
and purpose in mind!

If you realize that your audience may need more than your purpose allows, you have some hard con-
versations ahead potentially. When you want to make a project bigger, there are often institutional
concerns about mission creep--letting a project grow until it basically can do anything and every-
thing. More often than not, good projects do one thing well rather attempting to do all the things.
As such, organizations can be--rightfully so many times--opposed to expanding what a document is
supposed to do. If you feel strongly that a text needs to be expanded, make sure to couch your con-
versation in language that serves your organization--show them how this is going to help them too.

When it comes to what your audience will recognize, you're going to be thinking about what you
can rely on without explanation and what you can rely on with explanation. Most folks understand
what a stop sign is, but not everyone can quickly read the chemical hazard sign that you find on the
doors of laboratories with dangerous chemicals inside. That's okay. Part of your visual design at times
should be an explanation of the design itself--that is what a key on a map is for after all.

4)Are there any visuals that could be altered or integrated for the purpose?
Once you know who your audience will be and what they will recognize, you can move along to the
next phase and decide what visual conventions could be altered or used for your purpose.

In some cases, you can quickly alter a visual to make something visible. You might, for example, take
a generic soccer jersey shape and then use that shape as a frame in Illustrator with a nation's flag un-
derneath. The end result is a quickly-made graphical representation of a national soccer team. In this
case, you've identified two visuals that make sense to your audience/user--the national flag and the
soccer jersey. Combining the two is fairly seamless and with the right context (such as a poster title
referencing the beautiful game) the visuals should fit right in and explain things visually at a glance.

The goal here is to identify what visuals would be useful, or to create some visuals to be useful. You

                                                                  77
                   Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

can mashup various conventions to make one whole convention, or you can rely on a single con-
vention or two to make things work. Don't think about this as a close-ended process; this stage is all
about coming up with ideas.

Create a list as you work of what conventions might work or might be modified to fit your needs.
If you want, jot down some notes as to why you've chosen this convention and how it might work/
integrate with your purpose, audience, or content.

5)What will the visual look like?--Draft it!
For the next phase, you'll want to take all of your information and come up with at least one or two
drafts of what your visual could look like. One thing that may be helpful as you go through this
process is to get all of your data into one place where you can reference it clearly. A table can often
help for these purposes:

Purpose and Goals  Contents     Audience and      Possible        Combined
                             Audience Knowledge  Conventions  Conventions/Final

                                                                 Visual Ideas

       With a table like the one above, you can see your information and make connections across the ma-
       trix you've created. This can be extremely helpful in group writing situations and can help you see/
       make connections that you might not make or see when you're simply referencing a list or talking
       out loud.
       After you've gotten some ideas together, sketch them out. Don't spend a ton of time on polishing
       your concept though--you want to make sure this is something you can/should stick with!

       6)What associations, good and bad, come with the visuals?
       Next, you want to take stock of your visuals and what they connote. This may be something you've
       been doing all along, but sometimes you can include some imagery without critically engaging with
       what that will mean and say to others.

       In this phase, take a hard look at your visual drafts. What are they saying? What type of message is
       being conveyed? Does this align with your purpose and your content and your public image? If not,
       you may need to make some changes. Your audience is crucial in this phase--you might even want
       to reach out to some testers and get some feedback from the audience you are targeting. There could
       be positive, negative, or political associations with some of the visual conventions you've chosen
       without you having realized the connections that exist! Just because you don't see them doesn't mean

78
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

you'll not get implicated in any mishaps.

For example, you may have chosen a shade of red that is associated with a major rival of the flagship
state university's football team. You likely wouldn't want to have that color associated with your proj-
ect, especially during a tense football season. But, if you're not huge football fans, you might not real-
ize that a connection exists. Getting some outside feedback can be really helpful when you're figuring
out what exactly your visual conventions may be saying. Don't be Picard on Risa with a horga'hn.

7)Will this visual be understood, or will it need to be explained?
Next, you'll want to make sure your visual can be understood, or if it can't be understood that you
provide interpretation. If your entire visual is difficult to understand, you'll likely need to revert to a
previous phase of development. There isn't much use in creating an entirely novel set of conventions
that require painstaking explanations. (Sure, you can make some what-about cases, but for the most
part entirely novel designs that make sense to no one are a bad idea).

As you consider your visuals, run past what you're conveying and what your purpose is and combine
that with your audience. Where are the gaps that might appear? Once you've identified those gaps,
create some explanations to help guide the user. If the gaps can't be bridged, redesign!

For example, you might be using the soccer jersey with national flag example from earlier in an info-
graphic. In addition to the jersey, you might also be including soccer balls that represent 500 people
in order to create an infographic about the average attendance of home games for the national team.
In the case of the ball and the 500 people, there is not a direct visual convention that exists. No one
that I'm aware of naturally associates 500 people with an icon of a soccer ball. Since that is the case,
you'll want to label this aspect of your visual accordingly, teaching your reader that the value of a
single soccer ball in your visual is 500 people in attendance.

8)What legal guidelines, if any, impact the visuals?
This step comes late in the process, though depending on the field you're working in, it might need
to come earlier. In this phase, we're going to basically be assessing the legal guidelines that impact our
text in one way or another.

You may primarily want to think about copyright here--visual design is an area that has lots of tan-
gles that you can get into. You can't simply use the Nike swoosh and think everything is going to be
okay. Make sure that you have the rights to the visuals that you will be using!

Go through your visuals--are there any copyrighted or trademarked aspects that you're using? Do
you own those or have permission for their use? If you don't, see if you want to take the trouble to
get the visuals or if you simply need to design around the issue. Be warned--if you are using parody
or satire, you can still end up in a legal battle.

9)Finish it up or return to a previous phase
Once you've finished the previous steps, you should have a final candidate and be confident in the
candidate's effectiveness and legality. In that case, put some final polish onto the design and get it
ready to go. If, however, you're not happy with what you've found yourself with, take some time to

                                                                  79
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

       go back in the design process.

     Section Break--Visuals and Production

       1. What are the iconic visuals associated with your institution? How are they protected? How are
       they parodied or used by 3rd parties?
       2. What conventions are protected by regulation in your major area of study due to their impor-
       tance?

   Signs, Safety, and Visual Rhetoric

       When you're working with visuals and visual communication, one important aspect of this type of
       work to keep in mind is the presence of safety and warning signage and their associated conventions
       and representations. As with any type of visual rhetoric, there are conventions that will come into
       play and conventions that can be flouted or adapted. Think about this section as an extended adden-
       dum to the previous, one that goes over a few issues that are of note when we're working with visual
       conventions and rhetoric that involve safety and signage.

       Warnings and Color Systems
       One ever-present part of almost any instruction manual or poster is the warning and caution system.
       These warning systems are so regular for some of us that we almost ignore/internalize them, but they
       are worth focusing on specifically as technical writers. When you have any sort of technical process,
       you have some aspects of that process that are more dangerous or more important than others. You
       may have some steps, for example, that are particularly troublesome or have just historically caused
       issues (even if you wouldn't think they would--people are weird). In those cases, you may need a
       warning note or signage.

       Coloration is one important part of warnings and cautions. When we think about the Western use
       of such colors, we often resort to the colors red and yellow for our work--these colors map onto our
       streetlights and are used in any number of areas. The visual rhetoric behind these choices is fair-
       ly universal--when you see red, you're expected to stop or expect some serious consequences that
       should be avoided or that you should be made aware of. When you see yellow, you're going to expect
       to slow down or realize that there is a particularly tricky step or issue about to happen. In each case,
       color gets recognized before the text.

       Even though we use color, we should be aware that all colors don't mean the same thing in all situa-
       tions and cultures. Colors that have one association in the United States may have entirely different
       meanings in other cultures! Part of understanding how to use colors in signage and visual rhetoric
       is to understand the meaning behind your choices or the meanings you're trying to connect to your
       choices (which we'll focus on more in document design). For example, Halloween is my favorite
       holiday of all time, but it is a holiday that isn't universal. Invoking Halloween with orange and black
       won't work everywhere because the tradition is not one that is immediately apparent to some groups.

       Warnings and Signage Conventions
       When we create any sort of visual rhetoric that is designed to warn or caution folks, first and fore

80
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

more realize that these signs often have mandated rules and regulations behind them. You don't
simply create your own chemical safety poster/signage--you use the mandated and approved sig-
nage. These mandates are important because the diverse groups may need to use them quickly, such
as first-responders going through a burning building. The flexibility of some visual rhetorical choices
is limited simply because more flexibility would introduce the chance that misunderstandings could
happen.

As a brief aside, this is also true of auditory warnings. A few years ago a film got into trouble for
using the Emergency Broadcast System tone for a trailer. You simply can't do that--it is illegal. The
whole goal of that tone is to prepare citizens for emergency information. If it was allowed in any
other case, it would lose its value. Because of that, it is protected vigorously.

Developing Visual Rhetoric for Safety with Signs
For our purposes, we need to be acutely aware of what existing laws apply to any signage that we
might use. While it may be amusing to read those faux signs that warn something akin to, "If you
touch this, it will kill you and it will hurt the whole time," there are many times government or insti-
tution-mandated choices that have been made for us already.

For signs that involve harm to the process being carried out or to individuals, we can follow a fairly
direct workflow, in addition to what is noted above:

Signs and Safety Workflow

1) What are the dangers of this task?
         a. To people
         b. To property
         c. To other stuffTM

2) What needs to be communicated to folks involved?
3 )What official signage already exists?
4) What signage exists that covers similar territory that could be adapted?
5) What legal or regulatory constraints control the signage or its presence?

1) What are the dangers of this task?
First and foremost, establish what dangers exist. You want to first of all know if someone might
become injured or perhaps even lose their life. You also want to know how something could be
damaged, potentially catastrophically. Finally, think about the types of dangers that exist that aren't
necessarily either--such as risks to appearance or reputation or relationships. (Medical records are
private for these exact reasons.)

2) What needs to be communicated to the folks involved?
There is a difference between knowing what is dangerous and knowing what someone needs to know.
Figure out what someone must know about the situation. It might be that there is a live wire in-
volved. It could be that installing a certain part is a one-way process that can't be reversed. It could be
that no lifeguard is present. It depends really. But, figure out what is absolutely needed.

                                                                  81
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

       3) What official signage exists?
       If something official exists, you'll need to use it. Find out what examples are out there and what tem-
       plates you can use. In some cases, you need a specific sign, such as with material labeling.

       4) What signage exists that covers similar territory that could be adapted?
       Because of the way that visual conventions work, you may have something that exists out there that
       you can adapt. If there is a common way of signaling something that isn't legally mandated, you can
       draw on your audience's knowledge of that format to get your point across. The same is true if there
       is an institutional equivalent that is often used in these situations.

       5) What legal or regulatory constraints control the signage or its presence?
       In some cases, you may have some legal rules around when signs must be present, though the signs
       may not be mandated to have a particular design. You need to be aware of those needs and design
       accordingly. For example, theme parks have ride-heights that are enforced via signage. The conven-
       tions vary between parks, but they are regulated to prevent accident and injury and are often easily
       understood by audiences because of their shared visual conventions.

       The Visual Rhetoric of Context with Signage
       When it comes to creating signs in particular, think about the users that will encounter those signs.
       As with the above section, think of this as a focused addendum to the visual rhetoric drafting process
       from earlier. Signs should rely on visuals that make sense to readers within the context they are de-
       ployed. Signs, more than any other type of visual rhetoric, relay information with visual shorthand.
       Too much information and a sign is useless, or it becomes an infographic or directory or map. Too
       little information in a sign and ambiguity and confusion reign.

       Signs and the power of context
       Think about the signage in a
       library, such as the library I'm
       drafting this text in. Library
       signage can do things that other
       signs can't because of the way
       that we read them. In a library,
       we're expecting to find things in
       the way that you find them in
       a library. For some collections,
       that means the Dewey Decimal
       System or whatever equivalent
       might exist. In other situations,
       it means alphabetical listings. In
       either case, signs in the library
       can reference alphabetical lists
       or a numerical reference system
       without explanation because the
       situation of the library explains
       what those elements mean:

82 A sign from the library
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

Take the example sign above--You have 7 major areas that are conveying information to the audi-
ence/user. You have a major block at the type labeled "Large Print." This block, from the context, we
would assume refers to large print books. There really aren't a lot of other options in a library for this
to have another meaning! Below that are two large blue blocks, each with arrows within them and
smaller blocks as well. The arrows, from the context, we interpret as one side or another of the book-
shelf. The arrows function that way from the context--there isn't room for much else to make sense.
Finally, there is the smaller box that starts with one short snippet and ends with another, such as the
amusing choice of "Sad-Tru." Because the context of the library, we can understand these terms to
likely reference alphabetical ordering. If we want something that falls between "sad" and "tru" in the
alphabet, we'll look on the left side of the shelf. If we want something beyond, we'll need to look at
the other side or further along.

For your own work, think about context. What can someone be expected to know? What will they
not know? What visuals will make sense within this context? Which won't?

Data Visualization and Infographics

When we think about visual rhetoric, one of the most iconic tasks we associate visuals with is the
graphical display of information. Visual representations of data are one of the quickest ways to take
something numerical and data-driven and make it digestible to a lay audience. For example, you
may not know much about quarterly profits or the levels of methane in the atmosphere, but you can
understand a trend line on a chart showing these figures rising and falling. Visualizations of data are
powerful, and potentially perilous on ethical grounds.

What is data visualization?
Data visualization is at its heart a fairly simple task--you take data and you represent it in a visu-
al format, often in the form of a chart. Now, if you are like most people, the idea of working with
charts does not exactly get your blood pumping. I think that is a natural reaction, perhaps even a
healthy one considering the state of most charts out there. But, it doesn't have to be so boring and
dull. Data visualization can be one of the most engaging and useful parts of your work in technical
writing and an essential tool in communicating complex information to others.

We tend to think of data visualization hand-in-hand with charts because charts have traditionally
been the name of the game for most folks, historically speaking. Until the relatively recent creation
of powerful and accessible data visualization software that laypeople can use successfully with little
training, simple charts were the most accessible option for sharing data visualizations because they
often had to be drawn by hand or with tedious software. With the rise of more and more software
tools to craft visuals and design texts, data visualization has changed dramatically in a short amount
of time. For example, infographics are a type of data visualization that have existed in one form or
another for a good while, but they have seen an astounding burst of popularity in the last several

                                                                  83
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

       years, likely due to the confluence of easier-to-use tools for their creation and low-cost/high-traffic
       venues for sharing them: social media and websites.

       At its core, data visualization is a process of translation more than anything else. Much like the
       standard definition of technical writing that we started with early in the course, data visualization
       takes a piece of data and then passes it on to a new audience, making choices along the way of how
       to present that data and which parts of that data to make more visible and which parts to make less
       visible or to omit altogether. For example, you might have a dataset that includes information on
       fifteen different criteria about different institutions of higher education in your state, but you may
       create a chart that only displays three of them together to make an argument about how the three
       are interrelated or dependent on each other or to simply show a huge disparity between institutions.
       The entire dataset doesn't always come through into the visualization, and even if it does, it will be
       altered in some way by the shift from text/number to visual.
       Now, you may have paused briefly at what I just said--shouldn't data visualization just be about
       numbers? Why would we want to talk about text? Well, thinking that data visualization is just about
       numbers is a mistake, one that limits our understanding of the power and flexibility of visualiza-
       tions. For example, I could have a dataset that lists the colors used by a college athletics team since
       its inception. This dataset likely includes color swatches, perhaps color codes, and will also contain
       dates for the usage of these colors and perhaps even imagery demonstrating the jerseys that the colors
       would used on during any given time period. Notice that most of this dataset is not actually num-
       bers. A good bit of it is going to be visual already! From this information I could create a timeline
       that shows the evolution of jersey design and coloration, or I could create a pie-chart that shows how
       much of the team's existence is devoted to each particular color choice, or I could do something else
       entirely. Data visualization doesn't have to be about taking numbers and turning them into images;
       visualizing any sort of data counts!

       Data Visualization, Education, Persuasion, and Discovery
       When we think about data visualization, we must keep in mind that we're working with a particular
       goal in mind (at least, I hope we are) to either persuade or educate our readers about something in
       our original dataset. (Now, that isn't to say this is a definitive list of stuff we can do, but let's keep it
       simple for our purposes). In each of these cases, we may actually find ourselves doing even more than
       simply educating or persuading--we may end up learning things we didn't set out to learn.

       When we work to educate or persuade with data, we're making editorial choices, choices that we've
       discussed above. We situate ourselves, our audience, our goals, and the dataset. We try to figure out
       what particular part of the dataset needs to be visualized and how that visualization will work. This
       may sound familiar, and it really does align almost one-to-one with our visual rhetoric workflow
       above. The key here is that we need to think about our dataset and what we need to pull out of it--
       what will be of use for our users and our context? Once we figure that out, we need to see how that
       can be carried out in a way that is clear and that doesn't mislead.

       Going about the work of figuring out how to share information visually can lead to unexpected
       discoveries, and that is part of the beauty of data visualization. The approach can be used to share
       information, but it also has a strong role in invention. You may be wanting to simply relay the
       growth of different categories of students at your university, but in that process you realize that while

84
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

all groups are getting larger, the rate at which they are growing is different, resulting in some groups
actually becoming a smaller percent of the overall student body despite continually getting larger.
You wouldn't have started out looking for this, but in the process of crunching all of those numbers
into visuals you stumbled upon this information, giving you a new perspective,

When we share visualizations, we're trying to get people to engage with data they might otherwise
overlook or ignore. For example, many people take numbers and simply don't hear them as data, but
instead hear them as noise or non-meaningful parts of your message. This isn't to say that folks who
think numerically don't exist--they do--but, they aren't going to be in the majority as far as I'm
aware. The same is true for other datasets--they are often super meaningful to a specific group of
folks. What a data visualization does is present the information you are sharing in a new way, giving
your readership a new lens to view your data through. In some cases, this can actually cause them
to engage with the data when they otherwise wouldn't. In other cases, it may help them see around
pre-existing conceptions they have about the data or subject by allowing them to see figures and in-
formation they are already familiar with in a new way or with new connections emphasized and old
ones deemphasized.

Types of data visualization
Just like with any other type of visual rhetoric, data visualizations work off of existing visual rhetor-
ical conventions. Often times these are codified into types of charts such as pie charts, scatter plots,
bar charts, etc. These types of charts exist because they represent an approach to visualizing data that
has a value and a purpose. For example, pie charts show us how much of a whole something occu-
pies. Other more novel designs exist, especially in the realm of infographics, but even those designs
often rely on visual conventions from outside sources to make sense.

With charts, we have a powerful tool because most popular types of charts are easily read by the
general public. More specialize charts have more specialized audiences, but simple bar charts and line
graphs and their companions are found all over and can be easily created with spreadsheet software
or design software. The advantage of the popularity of these types is that we don't have to do much
work to get across the gist of what we're trying to say--the charts have a built in message. Pie charts,
as mentioned above, show us a slice of a pie versus the whole. When you take a dataset and you want
to emphasize just how much of the dataset is a certain category of content or just how big a certain
group is, a pie chart makes sense. If you want to instead show how five different groups are outclassed
by one larger group, you might want to use a bar chart because having the different group next to
each other allows for a much easier comparison between them and emphasizes size similarities and
differences in ways that a pie chart can't do with much rigor. And the beauty of all of this is that folks
already understand how these charts work.

Sometimes, it can be useful to try to get your data into multiple types of charts and graphs, just to
see what these types can teach you and show you, but you'll often come to a particular type of graph
or chart because it represents something you want to say about your data, something you already
know.

With infographics, the conventions and audience understanding can vary wildly depending on how
you create your text. An infographic might be made up of a bunch of normal charts with some text

                                                                  85
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 3

       to narrate, but often you find more novel approaches in infographics, approaches that borrow visual
       conventions from elsewhere to make their point.

       For example, if we used our previously mentioned dataset on the color changes in an athletic pro-
       gram's history, we could compare the different colors by the number of wins a team had while wear-
       ing them. You see this sometimes with home and away and alternative jerseys in sports discussions.
       In this case, we would likely want to create a miniature version of the jersey that we could then use
       to represent a particular amount of wins, perhaps 50 per jersey. Then, we could have a grouping
       that showed all wins over a certain period of time with each jersey in each particular color represent-
       ing the amount of wins that occurred in that color. The result would be a block of tiny jerseys that
       would meld together into chunks, letting us see how stark or not-so-stark the differences in wins
       were between the colors. In this case we've turned data into a visual, one that borrows the visual con-
       vention of the colors and the general jersey design to convey information via a key that each jersey is
       50 wins.
       Now, the above is just one example of how an infographic might be made--you'll often find that
       infographics are not as simple as one subject and one visual. There can be any number of charts and
       unique constructions in a given infographic: the goal of the project will help constrain and guide the
       choices of what needs to be shown and what doesn't.

       Building a workflow for data visualization and the ethics of visuals
       With data visualization, we can mostly work with the previously discussed workflow on visual rhet-
       oric and visual conventions. When you're identifying what to share and what your goals are, think
       about which parts of your dataset are going to be shared and why you're doing that sharing. When
       you think about what an audience can understand, think about the types of charts that could be
       used or the visual conventions that could be altered to create infographic components.

       When visualizing data, one special extra issue stands out--the relative ease of purposefully or acci-
       dentally distorting the dataset behind a visual through design choices. When someone looks at our
       visual, they often do so with very little critical thinking, or at least that is what any number of sourc-
       es and anecdotes claim. We tend to trust visuals, especially pretty looking visuals that are professional
       and shiny. This perhaps is part of a larger cultural trend in the US that connects polish and graphical
       prowess with excellence. (Just think about how much value is placed on the visual appeal of certain
       brands of phones, for example, rather than their functionality. Think about older looking websites--
       do you want to give them your credit card?) In addition, realize that visuals operate on the rhetorical
       idea of synecdoche--the part stands for the whole. When you represent a dataset to someone, they
       often take that to be the dataset. We really should be more critical I suppose.

       When creating data visualizations, we need to ask ourselves: am I making choices that alter the way
       this data is perceived? You may be using a truncated X or Y axis on a chart to make a point, but that
       may not be obvious to your readers. In this case, your chart may be showing what looks to be a huge
       change in figures where one simply doesn't exist. Once you have created a visual, audit it. Get it test-
       ed with various users. Make sure that what it is showing and emphasizing can be backed up by the
       data behind the visual. If the visual can't be backed up by the dataset, you've got a problem.

Section Break--Data Visualizations

1. One critique of visualizations that is often made is that they simply don't cite their sources. Find
five visualizations or infographics and check and see if each has sources. If they do have sources, see if
you can locate the cited data.
2. Draft a quick data visualization about something related to your institution. You can often find
data related to your institution via the office of institutional research or another similar group. Think
about what you want to represent and why. Sketch this out--don't worry about fidelity.

Document Design in Technical Writing
                                           Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

    In this chapter, we're going to be looking at content in the vast arena of document design. Docu-
    ment design can be an entire course in and of itself (I happen to teach one at the graduate level), but
    there are certain essential skills in document design that technical and professional writers simply
    must master to communicate effectively and with purpose. We will cover the essentials of document
    design, followed by layout in design work, followed by a discussion of typography, and finally a
    reflection on document design and the signposting we've discussed earlier in the text.

    When we talk about document design, realize that we are talking about the way that someone reads
    our text. The design of a document encourages a reader to view a text a certain way, to navigate a
    text in a certain way. Sometimes that is done using color. Other times it may be done using lay-
    out choices. At the end of the day, we're designing a document to be read a certain way and used a
    certain way, using design to help align the needs of the user with the text within the document. The
    best document design syncs up with how the text is designed work and encourages users to navigate
    the document that way. A well designed document is a joy to use.

    Document Design Essentials is Essential

    Document design as a component of technical writing continues to push further and further into
    the forefront of what it means to communicate effectively. Put simply, the bar for what is considered
    good design has been raised rapidly over the years and the minimum expectations of what a tech-
    nical writer can do, and the value of being able to create good document designs, have risen. Think
    about websites, just for an example. How many times have you been hesitant to put your credit card
    information into a dated looking website? We judge websites, and documents, and the companies
    and individuals they are associated with, by their design chops.

    Much of this rise in importance has gone hand-in-hand with technological advances--something
    we've discussed previously. Much like with visual design, document design software has developed
    and proliferated at an astounding rate. From the 1980s through today, the evolution of software and
    publication options has multiplied considerably, and in the last several years the explosion of design
    apps on phones and tablets has pushed this trend even further along. With the advent of software
    like Microsoft Publisher in the 90s, suddenly even small business owners could create their own cus-
    tom signage, coupons, and brochures--something that we often take for granted today. Yes, the tem-
    plates and the clip art are comical today, but at the time the software was revolutionary. Combined
    with the expansion of inkjet printers and eventually color laser printers and the expanding footprint
    of commercial printing services online and elsewhere, advances in technology and access have made
    creating and producing attractive documents easier than ever before.

    Now, you aren't going to be expected to work at the same level as someone who works primarily as a
    designer or artist--those folks have entire degrees focusing on the art of typography and drafting and
    other important skills if you're going to be creating truly unique content as part of a design agency
    or the like. Instead, we're going to be focusing on using the massive array of tools at our disposal
    these days to make attractive texts that are well-designed and well written for the context they're
    going into. In particular, we want to focus on the design choices available to us and how to use those
    choices with meaning and purpose, not to simply click on buttons until things look nice.

       To help prepare you for your work as a writer that has to keep design in mind concurrently with
       the usability and appropriateness of their writing, we're going to cover some essential ideas as well
       as some tips and tricks that make working with highly styled texts much simpler and effective. We'll
       cover in this introduction to design the research of design, the choice of paper/PDF, discuss styling
       tools for easy changes to texts, and cover images and accessibility/usability.

       Design is Work, Research Work
       Many times when we think of designers, we tend to think of folks who sit around all day dreaming
       up wonderful designs that are a delight to our senses. We may stereotype these folks as being sen-
       sitive, whimsical, and driven by fits and starts of inspiration. Generally speaking, these folks don't
       exist--and if they do, they don't have steady jobs. Good design, like good technical writing, is a job
       that is research-driven and process-oriented. Good designers are good researchers that work by pro-
       cess rather than waiting for the mood or inspiration to strike.

       The goal of all of this work is to support your design choices, nay even to make those choices, based
       on the information you have about your goals and your users/audience. If someone wants to know
       why you used a certain color, you should have an answer that makes sense based on your research
       and the context. Generally speaking you shouldn't be simply doing design on a whim--there should
       be a goal with research connecting that goal to your choice. The idea here is that if someone ques-
       tions your work your time usage, you can explain what happened and why you made the choices you
       made.

       The research for design is pretty much the same research we're doing when we look at the research
       in the writing process or the design of visuals or data visualizations. In fact, though we're separating
       each of these into discrete processes to aid in learning the importance of different facets of each of
       these processes, in practical usage you'll make use of all of these processes together, tailored in a way
       that fits your personal needs and context. So, when we look at doing research for document design,
       we'll follow off the information we have on audience and visuals.

       The first and most important concern when doing design work is of course your audience--who is
       going to be using this and who are you actually creating it for? Your internal goals and purpose need
       to be honored while also adapting your text as much as makes sense to work with the primary folks
       using what you'll be creating. Each of these groups has information you will need: you will need to
       know what style is appropriate for your organization and the document you're creating, and you'll
       need to know what types of styles will be appreciated by your intended readership.

       When working internally, you'll primarily need to know if there is a style guide that governs what
       you're writing. Some organizations have expansive style guides with templates for almost any type of
       writing you would want to do, right down to putting the company or institutional logo on your polo
       or company car. Others have much more lax document requirements but extremely specific color
       and logo expectations. Figure out what is expected or required.

       You'll also want to think about the folks who will be using your design--not everyone values the
       same types of design and deliverables. For example, an ultra-trendy and modern design might not
       make a lot of sense if you're trying to target senior citizens for a research study or educational oppor-

90

tunity. In the case of the older demographic, you may want to use styles that are attractive to them.
Don't know what those are? Do some original research! (I may have mentioned this a few times, but
the last section of the book is chock-full of methods you can use to research audiences and usability).
Remember that design isn't universal--it is always situated in culture and individual perceptions. I,
for example, roll my eyes when I see rebooted 80s and 90s fashion choices that I thought were awful
when I was living in those decades worn by students on campus. I didn't like acid wash jeans then, I
don't like them now. Folks view design through their own experiences and their own values.

Paper, PDF, and Beyond
When you're doing document design, an essential choice is the venue for your document. Are you
going to be creating something that will be printed? Are you going to be printing something that is
in color or black and white? Will this be on the web? Will it be on phones? Will it need to be multi-
lingual? The choices are endless, but you need to know what type of document you're creating!

Practically speaking, you should know fairly early on what will be possible or not possible. If you're
doing something for a class, obviously you have more freedom than if you're going to be published
a run of 5000 documents that will be printed and delivered to their users. Find out what the goal of
your work is and what will be expected.

When it comes to design, the medium matters--some mediums cost more, some allow for more
options and design moves, and some present more accessibility barriers than others. For example,
electronic documents can be more readable for folks using a screen reader, but only if the document
is designed for that usage. In another situation, you might be creating a resume that you know will
be photocopied. you'll want the actual text to look nice, but you won't want to use colors that will
lose their legibility when they're transferred to a black and white copy.

One final consideration with the medium--color. Be aware, and we'll discuss this more in later
sections, that there are different color palettes used for screen and print. Generally speaking, you
can get much brighter and more vibrant colors on a screen than you can on the printed page. Now,
that's not to say you can't get super-vibrant printed colors--you can--but, these colors often come
from special palettes that can be expensive and hard to set up for a production run. The primary two
palettes you'll want to know about are CMYK and RGB. CMYK is the set of colors used in most
printing and consists of a mixture of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. You may well have seen these
colors in the ink cartridges of a printer. RGB is the set of colors used on screens, and is made up of
red, blue, and green. Though it may seem counterintuitive, the smaller selection of colors creates the
brighter shades.

If you ignore the question of color, you may end up with unintentionally hilarious or just plain aw-
ful results. If a printer is given a document set up for a screen, a document that uses RGB color, then
it will perform an on-the-fly correction. This correction isn't going to be perfect and you may end up
with a markedly different shade than you originally intended. At the same time, if you don't check
that your RGB colors are going to translate to the printed page, you may pass along a digital proof
of something that simply can't exist on the printed page without a lot of extra work and equipment.
Often software makes use of out-of-gamut warnings or the like to give you this information, but you
need to be aware those features exist and matter. (If you're wondering what this looks like in real life,

                                                                  91
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       think about any time you've had a really vibrant picture you've taken on your phone and had print-
       ed. It tends to look duller and less colorful when you get it printed, especially in the areas of intense
       color. This is what happens when you send something out of gamut--the printer will downgrade the
       colors to fit the available palette, often with dismal results).

       Styling Text and Quality of Life
       While we are going to be discussing typography and layout in much more detail later in this chap-
       ter, I want to spend a brief amount of time early on letting you know about the most powerful and
       life-changing tool that you may well have been ignoring for most of your academic career--para-
       graph and character styles.

       When you work with a large document, you often want to have a good selection of stylistic choices
       available to create signposts for your readers in the text. We've discussed this at length earlier in the
       text, and we're going to be coming back to it later in this section when we look at combining doc-
       ument design with signposting. The end result of this process is that you end up with a lot of text
       with specifically styled choices, choices that you may well want to edit later in your project! If you've
       ever spent fifteen minutes changing the font size or weight on a resume that you're tweaking before
       sending it you, you know just how miserable changing the font choices and design moves in a large
       document can be. There is, however, a better way.

       Paragraph and character styles are tools built into most word processing suites that allow you to
       markup your text to allow the program to remember what type of styling you want to use for a
       particular segment of text. This information can relate to spacing, font, color, etc. You may well have
       noticed this before when using something like Microsoft Word when you see the various styles listed
       as Heading 1 or Sub-Heading in the top section of the user interface.

       By painting a selection of text with one of these styles, you're allowing the document to know that
       this text has a certain purpose within the text. You may be saying this is a section heading, or it might
       be a keyword, or it might be a warning. In any case, the text has a label that you will be associating
       with a design. The magic of these styles, much like the magic of CSS when doing work with HTML,
       is that the program will always remember the purpose and label of the text, but it will be able to
       change the style associated with the text anytime you'd like. What you're doing is creating a label that
       then gets used to selective apply style choices like holding the text. If you decide later to change the
       font from bold to underlined, you can simply alter the settings for that style and then every single
       instance of the text that is labeled with that style will be altered. It really is life changing.

       When working with a larger document, using styles is almost a necessity and needs to be part of
       your workflow. Think about what types of text you will need to label for signposting and then create
       styles for those types in your word processing program or using existing styles as a starting point. By
       coming up with the styles that you'll need for signposting and design at the start of drafting, you'll be
       enabling yourself to easily change how the styles work as the document gets longer and more com-
       plicated. Suddenly, changing the font on a part of your resume goes from a painstaking process of
       clicking and dragging over and over again to simply selecting a new font or font permutation via the
       style settings.

I'm not going to go through the process of telling you how to go about setting up styles in this
text--that would be likely a choice that would instantly date this text and the software I'm using.
I would instead encourage you to look up the style options for your software of choice. If you're
using something like Adobe InDesign or Scribus, the options will be overflowing. If you're using a
cloud-based option, you may find significantly less tools available. Do some searching in the online
documentation for your software for paragraph and character styles and go from there. When doing
so, be aware that usually character styles are simply the characters in the text--not the spacing. Para-
graph styles incorporate the style of full paragraphs, including line spacing and page spacing. Char-
acter styles tend to overwrite paragraph styles, allowing you to set up a particular font and spacing
for your paragraphs and then selectively override the font when you have a single bit of text, such as
a keyword, that you need to consistently look different.

Images, Video, Accessibility, and Use
One last important area that we need to cover is the inclusion of images into your documents. Im-
ages are more and more common, especially in digital deliverables that don't have to rely on being
printed. With the spread of high quality camera and camcorders via smartphones, almost anyone
can take a quick photo or video that is impressive in quality versus anything available to the average
person in previous decades. (Writing this text is making me feel old). Because of the availability and
ease of creating images and video, we see them a lot. But, their uses are not always effective or even
legible.

One important aspect of using images is the quality of the image--images are created at a certain
level of pixel density and using a particular ratio for the dimensions. Despite what you see on TV,
you can't simply yell at a screen with an image to "enhance," and expect magic to happen. The pixels
you need to create a more detailed image simply don't exist--they were not recorded when the image
was taken or they're not present in the current form of the image. You can't get them back with pro-
gramming magic, though sometimes you can attempt to extrapolate what they might look like.

For our purposes, you want to make sure that your image is not pixelated and that it will print at
a decent quality if you're going to be doing a printed project. Different applications have different
needs--you can get away with different densities when printing depending on the size and use of
the image. Test out different densities and see how they look. For printing, starting at 300dpi can
be useful. And, of course, if you're going for a pixelated look to begin with, that's okay. After all, it
wouldn't be a proper picture of Nessie or Bigfoot or a UFO if the image was in focus.

When it comes to images on screens, keep in mind that our desktop or laptop screens and our
phones can have drastically different levels of image density. An image that looks awesome zoomed
in on a desktop with a dated display will look awful when you zoom in on a mobile device with a
high density display. Keep in mind that the size of the image, no matter the medium, needs to be
scaled with the quality of image available and the space requirements you have.

When it comes to video, think about your composition and framing. Basically, remember that most
people prefer video in landscape format for professional usage. Unless you're composing on Earth 2,
please try to hold your phone sideways when you film footage. Just saying.

                                                                  93

       Images and video also introduce accessibility issues for some readers. To assist these readers, you'll
       need to give titles and alternative text for each of your images in digital deliverables. This alternative
       text will allow a screen reader to read to your user whatever you consider to be a good description of
       the image that you've provided. Usually you want to design your alt text to allow the reader to get
       from the image whatever you'll be using it for later in the text. If you don't do this extra work, folks
       with screen readers will have no clue what your images are.

       Going along with the question of alternative text is the question of how to title and refer to an image,
       or a visual, in your document design. Generally speaking, you'll want to give a title to your images in
       a text that will be referencing them. You may call them Figure 1, or Figure 2, or Image 1, but you'll
       need to have some form of reference. This allows the reader to understand when you're discussing a
       particular image, and allows for easy navigation back to an image later on if you reference it again. In
       some contexts going without labels is preferred, but if you're going to reference an image a lot over
       the span of several pages, titles can help.

       Finally, you want to make sure your image is actually visible and doesn't blend into your text. Often
       times when you include a photo with a skyline, for example, the edges of the image may tend to
       bleed towards white due to how the image has been exposed and balanced by your phone or camera.
       When you place an image like this on a printed page, you end up with a visual that blends into the
       document itself, creating issues with visibility and crispness. To avoid these issues, you can often us-
       ing a simple border that is maybe 1 or 2pt in stroke. Something that contrasts with the background
       of both the image and the page can work--usually black will work. You won't want an overly thick
       border, but you'll be amazed at how much a simple stroke can change how easy an image is to see
       and how professional a layout looks.

    Section Break--Document Design is Essential

       1. When we use colors, we often think in generalities--red, blue, green, etc. When we design with
       color, we need to think in specifics that will get us the color we want time and time again. Do some
       research on the color codes associated with iconic brands and institutions you admire. See how many
       types of codes you can find--CMYK, RGB, Hex, etc.
       2. Try out using styles with a simple document. Create a series of headings, sub-headings, and para-
       graphs with associated styles. Save the text with three different final looks, altering the styles between
       each version.

   Layout and Document Design

       On the most global level, document design is all about layout. The design of a document is first and
       fundamentally controlled by the layout of the text and images on the page. Yes, the size and color of
       the text matters in how someone reads, as we'll get to in a moment, but layout controls what they
       encounter and when as they navigate in the traditional top-left corner and over and down manner.
       (And, if you're writing for languages that are right-to-left, from the top-right corner and over and
       down). Learning how to use layout to guide/assist readers is a fundamental skill for technical writers.

       With that said, most word processing software doesn't really dive into in-depth document design as

94
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

part of its core functionality. Instead, we tend to operate in a set of conventional document design
presets that govern how we read and write everyday documents. When you open a word processor,
you likely have a white page with black text, probably Calibri or Times New Roman or Cambria as
your font, and your margins are usually set to 1 inch or so on all sides. When you type, the text fills
the whole page until it hits the margin, unless you may use of tools like tabs or lists or indents. This
is the world we're used to operating in, and while document design is possible in these types of envi-
ronments, the freedom to determine layout isn't really baked into the fundamental operation of these
traditional word processors. You aren't supposed to have to think about fundamental layout--you're
writing.

When we take control of layout, much more is opened up to us. Many times a program truly ded-
icated to document design will simply open up to a blank page--there will be no places to write,
there will no places to insert images. All of the choices are open to you, the designer. This can be a
bit overwhelming at first, but you'll come to enjoy the freedom. You can place text boxes to house
text, you insert frames for images, or just insert the image into the document and move it around.
You can create custom paragraph and text styles as well as object-level styles that govern how and
when text and images interact. The amount of choices you have are virtually endless.

Document design programs are designed as sandboxes for the creation of any sort of document you
can think of rather than any particular type of document. The amount of choices they provide and
the lack of handholding go hand-in-hand with professional work where you want to create your
design rather than spend your time undoing someone else's preconceptions of what a design should
start with.

This can be a bit overwhelming if you're new to things, and you may try to start reinventing the
wheel, creating your own take on a fundamental document type from scratch. Try to resist that urge.
If you're creating a document that you've never made before, find some examples of the document
in the wild from competitors or internally. Look at what they've done that you like and that you
don't like. Figure out which elements work for you, and bring them together in a unique design that
borrows from a few different traditions. This is how design works--incrementally and building off
older ideas. Sometimes you'll see older content brought back to the forefront as the next new thing.
Sometimes you'll see existing content tweaked a bit for a new take on design. Designers tend to work
to develop off of what is already here--it is much more rare to create something that is fundamental-
ly unconnected to any previous design. Design is a conversation more than anything, and when you
contribute to the conversation you're building on what has already come before.

If you can think of the flavoring you wish to give your design, you often start off in a much better
place then simply saying, I'm going to create this type of document. I'll give you an example from
my own development as a designer to illustrate this point. When I was a Ph.D. student, I met my
future wife and we decided to get married. At the same time we were planning the wedding, I was
taking a design studio course over the summer. Neither of us were happy with the traditional wed-
ding program, so I decided--naively--to suggest that I could design it and get it printed at the local
printer. At first, this did not work out well at all. I would go to my future wife with a design, and
she wouldn't like it. I would go to her with another, and she wouldn't like it. A good part of this
was related to my actions--I was trying to create something I had no experience with and with no

                                                                  95
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       conventions to reference. It was awful. This happened for a while before I realized that I didn't need
       to reinvent the wheel--I simply needed a new paradigm to view what I was doing.

       I thought about who we were as a couple and what we had in common in our pasts. Both of us had
       many friends in theater when we were in college, and we both helped a lot with theater productions.
       I realized that what we could do was create a wedding program that was designed with the same
       visual aesthetic as a low-budget college theater's program for a play. Once I had this idea, which my
       future wife loved, I had a much easier time developing things. I was able to use classic clip art to give
       it a retro and low budget feel, and I set up the "play" of the wedding as a love story. The exit song and
       theme of the program was "Ever Ever After," so that tied in nicely. The different parts of the wedding
       were set up as acts and scenes in the play. Our history as a couple was the summary of the story thus
       far. And the back page, which I was particularly proud of, was the cast and crew--the wedding party
       basically--with headshots and short bios about each member and how they connected to the bride
       or groom. Having the theme, an approach that I could take to reimagine and meld two different
       types of documents, made all the difference.

       So, with your layout work, don't try to start with nothing and create something. Do some research
       on what is out there. Think about your goals, your audience, the use of your text. Find a thematic
       that works well and features that you like from elsewhere and blend them together into your own
       design that speaks in a particular design language that makes sense. As I've mentioned, you see this
       all the time. Ever noticed how phone design seems to work based off one hit design that gets copied
       and adapted just because? It works the same with material design and even architecture! Folks doing
       design operate in existing traditions and expectations. You can get rewarded for something novel, but
       that is extremely hard to pull off, and often outside the scope of what you need to do in any given
       project.

       To flesh out the rest of our discussion on layout, we're going to cover some fundamental ways of
       viewing layout and doing layout. We'll look at the basic concept of stacking to create layouts and
       designs, we'll discuss placement and purpose, we'll discuss legibility and color, and we'll discuss print
       concerns with layout choices (bleeds and such).

     Stacking--The Fundamental Design Tool

       When it comes to doing document design, or any sort of visual design really, the concept of stacking
       is absolutely central to pulling off virtually any sort of complicated multi-element design. (And, if
       we're honest, it applies to drawing and painting too, but let's not go too far astray). Stacking is a way
       of viewing design, one that makes the process of breaking down and then creating or recreating a
       design much easier than trying to tackle a full image by itself. I'll explain.

       Let's start with a terribly-drawn example of a carved pumpkin. I believe I've mentioned that Hal-
       loween is my favorite holiday, and thanks to the iPad Pro that I'm working on, I can draw you the
       world's worst drawing of a pumpkin. (I promise I can do better design work on a pc with a mouse).
       This example will provide for us both comic relief as well as a brief insight into how stacking can be
       used to create document design effects when doing layout.

96
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4
In this image, you see a pumpkin or something that looks like a pumpkin that has been carved
for Halloween--but we need to move beyond seeing the image as a single entity to understand
how stacking works. Normally, we would view this image as a single visual. The stem, the eyes and
mouth, the banding on the body, the outline of the body, and the color of the main body are all seen
as one. We need to instead see each of these items as a single entity that has been created through
stacking several different elements.
Stacking works in layout and document design fairly simply, much like an old fashioned projector,
you layer one visual element on top of another, creating a stacked effect that creates your final prod-
uct. Crucially, you also operate in a stacking mindset, creating each individual level of elements on
their own layer of the image. By breaking down the image into differing layers and stacking those on
top of each other, you create a final image.

          A Badly Drawn Jack-o'-Lantern

In the example above, we actually have four different layers that are being used. First, we have a
background image that is being used. In this case, we have a transparent background, so we can
ignore that for now. Next, we have the actual shape of the pumpkin and its outline and stem as you
can see on the next page.

                                                                  97
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       This is all that we have on this layer, and
       if we wanted to be really process-driven,
       we could have put the stem on a different
       layer entirely. What this allows is for us
       to create the basic look and overall shape
       of our design element without having to
       worry about other elements.
       Next, you have a layer that consists
       just of the banding that you see on the
       pumpkin. In this case, I started with a
       solid black line stroke and painted that
       onto the pumpkin body from left to
       right. Once that was done, I lowered the
       opacity of the layer so it would be less
       harsh and look more organic--which I
       suppose is overkill when you're drawing
       the world's worst pumpkin carving. Once
       I was done, I was able to clean up by eras-

    ing any strokes that went past the edge The basic Pumpkin shape Layer

       of the pumpkin body. Because I was on a
       totally different layer, I didn't have to worry about erasing any of the pumpkin's body. This is another
       key advantage to stacking and layer-based design. Here is what this layer looks like alone:

                   The Pumpkin Line Layer

98
Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

Notice that just the lines are visible here.
That is all that is operating on this layer.
However, due to the way that layers
work, I was able to see what was below
when I was doing my line insertion. The
final product, combining the two layers,
can be seen here.

Through the use of layering, you can
see how the image slowly evolves into
something that looks more and more like
a terrible pumpkin. The complex design
elements (ha!) are layered on top of each
other, allowing you to tweak each layer
independently without impacting the
others.

The final step was to take the eyes and
mouth and add them onto the pumpkin.

This was, as you might guess, yet another The Pumpkin and Lines Combined

layer that was drawn on top.

As you can see, there is simply a mouth and two eyes here. This
was drawn with the advantage of seeing what was going on below,
allowing me to line everything up. However, since the elements were
all on their own layer, I was able to tweak them, erase the edges as
needed, and redo them even without having to worry about the rest
of the document getting altered. The end result, which you can see,
was far from striking, but it does take advantage of this concept of
stacking when doing document design layout.

                                              Each stacked element,

                                              from bottom to top,     THE FACE
                                              blends together in the

                                              final image to create a carved pumpkin. Each element is

                                              standalone, which means I can tweak the colors and the

                                              shapes quickly without having to do much work at all. If

                                              I want to have a bright purple pumpkin with a silly face,

                                              I can do that by simply repainting the coloration on the

                                              pumpkin, making the lines darker, and redrawing the

                                              face layer. In less than two minutes, I was able to get just

                                              such a result that you can see on the next page.

THE FULL EFFECT

                                                                  99

              A quick design remix

       Again, because of the leeway that stacking gives us when doing a design, we can quickly change the
       elements, move different elements and recolor them quickly, etc. Stacking really is the secret to a
       good layout! It also helps when you need to replicate something with slightly different looks over and
       over again. Think about my pumpkins above--I was able to create a basic pumpkin then riff off that
       design with the same dimensions over and over again, giving me a basic template for future pump-
       kins that could all fit into the same slot/spot.
       Now most of our examples thus far have been with our outrageously bad pumpkin illustration. I
       started with that type of example because stacking is often the secret to creating complex logo el-
       ements and other pieces of technical writing that you may need to create from time to time. But,
       it also works for standard designs like signs and newsletters. You just need to apply the same para-
       digm and thought process to your work. Think in layers and stacks and you'll be able to break down
       virtually any design that you see and replicate it fairly easily. This also gives you any number of ways
       to find inspiration for a design because you start to see the various elements in the stack rather than
       the entirety of the image or document. You can borrow a few elements of the stack as inspiration and
       leave the rest.
       Take for another example the newsletter template you'll find below. In this example, you have several

100
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4
different items stacked in simple layers. The background layer has all of the major color blocks for
the header and the footer, then you have text on top of those layers one layer of text for the main
text in the body of the newsletter. To create colored segments that are edge-to-edge, you simply need
to draw a box or equivalent shape and then color it. That becomes a stand-alone layer and colors that
particular part of the layout:

     An example Newsletter Template

Here you get the effects of a simply-designed newsletter with a space for a photo in the center and a
colored header and footer. A few of the elements could be aligned better, but the overall layout works

                                                                 101
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       as a newsletter. By making use of layers and stacking, you can create virtually any design layout you'd
       like by breaking down your intended final product into a series of independent layers. And, again,
       this makes recoloring and movement of elements easy because you're not constantly running into all
       of the elements at any single time.

    Section Projects

       1. Take a document with a fair level of design applied--visuals and colors and the like. Break it down
       into a stack that you could reproduce. What elements will be on what level? What order will they be
       in?
       2. Build your own stack--you just need a program that does design in layers. Create a simple graphic
       using a stack, such as an icon representing a PC. Plan your stack out and then build it.

     Placement and Purpose in Layout Design

       Having looked at stacking, we now need to look at the central move we make when doing document
       design work--placing elements and using that placement to convey purpose. Whereas stacking is an
       approach to creating document designs, placement represents a type of choice we make with each
       individual element in our design. Where we place elements and the relationship of that placement to
       the whole document and other elements in the document controls the way our text is perceived and
       navigated.

       When we view a traditional document, placement often determines the level of importance that we
       give to a line of text. Looking at the x-axis of the document, the further left or right an item is placed
       usually determines the level of importance in the textual hierarchy. If this sounds familiar, it is be-
       cause we touched on this same issue when we were discussing taxonomies in chapter 1. Generally the
       closer to the left side of the document, the more importance something is given. The same also holds
       true to the y-axis: the closer to the top, the more important something is.

       As we noted earlier in the taxonomy discussion, placement has a crossover effect--items that are
       placed in the same way and along the same line on an axis are considered to be of equal importance.
       If you have three images that are placed side-by-side in the middle of a page, you consider them of
       equal importance.

       Going along with the idea of placement equaling the same value for different items, placement
       together also creates groups of items, groups that are usually read as being considered one unit to be
       read together. You see this in many texts where you will have a grouping of images or paragraphs.
       Each of the paragraphs or images that are placed together are considered to be equal and connect-
       ed in some way because they share the same placement on a line in the x or y axis. See the example
       below for what this looks like:

102
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

      An example of grouping

In the above example, you have three different images of pumpkins on the same level of the y-axis.
Because they are of equal size and on the same line, they are viewed as being of equal value to most
readers. If you look at the x-axis alignment of the pumpkin images with the text that is below them,
both the text and the image are on the same line of the x-axis. This creates an association that these
two items are of equal importance and draws a connection.
In addition to simple alignment along an axis, the relative closeness of two items in a document mat-
ters as well. In the pumpkin example, the relative closeness of the text and the images suggests to the

                                                                 103
     Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

     reader that they are part of the same item--they belong together because they are quite close. Each
     of the pairs is considered to be of equal value because they are on the same line of the y-axis, but they
     are not considered the same item because they are not quite as close together.

     The end result is that we can use placement along an axis to indicate that items are of equal impor-
     tance, and the relative closeness between two items along an axis to group them together visually,
     creating a unit within the text on account of the proximity each item has to its companion.

     When it comes to placement, do note that subtlety is usually not something to be sought after. What
     I mean by that is simply that when you want to space items out or want to group them together,
     don't be amibiguous or subtle. If items are together, place them close to each other. If they are of
     equal importance, place them along the same line. If they are not together, make sure the distance
     is great enough that it doesn't appear to be a mistake--very slight variations in distance can be read
     as mistakes by an author rather than a differentiation between two different images. The same holds
     true for any types of placement that indicate value or groupings--if you make the differences be-
     tween groupings or alignments slight, it can and will be read as a mistake. See the image below for an
     example of this:

     An example of bad grouping   In this example, you can see that the
                                  placement of the left and right pairings
                                  of pumpkins is almost exactly along
                                  the same line on the y-axis. There really
                                  isn't much difference between the two,
                                  and there is an awkward gap between
                                  them on the x-axis that just sits empty
                                  and open. To most readers, this is read
                                  as a design mistake because there is a
                                  very subtle shift in the placement of the
                                  images and a general lack of balance to
                                  the placement as well--the large white
                                  space doesn't sit well with us.

                                  Supplementing Placement with Size and
                                  Design Elements

                                  To fix this, we would likely want to use
                                  a different alignment, but we can also
                                  supplement our placement using size
                                  and other tools. Generally speaking, the
                                  size of an item that is placed in a docu-
                                  ment correlates to importance, just like
                                  the size of a font usually connects to the
                                  importance of text in a document. In
                                  addition, much like with text, we can
                                 use lines and other visuals to underscore
                                 our choices in the layout placement.

Putting a line between grouped items is the equivalent of a line break or other spacing equivalent
in text. The size and placement already indicates a relationship in the layout, but the extra elements
underscore this as in the example below:

      An example of grouping with size and lines

Here we have a massive size difference between the two pumpkin/text groups. On the left we have
traditional colors for the pumpkin in a fairly large size. On the right, separated by a black vertical
line but still occupying the same line on the y-axis, we have two additional pumpkins. This line exag-
gerates the importance or at least draws attention to the importance of the size difference and layout

                                                                 105
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       differences between these two groups. It also makes the two groups separate cleanly. The symmetry
       between the smaller elements size and placement also indicates they are of equal importance, but of
       less importance than the larger and left-most image and text combination.

       1. Take an example designed document and breakdown the layout choices. How are size and place-
       ment used to control the navigation of the document? How are groups created and what impact do
       they have on the text?
       2. Create your own layout using simple wire frames to meet a specific purpose, perhaps creating a
       poster or flyer for an event. Think about how you can use size, placement, grouping, and stacking to
       indicate intent.
       3. Take a layout that works well and break it. Move things in ways that ruin the intended effect. Why
       do your choices mess things up? What rules are being broken that make things uncomfortable to
       read or misleading?

     Legibility and Color in Layout

       In addition to the placement of the elements of a design and the relative size of elements in a design,
       we need to consider the relationship the overall legibility of elements and the relationship in particu-
       lar of legibility to color choices. While you can put a lot of great information into a document, that
       doesn't matter much if no one can actually read the information that you've placed in the text. Texts
       can become illegible for a couple of reasons including physical placement, size, and color contrast.
       We'll spend a little extra time discussing color because uses of color can cause text to be less obvious
       without necessarily making it fully illegible.

       We cover legibility for practical and ethical reasons. If you've ever run into a document that had
       important information in a place that was hard to find or in a place that didn't allow you to read very
       easily, you understand the ethical issues with legibility. Sadly, there are some writers out there who
       have purposefully used the layout and design of their texts to make some information less legible or
       to hide it altogether. One fundamental question we have to ask ourselves regarding legibility is sim-
       ply: am I making this text fit at the cost of readability?

       One way we need to deal with legibility is just the physical aspects of legibility--where text is on a
       document and how conducive that placement is to use and reference. In some cases, you may have a
       text where certain parts of the document simply aren't that useful for prime information. For exam-
       ple, if part of your document could be exposed to excessive wear, you wouldn't want anything im-
       portant to go in that space. (This might be an issue with a text that has a long life and gets referenced
       and used continually). You can also have parts of a text hidden by the physical structure of a docu-
       ment--content too close to the spine of a book can be unreadable.

       We also want to think about the size of the text that we're placing and how that size impacts readabil-
       ity. When it comes to working with size, we want to be able to balance the overall amount of space
       that a bit of text is using with the importance of that text, the amount of information that needs to
       be there, and the legibility of the choices that we're making.

Not all fonts are created equally, as we'll discuss in our next major section on typography. One
way we can measure/assess fonts is their relative x-height: the height of a given font's lowercase "x."
X-height allows us to assess the general contrast between the height of lower-case and upper-case
letters in a particular font. The closer the lower and upper case letters are in height, the more legibil-
ity a particular font tends to be at smaller sizes. This isn't universally true--some fonts are just hard
to read at small sizes--but, it can be a great rule of thumb. So, if you need a font that will perform at
small sizes, find one with a relatively small level of contrast between lower and upper case letters. For
an example, see below:

An example of the impact of x-height

Here you have two different fonts, each set at 10pt. Notice that the top example is much easier to
read at any level of distance. A major reason for this readability? The x-height.

When we're dealing with text in general, legibility concerns should lead us to try to never go below
10 point sizing. 12 point is a relatively common size for general paragraph text, and while small-
er font sizes can be readable in certain contexts, going below 10 can cause issues for some readers.
If you simply need more space to convey the information on a given document, you may need to
either edit your information for clarity and brevity, or you may need to create a larger document or a
supplemental text that can be referenced. (Though, the issue with supplemental texts is that very few
of us are going to go out of our way to find and read them).

As a secondary issue related to legibility and size, we want to make sure our use of size is is propor-
tional to the importance of a bit of information to our users. We shouldn't go out of our way to
make less important information super visible while hiding less important information--to do so is
unethical and often causes no amount of frustration with readers. Have you ever gone to the store
and seen a special and decided to go ahead and take advantage of it, only to get to the checkout and
realize you didn't see the fine print that makes you ineligible to actually get the special price? If so,
you've encountered this very issue! Depending on your mood, you may have rewarded the misuse of
font sizing by just going ahead and getting the purchase, regardless of the sale price, but if you're an-
noyed enough you might just abandon your whole purchase. Without naming names, I can tell you

                                                                 107
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       that a certain local retailer with a national footprint has basically turned me off of all of their "buy
       X and get a gift card for X amount" deals for this exact reason. If I see those signs, I tend to ignore
       them--I've been mislead too often and I'm too annoyed to mess with them.

       To get around issues related to size and importance, simply make sure that any critical information is
       obvious enough on a quick read. If you've gone out of your way to make a special visible to a reader,
       make sure any common disqualifications are equally visible, or at least make sure the fact that qual-
       ifications exist is very visible. When possible, try to give all information regarding a subject equal
       billing, that way you don't risk annoying or misleading your readers by gating certain information
       via sizing. For example, a BOGO (buy one, get one) sale sign that doesn't let you see that the BOGO
       nets you a 10% discount is deeply frustrating to someone who assumed a second item was free or
       heavily discounted. In this case, we would want the tail end of the BOGO to show up at the same
       size as the rest of the text, or at least at a size that allows instant comprehension of the deal. In situ-
       ations like this, the extra text placement simply makes sense--you can't assess the value of a BOGO
       offer without the final bit of information.

       Having looked at physical placement, font size, and the size/importance connection, we finally need
       to cover the importance of color in layout legibility and readability. Color can impact the way that
       we process texts in any number of ways, each worth taking a moment to focus on. First, color can
       impact overall legibility of text and other elements. It can also impact the way that readers assess a
       text and associate a text with other information. Finally, color pose an accessibility concern that we
       need to be aware of.

       When thinking about the legibility of a text's layout in regards to color, we want to think about how
       much contrast is available between a given text and that text's background. The traditional writing
       arrangement that we see when we fire up a word processor makes optimum usage of contrast by pre-
       senting us with a total contrast between a solid white background and solid black text. In a few cases
       we see this reversed for nighttime reading on a screen with a solid black background and solid white
       text. Regardless of which is used, the goal for both layouts is an optimum level of contrast. When
       moving beyond these two choices, we need to make sure our color choices maintain an acceptable
       color contrast in our layout.

       When dealing with contrasting colors, the simple rule of thumb is to choose colors that different in
       their general darkness or shade--you want a lighter option to contrast with a darker option. General-
       ly speaking, light text and light background shades don't go well together as in the example below:

               An example of poor contrast

108
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

With this example, you can see the horror that has been wrought by using a light yellow with a light
blue background. These two shades are both too close in coloration to be of use to us.

One trick to finding useful colors is to simply use complementary colors--colors that are opposite
each other on the color wheel. Any number of tools exist to select color off of a wheel-type selector,
and all you need to do is choose from colors on opposite sides to create a level of contrast that is legi-
ble and often aesthetically pleasing as well. See the example below where we've kept the same general
shade of blue but alternated the text with something complementary:

          An example of good contrast

Notice that the orange shade is much more legible on the blue background, creating a much more
attractive layout choice in general for text that should be easy-to-read.

Now, when it comes to color, this isn't to say that you should always avoid using similar colors!
When you're creating a design, you may well want to use colors that are shades of each other or that
blend well together. This can create aesthetically pleasing designs with the various elements of your
text. You should only avoid having colors that blend together easily when you're trying to say some-
thing important to your readers, when you're passing along textual information.

In addition to general legibility, color often impacts the way that we read a text--it colors our in-
terpretation. For example, if you're trying to associate a document with a particular brand, you will
want to use that brand's colors. Think about the way we can identify someone's affiliation at a given
sports event based almost entirely on the colors they are wearing--the same holds true for texts. Cer-
tain brands have iconic colors and iconic imagery--by using those, we're drawing on the associations
and immediately impacting how someone assesses the text.

There can be issues when we misuse color to draw associations--you want to make sure your usage
is genuine and not misleading, else you risk the ire of your users. No one likes to be deceived by a
document and using color to imply something that isn't accurate does just that.

In addition to brands, colors also have seasonal and cultural associations. We've already highlighted
how black and orange can signal Halloween, and the same can be true for green and red for Christ-
mas in the US. You likely can think of any number of color associations you have with seasonal and
local events, and the number of associations that go with these colors reaches even further when we
open up to an international audience. For example, Chinese weddings tend to make use of abun-
dant amounts of red--white wouldn't be appropriate at all because of associations with funerals. At

                                                                 109
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       the same time, a red wedding in current US culture might draw entirely different associations with a
       popular television and book series. Color and culture have a close connection that must be researched
       and respected!

       Next, as with size, you want to use the contrast and impact of a color choice to correlate with the
       information's importance that you're sharing. If you're simply creating a background element that
       makes the text nicer looking, there is no duty to make things stand out--blending in is a good thing.
       But, if you're relaying important information, you need to make sure that it stands out! Don't use
       your contrasting colors for unimportant information while hiding the important stuff with colors
       that blend into the background. Make sure your text stands out!

       Finally, keep in mind that colors can pose accessibility issues to those with different visible color spec-
       trums. Keep in mind that combinations such as red and green can be difficult to many readers who
       cannot differentiate between these two colors! While going into a full discussion of colorblindness ac-
       cessibility is outside the scope of this current text, you should make sure to test your documents and
       identify issues with color choices that may impact your readers. For example, green and black can
       be a difficult distinction for some with colorblindness to make: my father's favorite pair of pants is a
       set of olive slacks that are his favorite pair of black pants that he owns. A growing number of design
       tools have a built-in testing tool for color accessibility--if those are available for you, use them.

       Just like other audience issues, color needs to be researched! You need to be aware of any brand con-
       nections with your color choices, any cultural significance related to your colors when you're creat-
       ing a text, and any barriers that your colors may present to those with color blindness and different
       views of the colors around them. This type of work is simply due diligence for us as technical writers.
       Colors send a message, and we want to make sure we're using them to send a message we fully under-
       stand and intend to send.

     Layout and Printing Considerations

       One final layout consideration we need to tackle is the issue of printing, primarily an issue of bleeds
       and margins. If you've not done any professional printing, or at least any edge-to-edge color printing,
       you likely have no idea what I'm talking about. That's okay. We'll dive into the physicality of printing
       in this section and give you a brief boot camp on getting this stuff done.

       Whenever you see a printed document that has color elements that go all the way to the edge of the
       page, you're seeing a choice that was designed around the physical nature of printing using bleeds.
       Edge-to-edge printing is not something that naturally happens in a production environment. You
       may have noticed with your own printers that you can't print all the way to the edge of a piece of pa-
       per--there is always a margin the printer simply can't touch. The same is mostly true for professional
       printing. To get around this, documents are printed on larger pieces of paper than the final product
       and then cut down to the actual size needed. Usually you pay per cut for this service, so if you had
       four sides of a text cut, you'd pay for the four different cuts in your run. (Note, this is for the full run,
       not per document).

       The issue with cutting a text down to size is that cutting is not as precise as we'd prefer. There is
       almost always going to be some variability in the cut made by the printer. To get around this variabil-

110
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

ity, we make use of a document element known as a bleed. A bleed is a small extra margin around a
text where all elements that go to the edge of the final text will bleed off the normal page to a sec-
ondary edge of the text, usually one that is perhaps a quarter of an inch or less more than the stan-
dard edge. This extra area is the bleed, and is used to make sure if the blade cuts too far outside the
document there will still be designed elements to keep the text looking as intended. The same is true
for the opposite side--you generally don't want important information within the same margin of
the bleed on the inside of a text's border either--the cut can be too far in either direction.

When you set up your document for these types of printing, you'll want to go into your document
settings and create a bleed. The size of the bleed will depend on where you're getting the document
printed--different places with have different tolerances they prefer. Once you've set the bleed, you'll
want to make the printer aware of the bleed that will need to be cut off the text to reach the ideal
size.

In addition to the bleed, you'll want to be aware of the binding's impact on your text. Any text that
is bound by some sort of spine will have less room on the inside of each page for legible content. Too
close to the spine of the text and your words will be lost in the page--especially on documents with
a hefty spine.

1. Think about colors and connections. What colors are associated with your campus, with events on
your campus, and with groups there? What about with your workplaces or your hometowns?
2. Bleeds are a concept that can be foreign at first. Do some searching for designs that use edge-to-
edge color or images or text and assess how they use the bleed. What do you think the document
would look like after the margin, in the space for the bleed? What freedom does allowing elements
to hang off the text provide for you as an author or designer?

Typography

Having looked at layout, we need to next cover the subject of typography in document design.
Typography is a massive subject, one that we could spend an entire semester on and still find our-
selves lacking by some metrics. For our purposes, we will look at how typography impacts our work
as technical writers and investigate the choices that we have at the level of typography to tweak the
appearance of our texts and their impact. We'll discuss fonts and font families; the attributes of these
fonts and how they impact our texts; choices of kerning, tracking, and leading; and font availability.

In general, I think we find ourselves in a world that is more aware of fonts and font choices than
previous generations. We have entire documentaries available on the font Helvetica. We have folks
that will instantly turn their noses at the usage of Papyrus or Comic Sans. Fonts and their names and
impact are a bit more on our minds in popular culture, but these issues I've hit on only scratch the
surface of what a font is and how we can view it.

For one, if we're going to be traditionalists, we should distinguish between a font and a typeface.
Generally speaking, when we discuss fonts, we're really discussing typefaces. Typefaces are the full

                                                                 111
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       collections of the fonts of a particular family that share a common design. You may not realize it,
       but each particular variation of a font is often designed by a designer creating a typeface. There are
       separate variations for regular, italic, bold, and small caps, just to name a few. These variations are
       designed by the font's creator to maintain the font's aesthetic and legibility throughout. With that
       said, not all fonts have these options, or more correctly, not all typefaces have fonts with all of these
       variations. In those cases you may simply not have the option to bold or italicize or small caps your
       font--you're running into limits in what designer intended. Now, some programs will override this
       distinction and give you italics and bolding and small caps where none exists, but those options are
       usually less aesthetically pleasing and more likely to clash with the rest of the typeface.

       Going beyond the distinction between typefaces and fonts, we could go into different traditions of
       fonts and font designs. Suffice it to say that we can see fonts in a couple of ways. Some fonts are his-
       torically designed and oriented--they are recreations of classic fonts that were used in a particular era
       by a particular printer or artist. In the case of book printing, the font may be based on a typeface that
       was used by a particular printer. In the case of comics or other visual texts, the font may be based on
       a particular lettering style. On the opposite end of the spectrum are novel fonts, fonts that are created
       by their designer within particular traditions but without a direct one-to-one historical target. We
       could go even further down this rabbit hole, but for our purposes this amount of awareness should
       work for us.

     Attributes of Fonts

       When we look at fonts, we often use the most basic of distinctions to decide the difference between
       two different competing typefaces. One may simply look better than the other to our eyes, but fonts
       have any number of fairly universally recognized attributes that we can discuss, as well as distinct per-
       sonalities. Moving beyond simply liking a font to choosing a font based on its attributes and person-
       ality gives us even more ability as technical writers to shape the way our texts impact readers and the
       way that we research our projects.

       First and foremost we can divide fonts by whether or not they have serifs, tiny little embellishments
       on the letters, often referred to as feet. Serif and sans-serif fonts as they are usually referred to, have
       different aesthetics that can be traced in any number of directions. Below you'll find an example of
       the two types of fonts, with serifs highlighted in red:

         An example of serif and sans-serif fonts

112
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

In the first sentence above, we see a sans-serif font. The letters terminate with solid blocky forms
with no extra embellishment. In the second example, we see a serif font, one that has the small feet
on the edges of the letters.

There are any number of claims made by various sources that about whether serif or sans-serif fonts
are superior for different usages. The traditional line is that serif-fonts are best used for body text
because the feet allow the text to flow together well. Sans-serif are used in this line of thinking as the
headings and headers because they are stark and each letter stands out crisply. Some will also claim
that electronic screens are best suited to sans-serif fonts, but there is conflicting research on this
subject.

For our purposes, we want to be aware of these differences and use them rhetorically--to persuade
and inform our readers. Because sans-serif and serif fonts have a clear visual difference, we want to
use that difference to our advantage. We can use serif fonts for one type of information and sans-serif
for another, correlating font type with the information type available. We can also think about the
cultural character of each choice--serif fonts tend to feel more formal and bookish whereas sans-serif
fonts tend to be more minimalist and high-tech in their feel in our current culture (that can change).
We can take advantage of these differences and use the font family that best fits the aesthetic and
audience we have chosen.

Going beyond serifs, we can also look at the x-height of a font and the behavior of ascenders and
descenders in the typeface. As we mentioned previously, x-height refers to the relative height of the
lower-case letter x compared to the upper-case letters of the font. The x-height of a font can be used
to judge how well the font will perform at small sizes; in addition, a shorter x-height may look less
imposing at a larger size if you're wanting a larger font without overwhelming the reader. Ascenders
and descenders are, as perhaps the names suggest, the elements of a font that ascend and descend
from the normal line of text. Letters like "q" and "p" and "t" can be tricky with fonts that have sub-
stantial amounts of descending and ascending characters. See the image below for examples of each
of these elements:

    An example of ascenders, descenders, and x-height

You can see in our two examples that the x-height of the first sentence is considerably higher than
the x-height of the second. This creates a font that takes a good bit of room on the line and page.
At smaller sizes this can be very useful, though it can feel cramped at larger sizes. With each font
you see the ascending "t" and the descending "q." When the line spacing is tighter, as you see in the

                                                                 113
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       example, these ascenders and descenders with more exaggerated lengths can cause issues of legibility
       that we need to be aware of. The more ornate and exaggerated these elements, the less a font can be
       condensed with tighter line spacing on the y-axis. (Hint: this is called the leading and we'll get to it
       soon).

       In addition to the letters, we need to focus on how numbers are presented in fonts. There are general-
       ly two types of font that are of importance to us as technical writers, those with lining and those with
       non-lining numerals. As perhaps the name implies, non-lining numerals are those that don't stay in
       an even line with each other. Lining numerals, on the other hand, line up nicely. The difference in
       readability is incredible and you'll almost always want to go with lining numerals for technical writ-
       ing that conveys a lot of numerical data. Compare the two examples below:

         An example of lining and non-lining numerals

       In this example, the first sentence makes use of lining numerals and the second uses non-lining nu-
       merals. You can immediately see the difference, with the second example using numbers that vary in
       their height and line placement. The first example is much more regular, creating a figure that can be
       referenced a bit easier. Lining numerals are to be generally preferred for passing along large quantities
       of data since they make reference easier. Non-lining numerals can be more effective for an aesthetic
       effect or to convey smaller amounts of numbers.

       In addition to these attributes, some typefaces have what is referred to as a small caps font within
       the family. These small caps are a condensed version of the font in all caps that creates a more com-
       pressed yet readable variant of the font. You often see small caps in texts that will reference things
       like the scientific name of a particular species such as vulpes vulpes for a fox. With that said, not
       every font has an explicitly designed small caps--those that don't are restricted in their access to this
       format or have a fake version created by the word processor you're using. These fake version of small
       caps are often less legible and less distinct. See the example below for what small caps looks like when
       designed explicitly:

         An example of small caps

114
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

As illustrated above, small caps make sure of a smaller and slightly stylized version of the regular up-
per case font characters. These characters are sized close to the x-height of the font while maintaining
the same general feel of the larger characters. You can see in this example that also lends itself to a
slightly wider character as well.
Small caps can be useful for aesthetic reasons as well as practical and conventional uses. In the case of
species names, you will often find the usage of small caps appropriate and superior to italics. Com-
pared to italics, small caps stand out more and have more distinct characters. They are also more
subtle than all caps, which in the present day are often associated with screaming or HIGH LEVELS
OF EMOTION IN WRITING.
Having looked at the various attributes of fonts, we finally need to look at the collected impact of
those attributes--the personality of a given font. In addition to having particular characteristics,
fonts have an overall feel that makes them work in some situations and not work in other situations.
Script-style fonts tend to feel more formal and antiquated or intimate whereas more bold and blocky
letterforms seem convey an entirely different aesthetic. Decorative fonts, at the furtherest extreme,
sacrifice paragraph-level readability for a particular look and feel. Compare the fonts below and the
messages they convey:

    An example of font personality

In the example above, the message is one of general sympathy that you might find in a card that
would be sent after the loss of a fox. Each of the fonts above conveys the message in a different way
with varying levels of appropriateness. The first example is blocky and modern feeling, attributes we
don't normally associate with sympathy. The middle example is a script-style font and conveys the
aesthetic we'd associate with grief communications. The final example is a decorative font that simply
feels out of place and difficult to read--this font may have its uses, but full sentences of text is likely
not the ideal choice!

                                                                 115
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       Before we move on, I want tack on one additional note about fonts and symbols, and specifically
       symbol-oriented font families. You may have wondered in the past, like many of us no doubt, about
       the purpose behind the Wingdings family of fonts. Why do they exist? Who can possibly read them?
       The answer is simple: they aren't designed to be read. Wingdings and other symbol-based fonts,
       such as stylized fonts of the Greek alphabet that you might use in creating content for a fraternity or
       sorority, exist to provide high-quality and scalable graphical indicators that don't have to be embed-
       ded as an image. Instead, they scale in the same way that a font would and provide access to certain
       images without the need for embedding other content. They may not always have immediate uses to
       us, but be aware they exist and that you can browse them using the symbol insertion feature of most
       design and word processing tools.

       Kerning and Tracking and Leading, Oh My!
       Having looked at the various attributes of fonts, we now want to turn our gaze to the ways that we
       can manipulate fonts for different effects. As with the attributes and personalities of a font, all of this
       work is done in service of the use we have in mind for a font and the way we plan to implement the
       font in our documents. Just like the attributes of a font, these manipulations of fonts can impact the
       way the fonts are received and the readability of the text that results from their usage.

       Each of these attributes of fonts has to do with the relationship between individual characters and
       lines vertically and horizontally. By adjusting these characters, we can often fit a particular font into
       a particular use for a particular goal. Kerning and tracking and leading aren't necessarily something
       you'll be tweaking all the time--just like you won't need to constantly obsess about the x-height of a
       font. But, being aware of these options for font adjustment can be the difference between a deliver-
       able that is good or okay and one that is excellent for a particular usage.

       We'll start with kerning, the spacing between individual characters in a particular font. Kerning is
       something that is often hidden from us when we're working with fonts in a standard word processor.
       Unlike other options that we'll eventually look at, kerning works on a letter-by-letter basis, adjusting
       the spacing of different letters until we're entirely happy with the way they're spaced. One reason that
       kerning is often overlooked is because the choices regarding kerning are normally baked into any
       given typeface that you make use of. The designer of the font, in laying out the different glyphs, will
       have chosen what the natural kerning will be of the font.

       The most likely scenario where you'd want to regularly adjust kerning would be when you're going to
       be using a font in a way that it wasn't designed to be used--often at a very large size. This isn't always
       the case--some fonts are designed for signage rather than paragraph blocks of print--but, more
       often than not you'll find yourself wanting to tweak kerning after you've made something excessively
       large. With programs that are more design-friendly, you'll be able to choose between optical and met-
       ric kerning. Metric kerning is the basic kerning baked into your font, whereas optical kerning applies
       math to the spacing to give you a better spacing at larger sizes. The idea behind the optical option is
       that the default kerning just won't work as well at larger font sizes where everything gets exaggerat-
       ed--especially letter spacing.

                                                                 117
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       As in the example text on the previous page, you start to see more issues with kerning using letters
       that need a good deal of elbow room, letters like "R" and "W." These letters can be a real bear to
       work with because they have a larger spacing to begin with in the font's internal calculations, and the
       larger sizing means that those calculations get exaggerated effects at larger sizes. Some fonts will do
       better than others, but you'll likely need to switch to optical kerning or manually kern the letters to
       get the impact you want---usually a tighter text profile.
       Take a look at the examples below: two different font options will be presented for the same font and
       the same text, one with tighter kerning at a larger size and another with a looser kerning at a larger
       size. See which you prefer for a headline:

    An example of varied font kerning for headlines

       In the above example, you have two different amounts of kerning between the two text groups,
       though my kerning isn't perfect in the second. The top example is the default kerning of the font I'm
       using at 150pt or so. Below it I have some placeholder text that you can use to see how well these
       would go with a body of text as a headline. Notice that the second example is much tighter and looks
       a bit more impactful--the lack of extra spacing gives the text more weight. The wider kerning doesn't
       work as well--it looks a bit too airy for a headline. Now, my kerning could be better: I'm not 100%
       happy with the gap between "F" and "o" in "Fox," but the difference I think is fairly clear.
       Besides using kerning to adjust for larger sizing, you may also want to use kerning for creative ef-
       fect, altering the spacing on words to make them convey something different than they would with
       traditional spacing. An example will likely make this use a bit clearer, though my example won't be
       the best:

118
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

An example of creative kerning use

Here, you have the "her" of "together" kerned manually to create an emphasis on the "her" part
of things. You might be able to use this perhaps in an instance where you're naming a brand or a
product and you want to have an iconic wordmark that you can use for identification. It might look
something like this:

An expanded example of creative kerning use

Now, you may have already seen some issues with the way that I've done this. For me, I see that
when you separate "her" from the rest of the word, "together" can be read as "To get her," due to the
way that the spacing makes us more aware that there are individual smaller words in "together." So,
in this case it might not be the best idea to separate "her" with kerning because the final result might
run afoul of my goal. That's the risk we run into when we start kerning things to emphasize certain
parts of words.
Having looked at kerning, we next want to take a step up to tracking, an approach to modifying text
that takes the concept of kerning and applies it across a full word or more. Tracking is the adjust-
ment of the space between all letters at once--instead of taking a one at a time approach, you do
everything all at once. Tracking can be useful for tightening up a loose headline or header that has
gotten too wide or for spacing out something that needs to fill a bit more space. Be warned, howev-
er, that tracking is a fairly blunt approach to spacing letters. You will sometimes find that tracking
changes will make most letters look good while leaving a few letters looking awkward. These issues
you're running into with tight or wide tracking that becomes awkwardly wide or narrow for certain
letters, they're why kerning exists and why fonts are kerned in the first place! As a head's up--many
word processors will hide tracking under the term letter spacing.
As we've already noted, tracking can be useful to tighten up headlines as needed. I'll even let you in
on a little secret: I used tracking in my example above with the mayor-based headline. Practically

                                                                 119
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       speaking, it can be very hard to see differences between tracked headlines and manually kerned ones.
       In my case, as I noted above, the "F" gave me away slightly.
       You can also use tracking in the other direction to give yourself more space when you need it to make
       sense. You may have seen this type of approach in certain word-based designs or posters that use extra
       space between letters to give an individual word the ability to fill an entire space. Below you'll see an
       example of what that looks like with and without the extra spacing:

    An example of different levels of tracking

       In the above examples, you see two different approaches to the same wordmark design, one using
       tighter tracking, and the other using looser tracking. You'll see in the top example there is an airy feel
       to things and the two different text selections hold the same general width. In the case of the second
       line, this takes a script that flows together and makes it much more spaced and less obviously a tight
       script font. Personally, I'm a fan of the first item--I think it works better as a brand as the letters
       stand out and are more aggressive in their presentation (though breaking up a script font that con-
       nects can be dangerous). The tighter presentation of the second example simply looks like text to me,
       text that has been made larger. What do you think?
       Much like kerning, tracking can be used for these creative endeavors, or simply to fix the natural
       spacing of your fonts as you work with larger sizes. As technical writers you won't be placed, normal-
       ly, in the demanding position of a graphic design professional, folks who take knowledge like this of
       font design as a mere starting place for all that they do. However, having an awareness of the ways
       that you can tweak even down to the character and line spacing opens up so much more for you
       when you're doing design work. There really is just about as much you can do with fonts and spacing

120
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4
as you can do with paragraphs and headings!
The final spacing term that we'll discuss is leading, pronounced like the metal not the action. Lead-
ing refers to the space between lines, also known as line spacing. The classic term leading comes from
the actual lead that would have been used in a printing press between the different lines. For a fun
font fact, upper and lower case letters are simply those found in the upper and lower case of a font
collection. The name is based on the physical placement of those images. Here's an example of a
simple press and font bin:

A font collection and press

With leading, we're dealing with a term that represents the last vestiges of a physical process that for
most of us has become an entirely digital one.

                                                                 121
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       Leading, like tracking and kerning, can be used to shape the way our texts are perceived as well as
       the ways that they inhabit a space. As you create more space between lines, you give more space for
       ascenders and descenders to freely reach. Some fonts may well require you to manually adjust leading
       if they have an aggressive script that juts below and above the baseline, the invisible line that all type
       on a given line is oriented to. More space between lines can reach a point, however, where the lines
       cease to appear like they are part of the same text--they begin to break up into paragraphs or other
       structures. When you're using leading to give yourself more room, take care that you don't pass this
       invisible point of no return. See the example below for what different amounts of leading do to the
       same text:

    An example of different levels of leading

       Here we have three different takes on leading--the first example has aggressive leading, to the point
       that we barely get any text on the screen, the second example has an incredibly tight leading, almost
       getting to the point we don't want to read, and the third example has normal leading. Each has its
       own impact on the text.
       In the example above, notice that one primary facet of leading is that it makes paragraphs more
       distinct as visual units when the leading gets smaller--you see the larger spaces between lines a bit
       better when the leading is tight, but those blur and almost fall away when you start dealing with
       larger amounts of leading. A slight reduction of the leading can tighten up a visual design, but larger
       amounts can have the opposite effect.
       Practically speaking, you can use more leading in places where you may want to have a text annotat-
       ed and worked on. Think about double-spaced papers that you might have been required to submit

122
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

in the past: the number one reason these papers are useful from a practical standpoint is that if you're
doing handwritten markup on a paper, grading with pen and paper if you will, then you have room
for comments and changes. The same holds true for any type of editing work. However, outside of
those constraints, tighter leading is more pleasant to read (at least to me!) and wastes less space and
paper.

One point of caution regarding all of the types of typographical manipulation we've discussed: do
not use these tools to simply make something fit where it won't normally fit. When you go to great
lengths to wedge a text into a small space using tracking or leading, you're getting your text into a
place it wasn't designed to fit, literally. In this equation you save space at the cost of readability, and
the folks who bear the brunt of that readability will be your users. Don't do that to them, please.

Font Availability and Ethics

Having covered a great many aspects of font design, I want to finish with a very short discussion
of font availability and ethics. As you start learning more about fonts and what fonts can do when
used in different ways, you may become quite aware of the limits of your font choice in your default
working environment. Generally speaking, this is governed by your operating system choice--
Windows and Linux tend to have less font choices than OSX, likely due to the classical heritage of
Macintosh computers as designer-friendly spaces. To get new fonts, you usually have to find and
download them or buy.

Font creation, like any other act of creation, is a lot of work. Font designers craft each and every
individual character by hand and then go and create kerning for those designs and special characters
and variations as well. There is a lot of work in this process, and just like any other creative profes-
sional they deserve compensation for their work. I say all of this to prepare you for a reality that you
will encounter in any professional writing scenario: assets are not free, and many times they are not
cheap for professional use.

For example, a professionally designed font might cost $25 for a single license, but if you wanted to
use it across multiple computers and with multiple devices, you would need to investigate a multi-
use license. As we'll discuss a bit later when we talk about project management and intellectual
property issues in technical writing, professional materials require expenditures if you're not going
to create the assets you use yourself, and often the creation of those assets requires such a specialized
skill set and equipment that your either have to hire someone internally or simply pay the fees asso-
ciated with using the content you want. With that said, once you start thinking about all that can be
done with $250 image for a logo and a $25 font, all of the money and interaction that comes from
using these assets, the deal is quite reasonable.

With that said, there is a thriving world of open source fonts available for use, much like this text-
book is open-access and free for anyone to read and use. As with almost anything open source,
things can be a bit wonky and slanted towards a particular usage. Open source content is usually
created by folks with a particular ideological interest for open materials, folks that believe that open
is best (I suppose I'm closer to this camp than any as you might be able to tell since I'm writing an
open-access textbook), and folks that are using open source for a particular usage as part of an orga-

                                                                 123
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

       nized effort or passion project. There are other permutations of course, but these are two big camps.
       The end result is that the same idiosyncrasies that come with these mindsets carry over into the as-
       sets. Just be aware that open source doesn't mean that you get the same breadth and depth of quality
       for free. It means that in certain cases you can get amazing content for free from passionate folks, and
       in other cases you get a good-enough effort that exists because it needs to.

       With that said, you need to be careful of what you're getting into when you go looking for free or
       cheap fonts. There are individuals who will rather unscrupulously strip a high-end font and recreate
       it and release it open-source or as a low-end product to make a quick buck. These recreations aren't
       going to be as high quality usually as the originals and they won't reimburse the folks doing the
       amazing design and research work needed to create the font you've been eyeing. Be aware of these
       issues.

       Generally speaking, you'll want to be able to trace any fonts or other assets that have a potential
       copyright back to their original holder, as we'll be discussing later on. The way that business and
       professional writing works, if someone uses a copyrighted item to make money there can be severe
       penalties for lost profits and lots of lawsuits coming your way. When you're working as part of a larg-
       er organization, they'll get targeted because they likely have much more money than you and they're
       the ones making the profit off the content that you appropriated without a license or permission.

       However, there are many fonts out there that designers will freely offer to you with freeware licens-
       es--if you're not going to be making money off the font, they'll let you use it without issue. These
       licenses can be helpful for many personal projects that you may have, allowing you to create content
       without licenses designed around commercial use. I've used these types of licenses many times and as
       of late I've tended to use fonts created by a designer that I know through our mutual appreciation of
       comics. There is a wide world of folks creating fonts and I think you'll find they are passionate and
       fascinating folks to work with.

    Section End Questions

       1. Take a risk with font personalities! Recreate your institution's logo or wordmark with different
       fonts that have different personalities. What effects can you get? Why?
       2. Use tracking or kerning to alter the impact of a headline or wordmark. What happens when you
       introduce more space or less space?
       3. Do some original research--find a popular brand and breakdown their usage of fonts and spacing.
       What typefaces do they use? What fonts within those typefaces? What types of x-heights are used?
       How are kerning and tracking and leading used?
       4. Find a professionally designed font and research the process behind acquiring a license for it and
       the limitations of that license in professional usage.

   Remembering those signposts

       Alright, we did it. We got through document design! You've undoubtably learned something from
       all of this, hopefully several somethings. With that said, you may be wondering in the back of your
       mind how this all will apply to you in a technical writing situation. After all, you signed up for a class

124
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 4

in technical writing instead of a class in graphic design. At the very least, consider this content value
added--if you never had this knowledge, you do now! At the other extreme, realize that this content
is the very heart and soul of what it means to be a technical writer. The formatting and the presenta-
tion of the content you write has the same impact and resonance with readers as your choices in the
actual words themselves. It all matters and impacts things!
Now that you have a firm grasp of how layout, color, fonts, and all the rest work, use them to make
your documents wonderfully signposted and easy to access. You now have a cornucopia of choices to
make use of to guide your reader through a text in a certain way or to create a text that lends itself to
a particular type of usage. You have a toolbox full of new and at times creative ways of signposting
your texts, and that's exciting! (At least it is for me!)
Here are just a few suggestions:

Signposting Tips

 Think about using color consistently through a document, syncing up with sections, the major colors of your
organization, or the thematic that you're covering (green for green energy, etc).
 Analyze designs with stacking to create your own intricate logos and other effects through layering content
to create a cohesive whole.
 Consider using layout to your advantage, creating sidebars with extra information for your readers that
need it, while keeping your major text free of extra information that experts simply won't need to see.
 Choose fonts that sync up to your purpose with using them, allowing different fonts to serve iconic roles,
instantly signaling to readers what they're going to encounter in a given section. (Though, don't use too many--
that gets confusing, just like too many colors).
There are any number of things that can be done with the content we've covered--use this content
critically and creatively to expand what you can do as a technical writer. I think you'll find that just
this little bit of a background in document design can open doors to any number of possibilities you
thought were outside of your reach previously.

Chapter Five:

     Writing in Genres
     Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

     Having looked at the general idea of technical writing, the relationship of technical writing to the
     user, the visual communication angle of technical writing, and the process of document design in
     tech writing, we next need to cover a major pillar of technical writing in the minds of many: genres.
     (This is the part where we talk about report writing).

     When we work in genres, we're working in what are essentially categories of texts that have formed
     over time to mean something. We often run into genre when it comers to books and television, with
     some books or shows (or films) labeled with categories like "Suspense" or "Mystery" or "Comedy."
     We can also get much more specific, especially in television where the are very well-worn genres that
     have appeared over time, so you might run into a "police procedural," a very specific type of show. In
     the case of police procedural, you have a show that is entirely about the process of the police inves-
     tigating a particular crime. The genre gives you a clue as to the general type of show or film you're
     going to watch. (Bear with me in this discussion--you may wonder why I'm talking about TV, but I
     promise it will all wrap back around in a useful way in a bit).

     Genre, however, is not specific to the point that it controls everything about a production: genre is
     fluid and changes over time. For example, the police procedural of the earlier years of television with
     shows like Dragnet did not have a major relationship component to the show--it was just about the
     crime for the most part. However, if you made a police procedural today without heavy interaction
     between different leads and ongoing stories about the police and their lives, you'd likely have a flop
     on your hands. The genre has evolved and expectations have changed.

     Many genres come with an expectation even that you'll have a sub-genre that will come into play to
     flavor the dominant genre. Think about police procedurals again--you have shows that are much
     more direct and serious like the various iterations of behemoths like Law & Order and then you have
     shows much more playful at times such as Castle or even shows that skirt further towards the edge
     of the genre (if they belong there at all) like Psych (A true gem of television, up there with Star Trek:
     Deep Space Nine, Midsomer Murders, and Fringe). In these cases, there is a general approach to the
     genre, but all of that is filtered through the general gist of the sub-genre, such as comedy. With very
     common genres like the police procedural we often judge these shows on how they take the genre
     constraints and then push them or subvert them with a secondary genre or a new approach. Very few
     shows gain success for being an ideal procedural--it's all about what they do beyond that framework
     that gets folks excited. Sorry Dragnet.

     Now, let's bring this back home--all of what I've said applies to technical writing genres. When we
     think about a genre like a report, that term is just like a genre in television like a police procedural.
     The term itself gives you a general idea of what the document you're going to create might look like,
     but for the most part it is utterly meaningless if you're expecting the genre to give you a detailed
     insight into what your report should look like. Just like the television examples, the technical writ-
     ing genres are not laws carved into the bedrock of reality--they are categories, fluid ones at that,
     that give you a general gist of the type of document you'll be making without really getting into the
     specifics of things.

     Asking someone to teach you how to write a report or any other genre in the specific sense of what
     steps to take and what sections to include is akin to asking someone to teach you how to make a po-

127                                                                                                             127

       lice procedural--they can give you a general sense of the expectations and permutations of the genre
       in a broad and classic sense, but they cannot tell you exactly how to write it. And, to go even further
       and hammer this point home, if I was to tell you how to write a report it would be at best a polite
       fiction. My idea of a report and your future employers' idea of a report would differ, and even the
       types of reports you'd write within the same organization would change over time. There is no secret
       bastion of knowledge where you can uncover the true secrets of writing the ultimate report, no secret
       recipe to follow for success across time and space. And to be clear, anyone who tells you different isn't
       being very honest. So, what are we left with? We are left with research. Imagine that. Didn't see that
       coming, did you? :)

       Genre work, just like any other part of technical writing, relies on research to get things right. Report
       writing, white paper writing, grant/proposal writing, technical description writing, and any other
       type of genre you'd want to associate with professional or technical writing will always rely on the
       context that you're writing in and the expectations that surround you. That isn't to say that having a
       general sense of a genre is useless--it isn't at all! You need to know the general sense of the genre just
       to orient yourself and help identify it. But, expecting a general sense of the genre to guide you from
       start to finish is expecting too much from too little.

       When you operate within an organizational context and you're writing a genre like a white paper or a
       report, you're often writing within a series of constraints that will guide your work. On one level, you
       have the general gist of the genre that will be guiding what is going on. Unless your organization likes
       to call things odd names (my niece, for example, used to call buzzards "pelican badgers" for reasons
       unknown to anyone), the general genre constraints will apply. At the same time, the formal history of
       the genre within your organization will come into play--how have people done this in the past, and
       how do they do it now? In addition, the physical format of your genre will impact what you do (is it
       a template, or is it something that you have more control over?). Finally, the audience and use of the
       document will come to play as well. This confluence of forces will shape the final format of your text,
       and unless your workplace has very strict rules on such things (and some do, I'll freely admit) there
       will be some movement between documents as to what the genre looks like and does.

       When you think about researching your work in a genre, realize that each of these elements will
       play into the others to create a final version of your genre. In some cases one element may be more
       dominant--for example you may have a use or audience that is hyper-specific, such as a federal
       grant that asks for a series of employment documents and professional assessments of your project
       by subject-matter experts (such as an archival expert if you're getting funds to preserve an artifact or
       archive). You might also have an audience that is extremely formal or informal that will impact how
       you write, which may clash with your institution's existing culture--it gets tricky fast. Below you'll
       see the confluence of all of this mapped in a visual form for those that prefer to see rather than to
       read:

     A visualization of the areas of concern in genre research

In each case, you'll want to query the general genre, the institutional practice, and the audience and
use of your text to get an idea of what needs to be done.
For the rest of this chapter, we'll break down the discussion of genre into two major bits of content:
we'll cover the general questions of research you need to carry out work on any particular genre situ-
ation, and we'll go through a top-level overview of a few genres and what you can generally expect in
those genres. The real heart of the chapter will be the discussion of the research questions--they will
be your guide in virtually any genre-dependent situation. The coverage of the various genres at the
top level will supplement this by giving you an idea of what genres you might be called on to write
and some general (subject to context) tips you might want to know when you're writing in those
genres.

Genre Research

When it comes to researching genre, as with almost all of our research that we've covered, it comes
down to understanding the situation you're operating in and the expectations the situation places
on you and the amount of freedom the situation allows you that you can make use of. The level of
research needed really depends to a large extent on the amount of freedom that you have with the
genre as it is designed physically. If there is a template, you're going to be highly constrained, but if
there isn't a template you're going to get to have a bit more power. General genre, institutional prac-
tices, and audience and use still come into play in restricted situations, but in different ways than in
a truly open context.

Physical Context

Some genres have very little freedom baked into them--think about most of the forms you fill out
when you visit a doctor's office--this is done by design to get a certain type of information and to
control what gets recorded and what doesn't. Forms tend to be the types of genres that strive to be

                                                                 129
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

       durable--the particular information recorded is there because someone somewhere has decided that
       it matters a great deal to them, though the value isn't always apparent on the front end.

       Forms and other limited genres are useful because they create a set of data points that can be correlat-
       ed across time and participants, creating a general sense of how things are working in the broader
       context as well as a sense of history in individual cases. Having a record of all of your vitals for exam-
       ple gives your doctor a sense of how your overall health changes from month to month and year to
       year. In fact, these types of ongoing records are vital in catching things like high blood pressure and
       other diseases that come on slowly at times.

       The same benefits associated with forms also come with other genres that are highly regulated like
       grant and proposal applications. Many times these applications are highly specific to the particular
       project and agency that is offering money for projects or soliciting work. The categories exist because
       they matter in the rubric that the organization will use to judge the participants; they also exist be-
       cause they help create a uniform standard for comparing the different applicants. Image how difficult
       it would be to compare different grant projects if the only universal requirement was that you send in
       a document describing your project--it would make valid project-to-project comparison much more
       difficult!

       In contexts where you have very little control over the physical constraints that your text will work
       within, you may think that your job is fairly simple--you just fill in the data and move along with
       your life. That can be true in some situations, but especially in competitive environments where
       your text will be battling others that have the same constraints, the opposite is true. If you have five
       sections that are each limited to 500 words then the weight of each of those sections and the weight
       of each of those 500 words is exaggerated far beyond the normal weight that any given selection of
       500 words would ever have. They matter because there is very little room for error or for elaboration.
       You simply must do the very best job you can with your allotment, and ideally you'll do a better and
       more persuasive job than anyone else writing under those same constraints.

       In competitive cases, you need to focus intensely on the information provided about what is going
       on and how your text will be weighed. You need to be strategic in the deployment of every single
       word that you're using. Many times researching your audience and their description of these con-
       straints can be useful, but you also stand to gain a great deal of advantage by having a clear under-
       standing of the general expectations of the type of genre you're writing and an understanding of how
       your organization operates and uses these texts.

       Because of the weighting power that forms have on what is valued and what isn't, the contents of
       any given form can have an incredible amount of sway over the politics of any particular writing
       situation. The form tells everyone involved what officially matters. Anything that the form omits or
       doesn't cover simply doesn't matter in the world of the form and making a case that it does matter
       means battling uphill against the form and those behind it. This is one of the reasons, by the way,
       that long term residents of bureaucratic systems are valuable assets and why institutional knowledge
       and history matters a great deal: if you know how the system works and what it values and why, you
       can craft a text that will get things done. If you don't have this knowledge, you may lack the ability
       to get a task done because you don't know the particular language and presentation that a situation

130
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

requires to create value within a given form and institution.

One other aspect of physical constraints in the context of forms worth covering is the interaction
that forms have with the level of freedom that those working with the forms have. Like any automat-
ed system, forms remove a great deal of power from those doing the work. At times this is very much
the goal behind the entire system. In these contexts the value of individuals to the system depends
on the expertise needed to fill out of form or run a system. The more work the system does and
the less work the individual operating the form or system does, the more replaceable any particular
individual can be. As you can imagine, many organizations and companies that chase after profit
and other metrics that focus on data rather than people love the idea of replaceable workers. The less
value a worker has in a given situation, the less power they have to negotiate for more pay, better
benefits, and better working conditions. The idea here is that the less power workers have, the less
they can demand and the more profit and other metrics that can be squeezed out of a given context.

In case it isn't evident from the rest of this text, I find this practice to be more than a little bit trou-
bling. The true value in a given organization rests in the people that know how things work and
what is needed for success. A system or form is only ever a poor substitute for those folks, but their
value is often hidden to those that don't see the daily grind of the workplace. One pillar of technical
writing is advocating for such individuals, allowing their worth to be more visible and giving them
more agency. At the end of the day, people deserve to be treated as people rather than data points,
and from a purely functional standpoint you'll likely have a better end experience if folks doing the
work in a situation have freedom to develop and leverage expertise and are valued for that expertise.
Sure you can get things done with less expertise and more automation, but the end result of that
trade is you're blindly swapping money and metrics for the well being of people and hard-earned
local expertise; that seldom ends well in the long run.

Having focused on the power of forms and limited context, we also need to focus on the physical
aspects of production in genre. In some situations, you'll be working in a digital environment where
everything will be accessible and readable via devices. In these contexts, color and length matter a
great deal less than in a paper-based world. Knowing where the genre will be living helps you be-
cause it gives you a set of limitations in all your other research and choices. You'll want to keep in
mind that the format you're allowed to take will limit things. For example, if you're creating a white
paper that will be printed, you'll want to keep in mind what the length and color usage will do to
costs. If you're creating a brochure to be passed out, there are severe limits on text in a traditional
tri-fold brochure that will control what is possible. Physical context is the lens that filters almost
everything else.

For assessing physical context, a few quick questions can be helpful to give you some guidance in
your research:

                                                                 131
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

    Physical Context Research

        1. Is there a specific form that I must use for this document/genre?

        2. Is this an electronic document or a paper-based document?

        3. What are the budgetary constraints of this project if I'm printing
        things?

        4.Is there a physical format that must be followed, such as a tri-fold
        brochure?

       There are obviously other things that you can and should ask, but these questions form a useful start-
       ing point for any investigation into genre.

     General Genre

       In addition to looking at the physical constraints of a project, you need to investigate the general
       gist of the genre that you're going to be writing. We'll call this the triple-g of the situation. While the
       genre doesn't tell us everything we'd ever want to know and more about a given writing situation, and
       it certainly won't give us a set of concrete rules to follow, it can give us a firm understanding of the
       expectations that are generally out there for a certain type of text and what we need to do get our text
       recognized as a member of a particular genre (unless of course that isn't our goal at all).

       For example, reports tend to report things and focus on providing information that is then used to
       inform decision making. The goal behind any given report is not simply to report findings--you're
       not just gathering data for the sake of gathering data. Instead, the report is being used as part of
       a decision-making process. Now, I suppose in some particularly vindictive contexts you might be
       generating a report for no other reason than the person responsible for your work doesn't like you
       and wants to make your life miserable, but generally speaking reports should have a role to play in
       deliberations. You may have already made the leap here, but in case you haven't, this then leads us to
       understand that with reports in particular what can matter a great deal is the types of information
       that will be valued in the deliberation the report is going to contribute to. Your 150 page report on
       the feasibility of a water garden being installed across the middle of your corporate campus will be of
       no value if you don't build the report around the metrics and data that your organization's decision
       makers will respect (or take the time to create metrics and explain their value if they are foreign to
       the organization).

       Understanding things like the nature of reports and why they exist is part of understanding the
       general gist of a genre: it doesn't tell you how to do something, but it often can tell you why that
       something is done historically. Understanding the general gist of things after getting a handle on the
       context can be valuable because it helps you understand the institutional practice you find yourself

132
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

within. Once you get how reports work, then you realize that the particular focus in your individual
context on the executive summary a little bit more--the decision makers involved apparently highly
value the short gist of a project or simply can't be bothered to read longer projects that don't interest
them after a quick skim.

One other aspect of a genre can be valuable in the general sense--the popular associations with the
genre. For example, reports are usually not the sort of document that immediately quickens the pulse
of your average individual. Yes, some people get quite excited about reports, but people get excited
for all kinds of weird stuff. Generally speaking, reports have a rather dry and dull reputation. If you
know that, you can go out of your way to counteract that in the structure and format of your text, as
best allowed by other constraints. It is always good to know when you're going into a situation with
a fundamental disadvantage.

To focus your work on the general gist of genres, the following questions may be of some use:

General Genre Research:
1. What is the general definition of this genre?
2. What is this genre generally used to do?
3. What associations does this genre usually have?
4. Is this genre highly regulated or does it regularly support extreme
interpretations?

Once you have this information available, you have another level of clarification and context to add
to your investigation of the practices in your institution and the audience for your text.

Institutional Practice

Once you've ironed out the physical constraints and the general gist of your genre, you need to take
a long hard look at what your organization does with the genre you're writing within and how that
genre operates in the context of your workplace. Just like different types of television series can be
flavored by the broadcast network that supports them, or at least carry associations with audiences
(think about the types of shows you associate with say HBO and Hallmark), genre and institution
are linked. When you live and work within a workplace, you have to operate with the constraints
that come along with it. You can certainly make an impact on how things are done, but that isn't
usually something you have the power to do immediately without any dialogue or discussions.

For example, your organization may have an annual publication that it puts out for clients that
covers major projects that have been completed this year and the benefits of those projects. It may
be a weird hybrid genre, one that exists within your context as almost a take on the white paper. In
the landscaping business, this might be a useful way to both celebrate the artisanship of your organi-
zation, create a sense of camaraderie between your clients, and could serve as the impetus for future
work by clients that are on your list but haven't done much work lately. Think of it as the corporate

                                                                 133
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

       equivalent of keeping up with the Joneses.

       In the context of our example, there may be constraints that come with this genre. It may always
       have the same color paper with the same general length and same general types of material within. If
       the primary purpose of the genre is to get people to come in for more work, knowing that also helps
       because it gives you a sense of how your institution values the work and what will be seen internally
       as good work (which may not be the same as what is seen externally as good work on the text).

       Even in cases where the physical constraints are already decided for your organization, such as with a
       call for proposals that has a very specific set of requirements, there may be a historically successful or
       required template within your organization, a certain way of doing things. In that case, knowing how
       things are normally done helps you understand when and where you need to advocate for different
       choices and whether making certain choices is a wise use of your political capital. There is no use
       burning through the good will you've developed in an organization just to get a minor change to a
       document that really won't matter.

       For our purposes, the following can be some useful questions where querying your institutional prac-
       tices:

    Institutional Practice Research:
    1. What does this document normally look like and contain?
    2. What is the purpose of this document for our organization?
    3. Which parts of this document are highly valued internally?
    4. What is the normal workflow for producing this document?
    5. If there are external constraints, how are they normally

           addressed?

       These questions can give you a great starting place in your work, allowing you to figure out the
       particular expression of this genre in your workplace and the way the document is put together, why
       it is put together that way, and the workflow behind it that you may very well need to respect (such
       as letting the CFO see your draft before you get it edited because they have strong feelings about the
       text). Again, this is one more level of clarity you can gain in viewing the process you're going to carry
       out, one that helps you put the final level of research into even more specific of a context.

     Audience and Use

       The last level of context that we'll cover is the intended audience and use. All the other levels of
       context inform our process, but the final layer of complexity comes from our use and the users of the
       document. This level differs from all other levels in that the user and use are often going to be with-
       out an advocate in the design process, unless the process has been explicitly designed around them
       from the start. Because of this one-directional workflow in many situations, your job as a technical
       writer is to gather as much as possible from this level that exists outside of your production process.

134
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

There are many documents out there that are visually gorgeous, make sense within a particular genre
and physical context, and match up with what a given organization does, yet they fail to engage and
serve their audience and assist in the tasks they're associated with. This isn't to say the other influenc-
es don't matter--each and every influence on a genre matters a great deal. But, of all the constraints
on a genre, the audience and use are the most likely to be successfully ignored, that is they are the
most likely to cause no consequences if ignored during the production pipeline. They don't so much
create issues during production as much as they create issues after you're already out the door with a
deliverable and it's too late to make changes.

Keeping in mind that audience and use can cause an otherwise successful document to fail, you can
present alterations from this level of context from the viewpoint of a return on investment in the
overall document creation process. You don't want all of this great work going to waste because the
final audience didn't sit on the same level as the folks doing the writing and approval. As with any
audience-centered process, you may run into pushback and need to scale back your goals until you
can prove your point about audience/user information being valuable in the workflow of your group.
But, I think you'll find the contributions this level of context brings can't be understated.

To research the audience and use, we'll primarily be walking along the same path that we traced in
our earlier chapter on audience, but I'll narrow those down a bit for our discussion of genre in par-
ticular:

Audience and Use Research:
1. Who will be using this document?
2. Who will be assisting the users of this document?
3. How will they be using the text?
4. How will their use differ, if at all, from the normal use of the genre?
5. How will the user's context impact their use of the text?

Once you have this information in hand, you'll be able to bring all of the various genre influences
together into a single discussion. Keep in mind that the audience factors and use factors will be those
that you may need to advocate for the most strenuously to those that are production-oriented rather
than audience-oriented.

Bringing it Together

Once you've built out a picture of all of the influences on your genre, you can start to plan your
actions accordingly. You may find it helpful to create a table with information on each level of influ-
ence, giving you a broad view of what is going on and what the various stakeholders and forces on
your work may be pushing for.

One thing I want to stress is that this isn't a process that should always come into play when you're
writing. Once you really get a genre, you will find yourself pushing through the writing process
much quicker and with more surety. You'll simply get things down and not have to worry about

                                                                 135
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

       the specifics as much. You may eventually even get to dictate the specifics as someone with greater
       political power in your organization. Now, that isn't to say you shouldn't be critical of your work
       and reflect on it on, but by the very nature of how we learn to use genres and make them part of our
       workflows, this will be something that fades over time as you build your own expertise.

       However, you will want to follow this process, or your own loose adaptation of this process, when
       you're working in a new genre and a new context. Correctly performing a genre for all of those
       involved is a crucial step to gaining acceptance for a text. You can't expect your report to be taken
       seriously if no one believes it is a report.

    Section Questions

       1. One way we show our understanding of genre and place is through satire--good satire demon-
       strates more than anything a fundamental knowledge of the nature of the subject of that satire. As
       someone who grew up in the 80s and 90s, The Simpsons first 8 or so seasons will always for me be
       the peak of satire of my American life. Think about genres you are very familiar with. Take a pass a
       satirizing that genre by doing something unexpected or silly with.
       2. How does physical context change the way a genre works? Pick a genre from your institution that
       you normally use in one physical context and map out a plan to shift it to another genre. What hap-
       pens?
       3. Institutions evolve and change genres and terms the same way everyone else does. Do some re-
       search on your institution. What are some previous slogans, colors, symbols, and associations that are
       not longer part of the organization?
       4. Sometimes a genre is misused by an audience because of a mismatch between what is needed and
       what is possible. What are some examples you can think of that involve misusing a genre?

   Popular Genres in Technical Writing

       Having looked at a method to investigate genres, I want to shift our focus in the back half of this
       chapter to introduce you to a few specific genres in the world of technical writing. This will be a brief
       overview, giving you a window into what the general gist and goal of these genres tends to be in my
       experience as a writer, instructor, and researcher. Please note that between cultures and companies
       these documents may be drastically different--these are really just some popular conceptions of the
       genres themselves. To really dig into what they look and feel like, you'll need to do some original
       research. Surprised? Probably not at this point in our text.

       I'd like to briefly cover some key players in technical writing circles: proposals and grants, white
       papers, reports, technical descriptions, instructions, and manuals. This is by no means an exhaustive
       list of genres--you'll find an almost endless supply of them out there. This is also by no means a de-
       finitive definition of each, but I think each overview will give you a window into the ways that these
       genres work and the types of problems they were invented to solve.

     Grants and Proposal

       Grants and proposals are one of the most action-oriented genres that you can work with in technical
       writing, though they often also tend to be some of the most rigorously defined by forces outside of

136
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

your control. A grant or proposal often comes from a specific solicitation by a funding source that is
either looking for a particular project to be completed for them or looking to support projects that
complete certain goals.

In a corporate context, proposals will be solicited for various jobs an organization might need. For
example, I might put out a request for proposals and bids to create a new computer lab infrastruc-
ture in my building on a college campus. In this case, I'm soliciting folks who will complete a partic-
ular task and tell me how they'd go about doing that and what their budget would be, guided in all
of this by my own suggestions and guidelines.

The world of grants can be quite different because grants are often not designed for a particular
activity: they are instead designed to promote a type of activity. For example, there might be a civic
beautification grant available in a large metro area that solicits projects from local artists to create
public artwork that enhances the town and tells part of the local story to those that interact with the
art. For the funding agency, giving these grants out is a way they can encourage and bankroll a par-
ticular type of activity without actually completing that activity themselves. It offers a way to make
use of funding to influence activities without jumping into the business of doing a particular activity
or pushing for a particular cause.

In some cases, grant funding agencies have a very particular set of values that they advocate for, or a
very particular way of having projects completed, such as mandatory partners on a project. Be aware
of these goals and values--they may not always mesh with your organization's values and skills.
Almost any grant funding organization has an agenda for their funds, and it is entirely fitting that
they would--it is their money after all. Just be aware of this and the issues it can raise. (For exam-
ple, getting funds from some organizations may be more politically hazardous in certain areas than
others, such as getting funding from an organization that supports charter schools and school choice
in an area that is strongly against such measures).

Generally speaking, a grant or proposal has a few major sections, though the sections will always
be contingent on the funder of the task at hand. The call for grants or proposals will tell you what
should be submitted, what is needed, and sometimes will give you an insight into what matters and
why. You simply must follow these recommendations. They are not optional! When a grant or pro-
posal is judged, it will be judged by these rules and recommendations. Anything that doesn't fit will
be discarded--an easy way to winnow the pile of applications.

Your goal with a grant or proposal is to show how you'd fulfill the goals of the call for proposals in
a way that meets the needs of your funder. You need to show you understand the current situation,
that you have a clear plan for action, that your group is competent and trustworthy for this type of
work, and that you have a legitimate budget and timeline. Beyond these you may have some specific
sections and deliverables requested, but usually any grant or proposal will give you a chance to talk
about these types of subjects.

A good grant or proposal has a narrative structure. This doesn't mean that it's suddenly story time
and it was a dark stormy night. What I mean is that you'll want to have an overarching narrative
and theme to your work. You will frame the problem in a way that makes sense for your solution.

                                                                 137
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

       You'll frame your past work in a way that shows your ability to complete this current task. In short,
       you'll be persuasive. There are any multitude of valid and honest ways to tell the story of a grant or
       proposal; you'll just need to pick the right one for your situation. Again, this isn't a call to stretch
       the truth--lies and misdirection in a proposal is a great way to get into legal trouble or blacklisted.
       Instead, this is a reminder that your presentation of "the facts" is not enough.

       You need to think about the context and who you're writing to and why. If you're offering new
       technology, you can frame the current technology as out of date. If you're offering green technology,
       you can frame the current technology as excessively energy intensive. Each of these frames is a valid
       one, but the pairs I've created make more sense than framing the current technology as outdated and
       offering green technology or framing the current technology as inefficient and offering new technolo-
       gy. Remember that this is a competitive genre and you need to make the best and most accurate case
       possible for your team.

       When you're looking at how to frame things, look for what your organization values, what you've
       excelled at, and what the funding group values and what they excel at and ask for. You'll often find
       a way to draw connections between your group and the funding group. In some cases you won't be
       able to make many if any connections--this can be a sign this grant or proposal is a bad fit.

       As a final note, and one that goes with all genres that we'll discuss--do not use boilerplate texts.
       Don't create a generic grant application and send it to everyone with a few names changed. This is a
       great way to fail at grant and proposal submission. No one likes boilerplate texts and boilerplate texts
       are incredibly obvious in their overly generic approach to everything. Take a little time and customize
       your texts to the situation and you'll go much further!

     White Papers

       White papers are an odd genre, one that is not universally present in professional communication,
       but one worthy of noting. At its core, a white paper is a sales document, one that is designed to moti-
       vate someone to make a purchase. What is intriguing about a white paper in our context is that they
       are usually designed to educate someone enough to make them desire your current product or ser-
       vice. You can and should make a pitch for your organization, but usually after educating someone as
       to why it would be of value at all. (Note: white papers are not the same outside of the US. You may
       run into other documents called white papers that are totally different. Cultural context matters!)

       To help explain how white papers work, I'll give you an example from my own background. Growing
       up, my father was the third generation owner of the family tire repair business. When I was younger,
       the primary work the shop did was the repair of damaged tires and the purchase of new tires. You
       could also get maintenance work like balances and rotations. At the time though, oil changes weren't
       even on the menu. During the 90s, my father started getting white papers from companies selling
       machines for front and rear wheel alignment. These white papers came with informative models that
       you could use to demonstrate what an unaligned tire would do to a vehicle and generally educated
       you on the value of wheel alignment on the life of your tires. It also made the business case for wheel
       alignment and advocated for a particular machine from a particular manufacturer. After reading the
       documents and talking with sales folks, my father purchased the machines and from that point on
       his business had wheel alignments as a service.

138
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

In the context of the 90s, wheel alignment wasn't something that a traditional mom and pop tire
shop would have covered. It required specialized equipment that was not cheap, and it required
special training for operators of that equipment. Getting a mom and pop shop to buy the expensive
equipment directly wasn't a winning strategy--the price alone could spook people. Instead of mak-
ing an immediate sales pitch, white papers and strategies tailored around education allow the man-
ufacturers of this equipment to explain the importance of and sales potential of the machinery in
order to help the audience to get to a point where they understood the technology enough to make
an informed choice.

White papers are often used in areas where technology is advancing in a way that needs explanation.
If you're offering a new piece of software or a new type of service, you may very well need a white pa-
per to make the case for your approach. White papers don't make as much sense in established areas
with established technology that you're going to be selling to folks. If you have a new spin on that
technology, maybe a white paper makes sense. Otherwise, it's not going to be that useful.

Reports

We've already hit on reports, and so I won't spend that much time on them here. Suffice it to say
that reports are documents that give someone information on a process or series of events or a plan,
anything really, and then allows the person who has that information to make decisions or advo-
cate for decisions or courses of action. If you want to blame someone for reports, blame a business
major--a large part of the logic behind business majors is that they are experts at decision-making in
business environments, aided by reports as part of their understanding of what is going on and what
they should be doing. The rise of reports came along with the rise of the professional business major,
allowing information to move beyond people and into paper and other sources.

With any report, ask yourself who is going to be using this document and what they're going to be
using the data for. This can vary depending on who is reporting and why. You may be tasked with a
feasibility report on a project--in this case, you'll be creating a report that helps decide what actions
are available and whether they make sense. You can also see reports generated by openly or not-so-
openly political organizations that have very particular values and goals behind their reporting. Not
all reports are created equal.

When reporting anything that caries a value judgment, the most important thing you can do is
create a set of criteria. If you set up the criteria and define them, you can have a productive discus-
sion because you're making a case for what measures matter and then using those measures to make
a judgment call. If your audience agrees with your measures, all the better. If they don't, you'll need
to make the case for your measures. Without criteria, your report mostly stands as opinion. I have an
opinion, and you have one too. Opinions are great, but when we judge them based off specific crite-
ria we can debate on, we can have a constructive dialog. If we're just railing at each other's opinions
with no overarching context to create judgment and value, we're not going to get far. (Just watch
some political talk shows and you'll see this in action very quickly).

                                                                 139
            Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

Technical Descriptions

A classic of technical writing that is often associated with engineering, technical descriptions are
fairly self explanatory--they are a technical explanation of how a particular system or device works.
The use case for descriptions can vary, depending on who is going to make and share the description.
For example, there is a thriving online world of folks that reverse engineer and build their own guitar
pedals (effects devices that modify signals for distortion, compression, modulation, etc.). A large part
of this community is sharing how a particular pedal works and what the components are within a
given pedal, so they share a lot of domain-specific technical descriptions.

Technical descriptions are one of those genres where you may well get a chance to really get into us-
ing your field-specific terms and language because they are designed, often, for folks that are already
experts or who at least know enough to read through the text. This isn't always true, but it can be
many times. Here is a simple technical description of how the LED connects to a guitar pedal, badly
drawn by your author:

Now, this particular technical description

is entirely visual--that isn't to say that all

technical descriptions are, but you do find

visuals as a component in the genre. This is a

particularly awful description because of my

color choice on the black wire between the

LED and the switch--you notice it overlaps

the minus symbol, making it unclear as to

whether it is positive or negative. In addition,

I've neglected to include a resistor in this

schematic, making it very likely my LED will

burn out quickly and be ridiculously bright.

But, this crude drawing could                     A poorly drawn technical description
very well accompany some text like the

following:

"In this pedal the LED is connected directly to a wall-mount power supply input. Not pictured here,
a resistor is located between the power supply and the LED, regulating the output of the LED and
preventing premature burnout. The ground of the LED connects to the foot switch--several other
grounds from the PCB and the input connect here as well."

In this simple explanation, you get an idea of what is happening in the design. This isn't very techni-
cal, but it does tell you what is happening in this particular system of a pedal. That can be enough in
the hobbyist's world where you simply need enough understanding to make things happen electron-
ically without mishap. In the world of electric engineering, this would likely be entirely insufficient.
Audience and context matter.

       Anytime you're going to describe a system or a process, technical description as a genre can come into
       play. It isn't the most glamorous genre, but it has a useful purpose and helps folks understand how
       things work.

Instructions

It's come to this. Instructions. You knew they were coming, right? If any genre is associated with the
teaching of technical writing, the genre of instructions would be the one.

When we think about instructions, we want to think about them as tools for use--not those things
you throw away because you don't need them or can't read them. Instructions get a bad wrap because
too often they are designed as an item in a checklist that needs to be completed rather than as an
essential part of any project that is oriented around sequential tasks. Good instructions can be a true
joy to use, but we so often end up with the phoned-in-at-best variety that perhaps has lead many of
you to despise the genre.

Time for a brief confession--I truly love instructions with all of my being. To the very depths of my
soul, I love instructions. Why, you may ask? They help you do things. They tell you how things are
supposed to be done. They put order into a situation. I like following instructions and I like making
them because of this. I find special pleasure in good instructions that are thoughtful and useful, like
so many are not. I like instructions because they take a process that might be challenging or tedious
and make it easily understood and perhaps even educational. (As a side-note, I'm also a huge do-it-
yourself person having built my own computers since I was a teen and having most recently tiled my
bathroom floor after some intense research. I like learning about things and how to do things and
instructions make that possible).

The biggest challenge with instructions is one of perspective--you often don't see a task that you're
good at correctly. Think about starting a car and putting it into reverse or putting your key into your
lock and unlocking your front door at your dwelling place. These are tasks that you do all the time,
and as such you tend to internalize entire steps to muscle memory. It's kind of like when you start
walking or driving somewhere and accidentally end up going to your normal destination when you
meant to go somewhere else but managed to get a little absent minded. Instructions often suffer
from this phenomenon because they internalize and omit steps that are essential to newbies.

The best thing you can do is to take a literal approach to your instructions when testing. If they don't
say to do something, don't do it and see what happens. You may find quickly that you're overlooking
key things like pressing the brake pedal when you shift from park to reverse when driving. This type
of testing will get rid of your blind spots by forcing you to run into them.

The best thing you can do outside of personal testing is to find someone who truly doesn't under-
stand what you're trying to explain. This can be hard with simple tasks, but if you can find a test sub-
ject or four you can find out quickly through various research methods what is going on and where
things are breaking down. The final chapter of the text offers you a number of solutions.

Finally, remember that the best instructions offer a clear view of the process that is taking place and
how each step comes together as part of that process. You'll find folks have an easier time with things
when they know where they are going and what their progress is. In addition, useful illustrations and
even things like color coding of steps and repeated processes can make things much easier for anyone
actually using your work. Remember--instructions are used to do something. Make sure they are

                                                                 141
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 5

       designed around that use!

     Manuals

       If there ever was a genre that was the opposite of glamorous and exciting, I think manuals would be
       that genre. Manuals get a bad rap I think because they aren't designed for reading, and we tend to
       judge most large texts by their readability rather than other metrics like use. Manuals are a reference
       tool rather than a relaxing read to pore through while you sit in the hammock and sip lemonade.
       They are designed to be searched to find information about a specific part of a process or system or
       procedure or to solve a particular problem.
       Manuals should be judged by how they help you fix an issue or understand something, not by their
       capacity to entertain. For example, if you have a flat tire you'll reference your car's manual to find
       out where your spare is and where you jack is located (if you have one instead of a can of flat-fixing
       goop). You might also use a manual if you need to know how to format say, a television show when
       using Chicago style.
       Like instructions, manuals can be annoying to use because they can be designed as an afterthought.
       We've almost trained ourselves in many circumstances to avoid manuals, and that can be a huge mis-
       take! A good manual can be a powerful tool to help you through a complex process.
       Practically speaking, think about a manual in a professional capacity as a barrier against having to do
       tech support of some type. A good manual helps folks understand systems and troubleshoot common
       problems without getting overwhelmed. A great manual does this in a clear, well-documented and
       illustrated way that allows easy identification of information that is helpful and avoidance of infor-
       mation that isn't helpful.

 Managing a Project
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6

       In our final cohesive chapter in the text (the final chapter is broken up into stand-alone discussions
       of method) we will be going through the process of planning and then delivering the final goods on
       a given technical writing project. As we go through this chapter, we'll draw on content from almost
       every chapter that has come before while also charting new ground in our discussions of things like
       idea generation, collaborating with folks inside and outside your team, prototyping and iterating,
       assessing and acquiring rights for materials, editing the final copy of your deliverable, and putting
       things into production and distribution. It's a lot, but we'll get through it!

       In our discussion of each step along the way of getting a project out the door we'll be working
       through this tremendous task in phases. Just like with the writing process, these phases may be
       highly abbreviated in situations where you know what is going on and you're working with folks that
       you and your process. With that said, you will sometimes need to complete a major technical writ-
       ing project from start to finish, from idea to final deliverable. In those situations, you need a plan
       and need a firm awareness of what is going to happen at each phase and when you need to move on.
       Take these phases as suggestions and guidance that can and should be tweaked situationally.

   Phase 1: Ideas, Audience, and Goals

       Getting starting on any technical writing project, you need to have a firm awareness of what exactly
       you're doing and who you're creating your final deliverable for. When we think about projects, we
       want to think in terms of deliverables--what will you deliver to your client(s) at the end of the day?
       These clients may be your boss, they may be someone outside your organization, they might be your
       instructor or thesis or dissertation committee in an academic context. In any case, you need to know
       what you want to deliver, who's going to get it, and how you're going about all of that.

       Deliverables and audiences and goals intertwine considerably--depending on what you want to do
       and who's going to be the target, what you want to create may change. For example, you might be
       creating content that you want to market to skateboarders for a ready reference. If you know much
       about skateboarders, you may know that in general they stereotypically love stickers, especially
       stickers that they can decorate their boards with. If you're trying to get awareness of say, concussion
       symptoms, to the broader community of skaters, a cool looking sticker might make a lot of sense.
       That deliverable fits that community.

     Sketching out Goals, Deliverables, and Audience

       When you get started, you want to think horizontally across categories. Don't get trapped in audi-
       ence, goals, or deliverables. Think about how each of these interact and the constraints that each puts
       on the rest. Using something like the chart below (which can be drawn easily on a whiteboard for
       collaboration), figure out what the constraints are for your project:

144
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6

A Table for working through Goals, Deliverables, and Audience

Think about each of these sections as being a supplement to or new way of thinking about the exist-
ing writing process that we've discussed previously. When you work with a project, you need a broad-
er lens than the specific writing process you may have--your projects often will transcend boundaries
that individual work won't come close to touching.
When you think about goals, think about your team's goals, your project's overall goals, and any
goals that may exist outside of your particular team and project that may come into play (such as an
organizational goal to reduce carbon emissions). For goals, think about what is going to be required,
what would be preferred, and what should be avoided.
After thinking about goals, start thinking about audience--what will your audience require, what
will they prefer, what will they want you to avoid (or should you avoid with this group) and what
might they have in common with your goals/group? Again, this is part of the larger writing process,
but you're trying to think long-term about a large-scale project.
When you assess deliverables, you are creating a space that will bridge your goals and your audi-
ence. The deliverables are a place where each group will impact what goes on, and in many ways the
deliverable is the mediation of the audience and your team's goals. Each side has some say about what
happens in this slot.
Don't take the above as the definitive version of what will be happening in your project--think about
how the above can be used to think through the project you have, giving you something to work
with as you advance to your ideas phase.

                                                                 145

     The Idea Creation Process and Theming

       Once you've got a handle on your goals, audience, and deliverables, you'll want to start to think
       about the format and form of these deliverables. Knowing that you want to create something doesn't
       tell you how to create that something. Just like the example we had previously of the wedding pro-
       gram, you often need to have an angle or a thematic that will guide what you're going to create. The
       idea creation phase of things, which can happen concurrently or after you've assessed the audience
       and deliverables and goals, tries to figure out what this project can/should look like and how it can
       all fit together. A lot of the ideas phase can be visual design work, but don't forget that visual design
       can also include the actual format and medium of your final deliverables. Large-scale projects like
       campaigns to build awareness for an event or issue often can contain documents of a variety of types
       and formats, but these documents tend to be bundled together using a cohesive theme. You see the
       same thing many times with university campaigns that will color the way a university presents itself
       for the duration of the campaign.

       For example, you might be tasked with creating a public-awareness campaign about a new park that
       will be built in the center of town. To do this, you would need to create a variety of texts such as
       flyers, emails, radio spots, banners, and signage. The overall theme of your campaign would need to
       mesh with the visual identity of the city and attract the particular audience you're aiming to bring
       into the park. For example, if the park has a central venue for hosting local concerts, you might go
       with the theme that "West End Park Rocks," going with a rock-and-roll theme for all of the visuals
       you'll create. You'd then want to see what this theme filters out into--how do you express rock and
       roll visually? Do you use a guitar outline? Do you have a band silhouette? Do you adapt the visual
       conventions of classic concert posters and album art? You have to figure out what the theme does
       when it meets the deliverables and campaign you are working with.

       First off, you need a theme that you can think through. To arrive at a theme, you want to think as
       broadly as possible. One thing that can be useful when you're creating a theme as a team is to find
       examples of content that you're required to incorporate as well as content that you like. Create a
       dropbox of sorts of your ideas and examples that you can use to collect data on what you might
       use as a theme. If you're designing a public information campaign like the example above, use your
       phone to take shots or screenshots of things that fall into that genre that have elements you like. Just
       like with visual conventions, you're looking for elements that you can blend together into your own
       cohesive whole, your own theme.

       Themes can also work with feelings and ideas--you can think about what types of ideas and feelings
       are associated with your project. For this, instead of creating a repository of content, you may want
       to start brainstorming with something like a word map. What key terms make sense for your proj-
       ect? What are terms and adjectives that expand off of them? What theme might you create that could
       encompass all of these terms and thoughts? See the example below for what this might look like
       sketched out on a whiteboard:

An example wordmap

With the above example, the word map begins with the term joy, and then expands in different
directions. The team in the example goes in two primary directions--synonyms for joy and actions
associated with joy. Then, you'll see the connection built off of express and sharing towards commu-
nity, two things that communities tend to do. The final result here might end up being a theme of
"The Joys of Community," based off the mapping and what meshes well.
Feelings and adjectives can also be associated with particular styles, so once you get into a concrete
theme in this area like "The Joys of Community," then you'd want to think about fonts and imagery
that are associated with joy. This could be another place for the type of data collection and examples
noted before where you create a makeshift dropbox for content that you can share to think through
what the particular theme looks like when expressed horizontally across a campaign.

Creating a Final Theme Style Guide

Regardless of your direction, the goal of this phase is to come up with a concrete them that you can
use for your deliverables and project. The end internal deliverable from all this work should be a con-
crete breakdown of what your theme will be and how that theme will impact your deliverables. The
following items may be useful to build your theme into something that can be shared and used, the
beginnings of a style guide (something we'll get to in the next phase in more detail):
Theme description: What is your theme? How does it relate to your project's goals and audience, and
how does it impact the deliverables?
Theme colors and imagery: What colors and images are associated with this theme? Think categorically
here.

                                                                 147
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6

       Theme fonts: How does this theme translate into font choices? What fonts will be used, and where
       will they be used?

       Theme layouts:What will be the various layouts/deliverable designs? How will they incorporate the
       theme to share information with your audience and to complete your goals?

       Once you have all of this together, you're in a good spot to start thinking about putting all of this
       into practice with a concrete style guide and some prototypes of your deliverables.

   Phase 2: Working with Others (Inside & Outside the Team)

       When you think about creating a major project, one of the major hurdles that you'll encounter is
       communication--how do you communicate with the folks you're going to be working with? What
       are going to be the ways you communicate and what rules will govern that communication?

       Generally speaking, the idea that too many cooks can ruin things holds true for design projects. Too
       many goalposts and too many folks with power can make things get crazy. Because of that, you want
       to have a well-structured workflow that will solicit feedback from stakeholders in a productive way
       while allowing your team to get work done without being constantly second-guessed and overridden.

       One major step you can take is to establish a concrete communication channel and a point person
       for each major group of stakeholders. Communication can be routed through this channel and these
       individuals, preventing chaos and overload. It can also help if your workspace for deliverables and
       other content isn't accessible to the stakeholders--you don't want something that you're not ready to
       share getting shared.

       As far as file services and the like, take stock of what features you'd need and what is available and se-
       cure or preferred. For example, if you're doing something that is primarily text-based, you may want
       a service that allows real-time commenting and responses to comments with an editing interface. If
       you're doing something primarily graphical or that will be printed, you'll want to make sure your
       files can be shared easily and accessed quickly. Adapt to your situation.

       Chat solutions like Slack and Teams can also be helpful, but be aware that you don't necessarily want
       an open channel between your team and the folks you're working for. The design process can be a
       messy and chaotic experience to those on the outside that don't understand what iteration looks like.

     Style Guides

       One of the most powerful tools that you can leverage when working in multi-person teams is going
       to be the style guide, a document that allows you to decide what will be the canonical choices for
       any and all design and textual variations. Style guides are used for visual design as well as for edito-
       rial work, allowing you to put into writing your final decisions and preferred practices regarding the
       word choice and the visual look of a given project. They're immensely helpful, especially when a final
       deliverable is the product of a large team working for multiple stakeholders.

148
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6

Style guides are usually formatted as reference materials and are designed to regulate what the com-
munications of a given organization are going to look like and feel like. Having a cohesive visual style
as well as a cohesive editorial style allows for regular information and consistent representation of the
organization. For example, most universities have very particular ways that you can present a school
or department with the university logo/wordmark. This is designed and guarded in such a way that
when you see the particular official combination that is approved, it looks like an official university
text. The same also holds true for how to abbreviate titles and positions.

In the corporate world, style guides are used for consistent brand imagery and for consistent internal
and external communications. Starbucks is famous for their web style guide and Boeing is famous
for never changing the name of a part, allowing mechanics to always know what they're talking about
and working on. Practically speaking, a style guide lets you know what is going to be okay and not
okay when working in an organization and it allows those in charge to put into place their desired
design choices in a relatively transparent way for those in the organization doing communication
work.

In some cases a style guide may reference an external system like the Chicago Manual of Style. A
preferred dictionary might also be used, often the Merriam-Webster Dictionary in the US. In these
cases, the organization is allying itself with a standard that is larger than one particular group or
company. This can also be the case when an organization works primarily in an area where the style is
dictated by formal groups associated with the work, such as legal teams using standard legal annota-
tion.

When creating a style guide, you'll tailor the guide to the situation. A comprehensive guide will often
cover official word marks, logos, color combinations and color codes, typographical choices, layouts
and templates, as well as editorial choices such as abbreviations. More targeted guides may limit
themselves to just visuals or just text.

Below is a brief one-page example of what a style guide might look like, especially if you go for a
plain guide that focuses on getting information across quickly:

                                                  In the example guide, you have information on the feel/
                                                  mission of the company first off. The mission statement
                                                  is often used to set a tone and goal for communications.
                                                  This can also be true of projects and campaigns. Next you
                                                  have the official type choices in a limited format, dis-
                                                  playing the choices at the size and format recommended.
                                                  Next you have the official presentation of the logo and
                                                  the wordmark slogan. A wordmark is often a text-based
                                                  representation of an organization without any extra
                                                  graphical elements. From these examples, you can know
                                                  exactly what choices you're going to need to use when
                                                  you work for this organization.

                                                                 149

A Sample Style Guide
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6

       In addition to missions and ty-
       pography and logos/wordmark,
       you can also encounter colors and
       layouts in a style guide. For your
       own projects, these can be extreme-
       ly helpful because they can be a
       way to quickly communicate your
       design ideas without getting into
       specifics. See the example here for
       what this might look like.

       In the example on the right, you'll
       see specific color swatches are
       presented, color combinations are
       suggested or required, and a little
       bit of information is given about
       color usage. This is the norm in
       many guides, and while this guide
       only includes RGB codes, many of-
       ficial guides would include CMYK
       to make sure colors are consistent
       across mediums. The templates that
       you see simply suggest the overall
       shape and form in this limited
       example, but they can get much
       more specific. The business card

    example. on the right is closest to a concrete Style Guide page on Designs

       A style guide really should expand and contract in content and scope depending on how you want
       to use it. The goal here is that you can communicate to folks the specific ways that you want to share
       information and how you want to present your project/organization. In our case we could almost go
       all the way into a design brief, another classic type of project-oriented document, but for our pur-
       poses we'll stick to the style guide.

       The final expression you may see that I'd like to show an example of is the editorial style guide, a
       guide that suggests that wording and textual choices that will show up in your documents. In group
       writing situations an editorial style guide can be useful to make sure you're keeping a consistent tone
       and word choice throughout. See the example on the next page:

                                      In the above example, you see a dis-
                                      cussion of tone, specific references
                                      for how to talk about members of
                                      the organization, and guidelines for
                                      discussions of outside groups and
                                      the current promotional campaign.
                                      The above is an abbreviated look at
                                      the ways that organizations often
                                      set particular guides for how official
                                      communications are worded and
                                      how specific groups and processes
                                      are referenced. Depending on the
                                      extent to which an organization is
                                      looking to create a readily-identi-
                                      fiable voice, the choices and power
                                      of an editorial style guide can be
                                      limited or extensive.

                                      Think about the style guide as the

                                      place where you'll make the tough

                                      calls once. Decide as a group and

                                      with the input of stakeholders

                                      what your official colors, images,

                                      approach to text, and all other

                                      design choices is going to be and

                                      then standardize them in the guide.

Style Guide page on Editorial Style   The guide becomes the place that
                                      decisions are made and recorded.

                                      This can be especially powerful in

settings where you're the leader of a team of writers and need to exert control without the need to

micromanage everyone and everything.

Your style guide may not be finalized by the end of Phase 2, but you should at least get one started.
As you go, update the version of the style guide and make notes as to what has changed in each ver-
sion--this will give you a clear idea of what has happened and why as your project has developed.

Phase 3: Prototypes and Iteration

Once you've gotten to the point that you know your goals and have a concrete set of ideas for your
audience that will be created with specific deliverables, you need to start prototyping and iterating.
Having a style guide at this point can be valuable, but your guide can grow or come into being
during this phase rather than before if your circumstances dictate that kind of workflow.

The goal of the prototyping phase is to get your deliverable created in a makeshift form that will
let you test it and see how well it works and whether it is going to meet the expectations of those

                                                                 151
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6

       involved with your project. There is often something quite different between pitching an idea the-
       oretically and holding that idea in front of you or seeing the idea on a screen in the case of a digital
       deliverable. By putting everything together, you get a clear sense of what your design will look like
       and work like.

       Your prototyping phase should also include some testing, ideally. You'll want to see how your design
       works and whether you get the impact you actually planned for with use. You can do this using some
       of the methods discussed in the next chapter.

       Once you've got your design tested, you'll want to iterate from the original design where needed.
       Don't be afraid to rework a design that isn't coming together or getting the reaction you were hoping
       for. The prototyping phase exists so that you can get a low-stakes reaction to your planned design
       without having to commit to a full production run of the deliverable. Much better to rework a pro-
       totype than to end up with finalized deliverable that just doesn't work out.

     Effective Time Usage and Templating vs. Tinkerating

       One note that is of the utmost importance when you're working on prototypes and other designs:
       guard your time vigorously! You will need to guard your time, more often than not, from yourselves.
       That may sound weird, but bear with me. Often times when you're doing a design project, especially
       one with fancy elements, you can get caught up in the what-if 's of it all. This gets even worse when
       you're building your templates and designs in the software you'll publish with final deliverable with.
       To avoid time wastage, there are a few things you need to keep in mind: the Cake Method and Tem-
       plating vs. Tinkerating.

       First, let's cover the Cake Method. It sounds silly, but it is the product of my having been involved in
       two birthday cake fiascos in a row in which a fondant-centered design was scrapped at midnight in
       exchange for cupcakes or something less amazing. It was also influenced by two student projects two
       years in a row that self-immolated due to 90% of the time on the project being spent on a design
       element that simply never came together. I'll explain.

       When you are working on a major project, many times the fancy little bits get your attention. You
       end up trying to tweak the one cool idea that you have about the design, and that ends up taking all
       of your time. It might be a logo. It might be a cool graphical effect on a website. It could be a fancy
       infographic idea you have. It could be fancy animations and graphics on a Power Point or Prezi. In
       the end, the amount of impact that cool bit has on your final deliverable is fairly negligible, but it's
       just so darn cool that you spend a massive amount of time on it, resulting in a project that has a cool
       graphic but no real content. It's like someone asked you to make a cake and you brought them a
       custom sculpted or 3D printed cake topper and a box of cake mix.

       The Cake Method attempts to help you work through your design woes by breaking up your time
       into chunks of content that mirror the construction of a cake, sorting the content into what has to
       be there and what would be nice to have. The base of a cake is the actual cake itself--you need cake
       for a cake, right? Next, you have the bare minimum of decoration, usually some sort of icing. After
       that, you might have decorative trim that really brings the cake into acceptable territory. Finally,
       you have additions that make the cake fancy such as various scenes that might be built on top like a

152
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6

construction site for a kid that loves heavy equipment.
The idea behind this breakdown is that you create tiers of importance with your content, tiers that
align with the most basic cake versus the final tier of fancy decor. You organize your content into
each of these tiers, and then you work through each one of them in order. You're not allowed to work
on the fancy final stuff until you've finished everything underneath. That way, you don't end up with
fancy decorations and no cake to put them on, metaphorically speaking. See below for a chart than
can help with this breakdown:

A table to be used to asses Objectives and time allotment

To use the chart, you'll want to break down your project into four basic tiers, just like we broke the
cake down into the bare minimums, the essential elements, the expected accent decor, and any final
polish and fancy elements. The base tier is the absolute minimum for your document. This may well
be the actual text elements that you need to generate to fill the text. This work isn't sexy, but it simply
has to be done and can truly suffer if you rush it. Next, you have the essential elements that would
be needed--this can vary from design to design. It might be a series of simple templates that arrange
things differently in a large campaign, or in a large document it might be the chapter breakdowns
and sections and sub-sections. Next you have the expected accents; this might be something like col-
or-coded headings and things along those lines in a large document. Finally, you have the final polish
tier that includes the fancy elements than can take a large amount of time. This might be something
like a heavily designed logo element or a complex infographic-style graphic that doesn't have to be in
the text but that makes the text more understandable.

                                                                 153
     Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6

     The goal behind all of this is that you'll have a fully-functional document that you can add elements
     to gracefully by the time you get to the final polish stage. It also recognizes that the fancy elements
     that we often want to focus on can take an inordinate amount of time, time that is fine to spend if
     we have managed to complete our text. You can't build a text around a complex element that you
     may not be able to pull off. You build the text first and then see if you can pull off the extra element.

     Sometimes your text is the fancy decorative element, or you have a design that is entirely driven
     by a fancy design. That's okay. In those cases, you spend more time on the design element. It is the
     cake in that case, not the final topping. The goal here is to arrange your steps in the project by their
     importance and to spend time on what has to be there before spending time on things that would be
     nice to have.

     One additional tool that can be useful when managing time is making a distinction between Tem-
     plating and Tinkerating. When you work on a project, you often need to come up with templates
     and designs that you can work through and design around. What I suggest, every single time, is to
     design your projects with pen, paper, and colored pencils first. Do not use a design-oriented program
     or code (in the case of the web). Do. Not. Do. This. You'll more likely than not end up wasting time.

     The problem with designing with a design program is that you have an infinite amount of tools
     available to create your design, and you often end up playing with those tools rather than working
     on your template. I call this Tinkerating because you're going to be tinkering as much as you are
     doing anything else. Now, that isn't to say that playing with the design program is bad--that is one
     of the ways you get better at the program or at coding in the case of the web. But, with that said, you
     don't need to be playing in the program when you're thinking about a design. You can prototype a
     design much more quickly with paper and a pencil than doing the code or design work behind it. Fi-
     nally, working with the design program encourages you to put in flashy elements and to spend time
     making things look nice when you're not even committed to the final design you're building! Think
     back to the Cake Method--this is not the way you want to spend your time!

     When it comes to templating and thinking through
     designs, the fast route is almost always the best. A quick
     sketch can help you think through a design quickly with-
     out too much trouble. When I'm teaching or designing, I
     usually try to do lots of stuff like the example here:

     In the example on the right, I've got a brief template for
     the front page and the body of a newsletter. You have a
     colored heading on the first page, then two columns with
     an image in between. You also have a small element on
     the bottom corner. The main body is two major columns
     with the shared element in the bottom corner. This is
     a fairly simple design, and it helps me see issues with
     layout quickly. You may notice the image looks weird
     between the columns, so I need to rethink that. Drawing
     it out allows me to see spacing issues quickly without

154                                                              An example template sketch
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6

getting into the weeds. If I wanted to go a bit further, I could embellish this all with colors to get a
better sense of what I'm doing:

Here you'll see I've colored in
the top section to give a nice
colored header, I've added in a
title to show where that would
be in black, and I've redone the
images in the middle to better
use the space and tried out using
red for the bottom element and
red frames for the images. After
seeing this, I'd likely switch to
black for the images, but I like the
red elements (though I might add
another on the top on the second
page for symmetry). Again, this
has taken me just a minute or two
and I'm already working through
the design without having to
worry about getting things lined
up perfectly or getting the colors
or something else right.

Use your time wisely--guard your
time from the demands of others
and from your own fancies. The
best design is the one that gets

finished and out the door, not the one with the fancy logo that never A second take on the template sketch

gets the polish it needs because all
the time was wasted on the logo and not the actually contents of the deliverable. Use the Cake Meth-
od, avoid Tinkerating, and do your templating work as quickly and directly as possible. Don't com-
mit to spending real time on a design or layout until you're sure it's ready for that investment of time.

Phase 4: Rights and Images

When you get ready to move towards publication, you should make a check that you have the rights
to all content and images used. In the case of content created outside of your group, realize that in
the US that any content created by an author is immediately copyrighted at the point of creation.
Without explicit permission, you cannot use that content commercially.

Usually the content that ends up requiring that you source rights will be images or music. In these
situations you will need to identify who holds the rights to the content you need and get permission

                                                                 155
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6

       from them. The rights holder may not be the person who created the content originally, as in the
       case where the rights have been sold to another individual or organization.

       If you need to get high-quality content for your deliverables but don't have resources available to
       create your own, you should investigate stock photo services that often have a range of photographs
       available to meet most generic project needs. In the case you need something specific, you may well
       need to generate content yourselves or pay someone to do the work professionally.

       There are limited open-source and copyleft content sources that you can use to get free content,
       but as mentioned elsewhere in the text these sources can be sketchy at times and sometimes come
       with explicit limits on commercial use or with clauses that would then cause your own work to be
       open-access or copyleft. In a corporate environment especially, these types of constraints are deal-
       breakers.

   Phase 5: Editing for Publication

       Before you start the publication process, you will need to get a final edit. The rule of thumb with
       this type of work is to always base this editing off of a final proof. You need to see the final proof and
       edit from that in order to get a full sense of what your text will look like and to identify errors that
       will have cropped up in the production process. This type of editing is different than the standard
       editing that might come into play when you're working through the prototyping and iteration phase.
       You will want to have a settled text that is ready for your final audience and publication when you
       start your final editing pass. The goal in this pass is to identify any missing content, any mismatches
       between your design and the final proof, and to catch any mistakes previous passes missed.

       Remember that editing before production is a risk-mitigation strategy. Any errors you can catch
       before you go into final production will prevent costly and potentially embarrassing mistakes where
       you have a final run with glaring errors throughout. It costs much more money to pulp an entire
       print run than to reprint a proof.

       In particular, focus on the colors, the quality of images, the location of content on the page, and
       other major features that can only be assessed once the deliverable has been put into its final form.
       You don't want to end up with images that are too pixelated or blurry or pages that are aligned too
       close to a margin for readability.

   Phase 6: Publication

       When you've reached the publication phase, your job is to make sure you get the quantity of deliv-
       erables you need to the folks who require them. As a team, make sure that you understand what has
       been requested and when. Having a great project doesn't matter if that great project doesn't get to the
       folks who are supposed to use it. Double-check your numbers, your delivery mechanisms, and your
       timeline.

       Finally, take some time to look over the final deliverables. Even with a closely monitored proofing
       process, there can be errors that happen. Your partner for publication may have gotten colors wrong,

156
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 6
used the wrong material, or cut things wrong in the case of a design with a bleed. Double-check all
of this. Just because your proof was awesome does not mean that you final design will be awesome as
well. Mistakes happen.

Closing it Out

The above is just a framework that you can use to think through the process of getting a project from
start to finish. You don't have to take my method as the Truth, but instead I offer it as a suggestion
and a system than can help you guide a project. You'll want to come up with your own system that
integrates the overall writing process that we've covered previously, the process of designing visuals
and documents, and the project timeline to get things done.
When it comes to technical writing, we deal with people and conditions that change over time. The
one constant is that things will change. In these situations, what can be useful is not a concrete way
of doing something every single time, but instead a method of going about doing something. If you
have a method of figuring out how do something, that will serve you well when the thing you're do-
ing changes and you're left figuring out how to adapt. Getting too wedded to a specific step-by-step
specific implementation of how things are going to be can be dangerous because things do and will
change. But, if your process is an open one that makes general moves and asks open questions rather
than setting specifics, you'll find that you can work through changes with less stress because you're
not tied to a specific way of doing things that is threatened when the context shifts.

                                                                 157
        Chapter Seven:

Research Methods for Technical Writing
     Open Technical Writing  Chapter 7

     Welcome to the end of the book. This is a weird sort of chapter, unlike any other chapter in this text.
     You may well have come here at my insistence from an earlier section, so let me explain how this all
     works.

     In this chapter you'll find five or so different segments, each focused on giving you a loose under-
     standing of a particular research methodology. In the first draft of this book in particular you'll find
     that these are general treatments rather than super-specific ones. The idea behind this design is that
     you'll be provided with the fundamental information you'll need to carry out these research methods
     within your technical writing classrooms, and that with the help of your instructor you can investi-
     gate these further, or you can research them further on your own.

     Each one of the methods here could, and does, have entire books dedicated to their practice, so keep
     that in mind as you read. Additionally, I'm not offering by any means a definitive approach to any of
     these methods. Instead, I'm attempting to provide you with a general understanding of how you can
     use them to do original research for your technical writing projects.

     In the following sections we'll cover Interviewing, Talk-Aloud Protocols, Card Sorting, Observation,
     and Participatory Design. To get a brief window into each, below you'll find a brief summary of
     what the method does and why you might use it:

     Interviews:
     Interviewing is about getting information from people by interacting with them. This can be on the
     phone, online, or face-to-face. The goal here is to talk your way into understanding a situation. In-
     terviews can be useful to get a rich understanding of your audience or a situation, but take planning
     and direction to succeed.

     Talk Aloud Protocols
     Talk Aloud Protocols, or TAP are used to get information from a user while they're using a system.
     They can be extremely helpful to identify when things break down during use, but they do create
     some artificial results from time to time. A bit of work is involved, depending on how you document
     things, but TAP can be essential in figuring out a breakdown in workflows.

     Card Sorting
     Carding sorting is a powerful method where you use cards to create categories with your users. This
     sorting can be useful to help you build a system of categories or to test the effectiveness of an existing
     one.

     Observation
     Observation is exactly what it sounds like, and differs from TAP in that you aren't going to neces-
     sarily be working with your users or even letting them know what is going on. You're observing and
     making notes from your own point of view.

     Participatory Design
     Unlike the other approaches, participatory design is more of an overall approach rather than a specif-
     ic method. Participatory design involves getting your users involved in the design process and giving

159                                                                                                              159
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 7

       them power and agency. We'll discuss some basic tips for this.

       Going forward, you'll find each of these approaches has a write-up that will be helpful in guiding
       your work. You'll want to decide which one makes the most sense for your situation.

     Doing Research with People

       Before we go further, I want to bring to your attention a crucial aspect of this work--you will be
       working with and researching people. Unlike doing scholarly work on existing texts and journals or
       even chemicals, working with living subjects, and people in particular, is tightly controlled at the
       university level. Your university likely has an IRB, an institutional review board, that will govern your
       official inquiry to create new scholarly knowledge. The goal behind these processes is to protect the
       folks you're researching from harm.

       In the private sector, there aren't as many controls on researching with people, and so the primary
       goal that you should strive for in your research in these cases is consent and transparency. You need
       to make sure folks know what is going on and what you're doing and that they agree with you and
       your goals and methods. Research should help you out, yes, but it should also at the very least do no
       harm to those you work with. If you're researching folks, they need to know and they need to con-
       sent. Anything less is unethical. Yes, you may need to hide specifics about which particular design
       they're working with, but they need to understand what is happening and what you're going to do.

       In particular, you need to guard personal information--anything you collect needs to be anonymous
       and needs to be impossible to trace back to your participants in a way that could cause them harm.
       This is your duty to the folks you research in private settings. In addition, you need to make them
       aware of how you're taking notes/recording content and how you'll store that data and anonymize it
       as needed.

   Interviews

       One of the most basic approaches to doing user research is the interview. Interviewing may very well
       be the most difficult of these approaches to research because you need to prepare fully and act with
       purpose in an interview if you plan to get any sort of useful data out of your time. In this section
       we'll cover the goals of an interview, strategies for carrying out an interview, and approaches to re-
       cording data from interviews.

       Goals of the Interview
       When you do an interview, you are getting an unique chance to hear from someone in their own
       words what they think about a given subject. With that said, the person you're interviewing also
       knows this, and sometimes will self-edit to present what they think you'll want to hear or what
       sounds like the best choice for a given situation. So, interviews are not without their risks and pot-
       holes to avoid.

       When you plan an interview, you need to know what you're hoping to get out of the process. You
       can't simply go into an interview and let things develop--you're going to waste your own time and
       that of your subject(s). Instead, think about what you want to know. Do you want to know about a

160
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 7

specific experience or a particular text? Do you want a broad overview of how a workplace functions?
Carefully consider your goals and your scope of questioning. One interview shouldn't do too much
or too little.

Time and timeliness also comes into play with interviews. For example, email interviews are notori-
ous for dragging out into infinity with folks simply ignoring or putting off the interview and ques-
tions to spend their time elsewhere. Think about how much time you have and what your schedule
looks like. Align the type of interview you want with your goals and your timeline realistically.

Strategies for Carrying Out an Interview
Interviews require a strategy on your part to be effective. Not every interview subject will have the
same level of comfort and willingness to share. At the same time, they may not even understand your
questions if you pose them in a way that is foreign to their own terminology and understanding.

First and foremost, you want your subject to feel comfortable talking with you. Many times this is
a matter of preparing the proper location and the proper setting. Doing an interview in someone's
workplace or workspace in particular can be challenging because the bustle of daily work can inter-
fere with your work and intrude or shorten your interview. Your demeanor and your dress also come
into play--you don't want to be too dressy or too casual compared to your subject. Ideally, you'll be
in the same ballpark or slightly more dressed up on a scale of casual to formal.

Besides location and your demeanor and dress, you'll also want to consider the way you ask ques-
tions as it relates to subject comfort. Your questions shouldn't be too accusatory or aggressive if you're
wanting to keep your subject comfortable. At the same time, they should not be too personal or
sensitive. Many times folks will say more than perhaps they even meant to in an interview setting,
and you want to guard against asking questions that prompt them to share things that are too private
for the setting. (The same advice usually goes out to teachers who ask for personal essays).

Next, you want to consider your questions and goals. When you ask someone a question in an in-
terview, the question should be crafted to get the information you need. Close-ended questions that
terminate with a simple yes or no answer can be self-defeating in this arena because you're not going
to get the valuable insight and elaboration from your subject that you need. Interviews are valuable
because you're getting a very specific set of information about a subject, and a series of yes and no
answers is not that.

When crafting questions, try to prompt discussion by your respondent with some direction. You
can vary the level of specificity as needed and to keep things fresh. You might ask some entirely
open-ended questions like, "What do you think about this document?". You could also ask fairly
specific questions like, "How effective are the headings and subheadings in this document, and how
might you change or improve them--if you would change anything at all?"

Remember with questioning that your goal is to get information from the person you're working
with to help you with a particular technical writing project. Write questions with that project in
mind and your goals in mind. Don't waste your time and your interviewees' time with anything off
topic or irrelevant.

                                                                 161
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 7

       Finally, set some standards for your interview from the get-go. Let your subject know what you're
       going to discuss, the types of things you're going to ask, and the length you're aiming for. That way,
       they don't spend their time second-guessing what is coming next or looking at the clock. By being
       upfront about all of this information you set yourself up for success by making the process itself less
       of a worry to the person(s) involved.

       Approaches to Recording Interviews
       It is worth noting that they way you decide to approach an interview's recording can impact the feel
       and the response of the interview. You'll want to make sure your interviewee understands they are
       being recorded if you make use of any mechanical means to record the conversation. Often you may
       find that video cameras have a tendency to make folks uncomfortable in a way that an audio recorder
       does not. In cases where you can't make use of either of these, you will want to transcribe yourself,
       noting important information.

       If you opt to take your own interview notes, please realize that this is a skill that is built over time.
       You need to have a real sense of what is important and what is not, as well as a good system for
       shortening what you need to write down. Practice more than a little before trying this with an actual
       interview you're running.

       Be aware that if you take the time to note something that happens in the interview and you make
       notes as if that something is important, you can skew the rest of the interview. Everything you do
       will impact the way the other party experiences the conversation.

       Finally, if you are going to be using anonymous data, you will need to transcribe the interview
       recordings and anonymize them and then destroy the originals. Voice recordings or video are not
       anonymous and if you've promised that to those you're working with, you'll need to make sure to
       honor that promise.

   Talk-Aloud Protocols

       Talk-Aloud Protocols, or TAP as we'll refer to them in this section, are a useful way to get a window
       into what is happening when someone is using a service or document. In the protocol, you ask a
       user to perform a given task while talking aloud their thought process. The TAP focuses on figuring
       out how folks interpret what is in front of them and the strategies they use to navigate through a
       document or service. There is some element of artificiality to TAP because of the self-filtering that
       happens when your participants talk aloud, and there is also a level of hyper-focus that wouldn't exist
       otherwise. With that said, the approach can be extremely useful to figure out how well folks can find
       a particular bit of information or operate with a document or website or service.

       Structure
       Usually a talk aloud protocol happens in a controlled environment where there are recording tools
       available. Using a PC, you can often make use of a webcam to track the focus of your participant
       while they are looking through the text that you've chosen or a website. Using a TAP is very common
       in testing websites in particular.

162
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 7

The TAP is oriented around a series of tasks that you have chosen for your participant(s). You might
ask them to find a bit of information in a website or document. You might ask them to finish a task
like registering for a course or event. You could even ask them to locate an item in a store. The task
will depend on what you're hoping to find out.

As the participant performs the task, you'll ask that they verbalize their thought process. You may
find it useful to model this for them first. The goal is that as they're searching through a site or doc-
ument that they'll explain the rationale behind where they are looking and what they are doing. This
type of talking can be useful because it can at times provide a window into the way your audience
perceives your text or site and allows you a window into the framework they use for navigation and
value making.

In general, you'll want to allow your participant to do their own work, though you may need to
prompt them with the next step of your protocol as you're going through, or you may need to assist
them if they get frustrated and stuck. The goal here is to keep getting information from your partici-
pant, not to make them hate the process and experience.

Technology
When you're carrying out a TAP, you'll be able to use any number of technologies to assist. Some
suits of software are specifically designed for TAP work, including Silverback for Macs. You may
also use screen recording tools to track what is going on, or screen casting software to capture both
the screen and the participant. In remote research you can often use services like Skype with video
chat and screen sharing to see both the participant and your target text as they navigate it. You can
also record someone in a physical space if they are navigating a place or a printed text. This relatively
flexibility via technology makes TAP work a great choice whenever you need to know how someone
would use your text or site or when you need to figure out why folks are getting to the wrong place.

Interpretation
When you're watching a TAP or reviewing the TAP after the fact, you can interpret data from any
number of sources. First, you can simply watch the eyes and progress of your participant for valuable
information. Where do they look first? What is their natural first choice to solve an issue? Is this the
same first choice you'd assumed they would make? Second, you can listen to what they're putting
forward as their logic of navigation. Ideally, they'll explain where they are looking and why. You can
see if this logic matches up with the logic of your text and whether there needs to be a change in the
text to match up with or defeat their logic's appropriateness. (For example, someone might misread
a term on your site and use faulty logic from that misreading to take them down the wrong path. In
that case you might want to alter the terms on your site so you don't accidentally mislead folks with
terms they interpret differently than you intended).

Card Sorting

Card sorting is a fascinating approach that you can use with minimal technology to figure out how
your participants use terms and group them together. The approach can also be a powerful tool for
sorting in situations where you need to think collectively, but we'll primarily focus this discussion
on using card sorting as a testing method. Card sorting is fairly literal in its meaning--you use

                                                                 163
                                              Open Technical Writing  Chapter 7

       notecards or something equivalent while asking users to sort those cards into various stacks that go
       together. The goal is to figure out how folks sort, and you may even go further to ask them why.

       Card sorting can be guided or unguided, meaning that you can create your own categories to allow
       folks to put content into, or you can give them a stack of cards and ask them to create their own
       categories for the content/terms that each card represents. Each approach as value and gives you a
       different insight into what is going on with your terms/categories.

       Structure
       Usually a card sort is structured around a stack of terms. The source of the terms can vary, depending
       on what you're hoping to find out. For example, if you have a menu system for a website and you
       want to know how folks would categorize your pages, you can use a card sort to figure out how they'd
       lump content together in their own categories. You can also use card sorting to figure out if your ex-
       isting system makes sense, having folks place each item in your menu system into the top-level menu
       headings, testing to see if they follow your logic or another logic.

       A card sort can be entirely focused around sorting, or you can include a component of explanation.
       You may simply want folks to organize cards, but you can also include the ability to name stacks
       when this is happening in an unguided sort, giving folks the ability to create their own categories
       rather than just stacking content in the same pile. In addition, you can ask folks to explain the choic-
       es that they've made once the sort is over, which may give you additional insight into the logic they
       used to make their choices.

       Face-to-face card sorts are the norm, but you can also use electronic services to carry out a card sort.
       There are any number of services online that will allow you to create card sorts, and you can create
       your own ad hoc sort using a database program like Excel or the equivalent. In that type of scenario
       you would simply list your terms and ask folks to put them into columns using copy/paste.

       In any scenario, it is incredibly valuable to get the actual feedback from the user after they've done
       the sort, so whenever possible try to get your users to explain after they're done why they've sorted
       the way they did. It may be best to ask them this after rather than during--you don't want to push
       them to overthink their work.

       Interpretation
       The interpretation of a card sort closely follows the way you've set it up what you hope to learn.
       If you're giving folks a set of subjects and asking them to place them in an existing set of chapter
       headings, you'll likely want to try and see what is different between the logic the user makes use of
       and your own logic. This can be helpful when you're trying to build a table of contents for a manual
       or other document that will be useful for reference. In scenarios where you're attempting to make
       groupings, you'll want to see how folks place the content, and you'll want to pay special attention to
       content that doesn't seem to fit anywhere at all. This can be a sign that your content is misnamed or
       doesn't belong in the existing framework; it might also mean that your users simply don't find much
       value in that content or really understand what it means or why it is there.

164
                                       Open Technical Writing  Chapter 7

Again, you'll want to think through your card sorting as a way to find out how folks view categories
and terms. This can identify terms that are misunderstood, terms that folks see as belonging together,
and generally help you get a better handle on the taxonomy of a given project. Design a sort around
something you want to learn; you'll find you get better results with a goal than simply performing a
card sort to perform a card sort.

Participatory Design

Rather than a particular method, participatory design is an overall approach to the idea of document
design and composition. Instead of creating something and then bringing users in to test what you've
created, participatory design as an approach asks that you bring users into the very act of creation.
This is a highly complex approach and one that has supported decades of research from any number
of technical writing and usability experts. As such, don't take this section in our text to be definitive
by any means, but rather as a very basic introduction to some ways you might want to begin to think
about bringing folks in to participate in the design of projects that impact them.

First and foremost with participatory design, you want to keep in mind your ethical obligations to
shield participants from negative consequences from their working with you. Participatory design
asks folks to give you honest feedback on the way things work and how they'd like them to work.
Sometimes, this information can come from someone who is lower in a power structure and end up
getting relayed to someone higher up in that power structure, creating an awkward situation where
folks criticize their bosses openly, creating a space for retaliation or resentment. Keep this in mind
and design your participatory design around protecting those who would give you their feedback
and time.

Structure
With participatory design, your goal is to bring someone into the design process so that they can
influence it. The idea here is that the folks who actually do the work, who actually are working in
a situation you're designing documents around, that these folks know the process and the variables
better than anyone else might. They know what blind spots exist and what existing documents fail to
do well or simply get wrong. As such, you want to bring them in at an early phase, allowing them to
shape the fundamental conception of what the text does and why.

One strategy can be to start with the existing document and simply ask folks to tell you what it does
well, what it doesn't do well, and what it simply gets wrong or omits. This can be a useful space for
incremental change because you're starting with an existing deliverable that can be altered as needed
to fit the needs of the folks actually working with it on a daily basis. This can also be a useful task to
bring to folks that use a document that has been created elsewhere, such as folks creating financial
reports from documents not created by their team. Documents can cause issues for the folks creating
them or the folks using them.

Another strategy that can be helpful is to simply start from scratch and ask the folks you're working
with what they do and how documentation can assist them in the work they do. What do they need
to record? What do they need to pass on to others? This can at times be useful to discuss when you

                                                                 165

       have multiple levels of folks in the same room, allowing them to see how different folks in the same
       organization need different things from documentation and from the workflow of others in the same
       company or group. Things that seem arbitrary at one level can be crucial at the next, and learning
       about the importance of data to folks at other levels of an organization can be helpful to those who
       generate text that seems meaningless to them.

       At the end of the day, there are innumerable approaches to creating participatory structures for docu-
       ment design and service design. The above are two simple approaches that you can start with in your
       own work, but they are simply suggestions. There is a massive body of research out there that I would
       encourage you to pursue if you find yourself drawn to this research paradigm.

       Interpretation
       When interpreting participatory design, please be aware that different users have different values that
       they give to documents and information. Depending on where someone is in an organization they
       may undervalue or overvalue information, or simply ignore it or not know it exists. Expertise within
       an organization can be hidden by existing documentation and ways of doing work. As a technical
       writer, you need to be aware of these issues and tread carefully. In some cases there can be valuable
       work that is getting done that documentation doesn't capture--you can help make that visible. In
       other cases, there can be work done for no reason and you can bring that to folks' attention.

       Be aware that when you work participatory projects that everyone has a political agenda to push and
       that you need to keep the overall power structure of the organization and your role in mind when
       you interpret data. Don't do stuff that will get folks in trouble, and keep in mind that entire orga-
       nizations are built around document workflows and that emphasizing one group at the expense of
       another can create tiffs and rifts.

       Technology and Recording
       Be extremely sensitive when using technology and recording tools with participatory design. Realize
       that all of the conversations you have are part of larger power structures that can get those who par-
       ticipate into trouble if the information they volunteer isn't well received or is taken out of context by
       those above (or below) them in the power structure.

   Observation

       The final research method that I will share is observation, one of the simplest and most awkward of
       all research methods, depending on the implementation. Observation is simply that, observing folks
       using documents or working in a given workplace. Sometimes bordering on ethnographic research,
       observation can be a tool that you use to figure out how folks are working and using systems and
       texts without intruding into their workflow. You simply sit back and observe the situation, taking
       notes of things as they happen.

       In public scenarios, observation can be extremely unobtrusive in that you can sometimes simply
       blend into the background. You may, for example, want to see how folks navigate the signage in the
       campus cafeteria. You could simply park yourself near the front of that cafeteria and observe patterns
       and when folks stop to interpret things. Obviously this would be more useful when you have large
       groups of folks using these facilities for the first time, such as during orientation week or when a

166

visiting group are present.
In more closed scenarios, observation can involve permission to simply sit around and record what
is going on. You will likely want to keep your recording to written notes, and you may need to get
your notes checked with those that you're working with before you use them or take them out of the
location, especially when sensitive information can be involved.
Interpretation
Observation excels at helping you understand how a process or system actually works when folks
work through it in a natural way. By casually observing a situation, you can see how folks navigate
a space or document and when they become frustrated and at what rate. In private situations, you
get a better sense of how work pulses and flows in a given location and the types of interactions and
work that happens in a given space. Each type of information can be valuable for you as a technical
writer because it gives you even more information to take into account when you consider the choic-
es you make in your own designs and documents.
Recording and Technology
As noted above, be aware that sensitive information can be relayed in a workplace or even in certain
public venues. Take care that you're not going to be recording in a way that will disrupt workplaces
or violate privacy. You may be asked to leave a room during a private observation, and you may need
to ignore anything you hear in a more public venue if the content that is being shared would be em-
barrassing or otherwise troublesome to record and share. As I mentioned previously, you may want
to default to written notes with observation, allowing you the chance to be your own editor as far as
what is recorded and what is not. In addition, you should check with those you will be observing to
see what types of sensitive information you should go to great pains to ignore or not record.
