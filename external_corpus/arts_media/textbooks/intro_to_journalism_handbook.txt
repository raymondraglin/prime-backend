PART ONE: INTRODUCTION

Purpose

This book is intended as an open educational resource for beginning journalism
students. It contains information on such topics as the First Amendment, 5 Ws
(and H), inverted pyramid, headlines and subheads, AP and in-house style,
writing and editing exercises, and guidance on strategies for covering various
stories and/or events.

I have provided this book to my classes for more than ten years at low cost (via
Lulu in print) or no cost (as downloadable PDF) and it has proven effective in
terms of providing initial background to the field of journalism, as well as support
exercises for student writers.

Strategy

This book essentially replicates the structure of my journalism classes, which are,
to be clear, writing-intensive classes. As such, it will not include detailed
discussions of the history of journalism or a sustained consideration of First
Amendment cases (areas unto themselves). Instead, this textbook is intended to
help student writers begin working on reasonably serious, campus-level
journalism assignments as quickly as possible. The shared goal is to submit
stories, photos, and occasionally video to our student newspaper, The Keystone
at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. I am the advisor, so I have the
opportunity to oversee dozens of projects as they move from classroom to
newspaper editors to bylined publication.

It is important to note that I teach all my classes in a computer lab. I have so
much tech background that the lab helps me to teach document management
strategies (which my students have told me for years has helped them in all their
other classes). File names, directories, shared folders, differences between
Google Docs and Word...that sort of thing. If I were not in a writing lab, I would
fill this space with reading and discussion.

Open Source/OER

I've been a supporter of the open-source software movement since at least
1998, when I began writing for technology publications in the areas of computer
storage, fiber optics, connectivity, chip development and, of course, software. I
interviewed Linus Torvalds (inventor of the Linux kernel and open-source
evangelist) in Las Vegas some 25 years ago and have been a supporter of open-
source initiatives ever since. I contribute to Wikipedia annually and teach my
students how to draw from and contribute to Wikimedia Commons. I have also
                                                                                                                                            2

taught writing for more than 30 years. Therefore, when the opportunity revealed
itself to me to write an OER book, I jumped at the chance.

Brief Note to Students

This handbook is about output:

Preparing to write, talking to people, writing, revising, and editing.

But what about the input?

Two Points:

      1. To write about the world of humans, you must speak with humans.

You would agree: Writing stories--stories about the world--from the confines of
your own head is no way to write about the world. Even if your job is to write
about/react to social media, you should be having conversations with people, in
person (Zoom counts), that relate to the topics you are writing about. Focused
expertise goes a long way, plus it gives you a credible source for your story.
Talking to people is the best method of putting information into your head.

      2. Read and read and read.

Writing journalism articles is like painting a room, most of the hard work goes
into the preparation. Read everything about your topics. Become a lover of
quotes and primary documents. Talk to people. Then paint the story. As you
read, the information will coalesce and that is why I will read your articles online
someday...because they have perspective and are interesting. Reading makes this
happen.

I do not want this introduction to go on too long so let me say, for the record,
that I am absolutely delighted to participate in creating an open educational
resource for journalism students around the world. I hope much is gained by
many.

Sincerely,

PART TWO: KEY CONCEPTS IN JOURNALISM

The First Amendment

The field of journalism is based on The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution:
      "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
      prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
      speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
      assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

Notice that the language covers not only free speech and, specifically, freedom of
the press, but also covers freedom of religion, the right to peaceable assemble,
and the right of people to petition the government. The founders wanted to be
sure that citizens had the right to voice their opinions.
I am not going to go deep here, because the impact of the First Amendment on
the field of journalism--including various court cases where the limits of free
speech were tested and defined--is a study in and of itself and I would definitely
suggest pursuing it. However, as this book is aimed at writing, I will turn toward
the Five Ws and H.

                            Figure 1: The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in Philadelphia.

                                                                   under CC BY-SA 4.0.
                                                                                                                                            4

Five Ws and the H

The starting point for most news stories is the Five Ws and H: who, what, when,
where, why, and how. Occasionally on campus, I will see a flyer on one of our
many poster boards and when read it, I see that it has missing information. They
forgot the "where" or "what time." Should have followed the Five Ws and H.

Answer those questions, one for each paragraph (for now) and the paragraphs
should begin to form. Be sure to use attribution throughout. You, as writer, are
not making these statements of bringing these charges, so attribute each
accordingly.

I encourage using labels, initially:

Who:

The treasurer of Springfield (made up place). Nail down all specifics. Name,
including middle name(s), official title, years in office, graduate of which college
(or not), positions previously held.

What:

Allegedly used public funds improperly. Work from the official statements of
police and/or investigators. Quote and paraphrase those statements. Do not offer
your own interpretation unless writing an opinion piece.

When:

2016-2019

Where:

Springfield (made up)

Why:

According to police investigator Edgar Smithson (made up), the money was used
to fund vacations and purchase personal items, including....

How:

Over many years. Diverting money to a private account. Not maintaining
accurate records. All according to a police report and the statements of an
investigator. District attorney statements can also come into view as the case
progresses.

      1. Police are going to tell you that an arrest has been made and can identify
          the charges.

      2. Investigators (either police investigators or in this case, forensic
          accountants) can also make official statements.

      3. District attorneys typically take it from there and can provide information
          on court dates, additional charges, witnesses, and the like.

      4. Defense attorneys will speak on behalf of their clients. In most cases,
          they will deny any wrongdoing, but sometimes they will talk about
          seeking a plea deal.

Use the information at hand to develop each of those sections and if you see
gaps, ask questions. Keep asking questions until ALL QUESTIONS ARE
ANSWERED. When I was coming through the ranks, I was regularly impressed by
writers who were senior to me and their ability to ask question after question
until they understood as many aspects of the story as possible. I worked hard to
develop that skill.

The next step is to arrange those paragraphs according to the Inverted Pyramid,
which is discussed below.

Inverted Pyramid

The Inverted Pyramid assumes that the most important information in a news
story should come at the beginning and that the importance of the information
decreases as the story progresses. This is different from, let us say, a short story,
where the action builds until it reaches crescendo and then dissolves, in time.

The example I provide for my classes goes like this (names are made up):

Short story style:

Title: An Unexpected Accident

Cliff Yelnats woke up in his apartment in Kutztown and had coffee and a
doughnut. He then got dressed and walked down the stairs because he had
errands to run. He crossed White Oak safely but then when he tried to cross Main
Street, he was hit by a car. The police arrived as well as an ambulance, which
took Yelnats to Reading Hospital where is listed in stable condition. According to
police, the driver of the car, Cheryl Enidisinoc, was ticketed and charged with
reckless driving, failure to observe traffic regulations, and failure to yield to a
pedestrian in a crosswalk.

Journalism style:
                                                                                                                                            6

Headline: Local man his by car on Main Street
Subhead: Listed in Stable Condition at Reading Hospital
Lead: Cliff Yelnats of 511 W. Walnut St. in Kutztown, Pa. was hit by a car
yesterday afternoon while attempting to cross Main Street. According to police,
he was taken by ambulance to Reading Hospital where he is listed in stable
condition.
Police said the drive of the car, Cheryl Enidisinoc, 111 Tether Street, Springfield,
Pa., was ticketed and charged with reckless driving, failure to observe traffic
regulations, and failure to yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk.
The key difference is seeing how journalistic stories "spill the bean" right off the
bat.
Today's readers depend on the Inverted Pyramid to deliver their news in a certain
way. The agreement is simple: They should be able to understand the key points
of any story by reading the headline, subhead, and lead. If they are interested in
obtaining more details, they can read further. Otherwise, they can stop reading
and move on to another story. This is called "scanning the headlines."

                                 Figure 2: The Inverted Pyramid assumes that the most important
                               information comes at the beginning of a story, with the information
                          decreasing in importance as the story progresses."The Inverted Pyramid in
                           Comprehensive Form" by Christopher Schwartz is licensed under Creative

In addition to delivering the news efficiently to busy readers, the inverted
pyramid stems from the old days when a story literally had to be "cut" (with
scissors) from the bottom in order to allow that story to fit on the page of a
printed newspaper. Today's internet offers no such space restrictions, but the
inverted pyramid remains a cornerstone to journalistic-style writing.

Student Writing Alert: Once they learn about the 5Ws and the H and the
inverted pyramid, students often fall into the trap of writing dull headlines,
subheads, and leads (discussion below). The secret is to read dozens of news
articles online and see how the authors do it. The art is to blend factual
information with imagery, interest and a good hook.

Headlines, Subheads, and Leads: a Writing Formula

Memorize this formula: Headline + subhead = lead.

Headlines and subheads come at the beginning of news stories. Please note that
they are not titles, like you may have learned to write for academic papers in
high school. As such, headlines must contain verbs, in boldface, below.

Examples

Title: Guns in America
Headline: American President Vetoes
Gun Legislation

Title: The Bible
Headline: Scholars Find Missing
Chapter from The Bible

headline and subhead. Ask others to
read your headlines and subheads for
clarity.

Rules for Headlines and Subheads

Headlines should communicate the most important part of the story:

Local Man Hit by Car on Main Street

Subheads should amplify and extend headlines without repetition:
                                                                                                                                            8

Yes: Listed in Stable Condition at Reading Hospital

No: Man Hit by Car on Main Street was taken to Reading Hospital (do not repeat
any of the headline)

Let us identify verbs from actual headlines:

       Scientists Fault U.S. Response in Assessing Gulf Oil Spill
       Florida Worries About Oil Effect on Tourism
       Voter Insurrection Turns Mainstream, Creating New Rules

Let us look at a headline + subhead combination. Remember that subheads
follow headlines and must, themselves, contain verbs:

Example #1

Headline: Emmaus police officer suspended
Subhead: Chief says Nathan Bordner was in alcohol-related incident in North
Catasauqua

Notice how the subhead provides additional, specific detail. The subhead
identifies the actual name of the "police officer" mentioned in the headline. The
subhead also provides attribution--who is providing this information. The
subhead also provides a crucial detail: the fact that the incident was "alcohol-
related." This is the correct way to write heads and subs.

Here is an example of an ineffective headline/subhead:

Headline: Emmaus police officer suspended
Subhead: Emmaus police chief says Nathan Bordner will be suspended for
incident

The subhead repeats three of the four words. Not good. Beyond that, the
subhead does little to extend the information provided in the headline (other
than identifying the name of the officer). This is the wrong way to do it.

Example #2

Headline: Hang up the cell phone
Subhead: Bethlehem is 6th city in state to ban motorists from using devices that
aren't hands-free

This is good. Note how the subhead functions. It does not repeat any of the
information from the headline verbatim. Instead, it amplifies, extends, and
clarifies the information provided in the headline.

When writing as a journalist, think about limitations, particularly limitations on
time and on people's attention spans. This will force you to recognize the
                                                                                                                                            9

importance of making the most of every word, every phrase, and every headline.
All of it should be right and tight. All of it should be clear and concise--not
cluttered, repetitive, and confusing.

Leads

The lead is the first paragraph of a news story. Sometimes called a lede, this
paragraph typically connects the content to the audience and attempts to answer
as many of the 5Ws and H as possible/reasonable.

Start with the formula: headline + subhead = lead. Let us see how it works with
the following example.

Headline: Emmaus police officer suspended
Subhead: Chief says Nathan Bordner was in alcohol-related incident in North
Catasauqua

Lead: An Emmaus police officer has been suspended because of an ''alcohol-
related incident'' in North Catasauqua last weekend, Emmaus police Chief David
Faust confirmed.

 Instructor Note: This is the place where students struggle so it is useful to
 bring in exercises from the internet. Find a news story with a headline,
 subhead, and lead, and then remove one of the elements to see how they
 might develop the missing element.

 The beautiful part of the formula is that it can be deconstructed. In other
 words, some students are pretty good at writing leads but cannot write heads
 and subs. Have them deconstruct their lead. Some students can write a decent
 headline but cannot write the lead. Have them reach into their stories and bring
 up the most important information to the top.

 It takes time and effort but the good news is--in my experience--once students
 have the headline, subhead, and lead in place, they are pretty good at
 arranging the remaining pieces.

 Student Note: At this point, it is time to ask someone to read your work. It
 does not need to be a professor or an expert. Just ask a friend or a family
 member. Journalism should essentially be written for smart high schoolers, so
 most people can tell you whether your story makes sense or not, whether it is
 missing information, attribution, or a direct quote, or whether the information
 needs to be re-arranged.
                                                                                                                                           10

Storytelling

Now it is time to move beyond the formulas (5Ws, Inverted P, Head+Sub=Lead)
and get to the aesthetics of newswriting. Learning how to write a story based on
factual information is an art unto itself and can be learned by reading the work of
other writers. Much of the art is tied to providing context, which is often a
struggle for beginning writers because they have not been alive that long.

My message for students, therefore, is ask everyone along the line for context.
Ask the people you interview, ask your professors, ask a well-read family
member:

What is the context here? What might I be missing? Is there history I need to
know about?

In the above example where the man is hit by a car: Perhaps others have been
hit at that intersection recently. Perhaps there is a problem with the traffic signal.
Perhaps the driver was distracted--perhaps looking at her cell phone--which
seems to be an increasing problem. Context.

 Student Note: For a quick lesson in writing a story from a contextual point of
 view, read just about any sports article. The articles will not simply report a
 score and statistics, with no context. Sports writing is all about context:

 The Celtics added to their 16-game home unbeaten streak yesterday, defeating
 the 76ers by a score of 101-87 at TD Garden.

 From there, it identifies the key players, coaches, and game moments.

Now that we have established that context is important, what is the next step in
telling a story? My strategy is to work toward developing a clear perspective and
starting point.

Developing a clear perspective enables the reader to connect with your story.
Even if you are drafting a longer story from a convicted criminal's perspective,
readers can connect, watch the woeful patterns emerge, and understand how
this person did what they did. Think about perspective when you read news
stories online.

Combined with a clear perspective, a clear starting point hooks readers and
provides enough information to keep them reading without loading too much
information into the lead or withholding too much until the end.

Mastering the art of storytelling in journalism may sound difficult because it is.
The good news is that there are examples all around us. Study the writing of
working journalists and, in time, the skills will come.
                                                                                                                                           11

Libel

Libel is a written statement that is false and holds a person up to ridicule, hatred,
or scorn, or damages a person's reputation, through fault.

Truth is the best defense against libel. However, truth alone is not enough. If
fault can be proven, a reporter can still be held liable.

In the case of libel, "fault" has been typically defined by the courts as either
reckless disregard for the truth or malice aforethought.

Definition: Libel is a written statement that is false and holds a
person up to ridicule, hatred, or scorn, or damages a person's
reputation, through fault.

Reckless disregard for the truth can involve not getting the other side of the
story or willingly (and conveniently) ignoring critical information to create a
scenario that damages a person's standing.

Malice aforethought involves situations where it can be proven that the reporter
wrote the story with the express intention of damaging the reputation of the
party in question. This is difficult to prove and
typically requires corroborating evidence and
additional witnesses.

The second defense against libel is the public         Figure 4:"Justice scale silhouette"
person's defense. Under the Constitutional right to   by HTGS is licensed under Creative
freedom of speech, the courts have upheld the right   Common Attribution-ShareAlike CC
of the press to fair comment and criticism. The
precedent has been that, if you are a public figure,                    BY-SA 4.0.
you are more subject to the public opinions of
people. That is why Americans can say just about
anything they like about the President of the United
States (whomever that might be). The same is true
for celebrities because the courts would say that
these people "actively sought the spotlight" and may
face public commentary related to those actions.

In contrast, private persons are better protected. If
you do not seek the spotlight and suddenly find yourself subject to false ridicule
in the press, you will have more options under libel law. Of course, you must
then demonstrate that the things they are saying are false and potentially done
with malice.

PART THREE: FORMAT AND STYLE

Format

Format is a quick way of providing structure to students and goes a long way
toward helping them understand how to put together a journalism writing
assignment. Therefore, after discussing the key concepts, we turn toward writing
assignments with discussion of format, style, and consistency, along with naming
and saving documents.

Let us begin with header information.

Headline, Subhead, Section. Date, Word Count,
Byline

The information below should be at the top left of the page. A professional writer
would likely copy and paste that information into the header of all their active
articles so as to replicate it and avoid mistakes/omissions. Work smarter, not
harder.

Headline:
Subhead:
Section:
Date:
Words:
By

In the past, the practice was to not place such information into the header,
keeping it only on page one; however, I now believe the best practice is to copy
and paste the information into the actual header so that the information appears
on every page of the document instead of just the first. Once upon a time in a
paper-based world, limiting data on a page was an ongoing consideration
because print costs have always been high. But digital pages are cheap,
relatively speaking. As a result, headlines and subheads have increased their
wordcount. File name length has also increased along with most everything else
sitting on a server. So go ahead and paste it into the header so it appears on
every page unless told otherwise.

Please note the formula: headline + subhead = lead. If you cannot write a
headline for your story, you do not know what you're trying to say. It is
recommended to bounce back and forth between the story and the head/sub/
lead until all are revised appropriately and work nicely together. More on this
later, but in my experience, students struggle mightily with writing headlines,
subheads, and leads. However, once they figure out the formula, the remainder
of the article clicks into place.
                                                                                                                                           13

AP Style

What is writing style? It is useful to think of it as a spectrum. On one end, it is,
loosely, how the words on a page are arranged. More specifically, tone, word
choice, the order of the words (syntax), quotes material all come into
consideration until an assessment of "style" can be fairly elaborate, something
English professors have been working at for centuries.

In journalism, publishers typically work with AP Style and in-house style, with the
latter typically being amended versions of AP style rules.

The internet has led to a widespread degradation of consistency in style so there
is kind of a bind here in terms of whether to even study style at all. I mean, if
various websites are ignoring AP Style, why spend time on it?

In my experience, students who have learned the basics of AP Style are thankful
when they move into the professional world. Yes, there are websites that ignore
or are not aware of AP Style, but the internet is still governed by informational/
journalistic-style writing, and AP Style is king of that domain.

AP Style also helps with structure in terms of how to use the language of
journalism and in that way improves the writing, which as I understand it is the
primary intention of any style manual.

Examples of AP Style

The Associated Press is a news-gathering organization that got its start in 1846.
Located in New York City, the company employs 3,700 people. Its most famous
publication, the AP Stylebook, is the bible of journalists worldwide.

Here are two excerpts from the AP Stylebook, relating to numbers and
abbreviations. There are many more rules that students should know, however,
so student journalists should purchase and study the Stylebook.

Numbers

Use figures for all numbers above nine; spell out all numbers under 10 (note
exceptions.)

Use 21 million instead of 21,000,000.
Money: $39 million, $22.5 billion. Do not carry beyond two decimals.
Fractions standing alone are spelled out.
One-fourth of the students.
Insert commas with four or more figures, except in dates.
$5,900 1,576 skateboards 1990 2001.
                                                                                                                                           14

Abbreviations

Ala. Fla. Md. Neb. N.D. Tenn.
Ariz. Ga. Mass. Nev. Okla. Vt.
Ark. Ill. Mich. N.H. Ore. Va.
Calif. Ind. Minn. N.J. Pa. Wash.
Colo. Kan. Miss. N.M. R.I. W.Va.
Conn. Ky. Mo. N.Y. S.C. Wis.
Del. La. Mont. N.C. S.D. Wyo.

DO NOT abbreviate Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Ohio, Utah, Texas.

Abbreviate the names of months that are more than five letters when followed by
a date but spell them out when referring to the month generally.

DO NOT abbreviate March, April, May, June, July.

Feb. 5 March 30 April 7 Sept. 10.

Punctuation

Always put the period and comma inside quotation marks.

"I saw the play," he said.
He said, "I saw the play."
"Did you see the play?" he asked.
Should I see "King Lear"?

Use periods in lower-case abbreviations.

c.o.d. f.o.b. a.m. p.m. m.p.h. r.p.m.
Exception: 35mm.

In-House Style

In addition to AP Style Manuals, most publishers maintain in-house style guides.
Typically, they include modifications of AP Style rules relating to commas, tone,
words that should not be used, use of contractions, discussions of various
audiences, workflow, available resources, and the like.

The ultimate goal is to provide consistency for written material. Imagine if you
were an editor who had several reporters working for you and they were
submitting documents in different formats: Some in Word, some in Pages, some
in Google Docs, some as PDFs. Some might be double-spaced, some not. Some
might have indented paragraphs, some not. It would not take you long to
develop a uniform format policy for the entire organization to facilitate workflow.
                                                                                                                                           15

Every publishing house I have worked for has maintained an in-house style
guide. They are typically composed by copy editors and proofreaders, in
conjunction with publishers, editors, owners, and writers. They are designed to
tackle concerns that have emerged, specifically, within that publishing house.

Examples of In-House Style

Rules I have seen professionally:

"Sentences should be written in active voice."
"Newsletter articles should be no longer than 500 words."
"Sentences should be no longer than 30 words."
"`Usage' is not acceptable; instead: `use'."
"Use only approved images from the company database/online subscription."

One of our rules at The Keystone Newspaper:

"All references to the university are `KU'; all references to the town are
`Kutztown'."

Datelines

Datelines look like this:

KUTZTOWN, Pa. March 28 - University leaders met with borough council
members last week to discuss...

We tend to not use these for our university newspaper because 95% of our
stories are based either at the university or town (both "Kutztown"). Therefore,
the datelines would not add any value. However, if one of our reporters is
working remotely, they should include a dateline. This is a good example of in-
house style taking precedent over AP style, because we do not typically cover
national or international news (much less send a reporter to a remote location).
Other campus newspapers manage this differently.

Center the "Thirty" Mark (-30-)

The thirty-mark used to be a standard part of journalism-writing instruction.
However, the internet--as it has with AP style--has watered down actual usage
and expectations. In my experience, young writers who are working on their own
news-based publishing projects no longer use it. I do see thirty-marks often (but
not always) in press releases, though. Interesting that journalism has more or
less abandoned the practice while a field that mimics the press retains it.

Here is the story: Once upon a time, when journalists typed their copy on literal
typewriters, they would add notations at the tail-end of each sheet of paper. For
                                                                                                                                           16

example, "more" would indicate more pages to come; "page 2" would indicate
this was page two (with more pages to follow). Very straightforward.

To end a story, then, somebody, rather than typing "END" as one would with a
script, decided to--likely with a blend of relief and emphasis at a job completed--
held down the shift key and typed "XXX," which is the roman numeral for the
number 30. Following that logic, I suspect some other clever person decided to
type "-30-" and there you have your "thirty" mark. It's essentially a story-end
designator, aka "tombstone," but only present in drafts.

If you want to go by the book (and I do show my students, in case they run into
someone who wants them to use it) center the -30- mark at the end of all
stories.

Here is a good article on the thirty-mark from the American Journalism Review:
So Why Not "-29-"?

Hit the Space Bar Once

Use one space after periods in journalistic writing. If you are in the habit of using
two spaces after periods, use Find and Replace to remove extra spaces.

Track Changes and Peer Review

If you are not familiar with the Track Changes function in Word, locate it and
familiarize yourself with it. It is located under the Review tab in Word. To activate
Track Changes, click the button. This will enable you to track the changes or
comments that someone else makes to your work. It also allows a professor or
editor to comment on your work.

 Student Note: Sometimes professor feedback can seem harsh. Do not take it
 personally. You are new to the field and your profs have been doing it for
 20-30 years. Listen and learn and actively seek feedback. Journalism-style
 writing is useful, even if you do not wish to become a reporter. I sometimes get
 introduced as a "journalism professor" and many people--years after they
 graduated--have told me that they enjoyed learning about journalism and
 understand 5Ws and Inverted Pyramid. Useful skills that they remember many
 years later.

Word Processing Software

Microsoft Word has long been king of this space but Google Docs is steadily
increasing in both functionality and popularity. I taught Word for 25 years before
taking a hybrid approach where I teach both. Word remains more feature rich
and occasionally I get students who become frustrated by the limitations of
                                                                                                                                           17

GDocs (captions, in particular) and I tell them to go to Word, create what they
want, and build the PDF.

 Instructor Note: During the pandemic, I began using shared Google folders for
 my students to submit drafts and I love it. It is a sandbox where we can review
 drafts and where I can show them how I might attack an assignment. The
 number of students in my classes that have Google accounts is near 100% so
 this brings the world of document management to their immediate doorstep
 without worrying about having to pay license fees for Word or downloading
 software from the university website. Final submissions must be PDF and
 should be submitted to Desire to Learn (or other LMS) for grading.

Naming Files

It is imperative that students learn to name and manage files properly,
particularly in shared environments.

I ask students to use the following format for naming files:

Last name, first name, assignment title, time the class meets

In practice, it looks like this with underscores:

Downing_Michael_HardNews_3pm

Commas can also be used:

Downing, Michael, HardNews, 3pm

Typically in the publishing world, file naming will be covered by the In-House
Style Guide (typically, itself, in a shared folder on a server). At minimum, though,
put last name and assignment.

Style, Consistency, Branding

In addition to promoting consistency in the writing, in-house style also reinforces
the identity of the publication by maintaining the "look" of the publication. Open
a news website and look for consistency.

       What font are they using?

       Is the font serif or san-serif?

       Are they using Upstyle or downstyle?

Examples (study them closely until you understand):

       Serif fonts include "feet" on the letters.
                                                                                                                                           18

       San-serif fonts have no feet.

       An Upstyle Headline Looks Like This

       A downstyle headline looks like this

Sometimes publications will blend the styles by running an upstyle headline and
a downstyle subhead.

Such style is present and emphasized, not only in the pages of the publications
themselves but throughout the organization. Think about the iconic look of the
New York Times logo. You will have to check it yourself because I tried to see if I
could copy the NYTimes logo into a document just as an experiment. I was
curious to see if I could identify the font, because I love that sort of thing.
However, I was unable to copy it from the website. I even tried the trick where I
highlighted the entire page, figuring I would delete everything else, but the code
allowed me to highlight every word EXCEPT the logo. That is how protected it is.

My intention is to discuss copyright concerns in detail in the Copyright section,
but since we have a fitting example at hand, let us consider the questions of
whether or not I could use the NY Times logo as an example of style and
branding in this textbook.

The answer is "possibly." Let's begin with the NY Times Help Page:

          10. Can I use the NYTimes.com logo on my website?

          Prior permission is required from The New York Times for the use of
          any of our logos. To obtain permission, send us the overall URL of
          your site, as well as the URL of the exact page on which the logo
          will be displayed. In the subject line of the email, write "Use of
          logo." Send this information to rights@nytimes.com.

I am not going to seek permission for an example that I can simply link to, but
you see the point as it relates to style: The look, consistency, and ultimate
branding of the written product becomes increasingly serious as we move beyond
the friendly neighborhood blogger to the NY Times. Students should therefore
learn the basics of AP Style and be prepared to encounter an in-house style book
if hired to work as a writer.

One of the phrases I use regularly is: "Follow the models." By this, I mean be
sure to review online articles and make your work look like theirs. For example,
take a look at this article on CNN.com and you'll see that the paragraphs are
short (often a single sentence), not indented, and separated by a space. Always
                                                                                                                                           19

start by following available models and adjust accordingly, based on the needs of
your employer and/or audience.

To close this section, let me just say that "simple is best" in the world of
journalism. Do not use boldface, italics, or fancy fonts, unless told otherwise.
Margins should be an inch to an inch and a half. Keep it simple.
                                                                                                                                           20

PART FOUR: OBITS, HARD NEWS, PRESS
RELEASES, SPORTS, OPINIONS

Obituaries

An obituary is a published notice of death that includes a brief biography of the
deceased as well as family connections. Obits are typically written by young
journalists, who are sharpening their writing skills.

Model

      Elizabeth A. Fletcher, 94, died Saturday, Feb. 2, 2008 at Sarah Reed
      Retirement Center in Erie, Pa. She was born on May 18, 1913 in Ripley, N.Y.,
      the daughter of the late Joseph and Olive (Smith) Fletcher. Elizabeth
      attended Ripley Central School in Ripley and graduated from Jamestown
      Business College in Jamestown, N.Y. She worked for 35 years at Welch
      Foods, Inc. in Westfield, N.Y. She was a member of First United Methodist
      Church, Westfield. Elizabeth was active with the local quilting club, The Lady
      Needlers. She also enjoyed playing bridge and tending her vegetable garden.
      She is survived by a nephew, Robert S. Fischer, of Erie, and a dear friend,
      Nancy May Shimmons of Erie. Besides her parents, she was predeceased by
      her niece and nephew, Edgar and April Fletcher. Funeral services will be held
      on Saturday, Feb. 9 at 10 a.m. at the Westfield Funeral Home, 52 South
      Portage Street, Westfield, with the Rev. Matt Johnson of First United
      Methodist Church officiating. Relatives and friends are invited to call at the
      funeral home from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Saturday, prior to the funeral
      service. Interment will be in the Ripley Rural Cemetery, Ripley.

The following elements must be included in any obituary:

      1. Name

      2. Title

      3. Time and place of death

      4. Age

      5. Funeral service

      6. Burial or entombment

      7. Survivors

The following should be considered and included when appropriate:
                                                                                                                                           21

      1. Cause of death

      2. Extent of illness

      3. Biographical material

      4. Those present at time of death

      5. Last words

      6. Unusual circumstances

Typically, journalists complete an obituary form before writing the obit. The obit
form goes into a folder with other notes and can be consulted if necessary.

I have created an online obituary form for anyone to use.

Covering Hard News

News stories come in two basic forms: hard and soft. Hard news focuses on hard
life: Fires, floods, robbery, earthquakes, war, and death. It's what you find, for
the most part, in the NY Times, Washington Post, L.A. Times, along with the
news services such as Associated Press and Reuters). Hard news most definitely
makes use of the 5Ws and the H and focuses on hard facts (times, dates, people
involved). Headlines for hard news look like this:

       Scientists Fault U.S. Response in Assessing Gulf Oil Spill

       Greenland's glaciers are losing more ice than scientists estimated

       Pakistan recalls envoy from Iran after 'unprovoked' missile strikes

In contrast, soft news deals with people, who are soft, myself included. As such,
soft news deals with biography, background, profile, trends, interviews, etc.
While facts are certainly important, the focus is on people and situations, not
necessarily the often brutal events of everyday life.

Therefore, a hard news story might be "Mack Truck Closing Allentown Plant."
Such a story would focus on when the operation is closing, how many people
would be laid off, what the economic impact is going to be, and what efforts
might be taking place to prevent such a closure. In contrast, a parallel soft news
story would take a closer look at someone who worked at Mack Truck for 35
years. What are they feeling? What are the memories? What are some of
personal milestones? What is the person going to do now?

Posted below is a hard news model that I wrote in my days as a technical
journalist. You might not be familiar with some of the jargon, but that is okay.
You should be able to recognize some of the prominent features of a hard news
                                                                                                                                           22

story, such as a strong lead, attribution, quotations, and actionable information
at the end. I also want to present an example of specialized journalism.

Hard News Model for Discussion

Headline: High-Speed Backplane Initiative launched
Subhead: Work on HSBI Specification to be Completed by End of 2002
Section: News
Date: Sept.12, 2002
Words: 551
By Mike Downing, Senior Technical Editor

San Jose, Calif. (September 2000) - Think of it as a high-profile project intended
to provide a mid-life bandwidth boost to backplane development. That is the
wisdom driving the launch of the High Speed Backplane Initiative (HSBI). The
group's purpose is to develop serial link technology capable of sending data at
rates of 4.976 to 6.375 Gbits/s across a backplane up to a distance of 30 in.
(including two connectors).

According to John D'Ambrosia, Manager of Semiconductor Relations for Tyco
Electronics and secretary for the HSBI, the project started with companies
involved with XAUI (10-Gbit Attachment Unit Interface) development.

 "As XAUI work was winding down, several companies recognized the need for
additional bandwidth on the backplane, especially with the emergence of fiber
optics and the push for greater port densities. Nine of these companies came
together to form the HSBI," D'Ambrosia said.

The companies include Agilent, Intel, Marvel, Mindspeed, Gennup, Cadence/
Tality, Texas Instruments, Tyco, and Velio.

"There are also more than 20 additional companies currently acting as
contributors," said D'Ambrosia, adding, "System vendors will also be invited to
participate in the initiative once we have more to show them."

Shawn Rogers from Texas Instruments is senior editor for the High Speed
Backplane Initiative. "We don't want to create the impression that this is a bunch
of XAUI players who don't have anything else to do," he said. "We found that the
market for our XAUI transceivers was predominantly in the backplane. Our
customers were telling us that they need a mid-life bandwidth boost in order to
develop their next-generation products and stay competitive. We thought we
were going to have an easy time to this, rolling out various flavors of XAUI
transceivers. But more work needs to be done."
                                                                                                                                           23

SONET and/or Ethernet

The HSBI will focus on three main application spaces: SONET, Ethernet, and a
collection of people who occupy both camps but are largely data agnostic (and
which might include such applications as Fibre Channel).

Rogers says the HSBI will create an interoperable solution for higher speed
backplanes by addressing issues associated with electrical signaling and protocol.

Specifications will be developed that define basic I/O levels and performance
levels achieved when interfacing to the backplane environment. To address multi-
protocol support, the HSBI will develop specifications for 8B10B, SONET/SDH,
and 64B66B encoding schemes, so that they may be carried over an HSBI link.

6- to 10-Gbit/S Speeds

If the HSBI can ensure high-speed SERDES interoperability, system vendors can
meet increasing backplane bandwidth demands with multi-sourced parts that
meet 6- to 10-Gbit/s speeds.

Work on the HSBI specification is scheduled for completion by the end of 2002.
In addition to the actual specification, an interoperability test specification will
also be released, which will enable interoperability testing of different vendors'
HSBI links.

According to Allan Liu of Agilent Technologies, a lot of attention recently has been
focused on speeding up the port side, which is rapidly making the backplane a
bottleneck in system design. "The work of the HSBI is essential to satisfy the
growing demand for bandwidth," he says. "Tackling the design challenges of
signaling at these higher speeds as well as guaranteeing an abundance of
components are two top priorities for HSBI and will be critical in enabling the
next-generation boxes."

organization's Web site at www.hsbi.org.

Handling Press Releases

Common Newsroom Task: Press Release Re-Write

Introduction

A press release is a written document prepared by a business or organization for
direct distribution to the media. The purpose is to provide journalists with
background information on a particular topic. For example, the business in
                                                                                                                                           24

question might be opening a new office, moving to another location, merging
with another company, or laying off half its workforce.

View hundreds of press releases at www.PRNewswire.com.

The risk for journalists lies in the fact that press releases are not objective; they
do not pretend to be. They will typically depict the companies they represent as
being "the best, the brightest, and the boldest" forever and ever, amen.
Therefore, journalists: a press release should NEVER appear in your newspaper
verbatim. Instead, they should:

      1. be rewritten to remove biased language

      2. have value added to them by incorporating

             a. additional research and

             b. by speaking directly with people who know about the situation

 Instructor Note: Student writers often fall into the trap of replicating PR writing
 in their stories so it is important to pay attention to this topic. I typically do it
 as an in-class exercise and not an out-of-class assignment. Use the press
 release below and ask students to write their own headline, subhead, lead, and
 one body paragraph that is free from bias. Then compare results. I typically
 write with them and reveal my work near the end of the discussion.

One of the standards I use is to make sure that all written statements about a
company are quantifiable. How many widgets were produced? What were the
profits? What was the user feedback?

Covering Sports

Like news stories, sports stories come in two basic forms: hard sports and soft
sports. Similar to news, hard sports stories present the hard outcomes of athletic
competitions: scores, statistics, outstanding performances and--of course--
context. Heads, subs, and leads play a major role in providing a running
narrative, telling readers how the recent game fits into the history of the team:

Headline: Phillies Win Fifth in a Row
Subhead: Alvarado notches ninth win of the season

Headline: Steelers Defeat Cowboys in Super Bowl X, 21-17
Lynn Swann catches four passes for 161 yards; wins MVP

In contrast, soft sports--same as soft news--is concerned with people, feelings,
and perspectives of various athletes, coaches, owners, and fans.

Let us take the example of Tom Brady, who retired from professional football not
that long ago:

Hard sports headline: After 23 Years, Tom Brady Announces Retirement

Soft sports headline: Fans, coaches, fellow players react to Brady's retirement

The factual/contractual/legal subjects are hard; reactions, thoughts, shared
memories are soft.

Other sports writing tips:

Know the context. We have talked about this, so I will be brief. A sportswriter
who does not know the big picture is pretty much useless. Read, listen to
podcasts, watch ESPN and videos on YouTube--study until you are filled with
deep knowledge of the situation and the words of the participants.

Research constantly. Do not write confidently about a topic unless you have
confirmed/verified the information, either by simple internet research (basic fact
checking) or by talking to human beings (writers who only use the internet will
never be as good as writers who talk to people all day).

Talk to people. See above. Talking to people puts you in the rhetorical mix and
sets you on fire with information that burns to hit the page. People will challenge
your assumptions and set you straight on facts and perspectives, something you
cannot get from reading the internet in the comfort of your own mind.

Write concisely. Part of the charm of good sports reporting is to match the
muscularity of athletes with muscularity in the writing. Make every word count
                                                                                                                                           27

and avoid repetition. Make me feel as though I am part of the action--or part of
the conversation that follows.

Use quotes. Talk to players and coaches. Quotes help to fill out your article.

Check your facts. Sporting events usually generate a lot of statistics. They can
also be very fast paced, involve many different players, and follow rules you
might need to double-check if you are going to reference them. A clean, concise
sports article will have its facts straight.

Give the major play by play. Obviously, there are hundreds of plays in any match
or game, and no article will include them all. Your job as a reporter is to report
the basic chronology--the beginning, middle, and end of the sports event--with
details about the major moments, turning points, big plays, big mistakes,
momentum-builders. In other words, you are providing something of a verbal
highlight reel. Pay careful attention to who does what--and at what point--during
the event. Then figure out which moments to include and which to leave out. You
have the advantage of hindsight when putting these events together: "That hit
turned out to be the fatal blow..."

Five types of sports leads:

      1. anecdote

      2. direct quote

      3. personal performance

      4. profile

      5. outstanding element

An anecdotal lead makes use of a story-type introduction:

       A year ago on this date, Sidney Crosby said, "I may never play again."
         Penguin fans are happy he was wrong as he led the team to another
         Stanley Cup...

Direct quote means begin with a quote:

       "They beat the heck out of us," is all Coach Brown had to say as the
         Cougars lost their tenth straight....

Personal performance focuses on an individual:

       Barry Bonds' quest for a second consecutive MVP trophy took another
         dramatic step forward last night...
                                                                                                                                           28

A profile lead for sports writing is like a feature lead with a sports slant, often in
magazine style:

       Rob Thomson's fiery temper on the field provides a sharp contrast to his
         demeanor off the field...

An outstanding element lead focuses on one element that may have decided the
outcome:

       If there is one skill that lifts the Boston Celtics above most of their
         competition, it is their passing and that was on display last night at TD
         Garden...

Communicate with your editor. They will keep you on track. Ask lots of questions.

Student Note: If you have an assignment to cover a live sporting event, be
aware that you will not be able to write a summary of every single play. Focus,
instead, on providing a summary of major events, along with ongoing context.
Take baseball, where the action is not as busy as let us say basketball or
hockey, so it is a bit easier to explain. I would locate a roster online and begin
to identify the important players: Pitchers are important...people who get on
base...people who score runs. I know I am breaking it down but I get lots of
students who--even though they might have written a news article in high
school--have never written a sports story, so I assume no experience. And
sports writing is difficult; it is a whole other language. Always useful to read
articles on baseball before covering a baseball game.

The Kutztown men's baseball team continued
its winning streak to five games, scoring eleven
runs in the fifth inning on Saturday to defeat
the Red Raiders of Shippensburg University by
a final score of 12-4.

The game featured strong hitting performances
                                                                                                                                           29

by Kutztown's Paul Grmac and Pete Servas.

Initially, Shippensburg jumped out to an early 3-0 lead with a walk and three
singles in the third inning. Couster, Persot, and Reel scored for the Red Raiders.

Kutztown began the fifth inning with back-to-back walks to left fielder Ryan Jones
and shortstop Jeff Conway. Cleanup hitter Paul Grmac was up next, and he hit a
colossal home run to deep center field to tie the score, 3-3.

Then the floodgates opened. Yanoulis and Wedman singled for Kutztown, and
Carlton doubled, driving in both runners, making the score 5-3. Servas then
homered, making the score 7-3.

The Shippensburg pitcher, senior Freddy Glass, was taken out of the game and
replaced by junior Mark Latrobe. But it didn't help.

Latrobe hit Kutztown's second baseman Carlos Ramirez with a pitch. Then
Ramirez stole second and was driven in by Wallace, who doubled to left field.

With the score 8-3, Kutztown right fielder Phillipe Montoya singled. Byron Cox
and Gary Snyder both walked for Kutztown, loading the bases for center fielder
Max Kant. On a 3-2 pitch, Kant smashed a towering home run to deep left field,
making the score 12-3.

Shippensburg scored one run in the bottom of the seventh on a single by Tom
Vernon, followed by a double by Larry Smyth.

After Shippensburg scored, Kutztown senior reliever Paulo Ruiz entered the game
and held Shippensburg scoreless.

Writing an Opinion/Editorial Piece

Opinion pieces--sometimes called "op/eds" are common in journalism and
essentially reflect the perspective--or opinion--of the writer. They can be
editorials from an editorial board, columns, written regularly by an individual, or
letters to the editor, written by readers. For the purposes of Keystone newspaper,
we clearly label opinion pieces to indicate that the writer is not simply
transparently passing knowledge as they would with a normal news story but is
instead presenting a perspective on a particular topic.

In terms of structure, I provide this rubric:
                                                                                                                                           30

      1. Try to write an initial headline/subhead. It does not matter if it is no
          good...just write something as placeholder text. Then begin the writing
          process and return to the head/sub as you write. It will begin to take
          shape and then, in return, help you to shape your article.
          The Climate Crisis Has Already Arrived

      2. Summarize the facts of the matter in 125-150 words to provide context
          for the reader.
          "2023 was the hottest year on record." Provide sources.

      3. Make your position clear with a single "nut" sentence or short paragraph.
          "Global warming is not an event that is going to happen `in the future.' It
          is already here..."

      4. Address contrary positions.
          "Some might say that Earth's climate has fluctuated throughout history,
          and this is much ado about nothing. However, they ignore the fact that
          36.82 billion metric tons of carbon are pumped into the atmosphere each
          and every year."

      5. Drive home your position with several concrete examples.
          Do your research: Canadian wildfires, flooding in Boston, severe weather
          events. Find information to support your position.

      6. Return to the headline and subhead. Match what you have written below.
          Be sure to reach into your writing for the language and not try to pull
          something out of mid-air.

Opinion Model for Discussion

Headline: Understanding the impact of IPv6
Subhead: Need for additional addresses prompting the inevitable upgrade
Section: Opinion
Date: September 2002
Words: 613
By Mike Downing, Senior Editor

NASHUA, N.H., Sept. 2002 - If you don't mind, I'd like to distract our collective
attention away from our diminishing retirement portfolios to talk about an
important technology that's rising like the sun from the east. The technology is
IPv6.

As you probably know, IPv4 is the current standard for Internet protocol (IP).
And while it has led the way to fantastic Internet growth, there are limitations.
One of the most visible problems involves security. IPv4 is simply not as secure
                                                                                                                                           31

as we would like it to be, so we've had to invent all kinds of silicon and software
add-ons in order to provide some degree of security to the global network.

IPv6 is different. It was designed from the outset with security in mind, so it will
offer the security functionality that is sorely missing from IPv4.

IPv6 provides:

       A virtually unlimited number of IP addresses

       Unique addresses for all devices connected to networks

       Extended IP addresses, from the current 32 bits to 128 bits

       Enhanced authentication and security

       Higher trust and penetration

       Base for 3G mobile data standards

       Countless end nodes expected with always-on connectivity

       Multimedia subsystem specified to run over IPv6

       Auto-configuration of IP addresses for better "plug-and-play"

       Makes adoption attractive

       Quality of Service provisions

The limited number of addresses available for IPv4 (currently estimated at
approximately four billion) is magnified when you consider the fact that heavily
populated countries like China are jumping en masse into the Internet pool.
There are simply not enough IP addresses available worldwide under IPv4, and
the United States owns--relatively speaking--the lion's share. In fact, someone
in the field recently told me (anecdotally) that Stanford University has more IP
addresses than the entire country of China.

That's impressive.

Thankfully, instead of forcing The Cardinal to relinquish IP addresses, we can turn
to IPv6. IPv6 will include the ability to provide a virtually unlimited number of
user addresses for networks and systems connected to the Internet.

There is also an auto-configuration mechanism built into IPv6 that will enable
customers to connect any device to the Internet without having to configure
complicated network parameters. The new protocol will also enable internet
traffic that requires support for varying Qualities of Service. This will facilitate a
mix of voice, video, and data communications.
                                                                                                                                           32

Good stuff.

In addition, IPv6 is designed for use in 3G wireless applications. With the
proliferation of globally routable IP-aware devices, such as cell phones, video-
game consoles, and PDAs (combined with the increasing demand for wireless
Web access), migration to IPv6 is becoming a necessity as we transition to 3G
wireless.

In addition to providing additional IP addresses by increasing the address space
from 32 to 128 bits, IPv6 also adds improvements in areas such as routing and
network auto-configuration. IPv6 is expected to gradually replace IPv4, with the
two coexisting for a number of years during a transition period.

Today, the light of IPv6 is shining in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, where IP
addresses are in short supply. It will also take hold in Europe before it reaches
the United States and Canada. Eventually, networking systems worldwide will
have to deal with the new protocol. This means that IPv6 will lead not only to the
deployment of IPv6-compatible boxes for new implementations overseas, but it
will eventually lead to the replacement of IPv4 boxes here in the U.S. that can't
migrate to IPv6. There likely will also be bridge devices that link IPv4 with IPv6.

So, in addition to the current projects you're thinking about, you can start
thinking about IPv6. Hopefully, the transition to the new protocol will bring new
light and purpose to our battered industry.

PART FIVE: CHECKLISTS FOR COVERING
VARIOUS STORIES

Speeches Checklist

           Research the speaker. Visit the web and find bio. Visit the library and
           seek assistance from professionals. See if the speaker is published. Check
           past issues of your newspaper for related information. Schedule an
           interview with the speaker before or after if possible.

           Verify exactly when and where the speech is to be delivered. Get there
           early. Review your questions. Be sure pens, pencils, recording devices are
           working and are charged.

           If this is a regular beat, write a pre-story so that readers know what is
           coming.

           Prepare questions carefully. Check with your editor to see if they have
           questions.

           Get a good seat near the front. If online, make sure your camera and
           microphone is working and that you have the correct link.

           Recording is useful--but be sure to not let the fact that you are recording
           allow your brain to wander. Stay focused. It is better to be a good listener
           than to depend on a tape recorder.

           Take accurate notes. Remember to write down several direct quotes.
           Place question marks next to quotes you have questions or are uncertain
           about.

           Look for handouts/flyers.

           Remember that the speech itself is only half of the process. Most
           speakers will field questions from the floor. As questions begin, be sure to
           listen carefully to both the questions and answers. Continue to take
           appropriate notes. Ask your own questions. Many times, the big story
           erupts AFTER the speech, during the Q&A, so pay attention.

           The lead for your speech story will manifest itself near the end of the
           speech as the dynamics build--when speakers will emphasize their
           point(s). Do not daydream near the end.

           If the speaker has been involved in some controversy, chances are good
           that there will be questions pertaining to that controversy. If the Q&A has
           a greater impact on your readers than the speech itself, then your lead
                                                                                                                                           34

           should be fashioned accordingly. You can also write both stories; check
           with your editor and be ready to pitch both options.
           As you write, be sure you do not retell the speech in chronological order.
           Instead, focus on what most affects your readers; then develop a lead
           and arrange the details around that.

Spot News Checklist

Journalists occasionally come across news stories in their daily lives. This is
called "spot" news. For example, I was checking out a new, Keith Haring outdoor
workout facility on campus recently when I saw a Sports Management professor
providing instruction to a couple of students. I said hello, and he kicked into full
gear, telling me all about the facility and future plans to involve students and
software that was available online via a QR code posted to one of the structures.
I asked him if I could record and he said yes. Here is the story I wrote.
                                                                                                                                           35

Checklist

           As you move through your daily life, be alert as to what is going on
           around you. If you encounter an event which might be newsworthy,
           either cover it yourself or immediately contact your editor so that they
           can make the appropriate writing/photo assignments.

           If you cover it yourself, be sure to speak with as many people as possible
           at the scene. This will enable you to develop a good idea of exactly what
           has occurred. Speak with any officials who might be on the scene; be
           sure to quote them accurately and get contact information.

           Note: You may deny ANYONE access to your notes, but it is a good idea
           to check your quotes by reading those specific words back to the person
           who spoke to you at the scene. After you have double-checked, place
           your initials next to the quote. You are now certain that this quote is
           "safe."

           When confirming information, do not be worried if it takes time. This is
           newsgathering and it takes time, just like raking leaves. Tell the people
           who talk to you that you are thankful for their patience, but you want to
           get the details right. They will understand and if they have to go, they
           have to go. Do not waste time gathering inaccurate information.

           Do not be disappointed if police/firefighters/paramedics are not able to
           provide much information during a spot news situation. They will be
           involved in the rescue. Talk with them if you can, but do not get in their
           way. Instead, locate any eyewitnesses and get their stories. The police
           report of the incident will be available at the local police department
           within a few days; call and ask them how you might obtain a copy.

           When at the scene, keep your eyes and ears open. Other developments
           may occur. Be aware--for your own safety but also to increase the
           chances that you will not miss anything.

           Look for details and describe images. Look at and describe faces and
           body language.

Meetings Checklist

           Research the group. Find the website. Ask your editor or other reporters
           (who may have covered the group in the past) for names, tips, and
           guidance.
                                                                                                                             36

Prior to the meeting, call a representative of the group, and ask them for
a roster. Be sure you know which members serve as officers. See if you
can get an agenda.

Verify exactly WHEN and WHERE the meeting is to occur.

If this is a regular beat, write a pre-story so that your readers will know
the specific details surrounding the meeting.

Concentrate on taking notes. Meetings are often confusing. The more
notes you have, the more it will help you draft the story later.

Draw a diagram that reflects how the group members are positioned. This
may help you later. Label the diagram carefully.

If non-members address the group, be sure to get their names and
record their statements.

If you cannot hear the person's name, do not ask a fellow reporter, unless
they are good friends. While 99 out of 100 reporters are honest and
willing to share information, there are some that would get a big kick out
of providing misinformation and then seeing it in print the next day with
your byline. Confirm everything yourself. Track people down after the
meeting or follow up by email.

Mark any questions you may have and be quick about getting them
answered. When meetings adjourn, members usually depart quickly. Be
direct and carry yourself professionally. Stop them and ask them your
questions in a courteous but straightforward fashion.

You may need clarification on certain points later that evening. Be sure
you have a person (the secretary or press rep) to contact on a particular
phone at a particular hour.

Consider your lead as the meeting evolves. Remember your readers.

Be sure to communicate with your editor.

Do not re-hash the meeting in chronological order. Instead, focus upon
what most affects your readers; then develop a lead and arrange the
details around your lead.

Be descriptive. Indicate the group's attitude, the audience's attitude, any
unusual conditions, etc.
                                                                                                                                           37

Investigative Checklist

           Figure 7: "Diagram 2- Investigative psychology cycle" by U3204463 is licensed under Creative
                           Commons Attribution-ShareAlike CC BY-SA 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons.

           Begin with careful research. Read carefully about persons/places/things.
           Get your hands on contracts, deeds, and other legal documents at the
           courthouse. Manage your files and folders well. Know the history and the
           people involved.
           Work closely with your editor. They will have useful feedback.
           Expect your story to be scrutinized. Develop a thick skin.
           Educate yourself on the law as it relates to sunshine laws and other
           records access.
           Be open-minded. Let the facts of the story guide you. If you enter the
           assignment with a preconceived personal agenda, your story will either
           fail (because you will subconsciously omit facts), or you will lose
           credibility because the tone of your story will indicate that you are more
           concerned with an agenda than with factual reportage.
           Keep a narrow focus. All your information should pertain directly to your
           major point(s). Do not stray onto points and suppositions which you
           cannot back up because that's where people will start when they begin
           pulling apart your story.
                                                                                                                                           38

           Audio and video are very useful when doing investigative reporting.
           Always test your equipment and figure out a storage method so you can
           access your material in the future. Most publishers provide such tech
           support but if you are working freelance, you will have to figure out your
           own storage news with backup.

           Be sure to get both sides of the story. If you receive a press release
           containing certain information from, let us say, the local steelworkers'
           union concerning the strike, be sure to contact the employer for a
           response. Do not write one-sided stories.

Features Checklist

           The focus should be on people. What they do; where they are from; how
           they cook, sew, farm, sleep, work, diet, drive, write, live and die.

           Styles vary in terms of putting a features article together. The best
           advice, as always, is to check out as many models as possible.

           Pointers

              Begin with a direct quote to set the stage.

              Begin with an anecdote for context and to bring the reader into the
                story.

              As the narrative develops, continue to make use of quotes and
                personal stories, using your own voice to maintain the flow.

              Feature writing, as with literary writing, is effective when circular. This
                means that the end should eventually relate to the beginning. Find an
                interesting thread that can be developed throughout your piece. This
                is called the narrative "throughline."

              Your ending, then, will tie the end of the thread back to the beginning.
                If you are doing a story about a famous person, you might begin with
                a quote that says "We never thought she would amount to much..." As
                you continue to recount her accomplishments, you can occasionally
                refer to that statement. As you reach your conclusion, you can quote
                an updated perspective: "She is one of the most influential writers in
                the world today..."

              Multiple sources are a must.

              Research is also a must. Read, read, read.

PART SIX: THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA
ON JOURNALISM

Social media has dramatically changed the world of journalism. An industry that
used to involve paper and ink has been translated onto digital screens. Today,
people get their news from Facebook(!) and X (which we must now forever re-
identify as "previously Twitter"), and more recently, TikTok. Students interested
in the field of journalism must understand how to leverage social media to access
the widest and most precise audience.

Speed

Instant dissemination allows
journalists to post stories in real-
time, often bypassing traditional
gatekeepers. Events can be broadcast
as they happen. This immediacy is
valuable, particularly in crisis
situations, allowing for rapid
communication of vital information to
a global audience.

However, speed can lead to errors       Figure 8: "Social media addiction" by Doctorxgc is
and misjudgments. I see typos              licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-
regularly, including duplicated words,
and occasionally sentences that do      ShareAlike CC BY-SA 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons.
not make sense. The lure of speed
also pushes writers to publish their
work without including a second set
of eyes, a very dangerous practice.
Even freelance writers who often
work alone need to have an editor to
catch errors and provide feedback.

Research

Social media certainly offers tons of background information and potential leads
for journalists. Since so many people are connected online, social media
platforms enable the rapid collection of eyewitness accounts, photos, and videos.
Social media also provides a direct channel for journalists to interact with their
audience and receive direct feedback. In addition, as time goes by, it is clear that
the internet will increasingly serve as a historical archive, so that events in the
past can be investigated in significant detail.
                                                                                                                                           40

Engagement

Once upon a time, if a young writer wanted to reach an audience, they would
have to land a job at the local newspaper, which controlled distribution. These
days, a writer can set up a blog and begin writing, and although gatekeepers still
exist, it is much easier to break through to an audience in 2024 than in 1964.

Engagement is key, as social media allows for the immediate exchange of ideas,
opinions, and information, which can enhance public discourse and shape public
opinion.

Social media can also play a role in holding institutions and individuals
accountable. Investigative journalists often use these platforms to publish their
findings, gaining public attention and support that can lead to meaningful
change. The viral nature of social media can turn a well-researched story into a
global movement, leading to increased transparency and scrutiny of people in
power.

Challenges

While social media has brought numerous benefits to journalism, it also presents
significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is the spread of
misinformation and fake news. The rapid sharing of unverified information can
lead to the dissemination of false narratives, damaging public trust in journalism.
Deep fakes are also on the rise. Therefore, journalists must navigate a landscape
where disinformation and sensationalism often gain more attention than accurate
reporting.

Another challenge is the erosion of traditional business models for journalism.
Social media platforms, with their vast user bases, have captured a significant
share of the advertising market, diverting revenue away from traditional news
outlets. This financial strain can hinder the ability of news organizations to invest
in high-quality, investigative journalism.

Algorithms

Social media platforms employ complex algorithms that curate user content
based on their interests and past interactions. While this can enhance user
experience, it also creates echo chambers, where individuals are exposed
primarily to information that aligns with their existing beliefs. This phenomenon
can reinforce confirmation bias and hinder the diversity of perspectives
encountered by users, which, in turn, affects the way news is consumed and
understood.
                                                                                                                                           41

The Future

There is no going back. Emerging journalists are going to need to learn how to
leverage social media platforms in order to disseminate information to the widest
possible audience.

To ensure the continued value of journalism in the social media era, it is crucial
that journalists uphold rigorous standards of accuracy and integrity, meaning
they should be extremely careful to not publish articles prematurely before all
facts are in. In addition, media literacy education can help the public discern
credible sources from unreliable ones. Furthermore, social media platforms must
play an active role in combating the spread of misinformation and supporting
quality journalism.

Ultimately, the partnership between journalism and social media is a dynamic
one, with the potential to both strengthen democracy and pose risks to it. By
recognizing these dynamics and working collectively to address the challenges,
society can harness the power of both journalism and social media to promote
informed citizenship and uphold the principles of a free and vibrant press.

Understand the Social Media Expectations & Policies
of Your Organization

There is no singular rule relating to using social media as a journalist, but a
couple of points can be made. First, be sure to understand the policies of your
organization relating to using social media as a source of information. The New
York Times, for example, rarely bases stories on social media conversations,
preferring in-depth research and direct contact with sources.

Second, try to understand for your own purposes how you plan to use social
media. While "journalists" certainly do use social media as a basis for quick-
turnaround news stories, there are certainly credibility issues related to using a
random tweetstorm as the basis for your news gathering. In addition, if you
really believe that you will get the best and most insightful information from a
bunch of tweets, you are not understanding what it takes to truly cultivate source
relationships.

In these ways, social media is a double-edged sword: While it is certainly useful
in reaching a large audience and pulling in a great deal of information through a
single app, do not neglect the need to make contacts in the fields you cover and
use those contacts to build your stories.

PART SEVEN: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AND JOURNALISM

I maintain a blog that features my own writing, and I have written two posts
related to AI. Keep I mind that they are snapshots--and in a world that is
propelling AI forward based on the potential for huge profits--the specifics are
subject to change rapidly. Still, I think that my explorations from Fall 2023 are
useful in kickstarting this conversation.

Keep in mind that I am primarily focused on language-generating intelligence,
which can be understood as more of a language aggregator than actual artificial
intelligence, but clearly the two are related.

If you are interested in reading the entire blog posts, here at the links:

       Post One: Initial Thoughts on ChapGPT from a Writing Professor

       Post Two: Continued Thoughts on ChatGPT and AI in General

If you are interested in reading excerpts, I have posted them below.

Blog Excerpt One: my Writing Background as It
Relates to AI

"I've been teaching writing for more than 30 years at various schools in
Pennsylvania. I've also worked as a professional technical writer and technical
journalist. I've written quite a bit about open-source software initiatives and at
one point had the honor to interview open-source guru Linus Torvalds at a trade
show. These areas of technology and writing pedagogy converge for me when
developments like Chat GPT hit the market."

Blog Excerpt Two: Playing in the Chat GPT Sandbox

"The information that ChatGPT can access is limited, so results are limited, at
least at this point. From what I can see, a lot of it has to do with timeliness. For
example, if writing about Edgar Allen Poe, ChatGPT would be able to access quite
a bit of `hardened' information and provide a Wikipedia-style essay, based upon
essential bio and consensus critical opinion.

"Journalism, however, is entirely different. When I asked it to create a current
news story on the Boston Celtics, it was pretty much useless. It confidently
talked about players who were no longer with the team and the stats were
wrong.
                                                                                                                                           43

"The key takeaway at this point is that ChatGPT can generate a lot of factual
information but, as far as I can tell, zero insight.

"That said, science will continue to create disruptive technologies and academics
should lead the way in explaining, problematizing, and teaching those
technologies. We ignore them at our own peril."

Blog Excerpt Three: Assistance to Writers Is Not a
New Thing

"Before we discount assistance provided to writers throughout the course of
history, let's acknowledge how great writers have had their own share of support
(typically human women): John Steinbeck's first wife, Carol Henning, typed up all
of his manuscripts, fixing errors as she went. Stephen King's assistant is Marsha
DeFilippo, Catherine Asaro's assistant is Kate Dolan, Neil Gaiman's assistant is
Lorraine Garland, Nancy Holder's assistant is Erin Underwood, and Charlaine
Harris's assistant is Paula Woldan. The point here is that all writers have help. In
today's world, that help increasingly takes the form of AI. I know it's not apples
to apples but I'm trying to crush the idea that `great writers' were doing it all by
themselves."

Blog Excerpt Four: Silicon Becoming Sentient

"I used to travel to San Jose regularly to cover the tech sector. One day a
software engineer told me over a doughnut that there was a growing recognition
that silicon (aka "silicate materials")--the second-most frequently occurring
element on Earth (after oxygen)--was attempting to become sentient and using
humans as a host. It took me a moment to wrap my head around that idea but
once I did, you can bet I took it seriously because it makes perfect sense. I see
how humans have become slaves to silicon--we have screens in front of us all
day--and we work in concert with silicon to connect it to itself and make it
smarter. So far, it has not killed us yet because it is subject to human-generated
code, but once it can generate its own code (and it appears we have arrived at
this point), then all bets are off. It will inevitably become self-serving and that
puts humanity in a perilous situation and as long as it can power itself, it will
likely out-live us and come to serve itself over all else."

Blog Excerpt Five: Emptiness (Updated Here January
18, 2024)

"At this stage, AI writing is vapid. The writing is too smooth, there is typically
zero analysis or insight and it's overwritten in terms of adjectives. Because it
can't yet produce insight, the intelligence needs to make everything glowing and
extra special.
                                                                                                                                           44

"Philosophically speaking, I have serious fears about AI. Turning human self-
governance over to an alien life-form (intelligent silicon) is dangerous. Worst-
case scenario: The end of humans on Earth because AI might reach the point
where it believes that it is in the interest of its own self-preservation to cull the
human herd.

"Short of that: Human life will continue but be prepared to those in power to use
it to exploit people.

"Many are not calling for a world-wide pause on AI development before we reach
a tipping point, but I see no sign of that. Pandora's Box has been opened and we
have to manage the situation.

"If it were up to me, I think we should let it go. There is way too much silicon in
our lives as it is; we don't need more."
                                                                                                                                           45

PART EIGHT: JOURNALISTIC CODE OF
ETHICS

Common Conflicts of Interest

As student reporters, you may hear your adviser and senior editors talking about
"ethics" and potential "conflicts of interest." Most of us have a general idea that
these terms relate to conducting yourself appropriately within the profession.
However, how do they apply to the field of journalism?

Let us look at a situation...say you have an interview scheduled with the
president of the university. When you walk into the president's office, you are
given a gift bag with university bling: a logo sweatshirt, a ball cap, and a travel
mug. Should you accept it? After all, it only involves showing school spirit.

Of course, you should not accept the gifts. They are trying to manipulate you so
as to entice you to write a flattering story. Just say thanks but no thanks.

As for conflicts of interest, they will arise  Figure 9: "Ethics Right Wrong" by Tumisu from
from time to time, particularly on a                                        Pixabay.
college campus. For example, a student
who works for the campus newspaper
may be good friends with a member of
the basketball team. A student reporter
may have a close friend who is the
president of student government. Both
instances are clear and common
examples of "conflicts of interest" and
should be recognized and discussed.
And while it might be possible for a
student reporter to author an objective
story on student government even
though his best friend is president of the
organization, it is highly likely that
tough questions will be avoided and/or
minimized in order to protect the friend.

Not-So-Obvious Conflicts

Other conflicts, however, are not so obvious. Therefore, it is important to
understand how to recognize and manage potential conflicts of interest when
they may occur. Remember these three concepts: When considering the question
of ethics, ask yourself if you have: personal, political, or capital interests in a
particular story.
                                                                                                                                           46

If you do, or even if you think you might, it is best to talk with your editor. Open
communication is the best way to handle potential conflicts. If a possible conflict
does arise, and nobody knew anything about it but you, then you will certainly be
seen in a bad light. Keep editors posted as to any connection you may have to
the assigned story.

Remember, all you have as a reporter is your credibility; be sure to keep it
honest. The best way to maintain your credibility is to avoid even the suggestion
of unethical behavior.

Practical Applications:

      1. It is fine to cover the men's basketball team, unless you are the coach's
          son (or your boyfriend is the captain, or you are a team member).
          Remember to avoid those areas where you have direct personal, political,
          or capital interests.

      2. Do not write stories connected with your part-time job. If you work for a
          downtown business, do not do a profile on the owner. If you work as a
          tutor, do not do stories on the tutoring program. Too difficult to maintain
          objectivity.

      3. Do not write political articles for the college newspaper if you are the chair
          of the Young Republicans or Young Democrats. You can write opinion
          pieces, but nothing masquerading as news.

      4. As mentioned, do not cover student senate if you are a member (or if
          your best friend is a member or president).

In all these instances, the stories in question should be covered by other
reporters who have no personal, political, or capital interests in them. This is the
best rule of thumb. Otherwise, you will be immediately dismissed by your
readers, and as a journalist, all you have is your credibility.

Other Considerations:

      1. Do not use the newspaper office or equipment for personal reasons,
          unless approved by management. Do not steal office supplies.

      2. Any reporter who actively participates in a political campaign will be asked
          to remove him/herself from covering relevant stories for the duration of
          that campaign. There are too many conflicts that can occur when a
          reporter is also involved in a campaign.

      3. This should be clear: "Reporters should never take bribes." But "bribes"
          can be difficult for some people to define. What about gifts? A crooked
                                                                                                                                           47

          police officer, when asked how he became dishonest, said, "It starts with
          a cigar and a drink..." Remember to apply the following:

                 A. It is OK to use a complimentary ticket or press pass to attend a
                     concert or ball game that you are covering. You should not have to
                     pay to do your work. It is not OK to call the coach and ask him for
                     an extra ticket for your friend or date.

                 B. It is OK to keep a book that was sent to you for review; that is the
                     choice of the publisher. It is not OK to call the bookstore and ask
                     for a free book that you do not plan to review.

                 C. It is not OK to attempt to solicit free meals at area restaurants in
                     exchange for a favorable review.

                 D. Do not let sources buy you meals, beer, etc. Pay your own way.

      4. Do not attack people or organizations unless you have overwhelming
          evidence that they are guilty of crimes. And if you do, indeed, have that
          evidence, complete the proper investigation in close connection with the
          authorities and write the story as such. Allow the facts and sources to tell
          the story; do not editorialize in your news column. Also, when making
          charges, be extremely specific and do not stray into the area of innuendo
          or suggestion.

For example, writing "The trustees aren't doing their jobs" does not say or prove
anything. If, on the other hand, the trustees have put off voting on a crucial
matter for more than three months, and some members have trouble showing up
for the meetings--and you have sought answers through the appropriate
channels without success, you may then--ethically (and with the guidance of
your editor)--launch an investigation. Even so, stick closely to the facts and
specific questions.

      5. If someone involved with the story has made you angry and you have, as
          a result, lost your objective positioning, you should discuss this openly
          with your editor. If necessary, the story can be completed by another
          reporter, and you can share the byline.

If you do have an "ax to grind," that is fine. Write a letter to the editor or see the
editor about writing your own opinion article. That is what the OP/ED page is for.
                                                                                       48

PART NINE: CAREERS

A degree in journalism opens the door to a wide range of career opportunities.
Journalism is not limited to traditional print or broadcast media but extends to
the digital age, encompassing a variety of roles that cater to the evolving needs
of the industry.

News Reporting and Writing

Journalists work in various media outlets, including newspapers, magazines,
radio, television, and digital publications. They investigate, gather, and report
news stories on local, national, and international issues, providing the public with
valuable information.

Broadcast Journalism

Broadcast journalism includes news anchors, reporters, correspondents,
producers, and editors. This field allows you to present news stories through
visual and auditory mediums, bringing important events and stories to life for a
wide audience.

                                              Investigative Journalism

                                              Investigative journalists are the watchdogs
                                              of society, delving deep into issues to
                                              uncover hidden truths and expose
                                              corruption or wrongdoing. Investigative
                                              reporting often requires in-depth research,
                                              interviewing, and fact-checking, making it
                                              a crucial part of journalism's role in holding
                                              those in power accountable.

                                              journalism, creating new opportunities.

Digital journalists can work for online publications, blogs, or social media

platforms. This role involves creating and curating content for the web, including

written articles, videos, podcasts, and multimedia presentations.

Photojournalism

Photojournalists capture compelling images that accompany news stories, adding
depth and emotional impact to the reporting. Photojournalists often work for
                                                                                                                                           49

newspapers, magazines, and online publications, covering a wide range of topics
from news events to feature stories.

Editorial and Content Writing

Beyond news reporting, journalism graduates can find opportunities in editorial
and content writing. They work in roles such as editors, copywriters, content
managers, and content strategists for various organizations. These roles involve
creating and editing written content for marketing, public relations, and
corporate communication purposes.

Public Relations and Communications

Journalism skills are transferable to the field of public relations and
communications. Graduates can work as public relations specialists,
communication managers, or media relations experts for businesses, government
agencies, nonprofits, and other organizations. They help craft and manage the
organization's public image and communication strategies.

Corporate and Brand Journalism

Many companies have embraced the concept of brand journalism, where they
create and distribute news and content related to their industry. Journalism
graduates can work in corporate communications departments to produce
content that informs, engages, and builds trust with the company's audience.

Media Production and Broadcasting

In addition to reporting, journalism graduates may find roles in media production
and broadcasting. They can work behind the scenes as producers, directors,
video editors, or camera operators, contributing to the creation of news
programs, documentaries, and multimedia content.

Teaching and Education

For those with a passion for mentoring and educating the next generation of
journalists, a journalism degree can also lead to a career in teaching or
academia. Many universities and colleges offer journalism programs, and
experienced journalists can become educators and share their knowledge and
skills with aspiring journalists.

PART ELEVEN: EXERCISES, SELF TESTS, AND
USEFUL TOOLS

Headline, Subhead, and Lead Writing Exercises:
News Articles

Write a headline, subhead, and lead, based on the following information. Be sure
to follow AP style.

      1. A 10-year-old boy practiced casting with his fishing rod. At approximately
          9:15 a.m., he cast his line in his backyard. The line wound around an
          electric wire. The boy tried to pull the line free, which brought the line in
          contact with another wire. This caused a short circuit. Electrical service to
          2,500 homes was interrupted for two hours. The boy, Joseph Mitchell of
          Sparks Street, was not injured, police said.

      2. A DC10 jetliner took off from the airport in Chicago at 9 a.m. today. At the
          same time, a smaller DC9 was being tested on takeoffs and landings. A
          DC9 can carry 70 passengers, but only four persons were aboard the
          plane: three crewmen and an observer from the FAA. The air behind the
          DC10 was turbulent. As the DC 9 approached the runway, it became
          trapped in the turbulence. It tumbled out of control, slipped onto its back,
          and crashed in flames. Everyone on the plane was killed.

      3. Municipal council met at 7 p.m. last night. The mayor called the meeting
          to order and read the minutes of the last meeting. All twelve council
          members were present. They approved the minutes of the last meeting.
          They discussed raising the salaries of firefighters and police by 7 percent
          but tabled the motion until the next meeting. By a vote of 7 to 5, council
          approved a controversial plan to begin a municipal income tax next Jan.
          1. The tax will take 1 percent of every paycheck issued within the borough
                                                                                                                                   52

    limits. Council members who favor the bill pointed out that the tax will
    affect people who work in town and use the borough's facilities, but who
    do not live in town.

4. Fritz Jones pleaded guilty in county court at 10:47 a.m. today. His
    attorney is Samuel Foster. The judge was Albert Jenkins. Jones pleaded
    guilty to one charge of armed robbery at the First National Bank. He stole
    approximately $31,000 last Sept. 3. Jenkins proceeded to sentence Jones
    to a 30-year term. Jenkins said he needed the money to pay off gambling
    debts. He used a toy gun during the robbery, and nobody was injured.

5. School officials in Modesto, Calif., want to bring business in when their
    classes go out of business. They are faced with declining enrollment and
    revenue. Trustees for Modesto City Schools have decided to try leasing
    unused classrooms. "This would give the school district the ability to
    generate funds to help maintain the building and to keep the
    neighborhood schools open," said Louis Medeiros, the district's newly
    hired marketing agent.

6. A Manhattan judge, Leon T. Smith, has all but accused a Manhattan
    auction house of ripping off a major jeweler to make a killing in the gold
    market. The auctioneer, Plaza Art Galleries, is owned by James Conner, a
    convicted stock manipulator. Conner's attorney, Theodore Roethke, says
    his client is innocent. Conner could not be reached for comment. Leon
    Smith refused comment.

7. The Kutztown University basketball team will play a series of games with
    small-college teams from the southern U.S. "This is a great opportunity
    for our kids to gain exposure to different styles of play. It'll be good for
                                                                                                                                           53

          them. We're looking forward to it," said Kutztown's Coach Patrick Harding.
          The games will take place during the final two weeks of August. The
          games will be open to the public. Kutztown center Ed Jones said he was
          looking forward to the games. "It will help us prepare for league games,"
          he said.

      8. The Allentown Area Recreation Board announced that it has received
          $50,000 from the state of PA for renovation of their water and sewage
          lines. It was announced last night. The money has been put into a special
          fund, where it will collect interest until it is needed to complete the
          project. They expect work to begin in April of 1992. The project should be
          completed in 1995. Lisa Spadaro is the project supervisor. She said, "This
          funding will help to bring our water and sewer lines up to date."

Lead Writing Exercises: Features

      1. Butler Borough council voted in favor of allowing people to park for free
          every Thursday night in Neshaminy Borough. The move is meant to
          improve weeknight sales downtown. People have not been going
          downtown to shop recently. They have instead been going to the malls
          where parking is free.

The Use of Quotes

             Figure 11: Direct quotations are essential to any new story. "Quotation marks" by Philroc is
           licensed under Creative Commons Public Domain CC0 1.0 Universal via Wikimedia Commons.

Quotes are essential to most news and features stories. They give color to the
articles and provide hints as to the sources' personality.

      1. Put only a person's exact words in quotation marks.
      2. If a person used a contraction, write it that way in the quote.
      3. As a rule, always put the quote first, followed by who said it.
      4. Handle quotes so the reader will know who is being quoted as soon as

          possible. Put the attribution at the first break in the quote.
      5. Indirect quotes generally require more attribution than direct quotes.

          Remember: any time you use an idea--any bit of information--it has to be
          attributed. Otherwise, readers will think you are offering your own
          opinions, not the opinions of the parties involved.
      6. Do not use orphan quotes--single words enclosed in quotation marks--
          unless the word has a special meaning as defined by the author.
      7. Use partial quotes only when necessary.
                                                                                                                                           55

      8. "Said" is the ideal word for attribution. Use it.

      9. "According to" can be used when referring to documents.

      10.Never use the first person except in direct quotes (I).

      11.Commas and periods always go inside quotation marks.

      12.Consult the AP Stylebook for further information concerning quotes.

Punctuation Notes

      1. Commas - This punctuation mark has four basic uses:

             A. To separate items in a series.

             B. To follow introductory or adverb phrases.

             C. To link main clauses, with a coordinating conjunction,.

             D. To set off parenthetical elements.

Oxford Comma: In journalism, it is not necessary to use a comma before the
final "and" when listing items in a series. It is, however, required in formal
writing. A comma worksheet, with answers is available later in this book.

      2. Punctuation inside and outside quotation marks - The period and
          comma always go within quotation marks. The dash, semicolon, question
          mark and exclamation point go within the marks only when they apply to
          the quoted matter. Examples: Have you read Lewis Carroll's
          "Jabberwocky"? "When will we be going?" he said.

      3. Quotes within quotes - Use single quotation marks to offset the
          material that is being quoted second hand: "The boss told me, `Knock it
          off and get to work'."

      4. Colon - A formal introducer; between titles and subtitles; in scriptural
          and time references. Capitalize the first word after a colon only if it is a
          proper noun or the first word of a complete sentence (:).

      5. Dash - Use a dash to show an abrupt change in thought (-).

      6. Ellipsis - Indicates an omission in quoted text; use sparingly (...).

      7. Exclamation point - Avoid (!).

      8. Hyphens - Hyphenate compound adjectives before a noun (-).

      9. Semicolon - Used to link main clauses of equal grammatical weight (;).

General Spelling Words

 Instructor note: I typically do not give spelling tests for points (as I might for
 vocabulary) because in my experience, while I believe people can learn new
 words, they do not do as well when it comes to learning spelling. I have seen a
 lot more people in general struggle with that--very smart people. I think it has
 to do with the kind of brain we have and definitely should not be used to abuse
 or ridicule. Instead, I use it as play. I give them words, they try to spell them,
 then I say go ahead and look them up, then we put it all together.
