A Letter to My Students

Dear Students:
   As I write this in October 2020, I can safely say that our world has changed

A LOT in the past few years--even over the last few months. More change and
uncertainty await us. As we watch a huge shift taking place in our societies,
intercultural communication is more important than ever.

   If we want to move forward together as a nation and global community, we
must learn how to respectfully communicate with each other across differences.
Intercultural communication doesn't refer only to communication between people
from different countries, but includes communication across all kinds of personal,
social, and cultural identities like race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, abilities,
gender, socioeconomic class, and religion.

   In order to understand each other and how our identities are similar, different,
and intersect, we must listen to those with different backgrounds and spotlight
voices that might not typically be heard in our society. To achieve that goal, I have
collected materials from a wide range of open resources and authors in order
to best represent what I want to bring to you this semester: many perspectives
and stories. My hope is that through this exposure, we will find what many great
leaders have said: "It's harder to hate up close."

   This course will open your mind to how differences can be valuable, interesting,
and even worthy of celebration. If we open our minds and stay curious, we can
learn how to respect and communicate across differences in a constructive way,
leading to stronger relationships, communities, and nations.

                                                                  Moving forward together,
                                                                  Professor Shannon Ahrndt

    In the resistance and separation stage, an individual
with a nondominant identity may shift away from the
conformity of the previous stage to engage in actions that
challenge the dominant identity group. Individuals in this
stage may also actively try to separate themselves from the
dominant group, interacting only with those who share
their nondominant identity. For example, there has been

1400 bce-   During the Greek and Roman era, there was no conception of sexual orientation as an identity. However, sexual

   565 bce     relationships between men were accepted for some members of society. Also at this time, Greek poet Sappho
               wrote about love between women.
533         Byzantine Emperor Justinian makes adultery and same-sex sexual acts punishable by death.
1533        Civil law in England indicates the death penalty can be given for same-sex sexual acts between men.
1810        Napoleonic Code in France removes all penalties for any sexual activity between consenting adults.
1861        England removes death penalty for same-sex sexual acts.
1892        The term heterosexuality is coined to refer a form of "sexual perversion" in which people engage in sexual acts for
               reasons other than reproduction.
1897        Dr. Magnus Hirschfield founds the Scientific Humanitarian Committee in Berlin. It is the first gay rights organization.
1900-1930   Doctors "treat" homosexuality with castration, electro-shock therapy, and incarceration in mental hospitals.
1924        The first gay rights organization in the United States, the Chicago Society for Human Rights, is founded.
1933-44     Tens of thousands of gay men are sent to concentration camps under Nazi rule. The prisoners are forced to wear
               pink triangles on their uniforms. The pink triangle was later reclaimed as a symbol of gay rights.
1934        The terms heterosexuality and homosexuality appear in Webster's dictionary with generally the same meaning the
               terms hold today.
1948        American sexologist Alfred Kinsey's research reveals that more people than thought have engaged in same-sex
               sexual activity. His research highlights the existence of bisexuality.
1969        On June 27, patrons at the Stonewall Inn in New York City fight back as police raid the bar (a common practice used
               by police at the time to harass gay people). "The Stonewall Riot," as it came to be called, was led by gay, lesbian,
1974           and transgender patrons of the bar, many of whom were working class and/or people of color.
1999        The American Psychiatric Association removes its reference to homosexuality as a mental illness.
            The Vermont Supreme Court rules that the state must provide legal rights to same-sex couples. In 2000, Vermont
2003           becomes the first state to offer same-sex couples civil unions.
            The U.S. Supreme Court rules that Texas's sodomy law is unconstitutional, which effectively decriminalizes
2011           consensual same-sex relations.
            The U.S. military policy "Don't Ask Don't Tell" is repealed, allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly.

           The Greeks make connections between biology, physiology, and actions. For example, they make a connection
30-480        between epilepsy and a disorder of the mind but still consider the source to be supernatural or divine.

              impurity that could possibly be addressed through prayer.

           As beliefs in the supernatural increase during the Middle Ages, people with disabilities are seen as manifestations of

     Unfortunately, homophobic attitudes and even violence
are not uncommon in Russian society. For example, groups
such as Occupy Gerontilyaj have been known to lure and
then beat and torture gay teenagers. In 2012, a video that
surfaced online showed six members of another far-right-
wing organization torturing a young man who later died,
according to the Spectrum Human Rights Alliance (a group
that advocated for LGBT rights in Eastern Europe).

     The tone of some of the Russian media reflects these
attitudes. For instance, the LGBT community are portrayed

of culturally diverse groups may be less attracted to each

may have more difficulty communicating with each other,
and in some cases may actively dislike and even engage in
aggressive behavior toward each other.

    The principles of social psychology, including the
ABCs--affect, behavior, and cognition--apply to the study
of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, and social
psychologists have expended substantial research efforts
studying these concepts (Figure 2.1). The cognitive com-
ponent in our perceptions of group members is the stereo-
type--the positive or negative beliefs that we hold about
the characteristics of social group. We may decide that
"French people are romantic," that "old people are incom-
petent," or that "college professors are absent minded." And

    Genocide is not a just a historical concept; it is prac-
ticed today. Recently, ethnic and geographic conflicts in
the Darfur region of Sudan have led to hundreds of thou-
sands of deaths. As part of an ongoing land conflict, the
Sudanese government and their state-sponsored Janjaweed
militia have led a campaign of killing, forced displacement,
and systematic rape of Darfuri people. Although a treaty
was signed in 2011, the peace is fragile.

dominant group, to leave a certain area or country. As seen

mutual respect on the part of all cultures, both dominant
and subordinate, creating a multicultural environment of
acceptance. In reality, true pluralism is a difficult goal to
reach. In the United States, the mutual respect required by
pluralism is often missing, and the nation's past pluralist
model of a melting pot posits a society where cultural dif-
ferences aren't embraced as much as erased.

Assimilation

Assimilation describes the process by which a minority
individual or group gives up its own identity by taking on
the characteristics of the dominant culture. In the United
States, which has a history of welcoming and absorbing
immigrants from different lands, assimilation has been a
function of immigration.

    Most people in the United States have immigrant
ancestors. In relatively recent history, between 1890 and
1920, the United States became home to around 24 million
immigrants. In the decades since then, further waves of
immigrants have come to these shores and have eventually
been absorbed into U.S. culture, sometimes after facing
extended periods of prejudice and discrimination. Assim-
ilation may lead to the loss of the minority group's cul-
tural identity as they become absorbed into the dominant

How and Why They Came

The national and ethnic diversity of Asian American
immigration history is reflected in the variety of their
experiences in joining U.S. society. Asian immigrants have
come to the United States in waves, at different times, and
for different reasons.

    The first Asian immigrants to come to the United
States in the mid-nineteenth century were Chinese. These
immigrants were primarily men whose intention was to
work for several years in order to earn incomes to support
their families in China. Their main destination was the
American West, where the Gold Rush was drawing peo-
ple with its lure of abundant money. The construction of
the Transcontinental Railroad was underway at this time,
and the Central Pacific section hired thousands of migrant
Chinese men to complete the laying of rails across the
rugged Sierra Nevada mountain range. Chinese men also
engaged in other manual labor like mining and agricul-
tural work. The work was grueling and underpaid, but like
many immigrants, they persevered.

    Japanese immigration began in the 1880s, on the heels
of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Many Japanese

is mentally healthy, and deciding what interventions are
appropriate. Definitions of mental health depend on cul-

cept. It refers to the social and cultural differences a society
assigns to people based on their (biological) sex. A related
concept, gender roles, refers to a society's expectations
of people's behavior and attitudes based on whether they
are females or males. Understood in this way, gender, like
race, is a social construction. How we think and behave as
females and males is not etched in stone by our biology
but rather is a result of how society expects us to think and
behave based on what sex we are. As we grow up, we learn
these expectations as we develop our gender identity, or
our beliefs about ourselves as females or males.

    These expectations are called femininity and mascu-
linity. Femininity refers to the cultural expectations we
