Introduction

         Schools have always been information-rich places. There is a curriculum to be taught that
comprises ideas, concepts, information, and skills. Learning the curriculum requires information-
rich interaction between teachers and students and among students. Humans have invented
technologies to facilitate interaction and information exchange for centuries, and these
technologies have been incorporated into teachers' instructional methods. As a result, students
graduate from school both knowing the curriculum and knowing how to use the information
technology tools they will encounter in the real world. At least that is the intent.

         Paper was the dominant information technology for many generations of students and
teachers. Printed textbooks, encyclopedias, and other books, along with magazines, posters and
maps (some held in hands and some hanging on walls), and other printed materials contained the
curriculum. For these generations, written tests, worksheets, research paper, drawings and
paintings, and other paper-based assignments were the basis of demonstrating their learning to
teachers. Of course, some electronic media were also used for teaching, and generations of
students were happy to see the movie projectors, film strip projectors, and televisions with video
cassette players on the carts being wheeled into the classrooms. This reflected the greater society
in which much of one's economic activity (for example preparing income tax returns) was done
on paper while electronic media were encountered in the popular culture. For the last several
decades, the information technology used in schools has been changing as print is being replaced
by digital electronic devices and information.

         Today, when one talks about the information technology (IT) in schools, they almost
always refer to computers and other digital electronic devices that are used to access and create
information. The information is almost always digital and electronic and stored on "the cloud"
(the vernacular term for platforms like Google Workspaces in which data and productivity tools
are housed on web servers and accessed via web browsers). Most trace the origins of computers
in schools from the arrival of desktop models in the late 1970's and early 1980's, but teletypes
and even some mainframe computers were found in schools before then.

         It did take several decades for computers and electronic data to replace print as the
dominant medium for instruction, records, and school operation, but in the third decade of the
21st century, computer technologies are used for all aspects of schooling. It should be noted that
radio, television, and movies were promoted as tools that were predicted to replace teachers and
reform schooling, but they remained marginal tools. Computers have been integrated into
teaching and learning to a much greater degree than the earlier electronic media. Regardless of
the age of the students the school enrolls, the number of students, or the nature of the curriculum,
all schools rely on information technology systems for:

          Teaching--Educators create study guides, worksheets, and other files for students;
             they curate web sites to support their teaching, create slide shows to present materials
             to students, manage virtual classrooms, give feedback on work, and otherwise instruct
             students with computing devices.

          Learning--Students gain access to digital information resources including those
             analogous to paper media, animations, video, library databases, and other sources of
             information through computing devices. They also participate in discussions, write

                                                              2
             papers, prepare presentations, program spreadsheets, graph functions, create art, and
             otherwise demonstrate their new abilities with digital information technologies.

          Managing data--Almost all teachers report attendance and grades using a web-
             based student information system (SIS), parents can (usually) access the records of
             their children on the same SIS. Behavior, health, and other records are also secured
             on those systems and the data saved on them are used for both internal decision-
             making and the data are reported to external agencies such as regulatory agencies.

          Facilitating business operations--Schools are organizations with accounting,
             human resources, operations, and facilities management needs like those of all
             businesses and organizations of similar size. Many of the digital tools used for those
             functions in other organizations are used for the same tasks in schools.

         The technology systems installed in schools support all these functions and others. These
are seriously complex systems. In the vocabulary of IT professionals, they are enterprise systems
(or perhaps business systems in small schools) and managing them requires specialized
expertise, so schools employ a variety of professionals to manage the networks, keep end-user
devices functioning, and keep data systems secure.

         Usually, IT professionals arrive in schools with little knowledge of education beyond
their experiences as students. Programs that train IT professionals (trade schools, professional
organizations, community colleges, and universities) focus on the technology and how it
supports general business and management operations; educational uses of computers or the
nature of students and teachers as IT users are rarely the focus of lessons preparing information
technology professionals. As a result, many who are hired as IT professionals in schools have
deep knowledge of IT and strategies for keeping business users productive and content, but they
find those strategies are not as effective in schools. No IT professional wants users of their
systems to be unproductive and discontent.

My Rationale
         My purpose in writing this book is to give readers a view into the work of managing

information technology in schools. IT professionals will notice differences (some nuanced and
some significant) between the needs and expectations of IT users in business and IT in school.
With the more complete and more accurate concept the nature of the computing environment
necessary for successful schooling, which I intend to provide through this book, IT professionals
will be better prepared to meet those needs. Educators will also benefit from this book by
clarifying the nature of their IT needs and how these may be different from those that are
familiar to IT professionals who are hired to work in your school.

         The preceding paragraph portends a common situation in schools: The IT professionals
lack the expertise to makes decisions about what is an appropriate configuration of IT to meet
teaching and learning goals, but their decisions can limit what can be done by teachers and
students. Educators lack the skill and expertise to properly configure the IT upon which they rely
to do their jobs effectively and efficiently. IT in school is further complicated by the fact that
schools are under resourced, and they are obligated to comply with laws and regulations, so
some actions educators and IT professional want to undertake are found unreasonable.

                                                              3
         Appropriate design, proper configuration, and reasonable implementation are concepts
developed in later chapters to illustrate the very different types of expertise necessary to create
and maintain IT systems in schools. For now, it is enough to recognize that expertise with IT and
expertise with education are necessary to keep educational technology functioning the way
educators and their students need, and it is rare to find a single individual who all of the
necessary expertise.

     "I know educators, and you don't want them running your network. I know IT folks too,
     and you don't want them running your schools."

         When framing a problem, we define what we believe its cause to be along with the
conditions that will indicate the problem has been solved. When attempting to solve problems,
we take actions to reduce its effects and to prevent it from returning. When working with IT in
schools, it becomes obvious there are differences between how IT professionals and educators
define and attempt to solve problems. These differences must be bridged if IT systems are to be
appropriately designed, properly configured, and reasonably supported in schools. Notice my
careful language. Many problems are not really solved for all stakeholders and in many cases one
solution creates new problems.

         In the domain of information technology, all problems are solvable. We all know what IT
systems are supposed to do, and we get frustrated when they do not. IT professionals know the
function of each component; they adopt systematic troubleshooting steps, and most problems can
be isolated and resolved in minutes or a few hours. (Yes, I have problems that extended much
longer--all IT professionals have--but those tend to be rare.) IT professionals have knowledge
of the systems and components they manage, and they have resources (from online communities,
colleagues, vendors, and even user manuals) to help them resolve unfamiliar problems. IT
problems rarely resolved without something happening; it is often a distant and unknown system
being restarted, but some human or other computer must intervene. When IT problems are
solved, all users can recognize the green lights that signal functioning connections, operational
computers, and--in schools--smiling teachers.

         In the domain education, problems are not so easy to identify and resolve. Students and
teachers are vastly more complicated than IT and their lives are affected by far more variables
than even the most sophisticated IT systems. When looking carefully at problems in education,
we discover they cannot be clearly stated, and the causes cannot be isolated. After considerable
effort and expense to implement solutions, the original problem may remain, it may have been
shifted to another part of the system, or the solution may have caused new and unanticipated
problems. Some problems that affect educators and students also resolve spontaneously on
occasion. Further, there may be disagreement that the problem even existed or that it has been
solved.

         Because they solve different types of problems, IT professionals and educators rely on
much different types of knowledge, skills, and habits to their work. They must have differences,
otherwise, they would not be able to solve the problems they face every day. My purpose in
writing this book is to help bridge the gap. My goal is to explain to IT professionals what they
can expect when they arrive to work in a school. Those folks are going to make strange requests
of you. (This sentence applies equally to IT and to educators--the other group makes little sense
sometimes.) My purpose is to help you understand them and for you all to make better decisions
because you share understanding of teaching and learning and technology.

                                                              4
     I once served on a committee hiring a professional who was primarily going to serve as
     network administrator. We were in the second interview, so there were fewer questions
     and more discussions, and the applicant asked, "What can you tell me about the
     environment?" The superintendent (who admitted little knowledge of technology)
     began describing efforts they had made to improve the working climate in the schools.
     The candidate looked puzzled as he listened for several minutes. When she paused to
     take a breath, I interrupted, "I think he was asking about the network environment?" He
     said, "yes, I'm glad to have heard that, but I was asking about the servers and stuff."
     Sometimes IT professionals and educators are not even speaking the same language
     even when they use the same word.

         By writing this book, I seek to help readers bridge the gaps in language, problem-solving,
and even agreement between IT professionals and educators. If IT professionals understand a
little about how schools operate, the IT needs of students and teachers, and the how the demands
put on infrastructure are different from when they have experienced in other situations; they will
be better prepared to meet those needs. If school leaders understand those same needs, they will
be better prepared to interpret what they need and provide better leadership to the IT
professionals they depend on to meet the mission of their schools.

The Perspective I Bring to This Book
         When I was a young adult, just entering my undergraduate studies, I had little interest in

computers. There were a small number or computers in my high school when I graduated in
1983, but I avoided them. When I was a freshman in college, many of my dormmates spent time
in the college's computer rooms, but I avoided them.

         When I was finally assigned to use them to analyze some data that my lab mates and I
collected in biology class, I realized computers were useful for something that I valued. I bought
one (an Apple IIc) and started using it for my schoolwork. I also enrolled in the optional
"Computers in the Classroom" course offered by the education department for those studying to
be teachers (it was so long ago that the course was an elective for education majors). By the time
I started my first teaching job in 1988, the school was replacing their first fleet of computers with
the second, so I claimed a few of the old models for my classroom (which I never got working as
I wanted).

         My math and science students were found using computers as often as I could make
reasonable plans, and--over the next few years--I became a teacher-leader in the emerging field
of educational technology. At two different schools, I led the first technology planning
committees, wrote technology plans, started developing workshops for teachers to help them
create technology-based lessons. After 10 years as a science and math teacher with emerging
technology expertise, I become a computer teacher. My duties expanded as each new wave of
technology arrived. I have been responsible for fleets of computers, local area networks, training,
budgeting, planning, and otherwise managing IT in schools.

         I have written the grants to buy the devices, recycled them at their end of life and
managed everything in between. Users of my systems have included kindergarten students
through high school students and adults in community colleges. I have also taught all those
populations how to use computers and I have taught other subjects using technology. I have

                                                              5
taught teachers how to use computers, and how to teach with computers. I have also taught those
who manage IT in schools.

         Along the way, I have studied both the theory of how technology affects institutions and
users (especially schools) and how technology systems are deployed and technology plans are
implemented in schools. In addition, I have written about technology in teaching, and I have
written about managing educational technology. Despite all that I have learned and done, I find
interesting new situations, questions, and problems (as well as some very familiar ones) every
day.

         I am still active in information technology in education; my full-time work finds me
working with technology in classrooms and supporting online learning in a community college. I
was hired into my current role "to bridge the gap" between faculty and information technology.
That is a role I have played many times before. It is a role that many school leaders tell me they
need.

My Assumptions About Readers
         This book has been written to help those who want to ensure information technology is

an effective tool for teachers and students to accomplish their goals and to ensure it supports the
efficient operations of schools. Some readers, I expect, will have significant experience with IT
and may find my find my treatment of it will be too generalized and it will raise more questions
than it answers. Other readers, I expect, will have some specific interests in and experience in
education and may find my claims about schooling will raise more questions than they answer.
(This is a common situation when working in school IT, planning meetings often raise more
questions than they answer.) While this is not a comprehensive list, some readers I have in mind
are:

          IT professionals with experience in other fields who seek to work in schools.
             There are many reasons why one might want to transition from business or industry
             into education. Many are motivated by the desire to support the work of educating;
             others are motivated by the different working conditions. (School tends to be lower
             stress and more predictable work environments than many non-school environments.)
             In schools, some folks make the switch and find out they are not cut out for it. I hope
             to help you understand what you are getting yourself into if you are considering
             switching industries.

          Those who seek their first position as an IT professional perhaps after having
             completed an associate or bachelor degree or a certificate. Schools often hire
             individuals who have little experience into entry-level jobs. This provides an
             excellent situation for both worker and school. I hope to help these job seekers
             understand the nature of the work as well.

          Individuals who seek to reenter the workforce. Just as schools hire those with little
             experience, they also hire those who have been out of the workforce.

          Someone working in a school currently, but who seeks to change their role. Some
             jobs in schools can be very stressful and individuals may like working in schools, but

                                                              6
             they want to fill a different role. I hope to help these individuals see their work
             environments from a different perspective.

          Someone working as a school IT professional who wants to improve their
             performance. If you find yourself working in school, but find there seems to be
             difficult situations arising, you hear complaints about how your department runs or
             what it accomplishes, I will help you see your systems from a different perspective. I
             know it is difficult to hear such "complaints" directed towards you and your work. In
             almost every case, such complaints arise out of misunderstandings of what needs to
             be accomplished. I also encourage these readers to introduce this book to the
             administrators in your schools. They need to be aware of what you do as well as
             much as you need to understand their work.

          A school leader who seeks to better understand the nature of school IT. Many
             school leaders avoid making technology decisions. That may be best as we really
             don't want them configuring networks or servers, but school leaders do have a role in
             making decisions about what should be done. This book should help these readers
             understand the nature of IT and schools and the rationale behind some IT decisions
             that you find troubling. This book should help you identify your role in school IT
             decisions.

A Brief History of Computers in Schools
         In the United States, desktop computers arrived in classrooms beginning in the late

1970's and early 1980's, which is when they arrived on the consumer market as well. If you
walked into a classroom where there were those first desktop computers were installed, you
probably would have seen one or two computers on the margins of the classroom; nearby, there
would have been a box of disks with applications and data were stored on them. To start a word
processing program, for example, one would insert the disk with the application, then boot the
computer. Another disk was inserted to load a document. To use another application, the user
powered the computer down, then inserted different disks and rebooted the computer.

         Before desktop computers arrived in schools, some public schools connected to
mainframe computers located at colleges and universities. Students, teachers, and other users
entered data on teletype terminals in schools to write programs. Commands entered in the
teletypes were sent over plain old telephone system connections to the mainframes where they
were executed, and the results sent back to be displayed on the terminal. One of the largest
expensed associated with these efforts was the cost of long-distance telephones charges. These
localized efforts were centered near colleges in New Hampshire (where BASIC was developed),
Minnesota (which contributed the Oregon Trail to generations of students), and Illinois (where
PLATO included many tools that were later central to the Internet). The institutions hosting
those systems were recognized as early leaders in computer science research and education.
While there is a rich narrative that the technology gurus in Silicon Valley were the innovators
who built the computer revolution, historian Joy Lisi Rankin claimed the teletypes users in
schools were as important in laying the foundations of our current computing landscape in the
2018 book The People's History of Computing in the United States.

                                                              7
     First-hand account: I graduated from high school in 1983. My New England school had
     a book storage room that had been converted into a "computer lab" where there were
     six desktop computers. Two were standalone computers with programs loaded from 5 
     inch floppy disks. The others were connected to Dartmouth College's shared time
     computer for high schools. I used the standalone machines a few times, and watched
     others scroll through screens filled with green text to accomplish something, but I am
     not sure what, on those connected to the college.

         Eventually, the teletype systems were abandoned, and one-computer classrooms were
abandoned as well. As demand for computer courses increase, larger numbers of desktop
computers were installed. Rather than placing them in individual classrooms, technology leaders
installed them in "computer labs" which was the dominant model of computer-based education
until the early 2000's. In elementary schools, classroom teachers took all their students there at
once for special instruction at regularly scheduled times, and in high schools, students enrolled in
computer literacy or programming courses as electives, or teachers took students there for special
lessons or projects. The computer lab model of technology-based teaching generally found all
students doing the same type of work during their time in the space.

         Late in the 1990's, two programs supported by the federal government increased the
computing infrastructure in schools in the United States. Technology Literacy Challenge (TLC)
grants provided funds to purchase computers and support professional development for teachers.
The Schools and Libraries Program of the Universal Service Fund (eRate) provided financial
support for local area network (LAN) infrastructure and to defray to costs of Internet access.
Schools have largely assumed responsibility for purchasing devices and teaching teachers,
while eRate funds continue to support internet access in schools. IT professionals are usually
assigned the task of preparing and submitting the schools' eRate application. Another effort, led
by local activists, called NetDays found volunteers installing the cabling necessary to connect the
new computers purchased with TLC funds to Internet connections supported by eRate. This was
necessary because the schools were built before computer networks were necessary, and few
budgets allowed for the considerable capital expenses of installing cat-5 cables throughout
buildings. Such amateur endeavors are no longer common in public schools, but the fact they
were once common is an interesting reality of the history of computers in school.

         At about the same time, the findings from Apple's Classrooms of Tomorrow project were
influencing many educational technology initiatives. One of the important observations was that
access to computers was not sufficient for teachers to create effective lessons. They needed help
understanding how to use computers in their teaching as well as training in how to operate them.
This explains, in part, the inclusion of support for professional development in the projects that
were awarded TLC funds. Even today, IT professionals are involved with training teachers and
others to use IT systems and in some cases teach with the systems that they manage.

         As computers arrived in schools that had high speed Internet access in each instructional
space, and as teachers began to gain experience teaching with them, there was increasing interest
in moving computers back into classrooms. It was reasoned that teaching with computers
required they be in classroom so they would be available when students were engaged with all
classroom activities and materials. More frequent access to computers in classrooms allows for
easier technology integration, which is a popular model of organizing technology-rich teaching
(see page x).

                                                              8
         Since about 2010, one-to-one computing and cloud-based computing has come to
dominate school computing. In many schools, students carry Chromebooks with them, and
sometimes they take them home. (While the market share of educational computing devices is
difficult to ascertain, estimates are that Chromebooks represent over 60% of the devices
purchased for school users.) Some schools do continue to maintain computer rooms for special
functions, and computers with full operating systems for administrative staff, but in many
schools, Chromebooks are the only devices maintained by IT professionals, which can be a less
than optimal situation for many educators. Google Workspaces provide most students with
productivity applications, and student information systems (including grade books), library card
catalogs, and learning management systems are web-based, so students access them from home
and school. Because those systems are based in the cloud, robust, reliable, and secure networks
are essential to school functions.

         While the move to cloud-based computing has many benefits for students, teachers, and
IT professionals, it has introduced inequity into education. The "digital divide" has been used to
describe the inequitable access to digital learning for generations. Originally, it was used to
describe the fact that marginalized populations attended schools with fewer computing devices.
It has also been used to describe inequitable access to high-quality instruction with digital tools.
As cloud-computing became ubiquitous it described inequitable access to network connections to
use those resources away from the school. The problem was particularly acute during the remote
teaching necessitated by the pandemic in 2020.

In March 2020, I was discussing the inability of families to access high-speed Internet
in the town with a superintendent of schools. We agreed that "Internet access in the
town isn't really our problem, but it is our problem."

Layers of Educational Technology
         When looking at information technology in schools, we can break it into five levels (see

table 1). As one proceeds from "IT Systems" to "Students and Teachers Using IT for Teaching
Tasks," each level introduces more uncertainty into to the design process as each introduces
more variables which are outside the control of designers and that are unknowable to the
designers.

         IT professionals are generally comfortable with layers one, two, and three. "IT Systems"
through "Users Complete Tasks with IT" are amenable to planning. Organizational leaders can
clearly identify the tasks they need to complete, they can identify and train the users, and the
system requirements can be clearly defined. These can be used to define goals, and strategies for
achieving them can be implemented, and the degree to which they are accomplished can be
measured objectively. When the task becomes teaching and it is done with students and teachers,
there are uncomfortable levels of uncertainty for many IT professionals.

IT Systems
         Information technology systems are foundation of the work that is the focus of this book.

The end user devices; the Ethernet cables or access points to which they connect; the routers and
switches that send packets to and from network nodes; the servers that assign network addresses;
and the gateways, firewalls, and other devices that control access to the Internet can be
considered in isolation from the purpose to which they are applied.

         When networks are planned and installed, the system requirements are clearly defined,
and skilled network architects can design and install them to meet the requirements. The task of
creating these systems does require very skilled technicians and engineers, but it is an
engineering process. Known procedures and used to configure the devices and engineers can test
its operation before it is deployed. We can tell our IT systems are functioning by pinging devices
(that really is the name of the task of sending signals around networks to confirm networks
connectivity).

IT Systems for a Task
         In the real world, no IT systems are designed without a task in mind. Those tasks inform

the systems requirements that architects must meet. In some business situations, the tasks are
very specific, and the system is designed for that task alone. The computing capacity built into
the internet of things is an example of very specific tasks; your internet-connected video doorbell
serves its function, but it is not useful for analyzing your household budget.

         The IT systems created in schools tend to be general purpose computing devices. Rather
than being designed for a single purpose, the computers and devices are used for many purposes,
some of which are known prior to the system requirements being defined, but some are
unknown. In some cases, the decisions made when planning and deploying the systems limit
what can be done later. In organizations in which future tasks are not known, it is uncertain if the
current system requirements will meet the future requirements, so architects commonly add as
much extra capacity that the budget will allow when planning new systems or upgrades.
Minimizing the need to build and maintain unused capacity is one of the reasons schools (and
other organizations) are adopting cloud-based infrastructure.

         Rather than passing random data to confirm connectivity and capacity, designing IT for
tasks requires IT professionals support software, error correction, and other protocols to produce
meaningful, accurate, and secure data. These additional requirements specify the operations and
functions that affect the selection and configuration of the IT systems.

Users Perform Tasks with IT Systems
         Technology systems are designed for unknown users, and the assumptions designers

make about users can have important implications for how effective it is. Todd Rose begins his
2015 book The End of Average with the story of fighter pilots in the 1940's who were unable to
control their planes because the cockpits were designed for the "average" body. Once cockpits
were designed to adjust to the actual bodies of pilots, they found pilots more able to control
them, and fewer planes crashed, and fewer pilots died.

         While the consequences of designing IT systems in businesses and schools are not as
dangerous as the inability of a pilot to fly their plane, the principle is the same. Once users begin

                                                              10
interacting with IT systems, additional variables are introduced based on users' capacity and
preferences, and those variables cannot be controlled by the designers. When there is a disparity
between users' capacity and preferences, but the system has passed the IT professional's tests
can lead to the user being blamed for the poor functioning. In many cases, this blame is
misplaced as deeper situational awareness leads architects to design better functioning systems.

IT Used for Teaching Tasks
         The tasks that teachers accomplish using IT systems can be differentiated into two

categories. First, are the highly predictable tasks that resemble those performed by business
users. IT professionals can plan and test for functionality. These tasks include many of the data
management tasks such as recording attendance and grades for which teachers are responsible. It
also includes those instructional tools in which the goals and the practices are like workforce
training. Designing systems to meet these needs are familiar to many IT professionals as the
needs like the those in many other organizations.

         Second, there are the teaching tasks that are associated with what are commonly called
authentic learning environments. These can be unpredictable as they are driven by students'
interests and rely on diverse source of information, and the products of students' learning emerge
as the projects progress. When teaching with these methods, teachers question their practices,
explore new options, and experiment with new tools and technologies. These individuals will
seek to use the IT systems for purposes never conceived when the system requirements were first
defined. Obviously, this introduces even more variables and greater uncertainty into the design
and configuration of IT systems.

Students and Teachers Using IT for Teaching and Learning
         One of the most distressing realizations one makes when they become a teacher is that

the best plans one makes for the classroom are just guesses. While teachers apply their
knowledge of the curriculum and their familiarity with the students or with similar students when
planning, each classroom is different and a lesson that one group finds engaging and meaningful
is dull and boring to another. Students with their varying skills, different motivations and
perspectives, and clever insights (none of which can be known when planning) can lead teachers
to revise their thinking and update their lessons and what they do with IT.

         So they can respond in a timely manner to the necessary revisors they identify, teachers
often ask for permission to change systems. IT professionals know that is not a good idea; at
least it is not a good idea if you want secure, reliable, and robust systems. This is the situation
that can cause conflict schools between educators and IT professionals and resolving that conflict
requires seeing the problem form the other perspective.

Organization of the Book
         The book contains eight chapters. In the first two chapters, I preview what it is like

working in schools. In Chapter 1: What Exactly is School? I focus on the differences between
what many adults believe about school and what school is actually like. In Chapter2: Working in
Schools, I focus on the day-to-day realities of working in schools, including the various IT roles
that must be filled in school today.

         Chapters 3 through 6 approximately follow the levels of IT in schools I have presented.
Chapter 3: Infrastructure in Schools reviews the hardware one typically encounters in school as
well as the data systems one commonly encounters and Chapter 4: Supporting Infrastructure in

                                                              11
Schools revies some familiar strategies and approaches to IT management with a specific focus
on school environments. Chapter 5: IT Users in Schools presents the unique characteristics of
students and teachers and their IT needs that result from those characteristics. The role of
technology in the classroom is the focus of Chapter 6: Technology in Teaching,

         The different types of expertise necessary to make sound decisions related to IT in school
is the focus of Chapter 7: IT Decision-Making in Schools. The book ends with a brief chapter
that focuses on job search and application advice.

                                                              12
1: What Exactly is School?

   Schools are both familiar places and unfamiliar places. While most readers will have some
experience in schools, their familiarity is likely to be grounded in the experience of students and
  parents whose experience in school is highly mediated. This chapter explores schools as work

                                                  environments.

         There are many types of institutions that are labeled "school." In this book, I am
generally writing about the public institutions that enroll students in kindergarten through grade
12 in the United States. Students typically enroll in these schools after they have turned five
years old and graduate just after they have turned 18 (some individuals with special needs are
entitled to services in public schools until they are 21). Much in this book will be relevant for
those who work in private or charter schools or any other variations on schools for children and
adolescents. Further, much that is written here applies to post-secondary schools including trade
schools, community colleges, and other higher education institutions. Workforce training is a
much different type of education, and it is very valuable, but much different from what I have in
mind for readers of this book.

         The primary difference between public schools and other types of schools is the diversity
of the student body. Other schools select their students (or the students self-select) and in many
cases serve a specific program to a specific audience. Public schools are prepared to enroll all
students in the service area (except for those students with very specific and intensive special
needs) and provide a comprehensive curriculum intended to prepare students for a wide range of
educational or vocational opportunities once they graduate. The diverse nature of students and
the broad nature of the curriculum is part of what make schools unusual places to work for IT
professionals.

         I expect every reader has experience with school and has a strong concept of school.
Much that one "knows" about school, however, is a misconception. In this chapter, I describe
some of the lesser-known characteristics of schools as workplaces and I describe some of the
day-to-day realities of working in schools. In addition, I describe some of the issues that are
specific to educational populations or that have specific implications for IT professionals
working in school.

Your Experience Wasn't Everyone's
         If you are reading this book, I assume you were a student in elementary, middle, and

secondary schools, and perhaps even have some college or trade school education along with
workforce training. If you are like most people, you have distinct memories of each phase of
your education, and it is likely you were somewhat successful in school, otherwise you would be
unlikely to be considering or working in a school. I also assume some readers of this book have
experience as a parent of children who were in school or have other knowledge of the experience
of school for students.

         When humans have important experiences, such as we have in school (either as a
youngster or a parent), those will bias our beliefs about the experience for others. We assume
everyone's experience in school was like ours. (It was not--even for classmates.) We assume

                                                              13
that everyone should learn what we learned and how we learned it. (This may be true, but it may
not be true.) As a result, many adults pursue work in schools with the intent of replicating the
structures and instruction they experienced, but that may not be what all students need.

         The composition of the leaders who set school agendas, policies, and procedures is an
interesting aspect of these public institutions. In general, we recognize two groups of people who
participate in schooling as adults. There are those who liked school or were successful in school;
individuals in this group tend to advocate schools that reflect their experience. There are those
who did not like or succeed in school; these individuals tend to advocate different organizations
and different types of teaching than they experienced. In many cases, those who were not
successful also advocate for students and form strong relationships with them. While this is an
oversimplification of the nature of these groups and the composition of educators, it is
noteworthy that both groups include individuals who value school enough that they want to work
there and support today's students. The perceptions, experiences, and biases of individuals who
never return to school in any capacity are silent in the design of schools.

     For school IT professionals, many of the requests they hear seem foreign as they contradict
much that they "know" about teaching and learning and schooling. We will also see those
requests many contradict what they believe about IT configurations as well.

     I was not a strong math student; my lowest grades were always earned in math class. I
     attributed this to the "D" I earned in math when I was in 4th grade and the message it
     sent to me. Despite this, I became a math teacher. My students (and their parents)
     frequently said I was among the best math teachers they ever had. I attribute this (and
     the frequent conflicts between me and other math teachers) to the fact that I had first-
     hand knowledge of the negative effects of traditional approach to math teaching. I
     challenged what they do because it had failed me as a math student. My students liked
     my approach; other math teachers did not. Such conflicts are surprisingly common in
     schools.

         One of the most important things to remember as you consider a position working in a
school is that your education deserves no special consideration. While IT professionals may not
exert direct control over teaching and school management decisions, the priorities they set and
the devices and configurations they deploy do exert influence on what happens in classrooms and
how it happens. When they work in schools, IT professionals are often asked to build systems
that does not make sense to them as it is contrary to their expectations. As will be detailed in
later chapters, educators are the stakeholder who should make decisions about the technology
they need and what they must do. It is the IT professional's role to ensure whatever technology
educators need functions as expected. In general, IT professionals should avoid telling teachers
what technology they should install or how to best use it in their classrooms.

         One of the most puzzling aspects of teaching for many adults to accept is that teaching is
a much more interactive and dynamic activity than many experienced (or remember) or that they
see in the popular culture. When one thinks of a classroom, they picture a teacher standing in
front of the seated (in rows) students and telling them what they need to know. This Standard
Model of Education (Ackerman, 2017) assumes that we know exactly what teachers should
teach, how they should teach it, and how to measure it. For IT professionals, this is a familiar and
comfortable classroom for which to design technology: give the teacher a computer and projector
with web access and a presentation application and let them teach.

                                                              14
         Many educators are coming to realize (largely because they are listening to the cognitive
and learning scientists who are discovering how human brains really work) that "telling and
testing is not teaching," so they need much different arrangements and technology capacities in
classrooms than they need is they follow the Standard Model of Education.

     While preparing an early draft of this book, I observed a conversation between IT
     professionals and a science educator. The educator had grant funds to purchase
     "computer pods" for their classroom. Each pod would comprise a computer connected
     to a 40" display mounted on the wall as well as a hub into which students could connect
     their own devices. Using this arrangement, groups of five students could look at the
     same display coming from any of their devices connected to the hub. This arrangement
     affords several options for group work and collaboration.

     During the meeting at which purchase decisions and installation plans were to be made,
     the IT professionals were not supportive of the plan. The reasoned, "students can just
     turn their laptops, or they can connect them to the projectors used for lectures." The IT
     professionals were going to be responsible for installing the TV and hub but the
     additional demands on their time were to be minimal. In rejecting the teachers' request
     they both adversely affected the teaching environment, and they alienated the teacher.

         In addition to the changing nature of teaching in schools compared to what previous
generations experienced, there are many more factors that affect schools that are commonly
recognized. Most of these factors are not new, but their effects on school are often hidden from
students and parents, so IT professionals who arrive to work in schools may be surprised by their
effects.

Schools Are Multidimensional
         It may seem unnecessary to state it, but schools are places where children are present.

Lots of children. Children who reflect the social, racial, ethnic, and other characteristics of the
local population. They are everywhere and they affect every decision that is made. Ostensibly,
decisions are made to support student learning, but the reality of that goal is questionable.
Consider, for example, there is ample evidence that high school-aged people benefit, and
learning improves, if the school days starts in the late morning, but few schools have adjusted
their schedules to align with this finding. Consider, as well, the debates regarding the purpose of
school during the COVID pandemic; one very important function of school is providing reliable
childcare for large parts of the population. While this cannot be minimized, it seems contrary to
the goals of teaching the academic curriculum which is typically ascribed to schools. One of the
reasons the decisions made in school may be contrary to "what is good for students" is they are
multidimensional; schools fulfill several purposes and different stakeholders exert influence on
decisions.

         Schools are political organizations. They are funded by taxes levied by state and local
governments in the United States, and citizens serve on school boards that govern local schools.
Because the officials who fund and govern schools are elected, their selection is a political
process. This opens the process of school governance to partisan politics, and participants in such
decision-making are not bound to evidence and reason in the same manner as scientists and
scholars; so, any decision can be justified.

                                                              15
     While drafting this book, the school board I the city in which I live voted to replace the
     school mascot which was interpreted by many as racist. The composition of the school
     board changed, and the new board reversed that decision. In the next elections, three of
     the four open seats were won by individuals who did not support the reversal. It seems
     reasonable to conclude this issue has been distracting the board from the work of
     supporting local students and teachers.

         Schools are also regulated organizations. Governmental agencies, which take their
directions largely from legislation, define the policies local school boards are expected to adopt,
and they provide guidance on the contents of those policies. They also approve the qualifications
necessary to be a licensed teacher or administrator and approve teacher education programs
offered by college and universities. In the United States, the federal government did not exert
much influence on education until the Department of Education was founded in October 1979,
and since then it has sought to influence decisions and priorities through grants and other
programs, but most school regulations and decisions are made by state and local governmental
agencies.

         Schools are also hierarchical and authoritative organizations. Teachers have some
authority over students, and administrators have authority over students and teachers. This
authority is not absolute, of course, but it does influence decisions that are made and actions that
are taken. The hierarchical authority in school is grounded in age (teachers are adults and the
students are children), but also from the position one holds (administrators have more
responsibility than teachers) as well as expertise (teachers are experts compared to students, and
ostensibly administrators have greater expertise than teachers). As a result, even in classrooms in
which the students are adults, there exists a hierarchical and authoritative relationship between
students and teachers.

         Further, schools are organizations that rely on diverse expertise, and this is especially true
in relation to information technology. Early in the history of desktop computing in schools when
classroom computing comprised small numbers of computers that were not connected to
networks, it was common to find tech-savvy teachers who supported and managed the devices
that were in their classrooms. Few educators have the training and experience necessary to
configure and manage the enterprise and business class IT systems we find in schools today. In
most jurisdictions, the executive leaders who are responsible for all school operations, including
the IT, are licensed educators who began their careers as teachers, but who may not have been in
the classroom for years when technology was primitive compared to that installed today. As a
result, many initiatives are proposed, and even undertaken, without complete consideration of the
technology implications. The opposite is true as well; IT professionals often undertake
technology initiatives without complete consideration of the educational implications.

         Because schools are multidimensional, and many stakeholders influence the decisions
that are made, no person who works in school have exclusive authority to make decisions about
their work. In this, school employees and leaders are like other regulated and board-governed
organizations. In many other types of organizations, many the authority in which decisions and
judgements are grounded in the financial success of the organization. In schools, this measure of
success is absent. Various factors emerging from the political, regulatory, and authoritative
natures of schooling contribute to the decisions made and actions taken (even if they seem
unreasonable to those responsible for implementing them). Students are often unaware of these

                                                              16
competing influences on the schools they attend. This makes schools as workplaces for adults
very different from learning places for students, and some adults find they cannot work in
schools.

     When I was an undergraduate student, the university had recently begun a project which
     found students in education programs spending time in schools early in their studies.
     Faculty realized a small fraction of their students discovered during their student-
     teaching, just before they graduated, that they did not like working in schools as adults.
     Even those students who had spent several years studying to be teachers had no idea
     what the work environment would be like.

Special Considerations for IT
         Earlier in this chapter, I made the rather obvious observation that schools are filled with

children. Because so many of the IT users in schools are children, which is a population
deserving of special protections, several wide-ranging national laws in the United States provide
guidance and direction for school and technology leaders when they design policy and
procedure, and there are also other important considerations that provide indirect guidance for
school and technology leaders. Anyone who seeks to work as an IT professional in schools must
be aware not only of the requirements of these laws but also the rationale behind them.

FERPA
         Most IT professionals are familiar with the need to keep data secure. In some industries

this is necessary for regulatory purposes; and, in all industries, it is necessary to protect
proprietary information and to protect clients' information. In schools, the importance of privacy
takes on special importance because of the age of the individuals about whom the information is
kept and the nature of the information that is kept. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA) is law in the United States which is intended to safeguard sensitive information
about children in schools. FERPA details who is allowed access to information kept by the
school and the conditions under which the information can be stored. The law does specify the
rights of students, and their parents if they are under 18 years of age, as well as the steps school
officials are expected to take to protect information. Those whose privacy or rights have been
violated can file a complaint with the US Department of Education and legal action is possible.

         To ensure they comply with FERPA requirements, most schools require all employees
(including IT professionals) attend training at which local expectations are described. They also
protect the school by having employee acknowledge they received the policy training.

         While schools may interpret FERPA differently, there seems to be agreement (at least in
the dozens of FERPA training I have attended) that FERPA protects a wide range of information,
including that which school employees learn accidently. For example, a school employee who
sees a friend in the store and says, "I saw Johnny get in a fight at school today and he was
suspended," has violated FERPA. They identified a student and shared information about their
behavior and the consequences of it, and the recipient of the information was not entitled to it,
nor were the many other people who may have overheard the story.

         IT professionals have an unusual level of access to classrooms and data. When an IT
professional is in a classroom and sitting at a computer, they are "a fly on the wall." Teachers
and students largely proceed as if there is no one else there. They gain an unfiltered view of
classroom actions and interactions, and some of what they observe must be protected according

                                                              17
to FERPA. IR professionals also have access to data systems containing protected data. While
the student information system should have protections to prevent a technician from accessing
grades, a teacher may ask for help resolving a technology issue when they are logged in to
student information system and working the gradebook.

         What one observes in data systems, classrooms, and schools must be kept confidential;
the teacher who shows their gradebook to an IT technician while getting help has violated
FERPA. The IT technician who does not share that information with anyone or who does not
treat the student differently has not violated FERPA. They have minimized the damage done by
the original violation and they have not violated FERPA themselves which both protects the
privacy of the students and minimized the liability due to the original violation. The one
exception, of course, is if there are situations that are unsafe or potentially troubling. IT
professionals have the same responsibility as anyone, especially adults, to prevent and report
those situations.

     Now that projectors are found in almost all classroom and those tend to be connected to
     the single device assigned to the teacher, it is not uncommon for the teacher's
     gradebook to be displayed accidently when the projector is turned on when the
     gradebook is open. While most teachers are aware of the potential and will close their
     gradebooks, those steps may be forgotten. Many technicians have a question they will
     ask before turning on any projector and they try to make it a joke.

     One of my former colleagues would always ask "what is going to be on the screen when
     I turn this on? I'm not going to give away the winning lottery numbers, am I?" when the
     lottery joke got tiresome, he would say "I'd hate to show everyone your secret cookie
     recipe." This habit both prevented him being the cause of sensitive data being exposed
     and it served as a reminder that everyone should be aware of this potential situation.

COPPA
         The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) has been law in the United

States since 1998. The intent of the law is to protect the privacy and the personal information of
children; thus, it requires the publishers of web sites that collect user information to have
parental consent for those under 13 years of age. This is the law that has motivated social media
companies to restrict children from accessing their platforms. Of course, it is very difficult to
enforce age restrictions, but the terms of service and privacy statements of companies that
maintain web platforms, especially those that facilitate interaction among users, do reflect the
requirements of the law.

         Because of COPPA, most schools, especially those enrolling students younger than 13,
have procedures for identifying the online platforms that can be used by teachers. A teacher may
find that are not allowed to have students logging on to and using and interesting new tool until
the terms of service have been reviewed and school leaders conclude it is reasonable to allow
access and the publishers of the site align with local policy and procedure.

CIPA
         In 2000, the United States federal government passed the Children's Internet Protection

Act (CIPA) which is intended to protect children from indecent information on the Internet, it is

                                                              18
also intended to prevent personal information about students to be available online. Specifically,
CIPA requires schools that receive e-rate funds to install and maintain filters to restrict access to
inappropriate content, and it requires steps be taken to protect youngsters when using email, chat,
and similar tools. CIPA does allow the filter to be disabled when only adults are using the
network, but that is rarely done as children are hardly ever absent from school when adults are
there.

         School IT professionals can be expected to participate in the planning undertaken to
ensure the school complies with CIPA. They will review policy and procedures to ensure
Internet filters are configured and operational, email and chat is available only to those users for
whom it is permitted under local policy, to manage firewalls, and to otherwise protect children
who are using the school's IT systems. The planning takes on special importance when systems
are being updated or older devices being replaced. In addition, IT professionals are expected to
monitor systems installed to comply with CIPA are functioning, and to define steps to take if
they fail.

Advertisement-Driven Sites
         Another overlooked aspect of IT use in schools is students' exposure to advertisements.

Many sources of online information used in schools, including mainstream media and journalism
sites, the sites of professional organizations and edited periodicals, and especially social media
sites (like YouTube) are funded by advertisements. When students access these sites, they are
also exposed to the advertisements.

         Some educators, students, parents, and others object to this exposure for several reasons.
First, this can be perceived to be the commercialization of students. Students are required to
attend school, and they have little choice over the lessons and materials they use. By directing
them to information sources that are advertisement-rich, teachers may be exploiting students.
Second, some of the products may be unsuitable for children, especially in school. Even if the
products are not unsuitable, they may lead to distractions or they may contribute to inappropriate
situations.

         IT professionals may be asked to minimize students' access to advertisements when at
school, this may include installing and configuring software or web browser extensions that
block advertisements. In addition, IT professionals may be asked to support faculty as they
embed media in virtual classrooms or otherwise minimize expose to advertisements.

Other Privacy and Security
         Regardless of the nature of the organization in which they work, all IT professionals are

very familiar with the importance of network and data security; this is a lesson taught in
preparation programs and all organizations implement data security practices. IT professionals
working in schools should also promote data security, but they must be sure their actions align
with the decision-making hierarchies in schools and accepted policy and procedure.

         Schools are places where IT professionals and others are very likely to find passwords on
sticky notes attached to computers (while this is becoming less common, it is still more common
than it should be). In some schools where I have worked, technicians and other IT professionals
were encouraged to remove those sticky notes, but that was done only with the knowledge and
support of the school administrators. Another common practice is for teachers to keep list of their
students' usernames and passwords. Ostensibly, this is done to reduce troubleshooting when

                                                              19
passwords are forgotten, but there are other strategies whereby passwords can be recoverable
without the potential of them being discovered and used for nefarious purposes.

     The teachers in Springfield Middle School insisted their students provide the teachers
     with their passwords for the school network. One teacher kept the list taped to the inside
     of the door of the cabinet next to her desk. One afternoon, students noticed the teacher
     had left the door open and passwords were in plain sight. They memorized some of
     them and logged on to others' account. An IT technician noticed students behaving
     suspiciously near a computer and noted it.
     A little investigating found those students had logged on as another and sent some
     emails. It did not take much detective work to trace the origins of the email to the
     school's IP address, and the student whose account had been used was on a trip with a
     sports team. The IT technician reported the suspicious activity of the students who were
     questioned and admitted they had sent the messages.
     The question is the degree to which the teacher was responsible for keeping the
     passwords. It can be argued the students were old enough to remember their own
     passwords, so there was no reason for the teacher to have them. If the teacher did have a
     reason to keep them (which seems dubious) then it can be argued, they were negligent
     in not keeping them more secure.

                                                              20
2: Working in Schools

The nature of schools and the role of IT in their operations contribute to different workplaces for
IT professionals compared to business and industry. While many of the roles of IT professionals
 are similar, the exact nature of the work they do reflects the realities of teaching and learning.

         In the previous chapter, I described schools in very general terms, and I made the point
that schools are much different workplaces for adults than they are learning spaces for students.
As a result, some individuals who arrive to work in school find they are much different places
than they expect. In this chapter, I continue to describe schools as workplaces, but I focus on the
more specific aspects of schools as workplaces for information technology professionals,
including the working conditions in schools and the IT roles that must be fulfilled in schools.
This chapter comes with the warning that schools are very localized organizations, so the claims
I make may differ depending on the local laws, regulations, and regional norms and expectations.
The size of the school can also exert strong influences on the details of working there. Still, there
are some aspects of working in schools worthy of readers' attention.

Working Conditions
         One of the biggest differences between working in schools and working in business and

industry is the lack of a clear and unambiguous measure of success; in the vernacular, we can
say, "schools lack a clear bottom line." In education, they attempt to use test scores as a bottom
line comparable to financial measures in business, but many educators find those to be a weak
proxy for learning.

         While the weak bottom line does change the nature of IT configurations in schools, it
does not change the expectations of functional IT. While access to functioning IT is necessary
for school operations, most teachers can continue to educate children (for the short term) without
IT. When schools experience power outages so IT is not available, classes may be able to
continue with different (but still valuable lessons). The same is true of IT outages. While no
school IT professional wants their systems to be unavailable, and they respond with a sense of
urgency to outages, the urgency is different compared to that when a business' bottom line is
directly and adversely affected by IT outages. This and other factors make schools workplaces
where IT professionals experience less job-related stress when they work in school compared to
when they work in business and industries.

Pay and Benefits
         The pay for IT professionals tends to be less in schools than it is in other organizations;

just as it is for most other professions with similar educational requirements. Because schools are
public organizations, they often have requirements to provide health care and other benefits that
private organizations may not be compelled to provide. In the past, the benefits provided to
school employees were considered among the best in many communities. In recent decades,
many factors have resulted in fewer benefits being provided to school employees (which is
aligned with the changes in all industries).

                                                              21
         Any observations of pay and benefits for employees in schools or any other organization
in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic are going to be very uncertain. There has been
significant turnover of school employees (just as with all organizations) and there are sure to be
changes in the pay and benefits as schools adapt to new financial realities and as they seek to fill
open positions.

Unions
         In some regions of the United States, schools tend to be highly unionized organizations.

Many factors affect whether an IT position in a school is included in master contract agreement.
In schools where employees work under a master contract, it is the position that is included
under the contract, not the person who holds it. Whether one joins the union is a personal
decision, but employees in a position covered by a master contract are expected to comply with
those conditions regardless of their union status.

         Master contract agreements are established between the governing bodies that employ the
workers and the associations of employees; school administrators are generally not involved in
negotiating contracts, but they do follow the conditions specified in them when managing the
school. Union contracts are generally perceived to provide benefits for both workers and
management (in schools, management includes the school administrators who are implementing
the policy and procedures mandated by school boards and other regulatory agencies). Pay and
benefits are typically defined in a master contract, which means individuals cannot negotiate the
salary or wage for a position included in a master contract, but the management cannot decide to
withhold health insurance for the individual hired into a unionized position. Working conditions,
including supervision and evaluation requirements, are also specified in master contracts.
Perhaps the greatest benefit of master contracts for both the organization and the workers is the
predictability that is afforded to both.

         When individuals find the terms of master contracts are not being followed, they are
entitled to file a grievance in which the situation is examined, and disputes are resolved. Such
actions can be taken to prevent the management from violating the agreed upon conditions, and
they can be taken to prevent individuals from violating the terms of the contract. For example,
individuals holding unionized positions cannot voluntarily work for less pay. This protects the
other members of the organizations from being coerced into taking pay cuts as well.

         In schools that are unionized, it is also common to find multiple unions which are also
called local associations. The teacher association will comprise the professionals who hold
teaching licenses and who work in positions that require them. Teacher assistants, administrative
assistants, custodian staff, IT staff, and others may belong do a different association and their
work in covered by a master contract different from the contract covering teachers.

     A principal in a school where I was employed once decided to deny a contract to one of
     the teachers in the building. Despite having good evaluations throughout her career at
     the school, the principal claimed his decision was based on poor performance, but he
     violated several articles in the master contract. For example, the principal had not
     notified the teacher her performance was not acceptable, he had not defined a
     performance improvement plan, nor had he met the deadline for notifying teachers who
     were not be rehired due to performance reasons. All the steps that principal failed to
     follow were things he was obligated to do under the master contract, so she kept her job.

                                                              22
Initiatives and Change
         The title of this section contains significant irony. While school leaders often tout the

changes they are making in the teaching and school operation, schools are generally recognized
as being very conservative organizations, especially compared to businesses. Regardless of the
degree to which "change initiatives" produce different policies or procedures, those who work in
schools, including IT professionals, will be expected to participate in various initiatives designed
to improve school performance whether they concur with the intention of the change or not.

         The irony in the title of this section also arises from the reality that many schools
participate in the change efforts described in this section only superficially. Committees may
form and make recommendations, but nothing is implemented. Outside consultants may be hired
(at very exorbitant fees) to make presentations and lead workshops, but nothing is implemented.
While some of these initiatives may not seem directly related to the work of IT professionals,
they are likely to be expected to participate in a manner deemed appropriate by school leaders.

Curriculum Changes
         Educators are constantly reviewing what they teach. Many regulatory agencies require

curriculum documents to be updated and professional organizations update curriculum
recommendations, so educational leaders are responsible for ensuring local curriculum
documents and instructional practices align with emerging expectations. Although IT
professionals will not make recommendations about what should be taught, they will be asked to
participate in curriculum redesign initiatives to ensure the existing IT meets any system
requirements for technology tools necessary to implement curriculum changes, to plan for
necessary updates, to support digital document management, and to otherwise facilitate and
support curriculum planning.

DEI Initiatives
         Attending school is recognized in the United States as a fundamental right. The

government is compelled to provide a free and appropriate education for each person. For
generations, of course, the degree to which we have achieved this goal has been debated,
legislated, and adjudicated. At least within educational communities and among scholars of
school history, it is generally accepted that there are organizational structures and practices that
pose barriers to education for some populations. Some of which have histories long enough to be
labeled "traditions," and many of these organizations and structure remain even after policy and
procedure has ostensibly adopted to prevent them. In recent years, many communities have
undertaken diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in schools to address the remaining barriers and
prevent new one from being imposed.

         While such initiatives are typically considered together, diversity, equity, and inclusion
are different aspects the community and effective leaders seek to improve all three. Diversity
refers to the composition of the members of the community. When more racial, ethnic, gender,
disability, and other identities, and those of various socioeconomic populations are reflected in
the community, the more diverse it is. When those with all identities are given the same
opportunities to participate in all activities (as students or employees), then the school can be
said to be equitable. When the ideas, opinions, and desires of more individuals (representing the
diversity of the entire population), then the school can be called inclusive.

     One of the difficulties in sustaining engagement in this area is the fact that different people
have different perspectives and different experiences which affect their beliefs and opinions

                                                              23
about what is appropriate actions for school leaders to take under DEI initiatives. While some
individuals suggest DEI efforts are continuing exclusionary practices, but now just directing
them towards the majority populations, those views misrepresent the purpose and outcomes of
DEI initiatives. As public institutions, schools have an obligation to remove barriers to
participations for all, even if that means those who have been privileged in the past have less
privilege after the barriers are removed.

     The goal of DEI initiatives is to ensure no individuals face barriers to full participation
     in the school. Those who disagree with this goal are ill-suited to work in schools.

Trauma Informed Practices
         Another population that school leaders have recognized need particular attention in

schools are those who have experienced trauma either inside or outside of school. While the
effects of specific very traumatic events have been well-known for some time, post-traumatic
stress disorder being an extreme example, psychologists and clinicians have discovered long-
term exposure to stressful environments can also be harmful to brains and their ability to learn.

         While moderate levels of temporary stress are normal and benefit brains and bodies,
long-term and persistent stress even if it does not reach the level of trauma can affect developing
brains. Compared to those who have not experienced trauma, students who have are likely to
have decreased capacity to attend to lessons, decreased ability to make sense of situations, and
less control over their emotional responses to difficult situations. While IT professionals are
unlikely to have direct responsibility for planning for implementing strategies for educating
trauma-affected brains, they will be working with those who do have direct responsibility, and IT
professionals have the same obligations as all school employees to foster a culture and
environment where all students can learn.

         In addition to their indirect roles supporting trauma-informed practices, IT professionals
may participate in remediating difficult situations in which trauma contributed the events. For
example, IT professionals may be involved when students misuse IT devices or use them for
inappropriate purposes. Trauma-informed practices in school are designed to foster positive
relationships and inclusion. The default approach for remediating difficult situations with IT in
schools has been to exclude users. This is an increasingly untenable approach as trauma is
affecting larger parts of the student population and as IT is increasingly essential for teaching.

         The COVID pandemic has affected all aspects of society, and school-aged children and
their families have been particularly affected. While it is unclear the exact nature of the stress
caused by the pandemic, we can predict that individuals and populations within school
communities will have experienced trauma resulting from the pandemic that some individuals
and groups will have been more affected than others. This is an emerging area of school life, so
school leaders will be responding as the effects become clearer.

IT Roles in Schools
         Because the devices that provide local area network and internet access in schools are the

same as those installed in other businesses and industry, many of the IT roles filled in schools are
similar to those in other organizations. Because the devices are the same, IT professionals
perform may similar role as well. There are, however, several types of IT work in schools that
are not found in other organizations. Schools are also known to be organizations with under-
staffed IT departments. As a result, it is not uncommon for individuals to play multiple roles and

                                                              24
it is also not uncommon for individuals to expand and enhance their technology skills working in
schools and to gain experience in new roles. This is one reason school may be excellent places to
start an IT career.

         One of the realities of working in schools as an IT professional is that other stakeholders
often do not differentiate technology roles. IT professionals recognize this is not unique to
schools. When someone from "IT" appears, they will be asked to troubleshoot or resolve
problems they were not expecting and that they are not prepared to resolve. IT professionals find
it necessary to tactfully explain that they have higher priorities at the moment or that they do not
have the skill or the authority to solve their problems. Further, IT professionals sometimes find it
necessary to explain why some problems have not been resolved.

         The IT departments in school comprise a wide range of professionals who are managed
by the chief information officer. Each IT professional applied specific expertise fulfil specific
roles for specific audiences (see table 1). Schools are organizations in which the titles applied to
IT positions are very inconsistent. In some schools a "technology coordinator" may serve as the
chief information office (as I define it below); while in a nearby school, a technology coordinator
may serve as a technician. For this reason, clean and accurate job descriptions are necessary to
ensure qualified applicants apply and are hired.

Chief Information Officer
         It is only recently that educational organizations have adopted the practice of using "c-

level" titles for those in management positions. The superintendent of schools is typically
recognized as the chief executive officer (CEO); that individual manages and leads a team of
senior leaders, such as the chief financial officer (CFO) who is responsible for the business

                                                              25
functions of schools, the chief academic officer (CAO) who is responsible for all aspects of
teaching and learning within school, and the chief operations officers (COO) who is responsible
for facilities management and similar functions, and the chief information officer (CIO) who is
responsible all aspects of the information technology systems within the school. These and others
comprise the senior school leadership team, and these individuals typically work in the central
office and are responsible for multiple schools in a school district.

         Of course, no c-level executive managers work and lead in isolation, so--at the highest
level--decisions are made to satisfy the needs and limitations of the entire organization. The c-
level manager is responsible to both advocate for the needs with their area of leadership, then to
implement decisions within that area. The role of the CIO in schools is to advise the other top-
level leaders on the nature of the existing technology, the steps necessary to maintain it, and the
potential changes that will improve it. Of the many responsibilities assigned to the CIO, perhaps
none is more important that those involved with installing and upgrading information networks
and securing them because of the nature of the data stored on them. The CIO also advocates for
financial and human resources to maintain those networks and supervises the professionals hired
to manage the network and all other devices.

         For much of the history of computers in schools, a single individual was allowed to
decide what technology to buy and how to install it. The rationale behind this practice was that
those individuals held quite specialized expertise, so educators and leaders were willing to defer
to those with greater expertise. In many cases, that method of decision-making led to technology
that was ineffective and even led to conflict as technology decisions were made for technology
reasons with little regard for the effects on teaching and learning. As CIO's have been integrated
into technology decision-making in schools, there has been a shift towards making technology
decisions for teaching and learning reasons, but that is not yet systemic.

         The individual who serves as they CIO in a school is likely to have qualifications similar
to the others on the senior leadership team. These individuals are likely to have advanced degrees
and years of experience managing technology; as the team of IT professionals becomes more
diverse, this individual provides directions and leadership more than they spend time configuring
devices or troubleshooting problems. When necessary, however, this individual will be found
assisting in whatever IT emergencies arise. Ideally, the CIO will have experience working in
schools as well, but many hiring committees opt for individuals with technology experience over
school experience.

     A colleague whose experience was as a teacher attended the first planning meeting of
     the search committee for a new CIO. Afterwards, he observed, "I thought we wanted
     someone with strong technology chops, but we have experts in that on the team. We
     want a good manager." I agreed and told him they were not going to get it at the
     advertised salary.

Technicians
         Technicians are the individuals who have one of the most important roles in school IT

system operations; these individuals are the face of the IT department to most members of the
school. A technician is likely to spend their day troubleshooting and repairing end user devices
including desktop computers, laptops, Chromebooks, printers, and other peripherals. Because
these professionals spend their time interacting with teachers and students, it is essential they

                                                              26
have excellent customer service skills and are comfortable interacting with teachers when they
are in stressful situations (due to malfunctioning computers) and with frustrated students.

         On those staffs with multiple technicians, the group can be very interdependent; they
collaborate on solving problems and they share what they have learned about the systems and the
users of systems. By documenting the repairs that they make (ideally in a ticketing system),
technicians contribute to the emerging knowledge of the IT system and help identify those
devices that need to be replaced. As professionals who understand IT and who observe users
interacting with it the most, technicians are also the first to identify potential problems that are
emerging and unmet needs that the CIO and other professionals must plan to address.

         Technicians may be hired with a wide range of qualifications. One can develop the
expertise they need to be a successful technician in many places other than traditional higher
education. Many school IT technicians are hired and begin work as they are completing their
education or they complete formal education or earn industry credentials while working.

         The CIO plays an active role in ensuring the technicians who are working in the school
receives the professional courtesies and the on-going support they deserve. Good CIO's support
technicians as they develop their knowledge of technology, and they serve as mentors and
models as technicians develop customer service skills and professional dispositions.

Technology Integration Specialists
         For decades, school leaders have recognized the need to provide IT training for teachers

and to help them learn how to teach with IT. The professionals responsible for organizing and
presenting in-service professional development for educators have used a variety of models for
delivering learning experiences for teachers to learn how to use technology. In recent decades,
technology integration specialists have emerged as a specialty within the teacher populations,
and one of their most important roles is to model and co-teach technology-based lessons in
classrooms with students and teachers present. This represents an important change in how
teachers learn to teach with technology, and these individuals fill an increasingly important role
on school IT teams.

     In 2017, a librarian and I were cleaning out a cabinet and found an old CD containing
     "Oregon Trail." Even though the disk indicated it was for Windows 98 and the
     copyright was 1998, we tried installing it on a computer with Windows 7 installed and
     were surprised it worked. A middle school teacher heard our excitement and took the
     disk to use in his classes. "My students are so going to write journals of their trips, just
     like I did!" he explained.

         Traditionally, teachers' professional development in technology-rich teaching resembled
all school-based teaching as it occurred outside of the "real world." Students are separated from
the situations in which they will communicate, create, and collaborate to learn how to do so;
teachers were removed from classrooms with real students and real curriculum to be trained in
how to use computers and how to learn how to teach with them. While the technology and the
curriculum were the same during professional development and teaching, the dynamics of
students who are engaged and learning is missing from those types of professional development
experiences.

         In idealized circumstances, technology integration specialists spend most of their time
supporting colleagues as they become competent, confident, and independent users of and

                                                              27
teachers with technology. Three common obstacles do interfere with the work. First, especially
in smaller schools, a technology integration specialist may have to fill this role on a part-time
basis and have other teaching responsibilities. This can introduce scheduling conflicts that can
limit opportunities to work with some other teachers. Second, the personal characteristics of
some teachers may lead him or her to become dependent on the support of the technology
integration specialists, so they will not use technology if the technology integration specialist is
not available. Third, because technology integration specialists are among the most visible
technology professionals in the school, they are often the first contact for initial troubleshooting
help. While this often leads to quick repairs and can lead to opportunities for both students and
teachers to receive lessons in troubleshooting, this work does direct technology integration
specialists away from their primary responsibility of mentoring teachers.

         A final mentoring role for technology integration specialists is to support IT professionals
as they develop experience creating systems to meet the unfamiliar needs of educational
populations. They advocate for teachers' and students' needs when IT professionals are
designing and configuring IT systems, and they interpret educational users' experiences, so the
IT professionals understand unmet needs and systems that are perceived to be too difficult to use
or ineffective.

         Technology integration specialists are almost always licensed teachers who began their
careers as classroom teachers, but who pursued additional training and education, to add this
certification to their portfolios. Just like all licensed educators, their individuals must maintain
their licenses, and most could return to the classroom if needed. Because they are educators, they
pose difficulties when it comes to supervision and evaluation. While they are often viewed as
part of the IT staff, and they work closely with those professionals, it is inappropriate for a CIO
who is not a licensed educator to supervise and evaluate licensed educators.

Data Specialists
         Schools store vast amounts of data in sophisticated databases. The expertise necessary to

prepare and run queries of the database so that questions regarding correlations and performance
can be answered requires much expertise. Often this work includes creating scripts that produce
tabular and graphic reports that are used to support decisions made by school administrators and
teachers. In addition, regulatory agencies have increased the data reporting requirements for
school in many jurisdictions that have accompanied calls for accountability associated with laws
enacted since the beginning of the 21st century. As a result, schools have begun hiring data
specialists as the amount of data and the sophistication of the databases has increased. The need
for this specialist arises from both the skills necessary to manage the demographic, health,
behavioral, academic, and other information that is housed in sophisticated databases and the
increasing demand for data-driven practices.

         These professionals represent one the first ventures into the field of educational data
analytics by schools. In this field, educators seek to apply the methods of data science to predict
student needs and performances. It should be noted that advocates for data analytics argue these
methods hold much promise for improving education, but those claims have not been
documented and observed by scholars in the field. Regardless of the degree to which the data are
affecting teaching decisions and long-term and desirable learning outcomes, schools are expected
to gather and use data so the need for data specialists is expected to increase.

                                                              28
System Administrators
         Once computer networks are installed and configured (usually in consultation with

external engineers and technicians), system administrators employed by the school ensure the
networks remain operational and functional. These professionals listen for network problems by
both attending to reports of malfunctions from users and by monitoring system logs, and they
both resolve problems that are identified, and they take steps to ensure the continued health of
the local area network.

         Among the specific responsibilities of system administrators is ensuring users and
devices can access network resources, configuring software to backup files and checking those
files are being created as expected, upgrading the operating system and driver software on the
servers, and otherwise maintaining network hardware and software. As cloud-based systems
have become more common, one of their most important roles in user management which often
includes ensuring single sign-on systems are connected and functioning. They also play an
important role in planning for and deploying software and hardware upgrades, and this individual
pays particular attention to potential conflicts that may be introduce when networks are changed.
In general, if changes are made to a device that contains or manages local area network traffic, it
is the system administrator who performs the task. This individual will also work closely with
technicians to ensure that use devices are properly configured to access the LAN and Internet.

         Most system administrators have completed an undergraduate degree in information
systems, and they are also likely to hold credentials awarded by IT vendors and professional
organizations. In many cases these credentials require effort and understanding that is
comparable to graduate certificates and graduate degrees in their field.

Web Masters
         Almost every school maintains a web presence. These serve as important venue for

sharing information with a wide range of internal and external audiences. Those who are
responsible for managing school web sites know the most important information that can be
posted in the cafeteria lunch menu. Most school web sites provide information and
announcements about curriculum, staffing, athletic and extracurricular events (including
practices and rehearsals and meetings), governance, and other school activities.

         Whereas teachers often maintained classroom web pages in previous decades, those have
largely been replaced with Google Classrooms (or a full learning management system) or a page
integrated into the student information system. These are spaces where students find resources
and assignments, parents and students can see grade reports, and all can access the classroom
news and announcements posted by the teacher. Once these spaces are configured, school IT
professionals, including the web master will not usually post information on classroom spaces.

         Many schools are integrating other platforms into their web presence as well. Often
interscholastic athletic leagues will ask (quite insistently) that all members use the preferred
platform to set schedules. These schedules can be embedded in the web pages of member
schools, and it can facilitate reporting of standings, scheduling of officials, and otherwise
managing the participation of school team in the competitions. As only one or two individuals in
the school need access to post to these sites, they usually handle that without intervention from
IT professionals. Once the web master has included the embed code for the schedule in the
school web site, changes made by the athletic director automatically appear on the school web
site.

                                                              29
         One of the more challenging aspects of managing a school web presence is handling
images of students. This is especially true on social media. Once images are posted to the web or
to social media, the person who posted it loses all control of it. Some maintain that once consent
has been secured from parents, then school employees can post images for any purpose. While
this may be legally defensible, it can be argued that children cannot give consent and they are the
individuals who may be most at risk because of information or images shared on the Internet, so
all adults should be very cautious when posting images.

     In November 2021, I posted a tweet in which I maintained it is inappropriate for
     teachers to post images of students on Twitter. It motivated more the 70 replies, some
     agreeing, and others challenging my position. A few days later, I reflected on my post
     and the replies. Visit the blog post (which contains the original tweet):

              https://hackscience.education/2021/11/12/thoughts-on-a-tweet/

                                                              30
3: Infrastructure in Schools

  For IT professionals, much of the IT infrastructure they encounter is schools is familiar. They
 find laptop and desktop computers being used as well as large numbers of Chromebook. These
devices connect to wireless networks that are used to connect to web-based data systems that are

                 used for all aspects of teaching and learning and school operations.

         When working in schools, IT professionals encounter many unfamiliar needs and face
unfamiliar requests and situations. The computers and other devices they manage for users, the
networks that oversee, and the data bases they manage--on the other hand--are likely to be
familiar. The computers, operating systems, network devices found in school are the same as the
ones installed in the offices, warehouses, and factories of other organizations. System
administrators use the same consoles, interfaces, and tools to configure them as IT professional
in all organizations. In this chapter, I describe the computing devices commonly found in
schools, the nature of the networks, and the commonly used data systems.

         One word of caution. Just as schools are localized workplaces, schools tend to be very
localized technology environments. Budgetary limits, the expertise of local personnel, and the
overall leadership structure of schools influence the infrastructure found in schools. Readers who
are familiar with the technology in local schools will find differences between what I describe
here and what is installed locally. Further, those with experience as IT professionals may find my
descriptions to be too broad. Remember, my goal is to help those who care about school IT will
not be surprised at what they find, and to help school leaders to understand the technology in
their schools.

         Early in the history of computers in schools, they typically purchased and supported only
one operating system. Schools were "Apple" schools or "IBM" schools; later they were
Macintosh or Windows schools. Ostensibly, decisions were made for financial reasons (PC's
were generally assumed to be less expensive than Macintoshes) or for educational reasons
("PC's are what students will use in the reals world" or "Macintoshes are easier to use"). The
reality is that many schools adopted the platform preferred by the first IT professionals hired by
the school.

     A colleague worked in a school system where the first computers were Apples, then
     Macintoshes. A tech-savvy teacher (who moonlighted as a computer salesman in a
     business selling Apple products) installed and managed the computers and servers. He
     became disgruntled and refused to turn over the administrator passwords for the devices
     he had installed. The school hired its first CIO and that individual was directed to never
     purchase Macintosh computers. That was decades ago, but the school district still does
     not allow the purchase of Macintosh computers.

User Devices
         Since the first desktop computers arrived in schools decades ago, several generations of

computers have been installed, and they reflect the changes we have seen in consumer
computers. It is probably more accurate to use the term devices to describe the hardware

                                                              31
available to users as many things the students and teachers use to interact with information and
other users are very dissimilar from the desktop computers that were first installed in schools.
The original desktop computers were box-like. Output was displayed on cathode ray tube (CRT)
monitors (usually in one color--often green or orange), keyboards were connected via cables,
and even applications and data was stored on disks keep in boxes.

         Near the end of the first decade of the 21st century, netbooks became popular in schools.
Those mobile computers with screens and keyboards smaller than standard laptops and with
limited memory and processing capacity compared to standard laptops with a full operating
installed. Compared to standard laptops, netbooks were inexpensive, so they were the device of
choice for many early adopters of one-to-one initiatives.

         iPads and other have not become widely used in schools. There are several reasons for
this, but traditional instructional uses (such as typing on full sized keyboards) and the difficulties
of managing the devices that are intended for single users for use by multiple users were among
the most cited reasons these devices never caught on in education. If there is anyone who uses
and iPad or tablet in education, it is likely to be a school administrator. The extreme mobility of
the devices makes them appealing to principals and other school leaders. In addition, many
special education teachers find the tactile nature of iPads and tablets to be a useful feature for
some of their students.

         Chromebooks--notebook computers that are used to connect to the Internet and all
functionality from user authentication to productivity and other applications provided by web-
based applications--are very popular in schools. It is difficult to know exactly what devices
compromise the fleet of devices in schools, but the popularity of Chromebooks can be traced to
the much lower price compared to computers with full operating systems. The price value of
Chromebooks is extended by the fact that software licensing is much lower compared to
applications for full operating systems. In addition, they are much easier to manage than other
devices. These advantages do come at the cost of computing capacity, however. The popularity
of Chromebooks has important implications for network design and management as well. Robust
and reliable wireless networks are essential in schools where user devices are mobile and full
productivity requires a connection to the internet.

One-to-One Computers
         In the United States, the Maine Learning Technology Initiative (MLTI) is recognized as

the first large-scale effort to provide school-owned computers to students. In 2002, middle
school students in the New England state were provided Macintosh laptops. Since then, one-to-
one initiatives have been widely adopted. In some schools, students are allowed to take their
devices home, while in others, the device stays at school and is used only during the school day
or in afterschool activities. Whether the devices leave campus or not, one-to-one computers are
laptop or notebook models.

         Obviously, the devices for one-to-one initiates represent a very significant technology
expense in schools (although enterprise networks can challenge for the most expensive
component of the IT system). In addition to the expense of obtaining the devices and licensing
software, the number of devices necessary represent the largest support need in the school. For
these reasons, it is not uncommon to find Chromebooks are provided under the one-to-one
initiative, and devices with full operating systems are available in much smaller numbers in
shared spaces. This affords teachers and students access to plentiful devices for those tasks in

                                                              32
which low-computing capacity is sufficient, but high-capacity devices are available for tasks that
demand it.

Desktop and Laptop Computers
         While Chromebooks are common especially in one-to-one situations, there are both

educational tasks that necessitate students and teachers have access to computers with full
operating systems and the applications that can be installed on them. There are also many users
in school business offices whose work or preferences require computers with full operating
systems.

         The computing devices provided to students need not be an either-or decision. Students
who are writing the school newspaper, for example, may compose stories and edit drafts on their
Chromebooks, but when it comes to layout the newspaper for printing, they may use computers
with desktop publishing software installed. This example illustrates the common situation in
which information can be created on almost any devices, but create a final product requires
capacity that is only available on an application that necessitates a full operating system.

         In addition to the desktop computer found in computer rooms, desktop computers with
full operating systems are found on the desks of many school employees who serve business or
administrative functions. Even if those users can perform most of their job functions by
accessing cloud-based systems, thus they could be done on a Chromebook, those users may
perceive computers with full operating systems to be necessary. This preference can be explained
by the ease of use, effectiveness, social influences, and habits which are factors affecting
technology acceptance (see page x).

Special Use Computers and Devices
         In addition to the fleets of computers maintained for populations such as students and

teachers, schools are places where special purpose computers and peripherals are found. In
makerspaces, science laboratories, studios, workshops, and other special teaching spaces, there
are computing devices necessary for specialized educational activities. Examples include:

          Arduinos--These microcontroller boards are inexpensive and use open-source
             software, so they are used in makerspaces and similar spaces in which students design
             and program digital devices.

          Robots--There are several organizations that sponsor robotics competitions for
             students, and these are also popular devices in makerspaces and in science technology
             engineering and mathematics (STEM) classrooms. IT professionals encounter a wide
             range of robots in schools as well. Elementary students may use toy-like robots while
             students in technical schools may use programmed logic control (PLC) devices for
             mechatronics applications in manufacturing classrooms.

          Printers--Much of the printing that happens in schools is high-volume and low-
             quality. Today, most print jobs in schools are directed to network-connected
             photocopiers that also serve as scanners. Many schools also provide limited access to
             color printers for specific purposes. Teachers may find it necessary to print some
             instructional materials in color, and digital arts classrooms may have printers
             specialized for printing photographs installed.

          3-D printers--Students in makerspaces and STEM classrooms are also likely to be
             gaining experience with additive manufacturing.

                                                              33
          Science apparatus--Teachers in science laboratories have adopted many digital data
             collection tools in recent decades. Interfacing devices allow various probes to be
             connected to software so that (for example) temperature can be collected and graphed
             in real time. In addition, familiar devices from the analog laboratory, such as
             microscopes, are now digital. Combined with a high-resolution display, these
             microscopes afford more specific instruction by teachers than traditional microscopes
             and students can capture images to use for more accurate analysis compared to the
             traditional methods.

          Assistive technologies--In order to access their education, some students need very
             specific hardware or software. Decisions about what assistive technologies are
             necessary are made on a case-by-case basis and a team of IT professionals, outside
             consultants, and special educators collaborate to identify, select, and deploy the
             necessary assistive technologies. In most cases, assistive technologies are for the
             exclusive use of individual students. They both need the device all of the time and it
             is unlikely to be needed by others.

     Few schools provide desktop printers as the marginal cost is much higher for these
     devices than for network-connected copiers. Recognizing the fact that special education
     teachers and school nurses manage very sensitive data, many school IT professionals
     will support printers or multi-function printers for those users in their offices and
     classrooms.

         The faculty and staff who work in the areas where special use devices are used often have
accounts that allow them to manage the devices they use. For example, librarians may be able to
configure and manage the hand-held scanners they use to manage circulation, science teachers
will be able to manage the laboratory interfacing peripherals they use, and art teachers may be
able to manage the color printers in their spaces. This allows those users to restore service more
quickly than if a technician is assigned to the repair, and it minimizes the demands for IT
professionals to manage single devices.

Interactive Whiteboards
         Another common piece of hardware one encounters in schools is interactive whiteboards.

When these whiteboards are connected to computers, they function as an input device. Teachers
and students can control the computer to which it is connected by tapping the board, and they can
draw on images, markup text documents or slide shows, or write or draw in other applications by
interacting with the whiteboard.

         Among both teachers and IT professionals, interactive whiteboards have both strong
advocates and detractors. For IT professionals, the devices are notoriously difficult to
troubleshoot and repair and they are unreliable compared to most other technology devices. A
colleague summarizes his perceptions of interactive whiteboards with his oft-repeated statement,
"if any device is going to fail, it is one of those." They also tend to have few user-serviceable
parts, so repairs often necessitate ordering replacement parts. These devices are also very
expensive compared to other computing infrastructure, so they tend to stay in service for a long
time, in many cases whiteboards are used past the "end of life" date of the manufacturer, so
catastrophic failures are not uncommon, and they can represent an unplanned significant IT
expense and a disruption if the teacher actually uses the interactive elements of the board.

                                                              34
         Many educators object to interactive whiteboards because they are placed in the front of
classrooms and displace regular whiteboards. If the interactive whiteboard isn't perceived to be
an improvement compared to a regular whiteboard, then it is less likely to be used and will be
perceived as a barrier to effective teaching. Others find interactive whiteboards to encourage
teachers to lecture at a time when the learning sciences are finding other instructional methods
are more effective than lecture.

     Story from the real world: Ms. Smith is a special education teacher in an elementary
     school. Her classroom was one of the last in the district to not have an interactive
     whiteboard installed. Several years earlier, the school had defined the goal of installing
     them in every classroom. Ms. Smith did not want the board. She had been taking some
     courses in which iPads were used in special education classrooms and she wanted to
     organize her classroom in the same way. She worked with the technology integration
     specialist to develop a proposal for obtaining the iPads and apps she needed and
     presented it to the principal and technology coordinator for the school. They rejected the
     proposal as and stated, "we are committed to the goal of SmartBoards in every
     classroom."

BYOD Devices
         To minimize the expense of one-to-one initiatives, some schools opt for bring your own

device (BYOD) initiatives. This finds schools encouraging students to bring devices they own to
school, connecting them to an SSID, and using them for their schoolwork. This can pose several
difficulties for IT professionals, security being the most important. Others raise concern about
equity as individuals may not be able to afford their own devices or may find it necessary to use
devices that have less capacity than others.

         Even in schools that do not have BYOD initiatives as an alternative to one-to-one
initiatives, the fact that students and teachers often bring their own devices to school can be a
challenge for school IT professionals. If they are connected to the local cellular network, there is
generally little reason to connect these to the school network, but guest SSID's may be provided
to allow some connection to the internet through the school's gateway.

         School IT professionals will not support devices they do not own, but in many cases, they
will recommend strategies for incorporating media on students' and teachers' devices into school
projects. For example, school IT professionals may recommend installing Google Workspace
apps on personal devices so that users can upload images or documents to their school accounts.

     Story from the real world: Kara was using one of the Macintosh computers in the
     multimedia studio during study hall. It was connected to the library and the technology
     integration specialist was preparing for a video editing lesson. Kara went into the
     history on her web browser and found pornographic web sites listed. She reported it to
     the technology integration specialist who confirmed the internet filter was still
     functioning, then he looked at Kara's computer and found that the technicians who had
     installed the computers had not disables the wireless network interface card (NIC) on
     the computers. To bypass the filter, someone had connected the Macintosh to a wireless
     hot spot on their phone. In this case, devices not owned by the school posed a potential

                                                              35
     threat to the school as the students may have exposed the school computer to malware
     along with the pornographic images.

         Many educators are concerned about students accessing their own devices while in school
as they can interfere with learning. It has become clear that human brains are unable to multitask,
so attending to incoming messages on their own devices may distract students from lessons. In
addition, because the devices bypass the filters maintained to comply with the Children's
Internet Protection Act, students may be accessing and sharing all types of unsavory information.

Networks
         Because Google Workspaces and cloud-based data systems are used for all aspects of

teaching and learning as well as school operations; secure, robust, and reliable network
infrastructure is vital to schools. For many decisions about what to install and how to configure
it, school IT professionals must engage educators and other stakeholders (this is considered in
detail in Chapter 7: IT Decision-Making in Schools), but the proper configuration of networks
must be entirely left to IT professionals.

         Essential to the operation of networks is a system for managing networks addresses and
routing of packets to the correct node. Managing pools of Internet protocols addresses that are
reserved for devices such as access points, printers, and other network devices, as well as
identifying the device that will function as the dynamic host configuration protocol server that
assigns IP addresses to end user devices that can operate efficiently regardless of its IP address.

         System administrators also configure Internet filters, firewalls, and malware protection to
protect the school network and secure the data stored on the school's systems. Unified threat
management is the term applied to the hardware and software systems marketed to those
responsible for enterprise IT systems to provide all varieties of network protection. Recall that
schools have responsibilities to protect data under FERPA and CIPA which may be unfamiliar to
IT professionals familiar with securing data and protecting networks for other organizations.

         Network administrators in schools manage user accounts in the same way they are
managed for other organizations. The organizational units (OU) managed by for school users are
dynamic in a manner the OU's for other business and industry are not. In addition to adding or
deleting users as they join or separate from the school, just like in other organizations, school IT
professionals must move large groups of students into new OU's at the end of school years.
Some of the biggest changes in the permissions in OU's occur when students transition from one
type of school to another (for example from middle school into high school).

         Because so many of the one-to-one devices deployed in schools are mobile, the enterprise
wireless networks in schools require managed access points which are typically configured to
provide multiple service set identifiers (SSID's). In schools, it is not unusual for there to be
highly controlled SSID's to which school-owned devices are connected. There may be different
SSID's for student devices, another for teacher devices, and a third for those used by
administrators. Parameters can be set to restrict types of network traffic allowed on the various
SSID's. For example, chat may be allowed on the SSID's used by teachers and administrators
but disallowed on those used by students.

         One of the challenges for school and technology leaders is addressing the number of
devices owned by faculty, staff, and students that are brought into schools. While it is reasonable
to have a "no personal devices on the network" rules (and many schools opt for that rule), other

                                                              36
schools recognize these devices can extend and enhance the capacity of existing IT resources, so
they will allow personal devices, but limit the demands theses place of the school's network
resources.

         In those schools where personal devices are allowed on the network, the IT professionals
will typically create an SSID that is open to public users, and that provides a pathway to the
Internet, but to no other local area network resources. Further the bandwidth available to devices
connected to that SSID is limited so that its users do not adversely impact connectivity for
school-owned devices.

Data Systems
         One of the most significant changes faced by information technology professionals in

schools (and other organizations) has been the adoption of cloud-based data and productivity
systems. Whereas previous generations of IT professionals configured servers that were
physically located on campus to provide necessary services (for example file storage and print
management) and they installed applications on hard drives of individual computers, current
generations often configure virtual servers and manage user accounts on cloud-based systems.

         Schools make significant use of software as a service (SaaS) tools for productivity tools,
educational purposes, and business services. Google Workspaces is the dominant example, but
tools such as the student information system and the library catalog are also provided as SaaS..
The common descriptor for this type of system in "cloud-based" as users connect to a virtual
space on the Internet, but the specific location is uncertain. There other instances in which
schools will contract with vendors such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) provide highly
configurable systems that can be used to replicate many of the same functions that used to be
configured on physical servers; these are commonly called platforms as a service (PaaS), and
they can also accurately be labeled "cloud-based" as the virtual location is clear, but the physical
location is not. The benefits of both SaaS and PaaS service systems are:

          Security--Cloud providers employ legions of security professionals to protect their
             data centers. While most SaaS platforms configure their systems in a manner that
             minimizes the potential for insecure configurations, PaaS services ensure security of
             the data centers, but the subscriber is responsible for the security of the software and
             programs they install.

          Scalability--System administrators can log on to their administrative dashboard of
             their cloud-based platform and request additional capacity which is usually available
             in minutes. That additional capacity does increase the fees, of course.

          Redundancy--The data and systems stored on cloud-based systems can be easily
             duplicated. Depending on the exact configuration, systems can be copied with a few
             mouse clicks; this allows both duplicate services and automated backups. As a result,
             essential systems can be restored immediately if service is interrupted.

          Minimize capital expenses--Data centers are very expensive to build, maintain, and
             secure. The expense can be larger than anticipated because it is always necessary to
             build extra capacity into the system, plus it is necessary to provide air conditioning
             and other supports to ensure the servers operate as expected. When using cloud-based

                                                              37
             systems, IT professionals can "spin up" servers without the need to purchase,
             configure, and protect hardware.

         While SaaS and PaaS systems remove hardware from school data centers, the system
administrators employed by schools do continue to manage users and applications. Among the
most important responsibilities is user management--typically the users are grouped into
organizational units which has been the standard practice for generations of system
administrators--and the schools want to ensure only their current students, faculty, and staff can
access the systems. They also identify which tools and features are available to the different
organizational units.

         Cloud-based systems are all built on very sophisticated databases. School IT
professionals are often involved with managing the interoperability of different systems. For
example, they may manage a learning management system that is connected to the student
information system so that grades reported in the LMS are automatically sent to the SIS. This
does require the involvement of programmers from the vendors, but once the connections are
established, local system administrators manage them.

         From the user's perspective, using a cloud-based system is not unlike using files and
applications installed on the local hard drive or the local area network, except for the fact that
cloud-based computing starts with the web browser. When using them, all users:

          Connect to the internet--Cloud -based systems are available on every device that is
             connected to the Internet.

          Point their web browser to the URL of the platform--Most schools provide a
             portal or web page where students, faculty, staff, and others can find links to the SaaS
             and PaaS platforms. This facilitates users finding the exact links they need as the
             network locations of the cloud systems can vary depending on how the school's web
             domain is configured and how the vendor permits naming. One of the potential
             challenges for user of the cloud is that different web browsers (Google Chrome,
             Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, among others) handle the code used to create the
             cloud-based systems differently. This means systems may function differently on
             different web browsers, and it may even fail on some browsers. Some features may
             not be available to those who connect using a mobile device (the operating systems
             and web browsers on smartphones and tablets lack all the capacity of those on full
             operating system devices), but vendors do provide apps that provide the full
             functions.

          Log on--Access to cloud systems requires one to have an account on the platform.
             System administrators have options for managing users, including creating users one
             at a time or uploading spreadsheet files with user accounts define (which is not
             recommended for many reasons) or connecting existing user accounts across
             platforms. Because Google Workspaces is so widely used, many system
             administrators will create "customer keys" and "shared secrets" (that is actually what
             they are called) so that student, faculty, and staff can use their Google Workspaces
             credentials to log on to other platforms.

                                                              38
         Access the tools and data they have been given permission to use--Once users are
             authenticated, they see the data they have permission to see and can access the tools
             they have permission to use.

     When I was responsible for managing the virtual classrooms system at a community
     college, we paid Blackboard to host our installation on the learning management. When
     our users were "on Blackboard," they were connecting to Blackboard's servers on data
     centers several hundred smiles away from campus. Whenever the region where our
     primary data center had severe weather predicted, I received an email from Blackboard.
     In the email, the company reminded us that our system was replicated on two other data
     centers, each on a different continent. If the primary data center failed because it lost
     power, then our users would be pointed to one of the other copies of our courses and
     data.

         Another option for accessing application and data that is available, although it is less
widely used in K-12 schools than it is in higher education, is a virtual desktop. This finds a user
pointing their web browser to the tool (usually on a portal available only to authenticated users)
that launches a virtual computer that has a full operating system and applications available, and
the use interacts with it just as they do a "real" computer with the operating system and
applications.

Google Workspaces
         Since it was introduced in 2005, then made available to schools at no cost a few years

later, "Google Docs" has changed the educational technology landscape. Since then, the platform
has undergone nearly continuous upgrading and updating, and renaming. In 2022, it is called
Google Workspaces and the basic level of service which includes productivity tools, file storage,
email and calendaring, and other tools continues to be provided to educational institutions at no
cost.

         The basic service can be supplemented with a paid version of Google Workspaces. The
capacity of the applications can also be enhanced and extended by add-ons, some of which are
free (or available as freemium) others of which require a subscription. It is the responsibility of
school IT professionals to manage the tools that are available, the add-ons, and the tools used to
integrate Google Workspace files into the other systems provided by the school.

         Many educators have their own accounts on the consumer version of Google
Workspaces, so they are experienced with its features and functions. The features and operations
of the consumer and education versions of the platform are similar, the advertisements and data
tracking that are unavoidable to consumers are disabled for school users. The familiarity of
Google Workspaces independently of the school system can introduce some difficulties that must
be negotiated. The complaint, "but I can do this on my personal account" is commonly heard by
those who manage the school's Google Workspace must address.

         Almost every IT professional hired into a position in a school will be expected to have
some level of expertise using Google Workspaces to create and manage information. They are
also expected to have some level of expertise managing users and organizational units and
configuring services on Google Workspaces.

                                                              39
     In a 2021 article, Kruta, Smits, and Willhelm conducted a technoethical audit of Google
     Workspaces for Education. The scholars introduced the article by observing, "there is
     scant criticism of Google in educational technology literature, and they have faced little
     scrutiny in schools where Chromebooks, browsers, apps, search engines and more are
     used by students. Just as with users outside schools, we are concerned with what Google
     is taking from students (e.g., personal data), how it is targeting them (e.g., advertising,
     product familiarity), and where it is directing them (e.g., search and recommendation
     algorithms)" (p. 421). They then sought to answer questions about the ethics of its
     design and use, the unintended consequences of its use, and the limitations educators
     accept when it is used. While the authors do not suggest educators take a stand for or
     against the use of Google Workspaces, they do conclude, "Schools should not be places
     where educational technology titans exploit students, test new products, or reimagine
     education through their own techno-corporate ideals of personalization, efficiency, and
     profits" (p. 428).

Student Information Systems
         Schools are organizations that require information to be kept about students; this data

supports both internal operations as well as reporting to external entities which has gained
importance in the decades since No Child Left Behind was adopted. The student information
system is the term applied to the databases that are designed to collect, store, and report
information associated with students' school experience.

         The SIS is a large database that contains multiple tables related to students' attendance,
courses enrollments, academic performance, health, discipline, and other records. Many SIS will
also contain tables and tools to facilitate scheduling. Because many SIS are available on the
cloud, parents and others can access the SIS. I many ways, the SIS is the most essential IT
system maintained by the school IT professionals.

         In addition to ensuring robust, reliable, and secure networks so that users can have
uninterrupted access to the SIS, IT professionals play several roles specific to the SIS. They
ensure user accounts are accurate; in most cases, this includes ensuring a single sign on tool is
configured and secured. They work with registrars and others to ensure data are accurately
entered when students are registered and that data are sent to other schools when students leave.
They also write scripts and set other controls to ensure data are available and analyzed in a
manner needed by regulators and by internal audiences.

         There are a number of vendors that provide students information systems for schools. The
SIS that has been selected and deployed depends on many factors, and it is not unusual to find
SIS that have been used for many years in schools. IT professionals are likely to be asked about
their experience supporting the one that is in use. Some schools have replaced traditional grades
with "standards-based report cards" which has necessitated modification of the SIS.

                                                              40
Learning Management Systems
         Virtual classrooms took on particular importance to teachers and students with the quick

pivot to remote teaching necessitated by the COVID pandemic. Even before that, however,
virtual classrooms were being managed by school IT professionals and teachers were using them
to extend their classrooms and enhance information sharing and interaction. Like other cloud-
based infrastructure in schools, the learning management system (LMS) managed by school IT
professionals are usually provided by a vendor as a service.

         Learning management systems are used to recreate many classroom functions commonly
found in face-to-face classrooms. Access to the classroom is restricted to those who are enrolled
as teachers or students (or other roles) and different users have permissions appropriate for their
role. For example, students can upload assignments or take tests, but cannot see others'
submissions or test attempts. While the exact features depend in the LMS that is used and how it
is installed and configured (including what optional features are enabled), every LMS provides
features to allow:

          Sharing information--When using an LMS teachers never have to worry about
             students saying "I lost the paper," as they can log on to the LMS and get a new copy.
             In addition to word processing documents, multimedia presentations, audio, video,
             and portable document format (PDF) files, teacher can create pages with links,
             embedded media, and other items. The what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIYG)
             hypertext markup language (html) editor available in LMS's include equation and
             chemistry editors and other tools that allow teachers to create sophisticated pages,
             including embedded media and cloud-based files.

          Interact--Discussion boards, wiki, blogs, chat, and other tools for online interaction
             are available on LMS's as well. These are used to replicate the information sharing
             and knowledge building that happens in face-to-face classrooms, although the
             asynchronous nature of some of these tools does change the dynamics of the
             interaction for student and teachers.

          Administer tests--One of the most useful tools in any LMS is the ability to create
             test that can include many different types of questions. For many teachers, the most
             useful are those that can be graded by the LMS (assuming, of course that the correct
             answers are accurately identified). Setting up online tests can be a very labor-
             intensive endeavor, as there can be significant individual data elements that must be
             input, but once the test is created, it can be shared, edited, remixed, and reused.

          Collect assignments--Digital drop boxes are also one of the most useful tools in an
             LMS. Using this tool, instructors define an assignment and create a digital drop box
             in which students can upload a file that contains their submission. The problem of lost
             assignments or students arguing, "I handed it in, you lost it," are avoided by using and
             LMS to collect all assignments.

          Record grades--The gradebook in every LMS can record and display items from
             tests and assignments with grades associated (and grades can be automatically
             recorded for those items). Teachers can also add columns to the gradebook to record

                                                              41
             items that are done offline. Teachers can further organize the gradebook by assigning
             grade items to categories, setting weights to categories, adding calculated columns,
             and setting display conditions for items. Gradebooks are notoriously complicated, in
             many cases because the language used to describe the configuration is unfamiliar to
             teachers.
         Google Classroom is the LMS associated with Google Workplaces. Because of the
dominance of Google and the fact it is integrated into the productivity suite used by the teachers
and students, many adopt it. Some teachers who have experience with a full learning
management system either as a student or as a teacher find Google Classrooms to be too limited
to accomplish much they want to do.
         There are multiple full-feature LMS's available, both as open-source packages and as
proprietary packages. Full learning management systems include platforms such as Moodle,
Blackboard, Canvas, Desire 2 Learn, among many others. The selection of the LMS is made
based on several considerations. While Moodle is often chosen because it is available for free,
the cost of installing it on a server (either one in the school or a virtual server on the cloud) can
introduce unanticipated costs. Other considerations include familiarity which can increase the
perceived ease of use for both teachers and LMS administrators. Perhaps the most important
consideration is the degree to which the IT professionals, including the technology integration
specialists and other instructional leaders are prepared to provide support, training, and design
guidance.

                                                              42
4: Supporting School IT Infrastructure

 IT professionals working in schools can use many of the same tools and strategies to keep IT in
     good repairs as they use on other businesses and organizations. Clear communication is

  particularly important for those supporting IT in schools, as devices tend to be used by more
   users and for many purposes in schools than they are in other businesses and organizations.

        Good customer service is as important for school IT professionals as it is for all IT
                                                  professionals.

         The role of IT professionals in schools is to keep the infrastructure operational for
students and teachers and other users. This may seem a silly statement as that is their role in all
organizations. The same factors that make schools unfamiliar places for many IT professionals
who are designing and managing technology systems also make them unfamiliar places for
providing IT support.

         One of the most important differences between supporting school IT and supporting IT in
business or industry is the relatively low impact of malfunctioning IT in schools. While IT is
essential to teaching and schooling, and no IT professional wants their systems to be "down," the
circumstances of schools are different then in business. Many valuable teaching lessons can
occur for short time without IT, and the extreme impact of financial loss that is common during
business outages is absent in schools. The low impact nature notwithstanding, IT support is an
important aspect of IT professionals' work in schools.

         School users are notorious for waiting until the last minute to get the help they need. If,
for example, a teacher calls and asks for assistance getting a YouTube video to play through their
classroom projector, you can assume there is a classroom full of students awaiting the video.
Triaging such situations can be difficult as the teacher may be very anxious, and no IT
professional wants to seem unresponsive.

         School users are also notorious for being on either extreme of the need for support. On
one hand there are the students and teachers who believe they can resolve many problems and
they are willing to try to fix problems. While these users can often resolve many problems by
themselves, they can also attempt to resolve issues they should not, and they often find
workarounds that decrease their efficiency. On the other hand, there are the users who will not
attempt any troubleshooting and will call for technicians whenever anything goes wrong.

         School users are further well-known for trading reliability and ease of use for advanced
functionality. Also, many school users will use only a fraction of the tools and features available
in the applications they use. IT professionals know that systems can be configured to perform
many more functions than are typically used. Such configurations can increase the complexity of
using the systems and make them less reliable from the perspective of the user. In many cases,
teachers would prefer IT systems that are less complex and provide fewer features if what is
provided is very reliable (it is always available) and robust (it is reliable even when many users
are connected). Recognizing this can help IT professional avoid using time and resources to
deploy and train users on features that will not be used.

         In this chapter, I describe some of the strategies that are useful for providing effective IT
support in schools.

                                                              43
Standardization of IT
         Schools are characterized by large numbers of users all with similar technology needs.

For example, in a school enrolling 500 students in the middle grades and providing one device
for each student, IT staff will need to prepare 500 identical devices. Deploying identical devices
is particularly important for school populations as teachers must plan for all students to have
similar capacity and they need to be able to support their students. Of course, the widespread use
of Google Workspaces reduces the need to license and configure many types of software than
previous generations of IT professionals found necessary. Updating Chromebooks, for example,
requires only a few mouse clicks; far less work and much quicker than updating a full operating
system.

         Generations of technicians in schools managed devices that had full operating systems
through imaging and freezing. Imaging means a technician would configure a computer in the
manner they needed, then make a copy of the hard drive. Similar devices in the fleet that needed
the same configuration would then receive a copy of that imaged hard drive. The technicians
then updated the name of the device to allow for easier remote management and ensured
software was properly licensed before deploying the device. The widespread adoption of could-
based systems has reduced the need for IT staff to customize installations for different teachers
and other professionals, which has reduced the task of managing devices.

         Freezing means the system is configured as the technician intends, then put into the
frozen state. Whenever the computer is restarted, it returns to the frozen state and all changes that
have been made (except for some documents if the system is properly configured) are discarded.
While this approach to managing computers has become lesson common for a number of
reasons, it is still used in some circumstances to reduce maintenance demands on fleets of
computers in schools.

Triage
         IT systems fail; all IT professionals (and all IT users) know this. The reality is that the "to

do" list for IT professionals in schools is often too long to allow immediate resolution of failed
system. Further adding to the reality is that not all failed systems can or even should be fixed,
and many IT professionals find teachers are very reluctant to abandon old systems that provide a
useful and familiar instruction application.

         When triaging and scheduling work in schools, IT professionals seek to keep existing
systems operational while planning for updates and replacements that will reduce the need to
keep aging systems operational. This sometimes requires balancing reaction repairs to proactive
improvements, and time used for one is not available for the other.

     When being interviewed for any IT position in a school, you can expect to be asked
     how you prioritize what gets fixed.

         All IT professionals understand that one of the most important things to do to do after
starting a new position in IT support is to identify "the complainers." These are the people who
give the best feedback on the functionality of the systems, they raise concerns immediately (as
opposed to other users who try to manage with less-than-optimal technology), and they tend to
be the individuals who use the systems the most and for the most purposes. The IT professional
who can satisfy this group will generally be perceived to be responsive and effective.

                                                              44
         IT professionals must develop skill in triaging calls for IT support to decide what gets
immediate attention and what waits until later. Unfortunately, there are no rules that guarantee
the correct triage decisions will be made. Many factors which are described in this section affect
triage decisions, and the situation given high priority one day may be given a lower priority
another.

Safety
         It is an unfortunate reality that IT can be used to create unsafe situations. If there are

threats, bullying, or other potential unsafe situations and your expertise is needed to document,
investigate, and remove those threats, that needs to be given highest and immediate priority.

     During the weeks when an assistant principal was dealing with a particularly serious
     cyberbullying situation (it was sufficiently serious that the police were involved), he
     would ask me to "help fix the color printer in his office" if I was working with or near
     students or teachers. He did not have a color printer, so we arranged this code so he
     could request immediate help without drawing attention. When he used that phrase, I
     knew that I should secure whatever I was working on and go directly to his office.

Legality
         It is also unfortunate that IT can be associated with situations that can present legal

liability. These may be associated with unsafe situations, but they can also be associated with
human resource issues or other circumstances in which safety is not threatened but data needs to
be secured or actions documented. These also receive highest priority. When dealing with issues
related to safety or legal issues, no IT professional should be working without school
administrators participating in the decision-making; ideally, they would be present when any
work was being done and they will both direct the IT professional and also receive frequent and
detailed updates on what is happening.

Large Numbers
         One standard criterium for prioritizing IT troubleshooting in all organizations is "fix the

problem that will get the most users back up." This rule of thumb applies in school as well.

One-Time Events
         Teachers often arrange for their students to have special one-time only opportunities.

Before the COVID pandemic, field trips and guest speakers were common one-time events. As
video conferencing platforms gained popularity in the years before COVID, these events were
increasingly technology-based. Because these events cannot be easily rescheduled and because
they represent very valuable opportunities for students, these should be given high priority when
they are scheduled.

Students
         Because schools are hierarchical organizations, certain stakeholders can be understood to

be of higher priority. It seems reasonable that school administrators should be given the highest
priority as they are the most politically empowered individuals. It is difficult to justify this
decision, however. Whenever I am faced with prioritizing and one of the problems has direct

                                                              45
impact on students, then that one goes to the top of my priority list. It should be noted that not all
who are in leadership positions or teaching positions agree with my priorities.

     In several interviews for technology leadership positions, I have made it clear that
     students and teachers receive priority when I triage IT problems. I could tell by the
     expressions of the administrators on the committee, that they did not agree. Those
     expressions were also my cue that I should be brief with my answers through the end of
     the interview.

Beginnings and Ends
         School schedules are periodic. At the transition between school years and marking

periods, there are some information tasks that must take priority. For example, ensuring class
rosters are accurate, attendance can be recorded, and grades can be reported are among the tasks
that must be reliably and quickly accomplished at these times. For this reason, ensuring the
student information system is functional and accurate is the highest priority at those times.
Because these are scheduled well in advance, many IT professionals will be sure to minimize
scheduling other high-demand events to coincide with beginnings and endings of school years
and marking periods.

Ticketing and Scheduling
         Two IT functions in school that are necessary for the efficient operation of IT

departments in schools are a help ticketing system and a system for scheduling shared resources.
These functions are not unique to schools and the platforms used for ticketing and scheduling for
other organizations can be deployed in schools as well. The one difference between deploying
these platforms in schools and in other organizations is that the budget for these types of
platforms is the limited budget in schools. Especially in smaller schools, IT professionals in
schools may use open-source platforms or they may use freemium editions of paid versions.

Ticketing
         In many organizations, when users encounter problems with technology, they are

expected to use an online platform to report the problem. Because the ticketing system sends the
report to the IT department, there are multiple advantages, including improved communication
within the IT department and communication between IT professionals and other stakeholders
and centralized inventory and repair documentation:

          Users can report malfunctioning devices with little effort, so the system facilitates
             communication from users to IT staff. Most IT managers place a link to "create a
             ticket" in multiple places that computer users frequently visit (the school web page,
             the LMS, and other portals), or they create an email address to accept help tickets.
             Ideally, the ticketing system is part of the collection of tools that use a single sign-on
             scheme, so submitting a ticket does not require one to log on to a different system.

          The technicians can triage and assign malfunctioning devices and decide the best
             use of their limited resources. While the individual who submits the ticket can usually
             assign a priority to the repair, the technicians can override those settings, and repairs

                                                              46
             that will affect a greater number of users or that restore critical systems can be given
             higher priority. Within IT departments, there are individuals with different levels of
             skill and different levels of access. This is not always understood outside the
             department. Using a ticketing system allows the IT professionals to assign the correct
             person to the problem.

          A history of each device is maintained. Devices that are troublesome and require
             repeated repairs are known. Likewise, technicians can track similar problems
             throughout the fleet. This is particularly helpful when a design or hardware (or
             software) problem affects the same model; steps taken to resolve a problem on one
             unit are likely to resolve the same problem on other units. In this point and the
             previous point, there are examples of how the system facilitated communication
             among the IT staff.

          Ticketing systems also provide a database on which the inventory can be kept up to
             date. This helps IT professionals understand their fleet and it helps leaders understand
             the need to plan and budget for replacement devices.

          The total number of repairs performed by technicians and the time they spend on
             them can be recorded in the ticketing system. This information is used to assess the
             efficiency and effectiveness of the systems, so that support can be improved by
             refining systems and by supporting those who manage, train, and support IT staff. In
             this point and the previous point, there are examples of how the system facilitated
             communication between IT staff and school administrators.

         There are potential difficulties with using help ticket systems as well.

          Help tickets do take time to process. If a teacher has a malfunctioning projector (for
             example) and they need it immediately, then they need assistance immediately.
             Submitting a help ticket to a system that doesn't result in an immediate response is
             unlikely to be done for this situation. Such requests do interfere with scheduled work
             and can decrease the efficiency of IT repairs efforts.

          If the problem interferes with network access, the users may not be able to submit
             the help ticket. This can contribute to excessive frustration among users.

          One of the other difficulties with help ticketing systems is that some can generate an
             inordinate number of email messages which can end up interfering with the
             effectiveness of the communication. It is not unusual to hear users complain, "there
             are so many emails, I just ignore them" when giving feedback on the ticketing system
             used by IT support.

Scheduling
         Prior to the wide-spread adoption of one-to-one initiatives, most computing resources in

schools were shared. As a result, it was necessary to adopt a strategy for scheduling time in the
computer room, presentation spaces with high-quality projectors, and similar resources that

                                                              47
existed in small numbers. Since one-to-one computing has become the norm in schools, the need
to share computing resources has reduced, but there are still situations in which individuals or
groups may need to reserve time when they can use shared computers or devices. Increasingly,
the shared computing resources are human resources rather than computing resources. For
example, teachers may schedule time with technology integration specialists or other IT
professionals to provide additional support while they and their students are creating with
unfamiliar technology.

         To facilitate scheduling or reserving these shared technologies, IT professionals install
and maintain room booking systems. Effective tools for this purpose make the schedules public,
so they can be viewed on the internet without logging on or passing through other barriers. The
most effective schedules will be mobile-compatible, so the harried teacher who is finalizing
plans for the day can say to a student, "hey, go check the schedule to see if we can print our
posters in the computer lab today." Once a student confirms the resource has not been scheduled
by another, the teacher can log on to the system to add a reservation, but not edit others'
reservations. Further, each account can have specific permissions so that he or she can reserve
only the resources appropriate for the user. For example, only those who have received training
in using the 3-D printer are allowed to schedule time on it, or only those teachers whose courses
necessitate special software can reserve certain computer rooms.

         One of the difficulties that is commonly encountered with using scheduling tools in
schools is the unusual time increments that characterize the daily schedules in many schools.
While many scheduling tools are designed for businesses that are likely to break days into 15-
minute increments, schools break days in various chunks, and it is not unusual for different days
to be divided into different chunks. Further, some schools have multiple bell schedules, for
example in schools enrolling students in grades 7-12 (which are common in some regions) will
have one schedule for students in grades seven and eight, and another for students in grades nine
through 12. IT managers can increase the use of scheduling tool by making them easy to use,
including allowing users to select time blocks on the schedule that correspond to the daily
schedule blocks used in the school.

Customer Service
         Many school populations (including administrators and teachers) object to the use of

"customers" when referring to others in schools. While the term may seem inappropriate for the
collaborative and interdependent stakeholders in schools, the concept of customer service and the
characteristics of customer-service oriented IT professionals are applicable in schools as much as
they are in businesses that serve customers in the traditional sense of the word. A customer-
service orientation is grounded in empathetic communication with one's clients and the clients'
perceptions that their problems are being resolved in a timely manner.

         For IT professionals working in schools, creating a customer-service orientation is
challenging because of the differences in language describing technology operations and
malfunctions (see the story about environments on page x) and the belief of some that their needs
are of highest priority. Of course, these are not unique to school populations, but are particularly
acute in schools. In this section, I describe how a customer-service orientation can be nurtured
throughout the process of reporting a problem through its resolution.

                                                              48
Reporting the Problem
         One of the perennial problems for all IT professionals is that users often do not accurately

describe the problems they are encountering. This problem can be particularly acute in schools as
the systems are much more variable than business systems and the teachers and students use IT
for diverse activities. For these reasons, when IT users in schools identify and report a problem,
the IT professional who first deals with it must make sure they accurately understand the
symptoms; this is the first step in providing good customer service. One barrier to this
understanding is the use of vernacular or inexact or inaccurate language.

         One of the advantages of more users being experienced with video conferencing is their
capacity to connect and share screens with remote technicians. This will ensure both the
technician accurately understands the symptoms and the user is confident the technician
understands them. Of course, this assumes the system works enough to allow the video
conferencing system to operate.

     A teacher reported was using an app installed on iPads for students to access a specific
     cloud-based instructional platform. The teacher reported, "the app won't take" on one of
     the iPads. The IT technician who received this help ticket called the teacher to ask for
     more details. The teacher reported "it just won't take" and the technician was unclear if
     the app was installed or not or if the student was unable to log on to the app. In this
     case, the teacher was unable to provide an accurate description of the problem, so the
     technician accepted responsibility for figuring it out. The technician asked, "where is
     the iPad right now?" and "when will your students need it next?" and indicated they
     would "take a look" before the teacher planned to use the app again with students.

         While they should avoid demonstrating insincere empathy, IT professionals should
confirm to the reporter that the problem exists and that it is interfering with the ease of use or
effectiveness. When the user believes that technicians agree the computer is not working as
expected and that this is a problem worth solving, they will have a sense that technician is
providing good customer service.

         Understanding the problem does require the IT professional to be an active listener and,
in many cases, to observe the difficulty that the user is experiencing. Once the difficulty has been
accurately identified, IT professionals who demonstrate good customer service skills assume
responsibility and give the reporter an approximate timeline. When a color printer stops working
as a teacher is preparing for an open house, they will appreciate hearing "it needs more toner, I'll
be right back with it" or "the power supply failed, this printer needs to be replaced" rather than
simply "yes, its broken, we will take a look at it." Even if the news is not what the teacher
wanted to hear, at least they can make alternative plans for their classes, if necessary.

Resolving the Problem
         As will be detailed in Chapter 7: Making IT Decision in Schools, keeping IT systems

functioning in schools requires the systems be understood from the perspective of teacher and
students (to decide what is appropriate), school administrators (to decide what is reasonable), and
IT professionals (to decide what is proper). When it comes to deciding if malfunctioning
computers can be repaired, if they should be repaired, and how they should be repaired, IT
professionals must make decisions.

                                                              49
     IT professionals have a long history of "blaming the user." While the root cause of
     some malfunctioning devices is users not knowing what to do or what to expect,
     blaming them is one way to assure your customer service reputation will suffer.

         Because so many IT problems one encounters in schools are unfamiliar and because the
teachers and students who are the primary IT users in schools are so diverse in their interests and
needs, the steps necessary to resolve them are often unique. This requires IT professional to be
adaptable to the specific needs. Adaptability includes both recognizing the needs as being unique
and worthy of being solved as well as being knowledgeable and creative in solving the problems.

Avoiding Cold Closure
         Cold closure refers to the practice of resolving IT problems, and closing the ticket,

without communicating to the individual who reported it (and in some cases to the larger
audience) that the problem has been resolved. Most ticketing systems will send an email to the
individual who submitted it when and IT professional "closes" it after it has been resolved. This
is intended to signal that the issue has been resolved and the system is operational.

         Relying on the ticketing system to communicate to the reporter the system is fixed can be
problematic for several reasons:

          If the ticketing system generates multiple messages, the message may be ignored.

          The potential for "ticket closed" emails to be ignored is even more problematic in
             educational populations who have difficulty managing email messages and also for
             those who submit multiple help tickets.

          Help tickets are often ignored or resolved, but not closed. If multiple teachers, for
             example, report problems with printing it may be resolved, but closing the multiple
             tickets is not done (as the over-worked technicians focus on resolving problem rather
             than managing tickets). These tickets may stay open for a long time (weeks or
             months) which contributes to the sense that "IT never responds to tickets," or old
             tickets are cleaned out all at once which generates irrelevant messages to those who
             reported problems.

         The ambiguous communication that can result from relying on the ticketing system to
communicate with individuals about close tickets can be particularly problematic in school
populations because of the miscommunication of the nature of the problems between educators
and technicians. For this reason, the best customer service-oriented IT professionals in schools
seek to be as "warm" as they can be when closing tickets. The metaphorical temperature of how
an issue is closed is based on the nature of the communication and the degree of confirmation. A
cold closure relies on technology to communicate the ticket is closed and there is no
confirmation that the ticket is closed. When the communication is more personal (ultimately
delivered in-person) and when the IT profession confirms the issue is resolved (ultimately by
observing the teacher use the operational system), the metaphorical temperature increases, and
perceived level of customer service improves as well.

                                                              50

Figure 1. Cold closure to warm closure

         The message communicated in the closure matters to users' perceptions of customer
service as well. When the technician believes the issue has been resolved, they should make sure
the user is clear that it has been fixed. Especially in situations in which there may be inaccurate
or incomplete understanding of the symptoms, the IT technician may perceptive the problem has
been fixed, but the symptoms may remain for the user. In this case, the user may assume the
problem has not yet been resolved. Good customer service is promoted by closing repair jobs by
telling the user, "this has been fixed, if it comes back, let us know immediately."

Interactions
         "Difficult" interactions between IT users and IT professionals are not unique to schools.

The difficulties can arise from users' frustrations that IT is interfering with their abilities to do
their work, the perceptions that their priorities are not receiving proper attention, and other
factors. In many cases, the IT professionals contribute to the difficulties by failing to understand
the symptoms described by the users, the tendency to project their level of familiarity on to users
(things we find easy, they find difficult and that is your problem, not theirs), and the tendency of
many IT professionals to blame the users. The most customer service-oriented IT professional
will display:

          Empathy without being patronizing--Users who report IT problems want the sense
             the technicians understands the problem and it taking is seriously, but over scripted
             statements like "I'm sorry that happened" that appear insincere interfere with the
             perceptions that the technician is displaying good customer service.

          The ability to not take criticism personally--All IT professionals are going to
             encounter users who are frustrated at malfunctioning technology and who are unable
             to manage that frustration, so they will direct unwarranted criticisms towards the IT
             professionals who is present to resolve the issue. The best IT professionals realize the
             situation and will overlook unwarranted personal criticism. Of course, workplace
             bullies are not uncommon, and the best school and IT leaders will recognize those
             individuals and address them before drastic human resource interventions are
             necessary.

                                                              51
 Clear and professional communication--IT professionals who display good
    customer service skills are active listeners; they will ask questions to seek
    clarification and use comments and cues to have users who are reporting problems to
    give them sufficient details that they accurately understand the symptoms. Many also
    find this active listening increases the users' sense of empathy from the technicians.
    IT professionals who display good customer service skills can also explain what the
    problem is and how they intend to fix it along with a timeline in clear and appropriate
    language. Most IT users do not care to hear all the details of the problem and the
    solutions, especially if the details are filled with jargon, but they do appreciate
    knowing what they can expect.

 Calm and approachable tone--When users believe IT professionals are pleasant
    people with whom to interact and they will not be criticized or ridiculed, they will
    perceive the IT professional to have greater customer service skills.

                                                     52
5: Users in Schools

The users in schools are unlike the IT users in other businesses and industries. Those differences
      have important implications for how systems are perceived. As with all IT designs, the

     perceptions of users are the most influential factors in IT configuration and management
                                                     decisions.

         Compared to information technology users in business, IT users in schools are much
different. They bring different skills to the IT they use; they need more flexibility in what they do
and how they do it more often than business users, and their needs change over time. These
characteristics arise from the facts that students have emerging literacies; it is not unusual for
primary grade students to be only learning to read and the keyboard is new to them, so many
computer interfaces and input options (including typing) may be very difficult for students to
use. Even with clear curriculum guidelines, teacher and students may have different information
and computing needs than they had previously and they may be different from those of teachers
and students in similar courses. School years are also periodic. Just when all the elementary
school students are becoming familiar with the technology and they are becoming facile using it,
the school year ends, and teachers (and IT professionals) must prepare for a new group of
technology newcomers.

         It is important for all IT professionals who work in school to understand the nature of the
users and their specific needs. Every decision made and every action taken by IT professionals
(regardless of their role) affects end users either directly (by providing troubleshooting, training,
and other support) or indirectly (by selecting, installing, and configuring systems and interfaces).
As will be described in this chapter, the unfamiliar IT needs of school users and the limited
capacity of large parts of the school populations to use technology can pose difficulties for IT
professionals new to schools.

         Assumptions about the users' capacity to operate the devices, adapt to changes, and
operate the systems effectively all affect how systems are designed. For those who have
experience managing IT in organizations where all the users are adults and those who have
completed typical IT programs in schools (including trade schools, community colleges, and
universities) make very different assumptions about IT users than are true of school users. Many
IT professionals who honed their craft in organizations other than K-12 schools find school users
are unfamiliar and the strategies that produce usable systems in other organizations are less
effective in schools than they are in other organizations.

         In this chapter, I describe the characteristics of IT users in schools. I also describe the
nature of IT activities undertaken in schools.

Comparing Users in Organizations
         The careful reader will notice that I am beginning this chapter with some assumptions

about the typical IT users in organizations other than schools. I begin with these to introduce the
characteristics of humans that seem to affect their abilities to use computers. Many IT
professionals have not previously contemplated this aspect of IT system design. I find the

                                                              53
differences between IT users in other organizations and IT user in school can be summarized in
five characteristics:

          Business users tend to be competent in basic skills such as literacy. When building
             systems for business users, IT professionals can assume the users have some basic
             digital literacy and can operate a computer, they can read the screen and directions,
             and interact with the graphical user interfaces so they can accomplish the tasks they
             were hired to do. When referring to school-aged learners, I like to use the term
             "emerging competence" to characterize students. As they become more competent
             readers and writers, they will become more competent users of IT as well.

     Story from a School: When upgrading the active directory servers in a school that
     enrolled students in grades K-12, the new technology coordinator did not change the
     minimum complexity requirements of passwords for the organizational units containing
     student users. When they first logged on to computers, they were prompted to change
     their passwords and were met with the complexity requirements. Students in the
     primary grades who were just learning to read and had little experience with keyboards
     found the task of creating a password with eight characters, and a combination of
     letters, including capitals, numbers, and special characters unmanageable. The students
     were effectively locked out of the computers because they were incapable of typing in
     passwords. See the resolution on page x.

          IT users in businesses tend to have clear and specific needs and equally clear and
             specific IT requirements. Business users need certain software and to access specific
             data to complete their assigned work. If the hardware and connectivity are sufficient
             to run their software and access their data, then users are satisfied. Members of the
             accounting department do not care if they cannot edit video on their workstations (for
             example). In schools, many different users with much different software needs may
             use a specific computer during a school day. The same hardware used by students to
             run the accounting software for business class during one block in the schedule may
             be used by students in the digital arts class to edit video during the next block. As
             cloud-based computing and internet-connected notebooks have become popular, the
             need for school IT professionals to manage different software for different student
             users has been reduced. There does remain situations in which teachers cannot
             accomplish their curricular goals without sophisticated technology, however, and they
             cannot always predict the systems and IT capacity they will need.

          The IT needs of employees in business and industry tend to be task-based, whereas
             the IT in schools must be sufficiently flexible to allow for interest-based uses. The
             information sources that must be accessed and the applications provided (on the cloud
             or on the machine) vary depending on the interests of the student and the curriculum
             choices of the teachers. A further reality of deploying IT systems in social settings is
             that the best-made plans are only plans; many educators do not really understand
             what they need until they experience it with students, so teachers sometimes ask that
             systems be reconfigured after IT thought the job was done.

                                                              54
          In business and industry, users are selected for the role. Employees have selected
             themselves for the work (by applying) and were selected for the position (by being
             hired). Both gateways ensure those who use computers for their work have the
             necessary skills or the ability to gain them and are motivated to learn and use the
             systems. If this proves to be not true, there are options for the employer and the
             employee. If training or other support does not resolve the problems using the
             computers, the employee can be removed from the position.

             For the public schools I assume most readers have interest in serving, attendance is
             compulsory, and schools are obligated to provide education to all students. For these
             reasons, IT professionals in schools must accommodate a wide range of users, and
             schools in which a student is denied access to the IT they need may violate that
             individual's right to an education.

          The final fundamental difference is the relative stability of business users
             compared to school users. In schools, users' skills change over time in a periodic
             way. The students who struggle to use keyboards early in the school year, become
             more facile as they gain experience. When the next school year begins, those students
             are replaced with others who lack the experience. As curriculum changes, the IT
             needs are likely to change as well. Teachers who are introduced to new teaching
             methods and resources are anxious to try them. Families move into town and their
             children have different needs from the other student. All of these are situations in
             which IT professional must vary from their original plans to meet unanticipated
             needs.

         The candidate for a vacant technology coordinator position was being interviewed.
         When asked, "How would you respond to the teacher who returns from a conference
         and asks for help configuring systems to use a tool they learned about?"

         The response was, "Well, we set user devices up in the summer, and if they don't tell
         me before we start, then it has to wait until next year." That candidate was not hired.

         In reviewing the differences between IT users in k-12 schools and other organizations,
the differences are largely based on variability. In organizations other than k-12 schools, IT
professionals can predict the skills of the users and their IT needs within clear and narrow
bounds. In schools, IT professionals must provide IT for a diverse population of users who have
diverse interests and IT needs.

School Users
         IT professionals design systems for students, educators, and business-like users in

schools. In addition, they are often asked to configure systems for public users; this group
includes both visitors into the school (those who arrive to participate in meetings or those at
school-sponsored events) and those who are members of the community who bring in their own
devices.

                                                              55
Students
         Students, of course, comprise the greatest number of IT users in schools. When

considered together, k-12 students represent a group with very disparate skill sets and needs.
School and technology leaders must consider the nature of the students and their learning needs
(and well as the teachers' needs that are grounded in their students' needs) when making final
configuration decisions.

         The youngest students have emerging literacy and numeracy skills, and their hands are
too small to fit on full sized keyboards in the manner they are designed. Even if their hands could
fit the keyboards, they are not yet typists, so their ability to use the typical input devices on IT
can be limited, but they tend to be curious IT users and anxious to learn to use the devices they
know are used by others. The youngest students' use of IT tends to be highly prescribed by their
teachers. They often use web sites intended to facilitate learning of academic skills, and some
teachers integrate computer devices into the activity centers in their classrooms. Many primary
teachers are cautious about using IT in their classes, as there are many other valuable and
necessary skills that students must learn especially at this age.

         While the youngest students in schools are just learning to read and write, the oldest
students are adults (most students turn 18 during their senior year in high school) and are likely
to be engaged in independent projects and to have the need to gain experience using the same
software that professionals use. Older students tend to be creators of information with school IT
as well as consumers of information. In addition, these students tend to self-select into certain
courses and many schools have added independent projects as graduation requirements in recent
years. The IT professional may find students complete "internal internships" by learning entry
skills alongside and with active mentoring from the employed IT professionals. The specific
resources they use depend on their plans for post-graduation as well as their course work.

     For several years, I both taught and managed the IT for a small school. It enrolled about
     350 students in kindergarten through grade 12. There were two days per week that I had
     first and second graders (many of whom could not read) who came to the computer
     room; I led them through multimedia or and coding projects with their teachers helping
     me. When they left, I taught calculus-based physics. When those students left, I went
     into the wiring closet and managed the multiple servers that were used for user
     authentication, data storage, and the school's library.

         Most schools do not have the diversity of students using computers that I managed in that
school described in the box, but the students' and teachers' needs are the conditions to which
school IT professionals must direct their work. IT professionals cannot ignore them when
making IT decisions.

Teachers
         Teachers are the second largest number of school IT users, and they are the users who

have the most diverse IT needs. In addition to using computers for instructional purposes,
teachers use their devices to create materials, manage student data, and complete school
operations tasks. In addition to their work-related tasks, most school acceptable use policies
allow teachers to use their school-owned devices for professional tasks not directly related to
their jobs. The list of such activities includes completing courses for credit which are necessary
for recertification or for advanced degrees, participating in professional organizations, and

                                                              56
engaging in personal learning activities. One of the challenges for school IT professionals is
teachers' (and other adults') use of school-owned devices for personal purposes. While one may
be under no obligation to "save my pictures before you reimage my computer," no IT
professional wants to be the person who deletes personally important files.

         In general, educators use whichever productivity suite is supported by the IT
professionals to create classroom materials, such as worksheets, study guides, and presentations.
Increasingly, Google Workspaces files are the dominant suite used by educators. In addition,
they use whatever learning management system is supported to extend and enhance their lessons
with virtual classrooms. Managing classroom activity requires they have robust and reliable
access to the student information system as well. Whereas previous generations of teachers kept
paper copies of attendance (and sent hand-written lists of absent students to the office), today's
teachers mark attendance on the online student information system and those in the office see the
report almost instantaneously. Further, they access human resource systems and documents,
requisitions, and other operational systems and documents via their school-owned devices. In
these needs, educators are very similar to the IT users in other businesses and industries as they
are well-known and predictable.

         Meeting the IT needs of teachers is complicated by several factors. First, teachers do not
often have the language to accurately describe what they want or need. Their difficulty in
describing IT systems affects both their abilities to communicate how systems should be
reconfigured to meet their needs as well as their ability to describe malfunctioning systems. For
IT professionals, this means they must listen carefully and actively. In addition, they must repeat
back to teachers what they are hearing. Often, clear communication requires the teacher
demonstrate exactly what the system is doing that is problematic.

     A teacher of 3rd grade came to me one day when I was serving as the technology
     coordinator in the school where she taught. She said, "There is no voice on the
     computers in the lab." At the time, voice to text was beginning to appear on some
     systems, so I started explaining that these were older machines (they were repurposed
     desktops from a local company, and we had installed Linux on them) and I would
     investigate what we could do. She interrupted me and said, "No, there is no voice on
     them." It took me about 5 minutes for me to understand that what she really meant was
     that there were no speakers. She wanted her students to use a reading program in which
     they had to hear what animated characters were saying. I suggested she get her students
     headphones so they could listen themselves.

         Second, teachers cannot tell if the systems function in the manner they anticipate until it
is actually used at scale with students. In most IT design projects outside of school, the use case
is relatively well known, so the progression from design through testing to production can be
done in situations that closely resemble the end use case. While such testing can be done on a
limited scale in schools, the unanticipated circumstances that are introduced by students can
cause the most carefully planned IT systems to fail "in the wild." IT professionals must be
prepared to redesign systems and projects in response to what educators discover when they use
IT with students.

     Story: I once coached a technology coordinator who was fond of saying, "I built what
     they asked for, if they asked for the wrong thing, that is not my problem." I tried to get

                                                              57
     him to realize that indeed it was his problem. The money the school had invested in the
     devices and software; and the time he and his staff had spent were all wasted when the
     systems remained unutilized or underutilized. Careful listening to understand educators'
     needs and ensuring the final product is what they need and not what you or they thought
     they needed before they started are essential skills for IT professionals working in
     schools.

         Third, many teachers seek flexibility in their classrooms. For a number of very valid
reasons, many teachers vary the physical organization of their classrooms during the school year.
Elementary teachers use "centers" and these often change depending on the time of the year or
the availability of resources. Others change seating arrangements depending on the units they are
studying, and others vary classrooms to introduce novelty. IT professionals must be willing to
accommodate teachers need for flexibility and understand these changes are likely to be rooted in
valid teaching needs rather than whim.

         Teachers and IT professionals often find they have much different goals and needs when
it comes to IT systems. Teachers need flexibility and adaptability, but IT professionals know that
flexibility and adaptability can result in systems that are unreliable and unsecure, so they are
reluctant to build such systems. Time is limited, and IT professionals seek to build systems when
demand is low during the summer. Teachers may discover unanticipated needs only after the
school year begins, so they may request changes after IT professionals have completed the
upgrades, updates, and changes they thought were needed. Educators may also request quick
turnaround times on IT requests. For the (typically) understaffed IT staff in schools,
unanticipated changes and short timelines can be frustrating and can delay other projects.

         Just as teachers must accommodate to changing instructional needs with short-term
changes to their practices, school IT professionals must be prepared to make changes to their
systems with less notice than they would like. This does not mean that IT professionals must
make every change a teacher asks for, but it does mean they must engage in discussions and
adopt reasonable timelines for changes deemed necessary for teaching and learning.

Business-like Users
         As opposed to the systems designed for flexible use by students and teachers, the system

built for school operations purposes are task-oriented, so they can be designed and tested in the
same way IT for business users are. These systems include business operations such as financial
and human resources management and some educational functions such as the student
information system, learning management system, and library databases. Some instructional
tools, especially those that are web-based (which many are in the 21st century), can also be
managed from a task-centered perspective as well, but these are appropriate for a small part of
the curriculum.

         In the 21st century, many of these IT systems have become cloud based which means they
are accessed on web servers owned and managed by vendors. For example, accounting staff are
likely to access cloud-based systems for bookkeeping and processing invoices. Administrative
assistants are likely to access cloud-based systems to report academic reports to local regulatory
agencies. Increasingly, athletic schedules are managed on online systems. Building information
management systems are used by facilities professionals to control heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning; fire and security alarms; and other systems as well. School IT professionals work

                                                              58
with vendors to ensure web browsers and extensions are properly configured and they data are
accessed only by those who are authorized.

         Because of the transition to cloud-based data systems, school IT professionals spend
more time managing networks for secure and reliable connections than previous generations of
IT professionals who managed on-site data centers. IT professionals also spend time configuring
single-sign on or managing individual users accounts on the cloud-based systems used for school
operations. The cloud-based systems will be those that have been vetted by the school and
technology leaders to ensure they comply with school policy aligned with the Children's Internet
Protection Act (CIPA), then these become the tools supported by the school and IT professionals.

Public Users
         Schools are places where the public is occasionally invited. Some events that find the

public on campus place no demands on IT systems. Audiences at athletics events, concerts, and
other performances do not expect to have access to wireless networks, for example. Other events
may find individuals or groups from outside the school community that have valid reasons for
connecting their devices to the school's network:

          Consultants from local service agencies may participate in individual educational plan
             (IEP) meetings or they may provide services to students and find it necessary to
             connect to internet-based testing instruments or instructional materials.

          Presenters at workshops or training events many need to connect to internet-based
             systems. For example, trainers from the vendor providing the student information
             system may need to connect to it.

          Educators attending professional meetings or conferences held on campus may need
             to access their professional email or Google Workspace files during the event.

          Students from other schools who are participating in educational events held on
             campus may need access to the internet during the event. For example, students
             attending a robotics event may need to download software updates for their robots
             during a competition.

          Faculty, staff, and students may bring their own devices into the school for their own
             use or for auxiliary use in classrooms.

         In each of these situations, it is necessary to connect devices that are not owned by and
configured by the school's IT professionals to the school's network. This does pose a risk to the
school's networks as they cannot be sure what software is running on the devices that others
connect. If the network in improperly configured, then these devices may introduce malware or
other threats to the school's network, but skilled system administrators can minimize the risk.

Users' Perceptions of Change
         Education is a practice that has an interesting relationship with technology, especially

information technology. Whenever a new technology arrives, there are teachers who perceive it
to be an intrusion. This is a reasonable response as the new technology will be causing them to

                                                              59
reassess their practices, change some, and abandon others. Many interpret this as an accusation
that what they were doing was deficient. It also causes them to change practices they found very
familiar and comfortable. Even those who are open to new practices and technologies will find
they face decisions about what to include in their courses. By understanding how innovations are
adopted and the factors affecting technology acceptance, school IT professionals will be
prepared to design, support, and train users when new technology is introduced.

Diffusion of Innovations
         Despite their resistance, educators do have a responsibility to adopt those technologies

that facilitate learning in their field, and they have a responsibility to prepare students to use the
information technologies and information sources they will need to participate in society. Everett
Rogers was a scholar who is well-known for studying innovations and how they adopted by
populations. Rogers (2003) identified several types of users based on the rate at which they adopt
the innovation. Some are early adopters and will introduce new technologies into schools, but
others, the last 25% of users (named the laggards) will adopt it only when other options are
untenable. There are many reasons why some users are more reluctant than others to adopt
innovations, and those tend to be grounded in users' perceptions of them. Some innovations are
perceived to require too much effort to learn, some would require users to abandon recently
developed methods (and recently purchased technology), and others are socially unacceptable.
As IT professionals update and change systems, they will be met by all types of users that Rogers
identified. Innovators will make frequent requests for changes, and laggards will resist change
for as long as possible.

         Table x. summarizes the factors Rogers identified as affecting individuals' decision to
adopt innovations. It should be noted that several of Rogers' factors depend on the perceptions of
the individuals. While most users will concur on the complexity of systems (at least on the
relative complexity of various systems), all of the other factors depend on the interpretation of
the innovation in the context of existing methods. No matter how convincing innovators or other
adopters may find the rationale for adoption, until the individual makes the decision, it will be
unused. The other reality the emerges from studying innovations is that users do change their
minds. Technological innovations initially rejected may be adopted later, once the individuals'
perceptions change.

Observability

Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia that was begun in 2001, had a reputation as an
unreliable resource as it is edited by volunteers. Many who were responsible for
managing school IT at the time blocked access to it on their internet filters; I was one of
those who did. Over time, educators and IT professionals realized Wikipedia is about as
reliable as other encyclopedias and there are many advantages to using it, including a
wider collection of articles that are updated more frequently compared to printed
encyclopedias. It is unusual to find schools that continue to block Wikipedia today.
Teachers' and IT leaders' perceptions of Wikipedia changed over time, and they
changed both the configuration of the systems and the role it played in their teaching.

Technology Acceptance
         When an IT professional arrives in a school, there will be a level of use that has been

established, and they are likely to be asked (by both leaders and members of the school
community) to abandon some aspects of the system, improve some, and leave others as they are.
The challenge for these new arrivals is that these lists are never consistent. What some want to
keep desperately, others want to abandon immediately; and this is true for both hardware and
software as well as for strategies and procedures for managing the IT.

         In schools, like all organizations, the intent of IT systems is to promote efficient and
effective operations to achieve the strategic goals of the organization. Technology researchers
who investigate how technology is used differentiate compulsory use of technology from
voluntary use of technology. In school settings, the requirement that teachers take attendance
with the student information system is an example of compulsory use, while their decision to
integrate technology into their instruction is an example of voluntary use. Activities like taking
attendance can be mandated, and users trained how to accomplish the tasks, voluntary decisions
to integrate it into teaching when other options are available is a more complex decision.

         The question "What factors affect the decision to use technology?" has focused of
technology researchers for several decades. By designing systems that address the factors
associated with the decision to use technology, school IT professionals will find their systems are
perceived to be more effective for compulsory uses and they are more used for voluntary
purposes.

         In 2003, technology researchers defined the unified theory of acceptance and use of
technology (UTAUT) (Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, and Davis, 2003). There are several versions
and extensions of technology acceptance research, but UTAUT is the one that is most-used to
understand technology use in educational settings.

         According to the UTAUT, four factors are directly associated with users' acceptance of
technology and their patterns of technology use: performance expectancy, effort expectancy,
social influences, and facilitating conditions. In addition, four factors are indirectly associated
with technology acceptance. Since it was first introduced, UTAUT has been refined and
additional factors have been added which allows for more accurate predictions of decisions to
use technology. For example, UTAUT2 (Venkatesh, Thong, & Xu, 2012) added enjoyment,
price value, and habit as factors affecting decisions to use technology, and UTAUT also clarified

                                                              61
the indirect influence of age, gender, and experience. As technology acceptance has been applied
to different situations and populations, some of the factors have been modified, but the four
factors originally associated with technology acceptance are consistently found to predict IT use.

Figure 1. Factors directly associated with technology use (adapted from Venkatesh, Morris,
Davis, and Davis 2003)

         Perhaps the most important contribution of the researchers who use technology
acceptance to study technology use is the reality of users' perceptions. This does pose a
challenge for IT professionals as perceptions may be contradictory. IT professionals' perceptions
may contradict users' perceptions, and different users may have perceptions that contradict other
users' perceptions. Fortunately, there are instruments that have been developed and validated so
IT professionals need not invent their own strategies for determining how well their systems
align with these characteristics.

Performance Expectancy
         This is a measure of the extent to which an individual believes the technology system will

affect how well they will do their job; when PE is greater, they believe it helps them to be
effective in their work, and they are more likely to us it.

         Effective performance is rooted in outcomes and relative advantage. For educators who
are using IT in their instruction, outcomes will be defined by their goals in the classroom. One
challenge for school IT professionals is that outcomes may be different for different teachers or
for different parts of their curriculum or even for different students. Teachers who believe that
their job is to prepare student for standardized tests may perceive technology differently
compared to those educators who believe their job is to prepare students to create high-quality
public performances. Of course, the same teacher may have very different and even seemingly
contradictory goals. As a mathematics teacher, I may want my students to have access to a web-
based platform that gives practice problems designed to improve basic computation skills. This
"teaching by computer" method may have very specific system requirements. I may also want

                                                              62
my students to have access to multimedia tools that allow for scripting so that they can explore
fractals (for example).

         Relative advantage includes the educators' perceptions of the IT systems compared to
other options. If they believe they can achieve their goals (whatever they are) more quickly or
that learning is improved when they use the IT system compared to other IT or compared to no
IT, then PE is improved, and they are more likely to use the IT.

Effort Expectancy
         This is a measure of the individual's perceptions of how easy it is to use the IT systems.

Perceived ease of use exerts strong influences on decisions to use technology in the periods after
initial training has occurred, but before the user becomes highly familiar with and skilled using
the system. When first learning to use a technology system, the simple work of remembering
what one is supposed to do interferes with the ease of use, which indicates the importance of
initial training when new IT systems are deployed in schools.

         Ease of use can also be perceived differently by different stakeholders. One of the
realities that is clearly supported by research using UTAUT as a framework is that it is the users'
perceptions that determine effort expectancy. It is not uncommon for school IT professionals
(who we know are understaffed) to configure systems that allow for efficient management, but
these efficiencies may make the system less easy for users to operate. If IT professionals believe
a system is easy to use, but the users do not, then their perceptions matter more, and systems
must be modified.

Social Influences (SI)
         Educators are affected by what others do just like all other humans are; when it comes to

using IT, it seems educators are particularly affected by others. SI has complex roots emerging
from the individual's sense that others (whom they judge to be important) expect them to use the
IT, as well as the individual's cultural experiences and expectations, and the social status that can
be gained by using the technology or the status to be lost by the failure to use it.

         These influences may be contradictory. For example, if a CIO who has little teaching
experience recommends a new platform, it may not be accepted by educators because of negative
social influences. Alternatively, educators may advocate IT professionals install and configure IT
systems similar to those used by their colleagues in other schools. New educators may be
influenced to use technology based on the role of IT or the tools they used in their teacher
education program, which may be very different from what they encounter in their first
professional position. Younger educators may also have different cultural experiences, including
an acceptance of IT, that are dismissed by older colleagues who minimize the role of IT in the
classroom. (The stereotypes contained in that example are recognized. While research does
suggest there is a weak association between age and IT acceptance and gender identification--
younger and male tend to have greater acceptance--IT professionals cannot justify drawing any
conclusions about IT use based on age or gender identity in today's schools.)

         Social psychologists recognize three types of social influences. Social influences that
result in compliance are typical of settings in which individuals are obligated to act in a defined
way to gain reward or avoid punishment. Educators who are required to use a particular online
grading system may comply with the request, but not use the advanced features of the reporting
system. When individuals feel a strong identity with another individual (or with a group of
individuals) then the individual will seek to model the actions of that individual or group. The

                                                              63
social influences resulting from those identifications tend to be stronger than the social
influences of compliance. The strongest social influences arise when the individual internalizes
the social influences and thus, they become perceived as natural and the individual holds the
same expectation of others.
Facilitating Conditions (FC)

         There are a range of technical and organizational factors that contribute to an individual
feeling supported in their use of IT systems. For educators, these factors include financial
resources, troubleshooting and repair expertise, training opportunities, as well as perceptions that
they can influence technology decisions. In school where educators perceive all these areas are
sufficiently provided by the school and technology leaders and they procedures they have in
place, then they are more likely to use the technology.
The Challenge of Perceptions

         While it is true that it is users' perceptions of the factors related technology acceptance,
their perceptions can sometimes be wildly inaccurate. Teachers are also a group of users who can
be very quick to label systems as "broken" and to reject any attempts at support they perceived to
be taking too long as interfering with their ability to do their jobs.

         Improving users' perceptions of the functionality of IT systems requires school and
technology leaders address several aspects of the entire IT system. First, they must improve the
functionality of the devices. This includes updating and replacing older devices. Second, teachers
and other users must be trained in basic troubleshooting steps that can be done without posing a
risk to the system. If a user can resolve simple problems without the intervention of IT, then they
can return to productive IT user more quickly. Third, there must be on-going communication and
collaboration to ensure expectations are known and that malfunctioning devices are identified.
And repaired or replaced before they adversely affect perceptions of the system.

                                                              64
6: Technology in Teaching

 While IT professionals are not primarily responsible for teaching with IT, they are responsible
   for the IT that teachers and students use during many varieties of instruction. They are also

responsible ensuring the technical specifications are met, contributing to the training necessary
 for users to operate the systems. Being familiar with curriculum goals prepares IT professional

                                        to better understand that work.

         One of the most surprising realizations for adults who begin working in schools is that
what is taught is not what they were taught or what they think should be taught. Curriculum is a
part of school that is affected by many factors; some are very local (individual teachers are
ultimately responsible for what it taught in their classrooms), others are school-wide or district-
wide, yet others are state-wide or national. In the United States, there is no nationally mandated
curriculum, and concepts like "fourth grade mathematics" are variable and open to interpretation.
In some states, there are textbooks that are approved for use; in those states, all Algebra 1
teachers (for example) must select one of the approved textbooks to use in their courses.
Obviously, textbooks publishers are very motivated to have their books on those lists in states
with large populations. As a result, the curriculum expectation in those states can exert strong
influences on curriculum beyond the jurisdictions. In addition, some open educational resources
are becoming more widely adopted, thus they are heavily influencing curriculum decisions.

         Despite these variations, there are some generalizations that can be made about
curriculum and instruction, and some trends that can be recognized across schools, grades, and
subjects. These generalities and trends are described in this chapter. Of course, IT professionals
are not responsible for using technology to teach, but it is important they have some
understanding of the nature of technology-rich teaching so they can effectively participate in
system selection, design, and configuration decisions.

The Potential Roles of Technology
         Since IT was first introduced into schools, educators have explored the role digital

electronic computers should play in teaching and learning. What has become clear is there is no
single role that IT should play in schools. Four adjectives can be used to capture the approaches
to using technology that have been developed: teaching about technology, teaching by
technology, teaching via technology, and teaching with technology. IT professionals must be
prepared to recognize each comprises different types of interactions, and they must be prepared
to design systems that facilitate each and to support teachers and students engaged in each.

Teaching About Technology
         Teaching about technology was common when computers first arrived in educational

markets. Called "computer literacy" at the time, it focused on teaching students the names and
functions of the components of systems rather than how to use them. Although this has largely
been abandoned, this was a very reasonable approach at the time as few individuals had
computers in their homes and one of the most important aspects of IT was knowing the system
one needed and setting it up to function. Whereas computer users today can purchase systems

                                                              65
that automate much of the configuration (for example, when I replaced my years-old printer
recently, both my Macintosh computer and my Windows PC recognized the new peripheral and
installed the drivers without me taking any action), previous generations needed to know how
their peripherals connected the computer and how to install and configure the driver software to
make them operational.

         Although teaching computer literacy as described above is not common any longer, many
schools continue to teach lessons in which the systems are the curriculum. For example, when
teaching lessons about digital citizenship, cybersecurity, and coding, educators are teaching
about technology.

         Training users how to operate the systems they will encounter is also teaching about
technology. Ensuring students know how to use Google Workspaces applications, the full text
databases available through the school library, and the tools used by math teachers for graphing
are examples of teaching about technology within the domain of educators. Ensuring teachers
know how to use the student information system, email, and other systems is an example of
training within the domain of school IT professionals, and IT professionals are often excepted to
both deliver training to students, teachers, and other users and prepare how-to articles or videos
to support them.

Teaching by Technology
         When using test-preparation software, skills-building websites, typing tutors, and similar

tools, students are experiencing teaching by technology. For previous generations of technology-
using teachers, "edutainment" software was a popular method for teaching by technology. This
software found students playing games in which they earned points by quickly answering
mathematical calculations (for example).

         One of the more popular uses of teaching by technology for educators today is the use of
test preparation platforms. These are cloud-based and customizable, so teachers can create class
lists, define the content they want the system to present to students, and to set other variables.
Students log on to the system and work through the lessons selected by the teacher. Later, the
teacher can log on to the dashboard and see each student's progress. Data specialists employed at
the school may also access these dashboards to generate reports for various stakeholders,
although access to the data in the reports must comply with FERPA protections of privacy.

         Most educators recognize this approach is useful for only a limited type of lessons that
can be effectively delivered by technology. Once the teachers or other educators define the
lessons to be presented, the system and its algorithms (including the errors programmed into it
and the biases of the designers) determine the experience for the students. These systems
generally rely on students demonstrating learning by providing answers to fact-based questions
in which the answers can be clearly identified so it can be evaluated by software. These systems
also depend on algorithms to determine what happens when students do not provide the expected
answers.

         The publishers and vendors who produce platforms for teaching by computers seek to
take advantage of the economy of scale. Once the system is produced, they can sell it to many
schools and the very substantial development costs are distributed over the many clients. For this
reason, these platforms tend to be written to address very general curriculum goals, and in many
cases, the vendors seek to influence curriculum decisions, so they create a market for their
product regardless of the degree to which the lessons reflect what is needed by the students.

                                                              66
Teaching Via Technology
         Teaching via technology describes teaching in which the lesson could be done with or

without the technology. The technology may increase the efficiency of some activities, but IT
does not influence what students do or how they think about the material being presented.

         Consider, for example, a mathematics classroom in which students solve problems on
paper. When students review their work in class, the teacher may ask students to show their
solutions for all in the class to see. In the 1970's and 1980's, my classmates and I carried the
paper on which we had done our calculation to the front of the classroom where we transcribed
our solution onto the chalkboard for the class to see. I asked my students to do the same when I
taught math in the 1990's (although the board was a whiteboard and students used color markers
to write on them). Around 2010, I was asked to purchase a document camera and projector
(about $3000 worth of hardware at the time) so that a math teacher could project images of the
paper on which students had performed their calculations onto a screen for the class to see. In
that case, the experience of doing math was not changed by the technology as students were
performing calculation by writing numbers and drawing lines on paper. The students and teacher
did avoid the time needed to copy the solutions on to another medium, but the students did not
engage with math any differently.

         Video content is another example of teaching via technology. Whereas video content was
displayed to the entire class at one time before computers arrived in schools (and it still in in
many) instances, students today often have the option of watching video content on their own. In
the 2010's many teachers explored "flipped classrooms" in which instruction was delivered via
video and students watched them for homework, then class meetings were used solve problems
and apply what was taught via video. There are advantages to teaching via technology that do
affect how students learn in some cases. If students can access video content away from class
(for example when they are doing homework), they can get additional explanations just at the
moment they need it, which is advantageous, but the presentation is still like a lecture and the
student cannot get clarification from a video-based explanation.

Teaching With Technology
         Teaching with technology has been called technology integration in many sources. This

finds teachers incorporating technology into the lessons they would teach without technology. In
addition to adopting technology to present the lesson, teaching with technology often finds the
teachers adapting the lesson. They will both make planning decisions about the lessons based on
the technology tools available and vary the lesson depending on the capacity of the technology.

         Consider, for example, the math teacher who decides to use an online graphing calculator
rather than graphing on paper. That teacher may be able to introduce more sophisticated graphs
more quickly than those who plot functions on paper, or they may be able to create sliders or
similar controls that allow students to see how changing those variables affect the plots.

         Of the four approaches to technology-based teaching, teaching with technology is the one
that necessitates the greatest adaptability from educators and flexibility from IT professionals.
Whereas the other approaches are used for lessons in which there are clearly defined educational
goals and technology needs, teaching with technology requires design that accommodates many
variables including uncertain goals, needs, and customization and individualization of product in
which students demonstrate their learning.

         One interesting and effective method of teaching with technology is the use of
simulations. These are especially effective in mathematics and science education and allow

                                                              67
students to participate in otherwise unavailable experiments and demonstrations. Of course, the
boundaries between these types of teaching do blur. For example, a teacher who uses video to
show students footage of underwater ecosystems is probably teaching with technology rather
than teaching via technology.

Standards
         Curriculum (what teachers are supposed to teach) is an interesting part of school design.

Ostensibly, there are things that each seventh-grade student (for example) should know, but it is
very difficult to define "what students should know" outside of the context of school. The
statement, "the book is written at an eight-grade reading level" is best interpreted as "most
students who are about 14 years old can understand this book." Curriculum is also divided into
subjects that are artificial as well. In the real world, one encounters problems that necessitate
understanding many concepts and applying many skills that were taught in isolation in schools.

         In the last few years of the 20th century, professional organizations, such as the National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) began publishing "standards" which were their
version of what comprises appropriate curriculum. In the decades since, the number of
organizations publishing standards has increased to the point where teachers cannot reasonably
expect to teach all of them. Since about 2010, the Common Core State Standards have been
widely (although not universally adopted) across the United States. Exactly what is meant by
"adopted by" varies. In general, adoption means the state educational agency has mandated
schools administer the tests they specify, and the test publisher claims it is aligned with the
Common Core State Standards.

         When this book was drafted in early 2022, the Common Core State Standards had fallen
out of favor (which is the fate of every such initiative). While education leaders where not
referring to the Common Core to the degree they had a decade earlier, the testing mandates,
started under the No Child Left Behind and continued as the Common Core State Standards
emerged illustrate how education has become politicized in the United States, and many
decisions and actions are made to achieve goals that are not necessarily aligned with the needs of
learners.

         Some educators have criticized all aspects of standards-based education. They question:

          Do the standards accurately reflect what students should learn? It has been
             pointed out that employers and higher education are more concerned about graduates
             "soft skills" than they are about the content knowledge of graduates whom they hire,
             yet standards-based initiatives tend to focus on content.

          Do the tests accurately measure what they claim? Because the tests are written and
             administered by publishers who were awarded contracts by departments of education
             in states, they are propriety, so independent review of them cannot be undertaken to
             verify the validity and reliability of them.

          Do the tests predict "success?" The purpose of many tests is to predict the degree to
             which students will be successful (whatever that means) once they graduate. "Career
             and college ready" was the mantra of the Common Core State Standards initiatives,
             but that is a weak concept, and the claims were that the tests curriculum and tests
             achieved this outcome even before graduates were in their careers or college.

                                                              68
         The exact standards that teachers are expected to follow when designing their courses and
lessons varies depending on the priorities of the school leaders, the expectations of local
agencies, and other factors. In many cases, the priorities change. For example, a series of low
scores on math assessments may lead to a renewed focus on teaching math. In other cases, high-
profile public events will lead to demands that certain curriculum areas be given higher priority.

         While IT professionals may not deal directly with teaching to standards, they will be
asked to provide access to software, devices, and cloud-based platforms that are deemed
necessary for students to "achieve the standards." Further, data specialists who are among the IT
professionals employed in schools, will manage data and generate reports to help local educators
disseminate and use that data.

The International Society for Technology in Education Standards
         Among the professional organizations that publish standards is the International Society

for Technology in Education (ISTE), which is the leading professional organization for educators
and IT professionals with interest in educational technology in k-12 schools. ISTE first published
standards in 1998 and the National Educational Technology Standards focused on what students
should be able to do with computers. Since then, the name was changed to ISTE Standards, the
contents have been updated twice, and the organization has expanded the stakeholders for whom
it defines standards. When school and curriculum leaders plan and design technology-based
instruction (teaching about, by, via, or with technology), the ISTE Standards are likely to be the
documents that they are trying to address. For this reason, IT professionals in school should have
some understanding of the contents.

         As of 2022, ISTE promotes technology standards for students, educators (primarily
teachers), educational leaders, and instructional coaches, as well as standards for computational
thinking. IT professionals are expected to support users whose practice is informed by these
standards and to design IT to facilitate the work. The standards do assume the curriculum is
intended to extend beyond simply operating computers and developing declarative knowledge
and simple skills. ISTE standards promote:

          Active learning--While active learning is differently defined by different educators,
             in general, it comprises a range of teaching methods in which students are not sitting
             and listening to lectures, rather they are engaged with the curriculum and constructing
             knowledge as they solve or attempt to solve complex problems rather than simply
             recall information that has been presented to them.

          Citizenship--ISTE advocates that all users in schools understand, promote, model,
             and demonstrate ethical use of technology and the application of technology to
             important problems.

          Collaboration--Central to our emerging understanding of human learning and to our
             understanding of how problems are best-solved is the idea that learners and problem
             solvers work together and incorporate diverse perspectives. Collaboration is typically
             a component of the strategies that are included in active learning.

Standard Testing
         In the 21st century, it has become expected that educators be "data-driven." Ostensibly,

they make all decisions based on relevant information. In almost all cases this data comes from
tests. While the reliability and validity of the tests and data are dubious, students take far more
tests than previous generations of students did; those tests are often administered via web-based
interfaces. The trend to computer-administration is nearly complete for those tests that are widely
administered. In early 2022, the College Board announced the SAT will be transitioning to
computer-based delivery only in the coming years. IT professionals are expected to support
computer-based testing for all purposes and to generate and disseminate reports of the data that
are collected via the tests.

     There are two types of tests that are typically administered to students: standardized and
     standards based. For IT professionals who are designing systems to administer the tests,
     there is no difference; devices must be able to establish reliable and secure connections
     to the servers where the test is housed, user accounts must be created, and testing
     conditions managed. For the data specialists, there may be differences on the strategies
     for reporting results.

     Just so you don't have to ask the difference once you get into a school, standardized and
     standards-based tests are differentiated by the comparisons contained in the results. An
     individual's score on a standardized test is compared to all the others who took the test,
     so it is reported as a percentile. Scoring in the 50th percentile means half the students
     scored higher and half the students scored lower. Standards-based tests compare
     individual's performance to what they were expected to learn. Results of these test are
     reported with some variation of "no evidence," "almost meeting the standard," "meets
     the standard," and "exceeds the standard."

     Neither type of test is inherently better than the other. Each has its own purpose, and
     neither gives a more accurate measure of what any individual really knows than the
     other.

High-Stakes Testing
         In the United States, high-stakes tests are associated with the standards that were adopted

by states uder the No Child Left Behind act and the Common Core State Standards initiative. The
term "high-stakes" is traced to the efforts in the early years of the 21st century to ensure that
100% of students passed the tests (a statistically and practically impossible condition to meet).
Schools that did not make "adequate yearly progress" towards that goal were sanctioned, thus the
results were "high-stakes."

                                                              70
         While the original efforts have been replaced, and the exact testing requirements depend
on the tests that have been adopted within the jurisdiction, high-stakes testing is still very
common. Since their inception, these testing requirements have generally expanded to include
more subjects than they did originally, and tests are administered to a greater number of students
then they did originally.

         For several years at the middle of the second decade of the century (when these tests were
first administered via computers), school IT professionals and school leaders were making
decisions and installing systems that met the system requirements of the tests they were
mandated to administer. Both network capacity was improved to meet the requirements and user
devices that had sufficient processing and video requirements were purchased and configured. In
the years since, technology advances have generally outpaced the advances in system
requirements for the tests, so school leaders rarely find they have insufficient capacity to
administer the tests.

         Because of the importance some stakeholders ascribe to these tests, it is not unusual for
school leaders to take steps to ensure technology resources be reserved when the tests are being
administered. IT professionals may be expected to be present while the tests are being
administered to troubleshoot problems and the system administrators may be asked to limit other
uses of the network during testing. For example, public SSID's may be disabled or YouTube may
be blocked on the school network to restrict uses that may interfere with the network capacity
needed for testing.

Diagnostic Testing
         There are testing protocols that have been incorporated into many curriculum programs

that have been adopted by schools. The rationale is that all decisions about curriculum and
instruction must be made to create measurable changes in students. Many educational theorists
reject this assertion, and the evidence supporting the claims that more data is associated with
"smarter" students is dubious, but the reality persists. As a result, IT professionals are called
upon to manage access to cloud-based testing systems, which may require adding extensions to
web browsers, managing users, and ensuring the networks is configured to allow access.

Electronic Portfolios
         If a school does collect data other than test scores, it is likely they encourage students to

document learning in electronic portfolios. In schools where project-based learning, internships,
and other authentic learning methods are used, students develop skills and knowledge far beyond
what can be measured on tests, so students capture evidence of their learning in a portfolio.

         Portfolios are commonly organized around the competencies that the curriculum is
designed to promote. These tend to be much broader outcomes than are typically found in
statements of learning outcomes; students may be expected to demonstrate how they have
become an effective communicator or a skilled problem solver I their portfolios. Electronic
portfolios are also widely used in situations in which students are preparing to study or
employment in specific fields. For example, art students compile portfolios as do students who
must demonstrate their abilities in health care or other skills-rich fields. After the educators have
arranged the organization of the portfolio, which becomes a template for the students; students
capture images, video, or other artifacts of their learning to customize theirs. Finally, they reflect
on the meaning and importance of the artifacts and how it demonstrates their new learning.

                                                              71
         In those schools where they are used, electronic portfolios contribute to a more complete
and comprehensive evaluation of what students know and can do than those schools that rely
only on test scores. Because of the personal nature of electronic portfolios and the fact that
artifacts are often images and video, IT professionals in these schools will be asked to facilitate
students' use of their own devices to document learning. Such steps to allow students to use
personal devices includes opening an SSID for students to connect phones and tablets and
ensuring cloud services allow the devices to connect and the files (even large files) to be
uploaded. IT professionals may also be asked to configure the learning management system so
that work submitted there can be integrated into electronic portfolios.

     Electronic portfolios can be an interesting addition to the teaching and assessment
     strategies in schools. When planning them, teachers often expect that their assignments
     will be among the artifacts, and they will insist (for example) "students must put a poem
     they wrote in it," but the purpose of an electronic portfolio is for students to describe
     their own perceptions of what has been meaningful and what they believe in their best
     work. The more prescribed the requirements, the less meaningful the portfolios will be
     and the more likely they are to be abandoned.

Multimedia
         Generations of students have created presentations using a series of programs that

combine text, images, audio, and video (thus the "multi" in multimedia). Many trace the
beginnings of this type of educational software to HyperCard and HyperStudio, programs that
were available for Macintosh computers marketed in schools in the early 1990's. Interest in
multimedia grew when video cards, color displays, audio cards, and speakers along with the
computing capacity to play video became widely available in the middle of the 1990's. These
activities continue to be popular in schools, so anyone interested in working as an IT professional
in a school should be aware of the current trends in the field.

         Because schools are public institutions, they are compelled to follow the requirements of
the Americans with Disabilities Act. This means teachers who create multimedia for use in their
classrooms must ensure the materials are accessible. Accessibility of multimedia means, for
example, video is closed captioned, slides have unique names, descriptive alternative text is
added to images, and flashing content is avoided.

Slide Shows
         Slide shows created with PowerPoint, Google Slides, or any of the popular web-based

tools are very widely used in schools. Teachers create them to support instruction, and students
create them as projects. While these were originally stored on local drives, students and teachers
in the 21st century have adopted the practice of sharing and embedding web-based presentations
in virtual classrooms.

         Given the ubiquity of cameras and microphones on digital devices, it is easy to forget that
the capacity to capture high resolution images, video, and audio is a relatively recent addition to
the computing capacity of devices in schools. The web cameras integrated into Chromebooks
and laptops are used to capture audio and video that is integrated into slides shows, and these
presentations are created, edited, shared, and embedded by students in every school.

         IT professionals can expect to be asked to support accessibility checkers in the
productivity suites they deploy. These tools (which may be built into the applications or may

                                                              72
require add-ons to be installed) will identify parts of the presentations that are not compliant with
ADA requirements. For example, they will identify missing metadata, missing navigation aids,
missing alternative text on images, and other aspects of the files. Some aspects of the files (for
example color contrast) cannot be checked via accessibility checkers and IT professionals will be
asked to support other tools.

Video Editing
         Among many users, multimedia has been replaced with video, so video editing has

increased in importance as an education technology in recent years. Whether teachers are
creating video to supplement instruction or students are creating video to demonstrate learning or
student performances are captured on video, there are situations in which the original footage
needs to be edited. Many approach video editing with an underestimate of the time needed to
produce acceptable video, and many also overestimate the need for professional-quality editing.

         There are multiple web-based options for editing video. For example, YouTube provides
some capacity to edit video that has already been uploaded to the platform. Two challenges that
arise from using web-based video editing platforms are the limitations imposed by the
applications and the need to transmit video to the platform for editing.

         On devices with full operating systems, video editing software with far more tools and
features than web-based editing platforms can be installed. iMovie is a video editing application
that is installed by default on Macintosh computers, and it is widely used by that community of
computer users. Especially in high schools, there is often interest in teaching students how to use
professional video editing software. This software allows for sophisticated editing and can
incorporate multiple video and audio tracks, filters, and other sophisticated features.

         IT professionals in schools must be prepared to support whatever video editing capacity
is necessitated by the curricular goals of the school. Considering the range of instructional goals
and the needs of educators, a single video editing tool is unlikely to meet the needs of all users in
a school. Middle school students, for example may be able to meet their video editing needs
through a web-based platform, but the theatre department in the school may need a professional
application to produce video version of their performances.

Video Conferencing
         During the pandemic of 2020, video conferencing became a vital platform for remote

teaching. The long-term use of video conferencing in schools is difficult to predict. Even if
teaching via video conferencing does not continue to be widely used for instruction, there are
purposes such as some professional development training and meetings that can be as effective
when done remotely as when they are done in-person. Educators have also discovered that video
conferences can be used to enhance in-person classes. For example, students can record a video
conference in which they discuss cases studies or make presentations, then share recordings of
those meetings to share with the class or for the instructor to assess.

         IT professionals can expect to play several roles in supporting video conferencing. In
addition to providing user devices with camera and microphones, they ensure sufficient network
capacity, recommend platforms, provide training, and troubleshooting resources. One of the
important considerations when using video conferencing is the privacy of students and their
caregivers. While educators may want students to appear on screen during the video conferences
and they may have good reasons to ask for that, it can pose a threat to their privacy. Many
schools have also adopted recommended procedures to minimize the potential that uninvited

                                                              73
guests find, join, and disrupt their video conference meetings. IT professionals played an
important role in researching, defining, configuring, and training users to minimize this threat.

Coding
         Coding, which refers to teaching students how to write computer programs, has a long

history of focusing the attention of computer-using students in schools. When computers first
arrived in schools, multimedia was not yet possible and even word processors and spreadsheets
were not fully developed, so programming was how students created on computers. Beginners
all-purpose symbolic code (BASIC) was invented at Dartmouth College in 1964 and was used
for the time-sharing schemes that allowed multiple users (including students in public schools) to
write programs that were executed on mainframes computers. Versions of BASIC were also
available for desktop computers, so one of the first uses of computers in schools was to teach
BASIC programming.

         Coding continues to be an activity taught in schools. It can be its own subject in school
(such as high school students enrolled in Advanced Placement Computer Science courses), it can
be incorporated into other lessons (such as middle school math students coding with Scratch in
mathematics courses), or it can be the focus of special events (such as the Hour of Code).

         While technology integration--the use of technology to teach other lessons--has been
the dominant use of technology in education for several decades, there are organizations that
have advocated including programming activities in the curriculum. It is reasoned that
programming can teach various thinking skills (the evidence for this is not strong) and that
programming can demystify technology by giving students experience controlling it. Regardless
of the rationale, many students enjoy learning to program.

         IT professionals can be expected to support both web-based coding platforms and
integrated development environments and those installed on computer hard drives as well. In
many cases, the exact requests will depend on the preferences of the individuals who are
instructing students.

Scratch
         Scratch is a popular platform to introduce students who are aged eight to 15 to coding.

Originally released in 2007, the team at the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology that produced and maintains Scratch have released two additional versions, and
there have been other related projects such as Scratch Junior which is targeted at students aged
five through eight. Many trace the origins of Scratch to the Logo programming language
developed by Seymour Papert in the 1960's.

         Scratch 2.0 (the version released in 2013) introduced the online version, and most
Scratchers (the nickname Scratch users have for each other) log on to the online project editor to
select control blocks, set variables, and customize sprites as they design their projects. That
editor also allows Scratchers to publish and share their projects so that other can use them or
even edit them. Especially if you are interested in working in elementary schools, being familiar
with Scratch is valuable knowledge.

The Hour of Code
         The Hour of Code is a project in which schools host events at which students participate

in coding activities. It is not unusual for these projects find students taking "field trips" within
the school building. Normal classes are cancelled so that students can have special instruction,
hear guest speakers, and otherwise focus on coding. While Computer Science Education Week
(an event encouraged by and sponsored by a collection of organizations and businesses) and
Grace Hooper's birthday (Hooper was a programing pioneer) are popular times to schedule
events, local organizers may schedule events to meet their school schedules.

Pre-Professional Courses
         Many high schools, including vocational or trade high schools, offer a range of computer

science, digital media, or business applications courses in which students develop advanced IT
skills. The specifics of these offerings depend on the history and popularity of the department
and the nature of the local business community. If an art teacher is hired who has special skill in
digital photography, for example, the school may offer a course to take advantage of their skill
and interest, and IT professionals will be expected to support the hardware and software needs of
this course.

         Many high schools have computer science departments that offer Advanced Placement
(AP) computer science courses which are designed to prepare students to take the exams
published by the College Board. While these are promoted as being equivalent to college
courses, and students often enroll with the expectation that they will earn college credit for
passing the exam, those decisions are made by colleges, and they have been increasingly
reluctant to grant credit for passing scores on the Advanced Placement exams.

         It is unlikely that students enrolled in a comprehensive high school or even a vocational
high school will be prepared to pass professional licensing exams after these courses, so they are
best described as pre-professional courses. Despite this label, school leaders and faculty do strive
to replicate professional computing environments, so computers with full operating systems and
professional software titles are generally necessary in the classroom where these courses are
taught. One of the other challenging situations for IT professionals related to support teaching
about technology are the situations in which schools teach courses designed to prepare students
for positions in information technology fields. Especially difficult is situations in which students
must learn to manage networks. Obviously, these courses are taught on networks that are isolated
from the network used by other users in the school.

     Some search committees are interested in hiring professionals who have an interest in
     coaching extracurricular activities. Be prepared for a question like "Would you be
     interested in helping out our robotics team?" It is best to be positive, but cautious. If you
     would be interested, it is best to answer "Yes, but only if the meetings fit with my other
     duties." Even if you are not interested, it can be a good question to ask at the end of
     your interview. Something like, "Do your students compete in programming or robotics
     competitions?" shows interest in the schools and students beyond the position for which
     you are being interviewed.

                                                              75
Makerspaces
         Makerspaces have been introduced into many schools in recent decades. In some schools,

maker spaces were introduced after wood shops and similar classrooms were removed. In some
schools, the traditional industrial arts remain and are supplemented with makerspaces.

         In makerspaces, students are encouraged to build solutions to problems. Depending on
the age of the students and the interests of the teachers who work in makerspaces, they can
include a range of building tools, including 3-D printers, robots, and coding. While the faculty
who are hired to teach in these spaces typically have expertise in configuring these devices, and
they work closely with IT professionals to ensure they have the necessary technology and can
manage it so as not to interfere with the availability of the devices for students, but also to ensure
the network is secure and reliable.

Assistive Technologies & Accessibility
         School IT professionals often collaborate with special education teachers, leaders, and

consultants to select, install, configure, maintain, and manage assistive technologies necessary
for students who need them. These devices include items such as Braille printers, keyboards for
specialized input, specialized displays, assistive listening systems (for individual students and for
groups in presentation spaces), and other devices. In many cases, these devices are needed only
by specific students, so many of the selection and configuration decisions are made by others and
are made to meet the needs of the one individual using the device. School IT professionals may
be asked to understand the configuration and operation enough to provide troubleshooting
support for these devices. In schools that enroll older students, many of the assistive learning
devices that students use have been in service for many years as they were obtained when the
student started school, and they have used them throughout their school careers.

         Many IT professionals find this to fall outside of their area of expertise, but schools are
organizations that cannot deny any student access to education (except in very exceptional
cases). Because of this, school IT professionals do have responsibility to provide adequate
support for these users and devices, and denial to do so will likely represent a violation of school
policy.

         In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities act became law in the United States. This civil
rights law is intended to ensure all individuals have access to public resources regardless of their
disability status. For educators, this means the materials they use in class (such as textbooks,
videos, and presentations) must be available to all. For the resources created by publishers,
obtaining alternative versions of resources is not a problem as they understand this requirement
and have prepared the necessary versions. For example, it is usually easy to obtain audio or
Braille versions of textbooks from traditional publishers. For those materials created by teachers,
it is necessary they take steps to ensure their materials are accessible. It is also necessary to take
steps to confirm resources from publishers are accessible. For example, the presentations that are
included in the instructor resources that accompany textbooks are not always accessible.

     Microsoft Office (along with most other productivity applications) has an accessibility
     checker tool that identifies properties of the file that make it inaccessible. Before
     distributing a PowerPoint presentation to students, for example, a teacher should make
     sure the file "passes" the accessibility check. When introducing accessibility and the
     checking tools, I often have teachers check the presentations provided by their textbook
     publisher and we find many do not pass.

                                                              76
Copyright Issues
         One of the most challenging issues related to digital information in schools is copyright.

This is especially true in the time since one-to-one initiatives became common. One rationale for
adding computing devices for each student to the budget was that textbooks (traditionally a very
expensive resource) would no longer be necessary. While textbooks that are available as open
educational resources, thus available for reuse and editing at no cost, many educators who teach
without textbooks rely on other types of information, and some of those uses violate copyright
protections.

         When educational resources were print, the work of making physical copies of copyright-
protected materials was expensive. In most cases, it was cheaper to purchase addition copies of a
novel for English class, for example, than it was to make photocopies of a single copy.
Regardless, many teachers were found standing at the photocopier (which is likely connected to
the network and also allows scanning to either network drives or email addresses and is managed
by the school IT professionals) and other to make copies of materials for students before, during,
and after school.

     A former colleague used to tell the story of getting pulled over for speeding on the way
     to work one morning. According to his story, the officer said, "If you give me a good
     excuse, I won't write the speeding ticket." He replied, "I'm a teacher and I have to
     make copies for my students." It is unclear if he was violating copyrights with his
     copying, but he did not get the ticket. I do not recommend trying to see if the excuse
     convinces a police officer to not write a ticket.

         When educational media was analog, for example video on VHS tapes, many teachers
had their own collection of pirated video materials. Despite the fact the video degraded over
time, teachers valued their collections because they represented a significant investment of time
and money, and using this video in class was easier than the previous generation of projected
films. The costs of copying digital files, on the other hand, is effectively zero. Unless the files are
protected with digital right management locks (which many educational videos are) digital files
can be copied with a mouse click and the new file uses a miniscule part of existing resources. For
these reasons, it is very easy to make copies of files that one is not entitled to make.

         Because copies can be made using the devices they manage, many IT professionals are
expected to define procedures to reduce illegal reproduction of copyright protected files, help
users understand the importance of following copyright regulations, and addressing violations of
copyrights. Consider these situations which are all violations of copyright:

          Scanning paper versions of books or magazines and distributing the digital copies to
             students;

          Downloading images from the Internet and incorporating them into your materials;
          Extracting a digital audio file (commonly called "ripping") from a compact disk and

             using it as background music in a presentation;
          Accessing textbooks publishers' web sites to download and use the instructors'

             resources or other supplementary materials without using the textbooks;

                                                              77
          Purchasing a single subscription to a database, then distributing the materials to
             students.

         While ensuring teachers are following copyright laws is unlikely to be the responsibility
of most IT professionals, they do have a role in pointing out when copyright has been violated to
protect the school and themselves. They also work closely with librarians to promote responsible
use of digital resources and to ensure the library materials are available to all users both on
campus and off campus as their licenses allow.

Fair Use
         There are situations in which educators (and others) are allowed to make copies of works

that are protected by copyrights, and these uses are referred to as fair use. Many teachers claim
that they are entitled to use any materials in any way they see fit, and reason, "I'm not selling it"
or "It's for educational purposes." Fair use does not allow teachers to copy anything for any
purpose, but it does allow for limited educational use as long as it is a small part of the whole
and that the copies do not interfere with the copyright holder's ability to be compensated.

     If I am a subscriber to a magazine and I take a screenshot of a graph in an article to add
     to my slide show that I present in class, it is likely that is allowed under fair use. If I
     take the entire article and distribute it to my students year after year, then it is not
     protected by fair use.

         One of the important distinctions between fair use and violating copyright has to do with
the size of the audience to which it is distributed. If a copyright protected work is used for a
presentation made to a small group (for example if a popular song is incorporated into a student's
presentation that is show to classmates) then--while technically a violation of copyright--it is
unlikely to be problematic. If that same presentation is posted to the school web site or YouTube
channel, then it is problematic. Of course, the responsible use of digital materials is one aspect of
good digital citizenship, so student should understand their responsibilities regardless of the size
of the audience.

Creative Commons
         Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Harvard University, founded the Creative Commons

in 2001. This non-profit organization supports authors who apply Creative Commons licenses to
the works they create. While materials published under any Creative Commons license (as of
2022 there are six different licenses, seven if one counts the license that places work in the public
domain) are available at no cost, they are still copyrighted, but--depending on the license--
others may use the materials in various ways.

         All Creative Commons licenses, except for public domain in which the creator places the
work in the same class as works in which the copyright protection has expired, require the
creator be attributed. All licenses allow others to make copies of the works and to distribute
them, but there are some restrictions on those copies. The restrictions have to do with the
commercialization of works (some works cannot be used for profit-making purposes), the
creation of derivative works (some materials cannot be edited), and the licensing of derived
works (some derivative works must be licensed in the same way as the original.)

                                                              78

7: IT Decision-Making in Schools

         My rationale for writing this book is grounded in the premise that schools are unfamiliar
places for many IT professionals. In this chapter, I focus on the nature of decision-making
related to information technology in schools.

     In schools, IT decision-making is complicated by several factors. First, many educators are
technology-savvy, but often not in relation to enterprise systems. They may have deep
understanding of what they want technology to do in their classrooms, and this is grounded in the
fact they use their personal computers in their work. They may even have successfully installed
consumer network devices in their homes and manage multiple devices on those home networks.
While that is a worthy accomplishment and it does indicate an impressive level of technological
knowledge, it does not scale to enterprise networks in the manner they might predict. In some
cases, those educators who "know enough to be dangerous" and can attempt troubleshooting or
offer advice that makes situations worse.

     During one week when I was managing IT for a small rural school, I encountered two
     examples of how educators do not understand the nature of enterprise systems. On
     Monday, a teacher brought me a sale paper for a local box store retailer (it was early in
     the holiday gift buying season). She told me she had $300 left in her classroom budget,
     and she wanted to buy a laptop that was on sale for $250. On Tuesday, I was getting
     ready to install the replacement for the 48-port switch that had failed causing a whole
     floor of the school to lose connection. A teacher asked what I was doing when she saw
     me carrying the switch into the closet where it was installed (literally a closet... this
     was an old school building). When I said, "this is the new switch," she reacted with
     surprise and said, "I thought you were replacing something like a light switch." Both
     teachers described here are individuals who could accurately be labeled "tech-savvy"
     because of their use of IT in their classrooms and their web presence.

         A second factor complicating IT decision-making in schools is the fact that IT
professionals have experience in school, and they have concepts of what teaching is. This can be
especially true if the IT professionals have recent experience in higher education or workplace
training where the lecture methods are exceedingly common. Providing the IT for lecture-based
teaching methods, in which the instructor talks at a group of students who are facing the front of
the classroom is a relatively easy task. A single workstation with a projector and speakers
connected so that text, images, audio, and video content can be seen meets the need.

         Increasing numbers of educators are coming to realize that lecture-based teaching
methods are ineffective, and they are exploring and using other strategies. These new methods
can conflict with the concepts IT professionals have, and the IT for active learning classrooms is
much more complicated and flexible than that for lecture-based classrooms.

         A third factor complicating IT decision-making in schools is school administrators who
are ultimately responsible for planning and decision-making are often far removed from
classrooms and have incomplete knowledge of enterprise-level IT. Their conceptualization of
teaching and the role of technology in the classroom may be grounded in their teaching

                                                              80
experiences, which are likely to have been brief and using primitive technology compared to that
available to today's teachers. Most school leaders are also quite savvy technology users, but for
their own productivity, not for teaching and not for providing reliable, robust, and secure systems
for large numbers of users.

     iPads and other tablets are popular devices amongst school leaders. They are very
     portable, easy to use, and can be used as they walk around school buildings. These
     devices are designed to improve the productivity of a single user and are notoriously
     difficult to manage from a centralized location, thus they are avoided by many school
     IT managers. They are also notoriously difficult for some of the traditional classroom
     uses such as typing papers. Some of these difficulties are less problematic now than
     when the devices first arrived on the market, they still are little used in schools. This did
     not stop leaders in many schools from initiating large-scale table purchases. They
     reasoned, "my tablet helps me be productive, so they will help everyone be productive."
     They were unaware, however, of the differences between the tasks they do with
     technology and the tasks students and teachers do and they were unaware of the
     configuration and management challenges.

         Planning and designing school IT systems is a complicated process. It occurs on different
levels with the school organization, involves different stakeholders who have different types of
expertise, and that requires collaboration and clear communication.

The Nature of Goals
         Almost all management and leadership teams focus their work by establishing goals. It is

reasoned that decisions and actions in the organization must be directed towards the desired state
described by the goals. Just like in all organization, goals and the actions undertaken to achieve
them do exist on several levels. It is important to examine the nature of the goals when defining
and achieving them requires the participation of stakeholders with different types of expertise. In
all organizations decisions are made for several purposes, and goals are set at three levels to
guide decision-making and improve performance.

Strategic Goals
         At the broadest level, organizations have strategic goals which describe the purpose of

the organization, and the conditions leaders expect to be true. They are usually captured in the
mission statements that are adopted by the leaders at the highest levels. In schools, the strategic
goals are focused on graduating students who are "smart." The specific language depends on the
local priorities and preferences, but most will agree that the purpose of schools is to help young
people learn. The challenge for educators and school leaders is defining what exactly represents
"smart." There are many types of knowledge and some of the proxies commonly used to define it
(like test scores) are notoriously unreliable and tend to focus on only one type of knowledge. In
addition, closers inspection reveals cultural and other biases that are unrecognized.

         School leaders regularly convene strategic planning meetings at which they define the
strategic goals that will focus their efforts. The goals defined in these meetings are typically
intended to address problems that are identified by regulatory or legislative changes, local or

                                                              81
regional political situations, data indicating academic weaknesses, emerging teaching practices,
or the preferences or expertise of leaders. For many reasons, strategic goals are typically updated
each year for schools even if the mission statements are not.

         In the vocabulary of planning, organizations that achieve their strategic goal can be
labeled "efficacious." The chief information officer of a school can expect they will both frame
their departmental goals in terms of strategic goals and to support other departments as they
support the same goals.

Logistic Goals
         Strategic goals are necessarily broad, and they are accomplished only through the

cooperation of disparate departments. Especially in schools, strategic goals are also open to
interpretation; what is seen as success in reaching the strategic goal may be seen as failure to
others. While educators and support staff, including IT professionals, may keep the school's
strategic goals in mind as they go about their work, those goals are rarely sufficiently focused to
guide daily tasks.

         The daily work of IT professional is defined by logistic goals which are the things they
need to accomplish as they are designing, improving, configuring, and managing IT systems.
While strategic goals are typically defined by the school leaders, with the input of other
stakeholders, the logistic goals are typically established by departmental leaders. For school IT
professionals, most logistic goals are defined in collaboration with educators or business office
staff.

         When defining logistic goals, the best planners ensure there is a clear connection between
the strategic and logistic goals of the organization. When the goals are aligned in this way and
the goals are being achieved, planners would label them "effective."

Efficiency Goals
         School IT departments are typically understaffed, so IT professionals working in schools

will define goals and design systems to improve the efficiency of the operations of the
department. These can include technology solutions (for example ticketing or messaging systems
to speed up triage and repair and defining replacement plans to ensure devices are in good
repair), training solutions (both those to help users be more independent and those to improve the
skills of technicians), and procedural solutions (for example, assigning technicians to specific
places or a regular schedule so that users can get support at known times).

         Typically, the efficiency goals are defined by the members of the IT department, and they
have the most control over their definition and the systems to improve their efficiency and
productivity. Ideally, there is alignment and connection between the different types of goals in
organizations. When IT professionals meet their efficiency goals, they will be more effective in
meeting the logistic goals they have set with other stakeholders, so that the school can achieve
the strategic goals.

                                                              82
Dimensions of IT Decision-Making
         If technology is going to be used to achieve the strategic and logistic goals of the school,

then decisions must be made that address multiple dimensions. Each of these dimensions are
separate from the others: there are different professionals making decisions about efficient
operations within each and they bring different expertise to those decisions. Those dimensions
and the decisions and decision-makers within each are not independent, however. Teachers
decide the appropriate design of the IT for their instructional needs. IT professionals are
responsible that to ensure the technology has been properly configured so that it functions as
expected. School administrators are responsible to ensure the system is reasonably implemented
and can be maintained given the budget and other limitations (see figure 2).

Figure 2. Dimensions of efficacious IT in schools
         Because the decisions made within one dimension can determine what can be done

within the others and also the efficiency of operations within it, the decision-makers within each
are interdependent. Unless the decisions affect only the efficiency of the professionals working
within the dimension, then multiple perspectives and different stakeholder are involved. The
composition and operations of steering committees that make such decisions and set logistics
goals related to IT in schools are addressed in the following section. Here, the focus is on
appropriate designs, proper configuration, and reasonable implementation of IT systems.

         The term "stay in your lane" has become common in schools and other organizations in
which leaders share decision-making and ask members to evaluate the situation and possible

                                                              83
solutions to problems and recommend steps that are incorporated into strategic plans and actions.
When these members are attempting to affect decisions in a domain that has not been included in
their area of responsibility, then leaders will recommend they "stay in your lane." While this
phrase that is not well-received ("after all," it is reasoned, "why ask me to be a leader and
recommend actions if you are going to reject them?"), the design of school IT systems depends
on three very different types of expertise so "staying in your lane" is sound advice as it is
unlikely any one individual has sufficiently broad expertise to make informed recommendations
in more than one.

         Teachers and other educators make decisions about the nature of the technology they and
their students need; this input can be called "appropriate design." IT professionals make
decisions about what is installed and how it operates. While this is informed by the input of the
teachers, IT professionals determine the "proper configuration" of the technology. School leaders
make decisions about what is allowed to be done and they set resource limits; this ensures the IT
is reasonably implemented. These groups do not make decisions in isolation, and they make
better decisions when they communicate and integrate the needs of others into their decisions. At
the end of the day, however, teachers teach, IT manages IT, and leaders oversee the entire
endeavor. The most efficacious, effective, and efficient IT systems exist in schools where
decision-makers "stay in their lane," but ask lots of questions to understand that rationale for
others' recommendations.

Appropriate Design
         Schools are places where learning is supposed to occur. Educators, including teachers and

curriculum leaders, are the professionals who are responsible for defining what should be taught
and how it should be taught including the role of technology in the students' experience. IT
systems in schools must be configured in such a way that teachers believe it allows them to teach
what they must teach in the manner they should teach it.

         The appropriate nature of the IT system design is determined by teachers' perceptions
that:

          The available information technology affords the experiences students need.
             Educational experiences comprise an increasingly diverse collection including
             accessing information; interacting with classmates, faculty, staff, and others outside
             the school (when appropriate); and creating and disseminating products and
             performances in which they demonstrate their learning.

          The technology is sufficient to meet their needs. Sufficiency includes both the
             computing capacity, for example the software they need is operational on the
             available computers, and the number of devices.

          The technology is easy to use for both students and teachers.

         While planning is an activity with which all educators and professionals in other fields
find very familiar, the work of creating IT systems for school users is best described as design

                                                              84
rather than planning. Plans usually have clear goals in mind and specific measures established
before the work begins. Later, performance is assessed, and new plans are established. In design,
the goals, strategies, and measures emerge as the project is underway. Further, the project in
undertaken with the intent of updating the work as it proceeds. Because it is an iterative process,
the versions of the system that are developed during design are understood to be temporary. The
best feedback to incorporate into the design process is framed in a theory; technology acceptance
(see pages xx-xx) is one such theory that has proven effective in many schools.

         While teachers are the primary population to create appropriate designs for educational
technology, they do this in collaboration with other professional educators and IT professionals.
Technology integration specialists (see pages xx-xx) are educators with greater than usual
expertise with IT, so their insight is valuable during while defining appropriate designs. IT
professionals are also responsible for the proper configuration of the systems, so their
participation is necessary as well, but educators must establish the appropriate design of the IT
systems for teaching and learning. Once the needs have been designed, IT professionals are
responsible for properly configuring the systems.

Proper Configuration
         What emerges from the appropriate design process is a collection of IT tools and features

the educators deem necessary for the IT to meet the intended educational goals. It is the role of
the IT professionals to ensure that technology is properly configured to both provide that need,
plus reflect the responsible configuration of the system. Remember, we do not want IT
professionals running schools and we do not want educators to be running IT systems. Proper
configuration of the IT systems ensures they meet industry standards and they are secure,
reliable, and robust.

         First, devices and data are secured to minimize threats. Securing systems is work that has
accepted procedures regardless of the nature of the organization. The same strategies for
physically securing the IT systems (e.g. keeping wiring closets locked, ensuring cooling systems
are functioning, and uninterruptable power supplies are installed as needed) in a businesses an
organizations are used to secure school systems. The same strategies for providing virtual
security of the devices (e.g. using malware protection, firewalls, and other threat protections) as
deployed as well. Security also extends to data; properly configured systems prevent users from
accessing data they are not supposed to access. The nature of this work has changed as data and
applications have merged to software and platforms as service rather than data centers on
campus; the need to both establish the identify of users and make sure they access only what they
are authorized to are as important as ever.

         Second, properly configured systems are reliable; they are available whenever they are
needed. Some threats to reliability can be avoided, for example by scheduling software updates
and hardware upgrades to occur during times when school is not in session. Other threats to
reliability--for example failed devices--cannot be avoided, but regularly upgrading devices and
ensuring firmware and other software is updated reduces device failure. One advantage of using

                                                              85
cloud-based systems for productivity suites and data management systems is those are largely
built on virtual servers which can be made redundant at much lower cost and much quicker than
physical servers.

         Third, properly configured systems are robust which means they have the capacity to
meet the load. As one-to-one initiatives have gained popularity in schools, the need to increase
the capacity of wireless networks to manage the connections of dozens of devices and provide
sufficient bandwidth so no users experiences network latency (the term IT professionals use for
"a slow network") has become one of the most important aspects of properly configuring IT in
schools.

     Story from the real world: I was once called in to help troubleshoot a malfunctioning
     network in a school: When the first few teachers and administrators arrived in the
     morning, the network worked well, and productivity was high. When students arrived
     and began connecting their laptops (which were provided by the school) to the network,
     things quickly slowed to a crawl. Despite the fact devices were connected (i.e. we could
     ping both internally and externally), they could neither send nor receive data. The first
     technicians to diagnose the problem concluded it was the result of a malware infected
     computer which was sending out enough data to use all of the school's bandwidth. He
     reasoned performance was degraded as soon as they devices arrived and connected. We
     were unable to see any node on the network sending excessive data, however.

     We were able to look closer to find that a single device on the network was assigning IP
     addresses and routing almost all the traffic for the several hundred student laptops and
     scores of desktop computers in the school. That single device was not robust enough to
     manage all the tasks it was assigned. Once the configuration was changed and the
     management of network was dispersed to multiple devices, the performance of the
     network returned to normal.

         Appropriate design can sometimes interfere with proper configuration, especially when
educators ask for excessive flexibility in how they access and use the IT. Proper configuration
can also interfere with appropriate design, especially if steps to make systems secure pose
insurmountable barriers to accessing the systems. Of course, some appropriate designs and some
proper configurations may be deemed unreasonable by the school leaders who are ultimately
responsible for school operations.

              The art teacher responsible for the youngest grades in an elementary school
     wanted to be able to connect an iPad to the projector in her classroom so that she could
     do demonstrations and display works so that all students could see without the need to
     crowd around one table. The IT professional responsible for her building insisted she
     leave the projector in a single spot and refused to connect it to any device other than the

                                                              86
     desktop on her desk. The art teacher bought an adapter to allow the iPad to connect to
     the projector via a long HDMI cable. The PC remained connected via the VGA
     connection, but she switched the input to HDMI when she used her iPad. In an example
     of poor customer service, the technicians refused to provide any additional support for
     the projector in the art teacher's classroom as she had departed from the recommended
     configuration.

Reasonable Implementation
         School boards hire superintendents and other high-level administrators to make the

ultimate decisions about what happens in the school. These leaders are charged with ensuring all
decisions, including those related to appropriate design and proper configuration of IT systems
are reasonable. Reasonableness is defined by:

          Budgets--All decisions must fall within the available budgets and the anticipated
             budgets into the future.

         
          Human resources expectations--Master contracts and employment laws in the

             regions where the school is located affect what is allowed in schools.
         
          Adopted policies--Other regulations and laws are usually reflected in the policies

             that are adopted by the school board.

         When school administrators make decisions about what is reasonable, they may override
all the other decisions made by teachers or IT professionals, and it may be uncomfortable for the
leaders to communicate those decisions, but making the decisions is relatively easy. They have
the money, or they don't; this is confirmed by the business manager. The procedures violate
policy, or they don't; this is confirmed by the school's legal advisers.

         The more difficult decisions about reasonable implantation can arise when there is
conflict between the appropriate designs and the proper configurations. How these conflicts can
be reasonably negotiated and resolved is the focus of the next sections. In those case, we see the
political factors that affect many decisions in schools. Most IT professionals do not have direct
interaction with those elected to govern local schools, but the policies and procedures they define
and even the discussions that have affect the culture in which school employees work and
priorities that affect school leaders' decisions.
Design Cycle

         We know IT systems must be appropriately designed, properly configured, and
reasonably implemented. These characteristics are not necessarily the same and can be
contradictory.

         A fundamental aspect of managing school IT systems is designing them for the purpose
of continuously improving them. In general, appropriate design must be the primary goal of the

                                                              87
design, but proper configuration is also essential, and school administrators always have the
ultimate decision-making authority. By following the design cycle presented in figure x, steering
committees can design for improvement, and school administrators can decide which perspective
should be given priority at any point in the design process.

                                             Figure 3. Design cycle

         The design cycle begins with technicians configuring systems according to their
knowledge of proper configurations, limits of their skills, the extant infrastructure, budgets, time,
and other locally relevant circumstances, especially their understanding of the appropriate
design. Once the system is built, technicians must ensure teachers and others understand how to
operate it, and they have an obligation to understand and follow those procedures. If teachers and
students are using the system as designed by the technicians, but they find the design is not what
they need, then they "complain." The factors associated with technology acceptance (see pages
xx-xx), specifically ease of use and effectiveness, are used to frame the improvements that are
needed, so they are not really complaints. If the school has a well-functioning steering
committee, then they will meet to define the new configuration that will ensure the new version
of appropriate design is realized.

         This design cycle many be used either formally or informally and different component of
the total IT system in the school can be at different stages of the cycle at any moment. Further,
each stage of the process may require multiple iterations before process is sufficient for the next
stage to begin. The degree to which a stage is completed before the next iteration begins appears
to correlate with teachers' effort expectancy.

         At different stages of the cycle, all stakeholders must defer to decisions made by different
stakeholders. Technicians make initial design decisions, so educators must defer to their
expertise and use systems as the technicians design them to be used. When educators find aspects
of the system that interfere with technology acceptance, then technicians must defer to educators'
perceptions and change the system to improve their acceptance. School administrators are hired
to manage school operations and to ensure conditions are appropriate for teaching and learning.
When progressing through this technology planning cycle, school administrators must recognize
the stage and ensure the recommendations of the correct stakeholders are being implemented.

                                                              88
         When the planning cycle is active and completed on a continuous manner, the practice is
associated with improved perceptions of facilitating conditions. A principal captured the effect of
focusing on technology acceptance during the planning cycle. "When we talk about technology
at faculty meetings, I used to hear endless griping about how stuff was never fixed. The
technicians stuck to their plans and were reluctant to modify things." After introducing the
design cycle and insisting "complaints" be expressed as those aspects of the system that made it
hard to use or that interfered with teaching, the perceptions of the system seemed to change. He
observed, "We have opened communication about the role of the system in our school and the
conditions necessary for it to serve our purposes" (Ackerman, 2018).

     The password story ended this way: The teacher complained to the principal that the
     password requirements were too complicated and that her students were being denied
     computer-based lessons because they were taking so long to log on. Some students had
     given up, and refused to even try logging on; it was too frustrating.

     The principal deferred to the technology coordinator who said it was too risky to have
     simple passwords for those students, so he did not modify the password requirements.

     The teacher asked the principal to join her students in the computer room when they
     were next scheduled to be there. After spending 10 minutes seeing the frustrations and
     helping students get logged on, he insisted the technology coordinator allow passwords
     the students could use.

     The technology coordinator created an organizational unit in the user management
     console of the network software and set the permissions for the users in the group that
     left him confident the system would be secure if the passwords were compromised.

     In this case, the teachers identified "easy log on" as the appropriate configuration. The
     principal decided "easy log on" was reasonable. The technology coordinator configured
     the organizations unity so that it properly protected the system while allowing easy log
     on.

Acceptable Use Policies
         The leaders of all organizations take steps to protect themselves and the organization

from liabilities and damage resulting from the inappropriate use of IT systems. At the highest
levels, the organization's governing body (school board are generally responsible for adopting
policy) will adopt policies to protect the organization by ensuring they comply with relevant laws
and regulations, and to minimize threats to the IT systems which represent a significant expense.
As long as policies are lawful, and policies are usually written with significant input from the
governing body's legal counsel, then policy defines what IT users can do using it's IT systems
and violation of policies can lead to termination of employees.

         While policy is the ultimate rules that must for followed, users of IT typically follow
procedures which are more easily understood, and which have been defined to facilitate
management of the systems for everyday use by teachers, students, and others. If it is discovered
that IT procedures violate policy, they will be overturned. In schools where collaborative IT
planning is observed, new procedures that meet the needs of the IT professionals, but that aligns

                                                              89
with policy will be defined with the input of multiple stakeholders, including school
administrators, which reduces the likelihood that procedures will be overturned. Revising policy
takes a significant amount of time and policy makers typically revise IT (and other policies) on a
regular basis (usually with years between revisions).

         While the acceptable use policies adopted by school boards are the ultimate policy that
must be followed, those can be written in language that is difficult for laypeople to understand.
This is especially true regarding children, who we know comprise the majority of school IT
users. In response, IT professionals and educators will collaborate to create "acceptable use
policy" documents that are written in language that is appropriate for the students.

         Having students and adults sign AUP's is a largely symbolic activity in schools. The
signature does indicate students, parents, educators, and others have been made aware of the
policy. Whether one has signed an AUP or not, they are obligated to follow policy and failure to
follow the policy can result in school administrators taking actions to ensure policy is followed.
Because it is symbolic, it does not mean that AUP's are meaningless. These can present a
valuable opportunity for teaching students about cybersecurity, cyberbullying, privacy, and other
situations in which IT may be misused, and lessons focused on the school's AUP are often
included in the curriculum in part to address the International Society for Technology in
Education's standards related to digital citizenship.

Steering Committees
         School administrators, the licensed professionals hired by school boards to implement

their decisions and policies, have ultimate responsibility for all decisions in the school.
Efficacious administrators understand they do not have sufficient expertise to make appropriate
and proper decisions. They also understand reasonable implementation will also necessitate they
make decisions about the limits to what technology can be purchased and what professionals can
be hired. In addition, they will be negotiating and resolving situations in which there is
disagreement over what priorities should be selected when making decisions.

         To reduce the conflicts between what teachers want, what technologists need, and what
the budget and policy allows, school leaders convene steering committees to recommend
decisions and actions. The individuals who sit on technology steering committee are usually
selected because have a strong vision for the organization, broad understanding of the operations
of the organization, and an interest in identifying technologies that appear to be fill the gaps in
how the organization is functioning and the technology that is available.

         Steering committees are diverse groups comprising representatives from across the
community. They have a strong vision for the organization, broad understanding of the
operations of the organization, and an interest in identifying technologies that appear to be fill
the gaps in how the organization is functioning and the technology that is available. It is in the
work of steering committees that teachers and technicians and administrators share their own
perspectives and find solutions that are mutually supportive. All teachers want technology that is
secure, reliable, and robust, but there are also things they and their students must be able to do.
All IT professionals want the systems they build to support teaching and learning, but they also
must insist they are aligned with good principles of IT management and that they can be
supported with existing capacity and expertise.

         The work of the steering committee is to simultaneously negotiate appropriate design and
proper configuration and reasonable implementation so that system improvement is manageable

                                                              90
within the existing technological capacity, predictable for teachers, and sustainable at the
necessary scale.

Permissions Problem
         IT professionals know the danger of using computers when logged on with an account

that has administrator permissions. When logged on with an administrator account, users have
access to controls to change configurations, install software, and manage other users. All of these
have potential to be set improperly. Most IT professionals have two accounts; they user a regular
account when doing their day-to-day work and only log on with administrator credentials when
they intend to make changes, then they log off as soon as they are done.

         In general, school administrators should not be given IT administrator credentials. The
potential they can inadvertently misconfigure systems is too great. In fact, no school
administrator who understands the importance of secure, reliable, and robust IT systems would
want to have administrator access to the systems.

         Responsible IT leaders will take steps, however, to ensure the IT systems can be
administered in their absence. This can include having multiple individuals with administrator
credentials and it can also include making administrator credentials available to school
administrators. Especially when new individuals are hired as school administrators or chief
information officers, the best leaders will review plans to respond in situations such as these that
arise:

          The primary system administrator becomes incapacitated by a stroke (which
             happened to me when I was the primary system administrator for a school;
             fortunately, I was able to return to work before major IT malfunctions).

          An IT professional with administrator credentials is denied a promotion and walks off
             the job when informed he wasn't promoted.

          The technology coordinator for a small school is on a vacation in a remote region and
             the IT system becomes dysfunctional while he is gone.

                                                              91
8: Getting Hired

         Throughout the book, I have added some call out boxes with suggestions on how to
prepare for being interviewed for information technology positions in schools. In this final
chapter, I turn attention to the details of getting hired to work as an ITRR professional in school,
specifically, I turn attention to finding openings, the application procedures one is likely to
encounter, what to expect during interviews, and what to expect after you are hired.

         The reality of finding and securing jobs in education is a very localized process.
Individuals will find the contents of this chapter may not accurately describe the process for
getting hired in schools will not describe their local situations. Individuals interested in working
in schools are encouraged to investigate the details of getting hired by local schools by talking to
teachers or other school employees in the area or reaching out to the human resources
professionals at a local school to ask where they post openings.

Job Openings
         Employment vacancies in schools arise for the same reasons vacancies arise in any

organization. Leaders may decide additional workers are needed to keep systems operational (the
may new expertise or they may need more of the current expertise), so they create new positions.
Other openings arise when individuals leave because they are terminated, they resign, they are
transferred to other positions in the school, or they retire. The volatile nature of enrollments and
funding, which has been exacerbated by the effects of the pandemic, has made school
employment unpredictable. Positions may remain vacant to save limited budgets, or they may
remain vacant because qualified applicants cannot be found. At the same time, some schools
have added technicians to the IT staff to support the infrastructure necessary for the increased
reliance on online or remote teaching. They have also hired instructional technology specialists
to support teachers as they design and deliver lessons using video conferencing and other
distance learning methods. The degree to which the additions are going to be permanent in
unclear.

         Schools are also institutions that have short-term openings to fill in when employees take
family or medical leave. In addition, short-term positions funded by grants are not unusual in
schools. While part-time positions sometime become permanent, many veterans of school work
caution that often the duties of part-time positions expand while the pay does not.

         As public institutions, and institutions in which employees are often unionized, school
leaders often must follow specific procedures for filling openings. For example, it is sometimes
necessary that open positions be advertised to internal candidates, and those candidates to be
considered before the opening is advertised to external candidates. Schools are also institutions
that have been seeking to recruit candidates that will increase the diversity of the faculty and
staff. Recruitment does not mean candidates that increase diversity are hired preferentially.

         When being interviewed for IT positions in schools, candidates are sometimes told the
reason for the opening. Some interview committees are open to answering questions about what
motivated the opening.

Job Search
         When positions come open in schools, the vacancies are advertised. Previous generations

of educators and school employees looked in newspapers to find job openings in local or

                                                              92
regional schools. Today, education jobs (like job in many other fields) are posted on online job
boards. Using these job boards, those searching for positions can find openings for many schools
in one place. The specific job boards used tend to be regional; if one school uses a particular job
board, it is likely nearby schools will use the same one.

         Other job sites used by schools are sponsored by and even supported by local agencies or
by professional organizations in state or regional organizations. Some of those postings are cross
listed on some of the large commercial job sites, often with links to the specific job site and
posting used by the school. In addition, most school web sites include an "employment
opportunities" section, which is probably a link the openings they have listed on the job board
they use.

Applying
         Once a candidate has identified an opening for which they want to apply, they will follow

the application procedures specified. Previous generations of applicants submitted hard copies of
their application materials, and in some instances, applicants are still directed to submit hard
copies. It is far more common for applicants to submit application materials online.

         Some job boards that are used by schools include an option for applicant to upload or
create resumes, cover letters, and even to upload letters of recommendation, transcripts, and
license or credentials. Once these are uploaded, they can be used to apply for any position on the
site. Other schools maintain their own application platform, and completing an application
requires one to submit materials on the school's platform. (One of the frustrations for applicants
is the fact that many of these platforms require information about previous employers and similar
information to be added to the forms they provide. This can take represent a significant effort for
some; enough to dissuade some applicants.)

         Regardless of the platform used to apply for openings, when applying for an IT job in a
school, you can expect the application process will include several documents:

          Your resume should summarize your work experience and highlight your IT
             experiences especially those that are required for the position for which you are
             applying. Some find applicants who add other technology skills to their resume give a
             more complete overview of their skills that those who do not. Remember your resume
             will probably be read by those who do not understand the skills you list.

          Your cover letter should specify the position for which you are applying as well
             as your qualifications. The five-paragraph essay is a good model to follow. 1) Specify
             the job you want. 2) Introduce yourself. 3) Summarize your work experiences related
             to the position. 4) Summarize your technology skills. 5) Express interest in being
             interviewed.

          You are also likely to be asked to provide written references from three who are
             familiar with your abilities as an IT professional as well as a collaborative worker.

          Evidence of your education. This may be unofficial copies of transcripts, copies of
             professional licenses, digital badges, or other credentials.

                                                              93
         When preparing documents for your application, it is particularly important that that you
draw close connections between your experience and preparation and the role for which you are
applying. Even with a clear job description, it is not always clear to the individuals who are
reviewing applications exactly what qualification and experiences are most relevant. Be clear
and direct about your qualifications without being overconfident.

         Schools are organizations that are often open to hiring those who are new to the
profession or those returning to the workforce. If you are in either of those positions, be clear
about your skills and your willingness to learn.

     It is a good idea to learn more about the school where you are applying before you
     accept an interview. Spend some time on their web site to familiarize yourself with the
     curriculum, activities, and culture. Some applicants will search for those on the
     interview team on social media prior to the interview. I have recommended those who I
     know searched for me on social media. When I apply, I generally avoid finding them on
     social media. I never follow folks who I know will interview me after I have applied.

Interviewing
         Typically, vacancies are filled through a hiring process that is determined by the human

resources professionals in the school. A typical process will include:

              An initial screening of applicants to identify those who meet the minimum
                  requirements for the position.

              A search committee comprising individuals representing many different
                  stakeholders will select applicants to be interviewed.

              First round interviews are scheduled with the selected applicants. Increasingly, the
                  committees are expected to ask all of the candidates the same questions, and often
                  these are approved by human resources professionals to ensure they are
                  appropriate. When filling positions that require interaction with students, it is not
                  unusual to find students on the search committee.

              The search committee will recommend the top candidates for a final interview.
                  This interview is typically with a smaller group, often the person to who the
                  candidate will report, and others who will be close colleagues.

         In interviews, no one is allowed to ask about certain aspects their personal lives.
Questions about your marital or family status, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identify are
not allowed. Those types of questions are deemed protected information and cannot be used for
hiring decisions in most public organizations. Some career advising professionals recommend
candidates not disclose such information. In their application materials or in their answers to
questions. They reason, "if they can't ask about it, you shouldn't talk about it," and that is advice
intended to protect the search committee as well as the applicants.

                                                              94
     A colleague recounted a story in which they inadvertently disclosed they are
     transgender in an interview. As they said, "the committee all stopped as if they heard
     some great secret, they should not have been told."

         Those characteristics do not affect your ability as an IT professional, so just avoid them.
If those are important part of your life and they come up in your answers it is best to respond
with general references. For example, "I'm interested in a career that allows me to support my
family," is better than "I'm interested in a career that allows me to support my wife and
children," which identifies your marital and parental status as well as the gender identity of your
partner.

         Understand the interview committee is likely to comprise a diverse group of
representatives from the school community, and some of them many do not understand your
answers. If is often well to pay attention to the roles of the people who are on the committee and
direct answers about technology questions to those with technical expertise.

         Once the hiring committee has asked their questions, they often ask the candidate if they
have any questions. It is worth doing some research to ask about events that have occurred in the
recent past, but not difficult events.

         Depending on the local hiring policies, some interview processes are intended to be
advisory only. The final personnel decisions, including formal offers, salary decisions, and
similar details are addressed by human resource professionals and often school boards or other
governing bodies.

     I was once asked in an interview what I knew about the high school at which I was a
     candidate. I responded, that I knew they had a long winning streak in football about 10
     years earlier, and that I was the player who recovered the fumble that set up the
     touchdown that ended that streak. The committee got quite and looked at one
     individual. I said, "You are a football coach aren't you?" "Yes," he responded, "I knew
     your name was familiar."

         Schools are notorious for "ghosting" candidates. Applicants, even those who have been
interviewed, may never get an update on their status. While this is frustrating for applicants, they
have little recourse. Inquiries to human resources professionals are often not returned or the
standard "we cannot discuss personnel issues" reply is sent. There is little on can do about this,
but it is god to be prepared for this eventually.

Getting Hired
         Once a candidate is formally offered a position, they are usually granted a day or two to

decide if they are going to accept it. Once offers are accepted, contracts are signed, and a start
date is scheduled.

         In the 21st century, it has become very common for school employees to undergo a
background check and be fingerprinted before they begin work. In some jurisdictions, the costs
associated with this must be paid by the employee. In what seems an unnecessarily redundant
procedure, some school employees find they must undergo (and pay for) multiple background
checks. If, for example, they are hired to work at an afterschool program that is paid for through
a grant rather than the school budget, they may be required to have a separate background check
for that position.

                                                              95
Beginning Work
         Once individuals are finally hired, they begin the work. The on-boarding procedures for

IT professionals include completing required training, getting access to IT, and understanding
supervision and evaluation. All organizations include some required training as part of the on-
boarding process. In addition to the trainings common in other businesses and industries (for
example training intended to prevent harassment), school employees are required to participate
in FERPA training, mandated reporter training, blood-born pathogen training, and other training.
Depending on the role one is hired to fill, newly hired IT professionals will be trained in the
details of the systems they will be supporting and its connection to the greater IT infrastructure.

         Schools are organizations in which licensed educators are the chief executive officers.
The superintendent of schools is ultimately responsible for all aspects of school operation. The
personnel in schools can be divided into those who are responsible for academic activities
(including licensed educators and unlicensed educators) and those responsible for non-academic
activities. IT professionals are usually included in the non-academic staff, although some such as
technology integration specialists are licensed. In general, it is no appropriate for licensed
educators to be supervised and evaluated by individuals who are not licensed.

         As was discussed in chapter x, IT decision-making (which includes how to supervise and
evaluate IT professionals) is a collaborative effort. When openings are advertised, it is usually
specified to whom the hired individual will report. It is not unusual for IT professionals to be
supervised by multiple individuals. This seems unusual to those who are familiar with other
organizations, but it makes sense in education. A school IT professional must be competent with
the technology (which is evaluated by the chief information officer) and they mist interact with
school populations in an appropriate manner (which is evaluated by a licensed educator).

Summary
         Schools are interesting and rewarding workplaces for IT professionals, but they can be

challenging as well. The differences between business and industry and schools can make the
strategies and methods they developed less effect than they might predict when applied in
schools. Reflecting on the differences as described in this book will prepare IT professionals to
get hired and be successful in their careers supporting teaching and learning.
