THE EMERGENCE OF GIS IN URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING PRACTICE
During the last 20 years, geographic information systems (GIS) have transitioned from scienti c laboratories
into the heart of conventional planning practice. During this period, planners have been aggressive adopters and
adapters, and strong advocates for local governments deploying GIS. is is true in part because GIS provides a
platform for collecting and organizing spatial data, along with analyzing and manipulating capabilities that align
closely with the professional needs of urban and regional planners.
When facilitating GIS courses in the eld of urban and regional planning, we have observed a de cit of intro-
ductory textbooks speci cally written for planning students, whose career paths may require a certain set of GIS
skills that di er from those taught in geography or other departments. is textbook is our rst e ort to compile
a series of readings that we nd compelling and relevant for planning graduate students to explore spatial think-
ing and application, which will support a spatially informed future in the profession.

   e goals of this textbook are to help students acquire the technical skills of using so ware and managing a data-
base, and develop research skills of collecting data, analyzing information and presenting results. We emphasize
that the need to investigate the potential and practicality of GIS technologies in a typical planning setting and
evaluate its possible applications. GIS may not be necessary (or useful) for every planning application, and we
anticipate these readings to provide the necessary foundation for discerning its appropriate use. erefore, this
textbook attempts to facilitate spatial thinking focusing more on open-ended planning questions, which require
judgment and exploration, while developing the analytical capacity for understanding a variety of local and re-
gional planning challenges.
While this textbook provides the background for understanding the concepts in GIS as applicable to urban and
regional planning, it is best when accompanied by a hands-on tutorial, which will enable readers to develop an
in-depth understanding of the speci c planning applications of GIS. Chapters in this text book are either com-
posed by the editors using Creative Common materials, or linked to a book chapter scanned copy in the library
reserve. In the end of each chapter, we also provided several discussion questions, together with contextual appli-
cations through some web links.

CHAPTER 1: DEFINING A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM

Although GIS has been around since the 1970s, the concepts surrounding GIS are old, and even the practice of
doing GIS began before computers. e di erence today is that GIS is computerized. By computerizing GIS, we
have taken the processes away from our hand-drawn depictions, which tend to require extensive time, money,
training, and energy. Computers process numbers and mathematical equations far quicker than people. Yet,
before the concepts behind GIS were transferred to computers, people were doing manual GIS by combining
spatial and attribute data on various types of media including hard-copy maps, hard-copy overlays (acetate or
vellum), aerial photographs, written reports, eld notebooks, and--of course--their eyes and minds.
With manual GIS, a large base map was o en placed on a tabletop, and a series of transparent overlay maps,
drawn at the same scale, were placed on top of the base map. One would then look for relationships among the
base map and the features on the transparent overlays. Frequently, spatial data were copied from one map (or
aerial photograph) to another. is took time, and because of it, many great ideas about the relationships of the
Earth's features (both physical and human) were not analyzed. ese ideas were constrained by the amount of
time it took to do the analysis. Still, some impressive manual GIS projects did occur. e much-repeated exam-
ple of Dr. John Snow's Cholera map is a great example of manual GIS (Figure 1.1).

In the 1840s, a cholera outbreak killed several hundred residents in London's Soho section. Snow, a physician,
located the address of each fatality on a hand-drawn base map and soon a cluster of cases was visible. en,
on the base map, over the streets and fatalities, he drew the locations of water wells. Familiar with the idea of
distance decay, he knew that people might go a far distance to purchase a product that was cheaper, but they
would go to the nearest well because water was free and heavy to carry. Snow could see that the fatalities clus-
tered largely among those who lived near the Broad Street water well. He and his students took the handle o
the water pump, and new cholera cases dropped rapidly. By disabling the pump, Snow demonstrated the spatial
relationship between cholera fatalities and the Broad Street water well, and, more importantly, he established the
relationship between cholera and drinking water.

                                                                   2

Even with the advent of computers, GIS applications to several decades to transform to the personal computer
that we use today. Originally, the largest and most powerful computers were mainframes that were available to
some academics and government o cials. In the 1980s, most GIS applications ran on workstation computers
tied to mainframe computers because the early microcomputers (IBM, Apple, etc.) did not have enough mem-
ory, storage capacity, or processing ability. Today's personal computers, however, are fast, capable of storing and
processing large datasets, and can process multiple tasks simultaneously. is enables many academics, govern-
ment agencies (from local to federal), organizations, and small and large businesses to use GIS. Computer-based
GIS has its advantages, but requires trained users.

GIS DATA MODELS
In order to visualize natural phenomena, one must rst determine how to best represent geographic space. Data
models are a set of rules and/or constructs used to describe and represent aspects of the real world in a computer.
Two primary data models are available to complete this task: raster data models and vector data models.

VECTOR DATA MODEL
An introductory GIS course o en emphasizes the vector data model, since it is the more commonly used in the
planning professions. Vector data models use points and their associated [X and Y] coordinate pairs to represent
the vertices of spatial features, much as if they were being drawn on a map by hand (Arono 1989)1. e data
attributes of these features are then stored in a separate database management system. e spatial information
and the attribute information for these models are linked via a simple identi cation number that is given to each
feature on a map. ree fundamental vector types exist in GIS: points, lines, and polygons, each of which we
de ne below (and illustrate in Figure 1.2):

    % Points are zero-dimensional objects that contain only a single coordinate pair. Points are typically used
         to model singular, discrete features such as buildings, wells, power poles, sample locations, and so forth.
         Points have only the property of location. Other types of point features include the node and the vertex.
         Speci cally, a point is a stand-alone feature, while a node is a topological junction representing a common
         X, Y coordinate pair between intersecting lines and/or polygons. Vertices are de ned as each bend along
         a line or polygon feature that is not the intersection of lines or polygons. Points can be spatially linked to
         form more complex features.

    % Lines are one-dimensional features composed of multiple, explicitly connected points. Lines are used to
         represent linear features such as roads, streams, faults, boundaries, and so forth. Lines have the property of
         length. Lines that directly connect two nodes are sometimes referred to as chains, edges, segments, or arcs.

    % Polygons are two-dimensional features created by multiple lines that loop back to create a "closed" feature.
         In the case of polygons, the rst coordinate pair (point) on the rst line segment is the same as the last
         coordinate pair on the last line segment. Polygons are used to represent features such as city boundar-
         ies, geologic formations, lakes, soil associations, vegetation communities, and so forth. Polygons have the
         properties of area and perimeter. Polygons are also called areas.

RASTER DATA MODEL
   e raster data model is widely used in applications ranging far beyond geographic information systems (GISs).

Most likely, you are already very familiar with this data model if you have any experience with digital photographs.
   e raster data model consists of rows and columns of equally sized pixels interconnected to form a planar surface.
   ese pixels are used as building blocks for creating points, lines, areas, networks, and surfaces. Although pixels

may be triangles, hexagons, or even octagons, square pixels represent the simplest geometric form with which to
work. Accordingly, the vast majority of available raster GIS data are built on the square pixel. e contrast between
raster and vector model re ect the `pixilization' of a raster, which would be points, lines and polygons in a vector
data model (Figure 1.3). e raster data model is a part of a later chapter.

VECTOR VS. RASTER
Which is better? Although GIS users have their own personal favorite data model, the question of which is "bet-
ter" is an incomplete question. ere are advantages and disadvantages to both data models, so a better ques-
tion is which is better for particular applications or datasets. Some in the GIS industry use the slogan "Raster is
faster, but vector is corrector." While this is a good starting point, it conceals the details. Yes, your computer can
process raster data quicker, but today computer processors are so fast the di erence may be negligible. Yes, vec-

                                                                   4

tor output looks more accurate, but you can increase pixel resolution to something resembling vector resolution
(this, however, greatly increases the database size). In the following we try to list the advantage and disadvantag-
es of vector and raster le.

VECTOR ADVANTAGES:
    1. Intuitive. In our minds, we picture features discreetly rather than made up of contiguous square cells.
    2. Resolution. If the locations of features are precise and accurate, you can maintain that spatial accuracy. e
         features will not oat somewhere within a cell.
    3. Topology. Although the raster data model preserves where features are located in relation to one another,
         they do not represent how they are related to one another. is complex form of topology can be con-
         structed in most vector systems, so you can track the connections in a municipal water network between
         pipe and valve features and thus track the direction and ow of water.
    4. Storage. Vector points, lines, and simple polygons use little disk space in comparison to raster systems. is
         was once a major consideration when hard-disk storage was limited and expensive.

VECTOR DISADVANTAGES:

1. Geometry is complex. e geometrical algorithms needed for geoprocessing, for example polygon overlay
    and the calculation of distances, depending on the projection/coordinate system used, require experienced
    programmers. is is not usually a problem for most GIS users since most functions are directly coded in
    the so ware.

2. Slow response times.  e vector data model can be slow to process complex datasets especially on low-end
    computers.

3. Less innovation. Since the math is more complex, new analysis functions may not surface on vector sys-
    tems for a couple of years a er they have debuted on raster system.

RASTER ADVANTAGES:
    1. Easy to understand. Conceptually, the raster data model is easy to understand. It arranges data into col-
         umns and rows. Each pixel represents a piece of territory.
    2. Processing speed. Raster's simple data structure and its uncomplicated math produce quick results. For
         example, to calculate a polygon's area, the computer takes the area contained within a single cell (which
         remains consistent throughout the layer) and multiples it by the number of cells making up the poly-
         gon. Likewise, the speed of many analysis processes, like overlay and bu ering, are faster than vector
         systems that must use geometric equations.
    3. Data form. Remote sensing imagery is easily handled by raster-based systems because the imagery is pro-
         vided in a raster format.
    4. Some analysis functions (surface analysis and neighborhood functions) are only feasible in raster sys-
         tems. In addition, many new analysis functions appear in raster systems before migrating to vector sys-
         tems because the math is simpler.
                                                                   5
                                    Chapter 1: De ning a Geographic Information System
RASTER DISADVANTAGES:

1. Appearance. Cells "seem" to sacri ce too much detail (Figure 1.9).  is disadvantage is largely aesthetic
    and can be remedied by increasing the layer's resolution.

2. Accuracy. Sometimes accuracy is a problem due to the pixel resolution. Imagine if you had a raster layer
    with a 30 by 30 meter resolution, and you wanted to locate tra c stop signs in that layer. e entire 30 by
    30 meter pixel would represent the single stop sign. If you converted this raster layer to vector, it might
    place the stop sign at what was the pixel's center. Sometimes problems of accuracy (and appearance) can
    be resolved by selecting a smaller pixel resolution, but this has database consequences.

3. Large database. As just described, accuracy and appearance can be enhanced by reducing pixel size (the
    area of the Earth's surface covered by each cell), but this increases your layer's le size. By making the res-
    olution 50 percent better (say from 30 to 15 meters), your layer grows four times. Improve the resolution
    again by halving the pixel size (to 7.5 meters) and your layer will again increase by four times (16 times
    larger than the original 30-meter layer). e layer quadruples because the resolution increases in both the
    x and y direction.

MORE ON VECTOR DATA MODELS
   e real world is too complex and unmanageable for direct analysis and understanding because of its countless

variability and diversity. It would be an impossible task to describe and locate each city, building, tree, blade of
                                                                   6

grass, and grain of sand. How do we reduce the complexity of the Earth and its inhabitants, so we can portray
them in a GIS database and on a map? We do it by selecting the most relevant features (ignoring those we do not
think are necessary for our speci c research or project) and then generalizing the features we have selected. e
image above shows the real world is selectively represented by di erent features that we are interested in. ey are
also called map layers in GIS.
FEATURES AND FEATURE CLASS
In ArcGIS, map layers are also called shape les, or feature classes. Conceptually, there are two parts of a shape

 le: a spatial or map component and an attribute or database component. Features have these two components
as well. ey are represented spatially on the map and their attributes, describing the features, are found in a data

 le. ese two parts are linked. In other words, each map feature is linked to a record in a data le that describes
the feature. If you delete the feature's attributes in the data le, the feature disappears on the map. Conversely, if
you delete the feature from the map, its attributes will disappear too.

                     Figure 1.5. Spatial and attribute data. GIS Commons. http://giscommons.org/introduction-concepts/

Features are individual objects and events that are located (present, past or future) in space. In the above Fig-
ure, a single parcel is an example of a feature. Within the GIS industry, features have many synonyms including
objects, events, activities, forms, observations, entities, and facilities. Combined with other features of the same
type (like all of the parcels in Figure), they are arranged in data les o en called layers, coverages, or themes.
In the Figure below, three features--parcels, buildings, and street centerlines--of a typical city block are visi-
ble. Every feature has a spatial location and a set of attributes. Its spatial location describes not only its location
but its extent.

                                                                   7

                Figure 1.6. Each feature in the layers above has a spatial location and attribute data, which describes the indi-
                                  vidual feature. GIS Commons. http://giscommons.org/introduction-concepts/

Besides location, each feature usually has a set of descriptive attributes, which characterize the individual fea-
ture. Each attribute takes the form of numbers or text (characters), and these values can be qualitative (i.e. low,
medium, or high income) or quantitative (actual measurements). Sometimes, features may also have a temporal
dimension; a period in which the feature's spatial or attribute data may change. As an example of a feature class,
think of a streetlight. Now imagine a map with the locations of all the streetlights in your neighborhood. In
Figure 1.5, streetlights most are depicted as small circles. Now think of all of the di erent characteristics that you
could collect relating to each streetlight. It could be a long list. Streetlight attributes could include height, mate-
rial, basement material, presence of a light globe, globe material, color of pole, style, wattage and lumens of bulb,
bulb type, bulb color, date of installation, maintenance report, and many others. e necessary streetlight attri-
butes depends on how you intend to use them. For example, if you are solely interested in knowing the location
of streetlights for personal safety reasons, you need to know location, pole heights, and bulb strength. On the
other hand, if you are interested in historic preservation, you are concerned with the streetlight's location, style,
and color.
Now continue thinking about feature attributes, by imagining the trees planted around your campus or of-

 ce. What attributes would a gardener want versus a botanist? ere would be di erences because they have
di erent needs. You determine your study's features and the attributes that de ne the features.
ATTRIBUTE DATA TABLE
Once you have decided on the features and their attributes, determine how they will be coded in the GIS data-
base. ere are multiple ways to code features in di erent scale and circumstance. For example, schools can be
coded as a point in large scale maps, and a polygon of their campus in small scale maps. You can decide whether
to code each feature type as a point, line, or polygon. Together you also need to de ne the format and storage
requirements for each of the feature's attributes.
While thinking about your attribute values, consider where it ts in the "levels of measurement" scale with its
four di erent data values: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Stanley S. Stevens, an American psychologist,
developed these categories in 1946. For our purposes, these categories are useful way to conceptualize how data
values di er, and it is an important reminder that only some types of variables can be used for certain mathe-
matical operations and statistical tests, including many GIS functions. e di erent "levels" are depicted in the

                                                                   8

Nominal data use characters or numbers to establish identity or categories within a series. In a marathon race,
the numbers pinned to the runners' jerseys are nominal numbers ( rst column in the gure above). ey iden-
tify runners, but the numbers do not indicate the order or even a predicted race outcome. Besides races, tele-
phone numbers are a good example. It signi es the unique identity of a telephone. e phone number 961-8224
is not more than 961-8049. Place names (and those of people) are nominal too. You may prefer the sound of
one name, but they serve only to distinguish themselves from each other. Nominal characters and numbers do
not suggest a rank order or relative value; they identify and categorize. Nominal data are usually coded as char-
acter (string) data in a GIS database.

Although census data originate as individual counts, much of what is counted is individuals' membership in
nominal categories. Race, ethnicity, marital status, mode of transportation to work (car, bus, subway, railroad...),
and type of heating fuel (gas, fuel oil, coal, electricity...) are measured as numbers of observations assigned to
unranked categories. Using nominal data we can use the Census Bureau's rst atlas to depict the minority groups
with the largest percentage of population in each U.S. state (Figure 1.8). Colors were chosen to di erentiate the
groups through a qualitative color scheme to show di erences between the classes, but not to imply any quanti-
tative ordering. us, although numerical data were used to determine which category each state is in, the map
depicts the resulting nominal categories rather than the underlying numerical data.

Ordinal datasets establish rank order. In the race, the order they nished (i.e. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place) are mea-
sured on an ordinal scale (second column in Figure 2.5). While order is known, how much better one runner is
than the other is not. e ranks `high', `medium', and `low' are also ordinal. So while we know the rank order, we
do not know the interval. Usually both numeric and character ordinal data are coded with characters because
ordinal data cannot be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided in a meaningful way. e middle value, the
"median", in a string of ordinal values, however, is a good substitute for a mean (average) value.
Examples of ordinal data o en seen on reference maps include political boundaries that are classi ed hierarchi-
cally (national, state, county, etc.) and transportation routes (primary highway, secondary highway, light-duty
road, unimproved road). Ordinal data measured by the Census Bureau include how well individuals speak En-
glish (very well, well, not well, not at all), and level of educational attainment (high school graduate, some college
no degree, etc.). Social surveys of preferences and perceptions are also usually scaled ordinally.
Individual observations measured at the ordinal level are not numerical, thus should not be added, subtracted,
multiplied, or divided. For example, suppose two 600-acre grid cells within your county are being evaluated
as potential sites for a hazardous waste dump. Say the two areas are evaluated on three suitability criteria, each
ranked on a 0 to 3 ordinal scale, such that 0 = completely unsuitable, 1 = marginally unsuitable, 2 = marginally
suitable, and 3 = suitable. Now say Area A is ranked 0, 3, and 3 on the three criteria, while Area B is ranked 2, 2,
and 2. If the Siting Commission was to simply add the three criteria, the two areas would seem equally suitable
(0 + 3 + 3 = 6 = 2 + 2 + 2), even though a ranking of 0 on one criteria ought to disqualify Area A.

   e Interval scale, like we will discuss with ratio data, pertains only to numbers; there is no use of character
data. With interval data the di erence--the "interval"--between numbers is meaningful. Interval data, unlike
ratio data, however, do not have a starting point at a true zero. us, while interval numbers can be added and
subtracted, division and multiplication do not make mathematical sense. In the marathon race, the time of the
day each runner nished is measured on an interval scale. If the runners nished at 10:10 a.m., 10:20 a.m. and
10:25 a.m., then the rst runner nished 10 minutes before the second runner and the di erence between the

 rst two runners is twice that of the di erence between the second and third place runners (see third column 3
Figure 2.5). e runner nishing at 10:10 a.m., however, did not nish twice as fast as the runner nishing at
20:20 (8:20 p.m.) did. A good non-race example is temperature. It makes sense to say that 20° C is 10° warmer
than 10° C. Celsius temperatures (like Fahrenheit) are measured as interval data, but 20° C is not twice as warm
as 10° C because 0° C is not the lack of temperature, it is an arbitrary point that conveys when water freezes. Re-
turning to phone numbers, it does not make sense to say that 968-0244 is 62195 more than 961-8049, so they are
not interval values.
Ratio is similar to interval. e di erence is that ratio values have an absolute or natural zero point. In our race,
the rst place runner nished in a time of 2 hours and 30 minutes, the second place runner in a time of 2 hours
and 40 minutes, and the 450th place runner took 10 hours. e 450th place nisher took over ve times longer
than the rst place runner did. With ratio data, it makes sense to say that a 100 lb woman weighs half as much as
a 200 lb man, so weight in pounds is ratio. e zero point of weight is absolute. Addition, subtraction, multipli-
cation, and division of ratio values make statistical sense.

   e main reason that it's important to recognize levels of measurement is that di erent analytical operations are
possible with data at di erent levels of measurement (Chrisman 2002). Some of the most common operations
include:

    % Group: Categories of nominal and ordinal data can be grouped into fewer categories. For instance, group-
         ing can be used to reduce the number of land use/land cover classes from, for instance, four (residential,
         commercial, industrial, parks) to one (urban).
                                                                  10
                                    Chapter 1: De ning a Geographic Information System
    % Isolate: One or more categories of nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio data can be selected, and others set

         aside. For example, consider a range of temperature readings taken over a large area. Only a subset of those
         temperatures are suitable for mosquito survival, and health o cials can select and isolate areas based upon
         a speci c temperature range that is likely there to take action in order to reduce the threat of a West Nile
         Virus or Dengue Fever outbreak from these mosquitoes.
    % Di erence: e di erence of two interval level observations (such as two calendar years) can result in one
         ratio level observation (such as one age). For example, in 2012 (a year is an interval level value), someone
         born in 2000 (also interval level, of course) is 12 years old (age is ratio level, since it has a de nite zero).
    % Other arithmetic operations: Two or more compatible sets of interval or ratio level data can be added or
         subtracted. Only ratio level data can be multiplied or divided. For example, the per capita (average) income
         of an area can be calculated by dividing the sum of the income (ratio level) of every individual in that area
         (ratio level), by the number of persons (ratio level) residing in that area (a second ratio level variable).
    % Classi cation: Numerical data (at interval and ratio level) can be sorted into classes, typically de ned as
         non-overlapping numerical data ranges. ese classes are frequently treated as ordinal level categories for
         thematic mapping with the symbolization on choropleth maps, for example, emphasizing rank order with-
         out attempting to represent the actual magnitudes.

CHAPTER 2: COORDINATE SYSTEMS AND PROJECTING GIS DATA

A coordinate system is a way to reference, or locate, everything on the Earth's surface in x and y space. e meth-
od used to portray a part of the spherical Earth on a at surface, whether a paper map or a computer screen, is
called a map projection. Each map projection used on a paper map or in a GIS is associated with a coordinate
system. To simplify the use of maps and to avoid pinpointing locations on curved latitude-longitude reference
lines, cartographers superimpose a rectangular grid on maps. Such grids use coordinate systems to determine the
x and y position of any spot on the map. Coordinate systems are o en identi ed by the name of the particular
projection for which they are designed. Because no single map projection is suitable for all purposes, many dif-
ferent coordinate systems have been developed. Some are worldwide or nearly so, while others cover individual
countries (such as the United Kingdom's Ordnance Survey's coordinate system), and others cover states or parts
of states in the U.S.

   is chapter begins with concepts that de ne the geographical referencing standards of the Earth. Topics include
latitude and longitude, projections, coordinate systems, and datums.
GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATE SYSTEM LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE
Any feature can be referenced by its latitude and longitude, which are angles measured in degrees from the
Earth's center to a point on the Earth's surface (see Figure 2.1). Across the spherical Earth, latitude lines stretch
horizontally from east to west (le image in Figure 2.2), and they are parallel to each other, hence their alter-
native name, parallels. Longitude lines, also called meridians, stand vertically and stretch from the North Pole
to the South Pole (center image in Figure 2.2). Together these "north to south" and "east to west" lines meet at
perpendicular angles to form a graticule, a grid that encompasses the Earth (right image in Figure 2.2).
Latitude can be thought of as the lines that intersect the y-axis, and longitude as lines that intersect the x-axis.

   ink of the equator as the x axis; the y axis is the prime meridian, which is a line running from pole to pole
through Greenwich, England. Just as the upper right quarter in the Cartesian coordinate system is positive
for both x and y, latitude and longitude east of the prime meridian and north of the equator are both positive.
Europe, Asia, and part of Africa - which have positive latitudes and longitudes - correspond to the upper right
quarter of the Cartesian coordinate system. With the exception of some U.S. territories in the Paci c and the
westernmost Aleutian islands, all of the United States is north of the equator and west of the prime meridian, so
all latitudes in the U.S are positive (or north) while almost all longitudes are negative (or west).

                 Figure 2.1: Latitude and longitude are angles measured in degrees from the Earth's center to a point on the

Midway between the poles, the equator stretches around the Earth, and it de nes the line of zero degrees latitude
(le image in Figure 2.2). Relative to the equator, latitude is measured from 90 degrees at the North Pole to -90
degrees at the South Pole. e Prime Meridian is the line of zero degrees longitude (center image in Figure 2.2),
and in most coordinate systems, it passes through Greenwich, England. Longitude runs from -180 degrees west
of the Prime Meridian to 180 degrees east of the same meridian. Because the globe is 360 degrees in circumfer-
ence, -180 and 180 degrees is the same location.
PROJECTION TRANSFORMATION OF GEOGRAPHICAL COORDINATES TO CAR
TESIAN COORDINATE SYSTEMS
While the system of latitude and longitude provides a consistent referencing system for anywhere on the earth, in
order to portray our information on maps or for making calculations, we need to transform these angular mea-
sures to Cartesian coordinates. ese transformations amount to a mapping of geometric relationships expressed
on the shell of a globe to a atten-able surface -- a mathematical problem that is guratively referred to as Projec-
tion.
Globes do not need projections, and even though they are the best way to depict the Earth's shape and to un-
derstand latitude and longitude, they are not practical for most applications that require maps. We need at
maps. is requires a reshaping of the Earth's 3-dimensions into a 2-dimensional surface.
To illustrate the concept of a map projection, imagine that we place a light bulb in the center of a translucent
globe (Figure 2.3). On the globe are outlines of the continents and the lines of longitude and latitude called the
graticule. When we turn the light bulb on, the outline of the continents and the graticule will be "projected" as
shadows on the wall, ceiling, or any other nearby surface. is is what is meant by map "projection." e term
"projection" implies that the ball-shaped net of parallels and meridians is transformed by casting its shadow
upon some at, or atten-able, surface. In fact, almost all map projection methods are mathematical equations.

                                                                  13

                                                                          tems-a.html

Within the realm of maps and mapping, there are three surfaces used for map projections (i.e., surfaces on which
we project the shadows of the graticule). ese surfaces are the plane, the cylinder, and the cone (Figure 2.4).

                Figure 2.4. ree types of " attenable" surfaces to which the graticule can be projected: a plane, a cone, and a
                                        cylinder. https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog482fall2/c2_p30.html

As you might imagine, the appearance of the projected grid will change quite a lot depending on the type of sur-
face it is projected onto, and how that surface is aligned with the globe. e three surfaces shown above in Figure
2.4 -- the disk-shaped plane, the cone, and the cylinder--represent categories that account for the majority of
projection equations that are encoded in GIS so ware. e plane o en is centered upon a pole. e cone is typi-
cally aligned with the globe such that its line of contact (tangency) coincides with a parallel in the mid-latitudes.
And the cylinder is frequently positioned tangent to the equator (Figure 2.5).

                                                                  14

Referring again to the previous example of a light bulb in the center of a globe, note that during the projection
process, we can situate each surface in any number of ways. For example, surfaces can be tangential to the globe
along the equator or poles, they can pass through or intersect the surface, and they can be oriented at any num-
ber of angles. e following gures shows how these projections can vary.
PROJECTION AND DISTORTION
Flattening the globe cannot be done without introducing some error, and some distortion is unavoidable. Any
projection has its area of least distortion. Projections can be shi ed around in order to put this area of least dis-
tortion over the topographer's area of interest. us any projection can have an unlimited number of variations
or cases that determined by standard parallels or meridians that adjust the location of the high-accuracy part of
the projection.
If the geographic extent of your project area was small, like a neighborhood or a portion of a city, you could
assume that the Earth is at and use no projection. is is referred to as a planar surface or even a planar "projec-
tion," but with the understanding that it does not use a projection. Planar representation does not signi cantly
a ect a map's accuracy when scales are larger than 1:10,000. In other words, small areas do not need a projection
because the statistical di erences between locations on a at plane and a 3-dimensional surface are not signi -
cant.
For small-scale maps one must consider the Earth's shape. Our assumption that the Earth is round or spheri-
cal does not accurately represent it. e Earth's constant spinning causes it to bulge slightly along the equator,
ruining its perfect spherical shape. e slightly oval nature of the Earth's geometric surface makes the terms ellip-
soid and spheroid more accurate in describing its shape, but they are not perfect terms either since di erences
in material weights (for instance iron is denser than sedimentary deposits) and the movement of tectonic plates
makes the Earth dynamic and constantly changing. e Earth is a geoid with a slight pear shape; it is a little larg-
er in the southern hemisphere and includes other bulges. e di erence, however, between the ellipsoid and the
geoid is minor enough that it does not a ect most mapping. Until recently, projections based on geoids were rare
because of the complexity and cost of collecting the necessary data to create the projection, but satellite imagery

                                                                  15
                                  Chapter 2: Coordinate Systems and Projecting GIS Data
has helped with measurement and geoid projections are now more common.
Projections are abstractions, and they introduce distortions to either the Earth's shape, area, distance, or direc-
tion (and sometimes to all of these properties). Di erent map projections cause di erent map distortions.
One way to classify map projections is to describe them by the characteristic they do not distort. Usually only
one property is preserved in a projection. Map projections classi ed based on the preserved properties include:

    % Conformal - Preserves: Shape, Distorts: Area
    % Equal Area - Preserves: Area; Distorts: Shape, Scale or Angle (bearing)
    % Equidistant - Preserves: Distances between certain points (but not all points); Distorts: Other distances
    % Azimuthal (True Direction) - Preserves: Angles (bearings); Distorts: Area and shape
Map projections that accurately represent distances are referred to as equidistant projections. Note that distances
are only correct in one direction, usually running north-south, and are not correct everywhere across the map.
Equidistant maps are frequently used for small-scale maps that cover large areas because they do a good job of
preserving the shape of geographic features such as continent.
Maps that represent angles between locations, also referred to as bearings, are called conformal. Conformal map
projections are used for navigational purposes due to the importance of maintaining a bearing or heading when
traveling great distances. e cost of preserving bearings is that areas tend to be quite distorted in conformal
map projections. ough shapes are more or less preserved over small areas, at small scales areas become wildly
distorted. e Mercator projection is an example of a conformal projection and is famous for distorting Green-
land.
As the name indicates, equal area or equivalent projections preserve the quality of area. Such projections are of
particular use when accurate measures or comparisons of geographical distributions are necessary (e.g., defor-
estation, wetlands). In an e ort to maintain true proportions in the surface of the earth, features sometimes be-
come compressed or stretched depending on the orientation of the projection. Moreover, such projections distort
distances as well as angular relationships.
As noted earlier, there are theoretically an in nite number of map projections to choose from. One of the key
considerations behind the choice of map projection is to reduce the amount of distortion. e geographical
object being mapped and the respective scale at which the map will be constructed are also important factors to
think about. For instance, maps of the North and South Poles usually use planar or azimuthal projections, and
conical projections are best suited for the middle latitude areas of the earth. Features that stretch east-west, such
as the country of Russia, are represented well with the standard cylindrical projection, while countries oriented
north-south (e.g., Chile, Norway) are better represented using a transverse projection.
If a map projection is unknown, sometimes it can be identi ed by working backward and examining closely
the nature and orientation of the graticule (i.e., grid of latitude and longitude), as well as the varying degrees of
distortion. Clearly, there are trade-o s made with regard to distortion on every map. ere are no hard-and-fast
rules as to which distortions are more preferred over others. erefore, the selection of map projection largely
depends on the purpose of the map.
Within the scope of GISs, knowing and understanding map projections are critical. For instance, in order to per-
form an overlay analysis, all map layers need to be in the same projection. If they are not, geographical features
will not be aligned properly, and any analyses performed will be inaccurate and incorrect. If you want to con-

                                                                  16
                                  Chapter 2: Coordinate Systems and Projecting GIS Data
duct a measurement of land parcel size, you need to use a projection that does not distort area space. Most GISs
include functions to assist in the identi cation of map projections, as well as to transform between projections in
order to synchronize spatial data. Despite the capabilities of technology, an awareness of the potential and pitfalls
that surround map projections is essential.
ON THE FLY PROJECTION
Creating map projections was extremely challenging, even just 30 years ago. And now we can project and un-
project massive quantities of coordinates, transforming them backward and forward from Latitude and Longi-
tude (assuming this or that earth model) to overlay precisely with data that are stored in some other coordinate
space. It is truly amazing that humans have perfected a rich library of open-source so ware that can Forward
Project geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude, + earth model) to any projected system; and also back-
ward project) from any well described projected coordinates back to geographic coordinates -- all in the wink of
an eye. We can be thankful for that. But there are still some details that we have to understand.
Automatic transformation of coordinate systems requires that datasets include machine-readable metadata. In
about 2002, the makers of ArcMap added one more le to the schema of a shape le. e .prj le contains the
description of the projection of a shape le, and if it exists, it is always copied with the shape le or dlements
that are exported from it. is is the machine-readable metadata that allows ArcMap to know how to handle
the dataset if any transformation (reprojection) is required. ere are plenty of datasets that do not include such
machine readable metadata. is includes data that are not created with ArcMap since 2002 and even some that
are. So we should get used to understanding map projections and their properties. If you need to learn to set the
coordinate system for a dataset, use ArcCatalog - as explained in the e ArcMap Projections Tutorial.
UNIVERSAL TRANSVERSE MERCATOR

   e rst coordinate system we want to introduce here is the Universal Transverse Mercator grid, commonly
referred to as UTM and based on the Transverse Mercator projection. Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) is
a coordinate system that largely covers the globe. e system reaches from 84 degrees north to 84 degrees south
latitude, and it divides the Earth into 60 north-south oriented zones that are 6 degrees of longitude wide (Figure
2.6). Each individual zone uses a de ned transverse Mercator projection (See Figure). e UTM system is not a
single map projection. e system instead has 60 projections, and each uses a secant transverse Mercator projec-
tion in each zone.

   e contiguous U.S. consists of 10 zones (Figure 2.7). In the Northern hemisphere, the equator is the zero base-
line for Northings (Southern hemisphere uses a 10,000 km false Northing). Each zone has an arbitrary central
meridian of 500 km west of each zone's central meridian (called a false Easting) to insure positive Easting values
and a central bisecting meridian. In UTM, the CSUS Geography Department is located at 4,269,000 meters
north; 637,200 meters east; zone 10, northern hemisphere. UTM zones are numbered consecutively beginning
with Zone 1. Zone 1 covers 180 degrees west longitude to 174 degrees west longitude (6 degrees of longitude),
and includes the westernmost point of Alaska. Maine falls within Zone 16 because it lies between 84 degrees west
and 90 degrees west. In each zone, coordinates are measured as northings and eastings in meters. e northing
values are measured from zero at the equator in a northerly direction (in the southern hemisphere, the equator
is assigned a false northing value of 10,000,000 meters). e central meridian in each zone is assigned an east-
ing value of 500,000 meters. In Zone 16, the central meridian is 87 degrees west. One meter east of that central
meridian is 500,001 meters easting.

                                                                  17

STATE PLANE COORDINATE SYSTEM
A second coordinate system is the State Plane Coordinate System. is system is actually a series of separate sys-
tems, each covering a state, or a part of a state, and is only used in the United States. It is popular with some state
and local governments due to its high accuracy, achieved through the use of relatively small zones. State Plane
began in 1933 with the North Carolina Coordinate System and in less than a year it had been copied in all of the
other states. e system is designed to have a maximum linear error of 1 in 10,000 and is four times as accurate
as the UTM system.
Like the UTM system, the State Plane system is based on zones. However, the 120 State Plane zones generally
follow county boundaries (except in Alaska). Given the State Plane system's desired level of accuracy, larger states
are divided into multiple zones, such as the "Colorado North Zone." States with a long north-south axis (such as
Idaho and Illinois) are mapped using a Transverse Mercator projection, while states with a long east-west axis
(such as Washington and Pennsylvania) are mapped using a Lambert Conformal projection. In either case, the
projection's central meridian is generally run down the approximate center of the zone.

A Cartesian coordinate system is created for each zone by establishing an origin some distance (usually 2,000,000
feet) to the west of the zone's central meridian and some distance to the south of the zone's southernmost point.

   is ensures that all coordinates within the zone will be positive. e X-axis running through this origin runs
east-west, and the Y-axis runs north-south. Distances from the origin are generally measured in feet, but some-
times are in meters. X distances are typically called eastings (because they measure distances east of the origin)
and Y distances are typically called northings (because they measure distances north of the origin).

DATUMS
All coordinate systems are tied to a datum. A datum de nes the starting point from which coordinates are mea-
sured. Latitude and longitude coordinates, for example, are determined by their distance from the equator and
the prime meridian that runs through Greenwich, England. But where exactly is the equator? And where exactly
is the Prime Meridian? And how does the irregular shape of the Earth gure into our measurements? All of these
issues are de ned by the datum.
Many di erent datums exist, but in the United States only three datums are commonly used. e North Ameri-
can Datum of 1927 (NAD27) uses a starting point at a base station in Meades Ranch, Kansas and the Clarke El-
lipsoid to calculate the shape of the Earth. anks to the advent of satellites, a better model later became available
and resulted in the development of the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Depending on one's location,
coordinates obtained using NAD83 could be hundreds of meters away from coordinates obtained using NAD27.
A third datum, the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84) is identical to NAD83 for most practical purposes
within the United States. e di erences are only important when an extremely high degree of precision is need-
ed. WGS84 is the default datum setting for almost all GPS devices. But most USGS topographic maps published
up to 2009 use NAD27.

GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVES
Topology is the sub eld of mathematics that deals with the relationship between geometric entities, speci cally
with properties of objects that are preserved under continuous deformation. A GIS topology is a set of rules and
behaviors that model how points, lines, and polygons share coincident geometry. e concepts of topology are
very useful for geographers, surveyors, transportation specialists, and others interested in how places and loca-
tions relate to one another. We have learned that a location is a zero-dimensional entity (it has no length, width,
height, or volume), locations alone are not su cient for representing the complexity of the real world. Locations
are frequently composed into one or more geometric primitives, which include the set of entities more common-
ly referred to as:

    1. Points;
    2. Lines; and
    3. Polygons (or Areas).
In the eld of Topology, we can expand them to:
    1. Nodes: zero-dimensional entities represented by coordinate pairs. Coordinates for nodes may be x,y values

         like those in Euclidean geometry or longitude and latitude coordinates that represent places on Earth's sur-
         face. In both cases, a third z value is sometimes added to specify a location in three dimensions;
    2. Edges: one-dimensional entities created by connecting two nodes. e nodes at either end of an edge are
         called connecting nodes and can be referred to more speci cally as a start node or end node, depending on
         the direction of the edge, which is indicated by arrowheads. Edges in TIGER have direction so that the le
         and right side of the street can be determined for use in address matching. Nodes that are not associated
         with an edge and exist by themselves are called isolated nodes. Edges can also contain vertices, which are
         optional intermediate points along an edge that can de ne the shape of an edge with more speci city than
         start and end nodes alone. Examples of edges encoded in TIGER are streets, railroads, pipelines, and rivers;
         and
    3. Faces: two-dimensional (length and width) entities that are bounded by edges. Blocks, counties, and vot-
         ing districts are examples of faces. Since faces are bounded by edges and edges have direction, faces can be
         designated as right faces or le faces.
Figure below shows an example of these geometric primitives in a realistic arrangement. In this example, note
that:
    1. Nodes N14 and N17 are isolated nodes;
    2. N7 and N6 are the start and end nodes of edge E1; and
    3. Due to the directionality of edges, face F2 is on the le of edge E8.

                                                                  21

TOPOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS
We have learned how coordinates, both geometric and geographic, can de ne points and nodes, how nodes can
build edges, and how edges create faces. We will now consider how nodes, edges, and faces can relate to one
another through the concepts of containment, connectedness, and adjacency. A fundamental property of all
topological relations is that they are constant under continuous deformation: re-projecting a map will not alter

                                                                  22

topology, nor will any amount of rubber-sheeting or other data transformations change relations from one form
to another.
Containment is the property that de nes one entity as being within another. For example, if an isolated node
(representing a household) is located inside a face (representing a congressional district) in the database, you can
count on it remaining inside that face no matter how you transform the data. Topology is vitally important to the
Census Bureau, whose constitutional mandate is to accurately associate population counts and characteristics
with political districts and other geographic areas.
Connectedness refers to the property of two or more entities being connected. In Figure 2.1, Topologically, node
N14 is not connected to any other nodes. Nodes N9 and N21 are connected because they are joined by edges
E10, E1, and E10. In other words, nodes can be considered connected if and only if they are reachable through a
set of nodes that are also connected; if a node is a destination, we must have a path to reach it.
Connectedness is not immediately as intuitive as it may seem. A famous problem related to topology is the
Königsberg bridge puzzle (Figure 3.3).

   e challenge of the puzzle is to nd a route that crosses all seven bridges, while respecting the following criteria:
    1. Each bridge must be crossed;
    2. A bridge is a directional edge and can only be crossed once (no backtracking);
    3. Bridges must be fully crossed in one attempt (you cannot turn around halfway, and then do the same on

         the other side to consider it "crossed").
    4. Optional: You must start and end at the same location. (It has been said that this was a traditional require-

         ment of the problem, though it turns out that it doesn't actually matter - try it with and without this re-
         quirement to see if you can discover why.)
   e right answer is, there is no such route. Euler proved, in 1736, that there was no solution to this problem.

    % Line features can share endpoints (edge-node topology).
In addition, shared geometry can be managed between feature classes using a geodatabase topology. For example:
    % Line features can share segments with other line features. For example, parcels can nest within blocks:
    % Area features can be coincident with other area features.
    % Line features can share endpoint vertices with other point features (node topology).
    % Point features can be coincident with line features (point events).

Galdi (2005) describes the very speci c rules that de ne the relations of entities in the vector database:
    1. Every edge must be bounded by two nodes (start and end nodes).
    2. Every edge has a le and right face.
    3. Every face has a closed boundary consisting of an alternating sequence of nodes and edges.
    4. ere is an alternating closed sequence of edges and faces around every node.
    5. Edges do not intersect each other, except at nodes.

Compliance with these topological rules is an aspect of data quality called logical consistency. In addition, the
boundaries of geographic areas that are related hierarchically -- such as blocks, block groups, tracts, and coun-
ties - are represented with common, non-redundant edges. Features that do not conform to the topological rules
can be identi ed automatically, and corrected.
Topology is fundamentally used to ensure data quality of the spatial relationships and to aid in data compilation.
Topology is also used for analyzing spatial relationships in many situations such as dissolving the boundaries
between adjacent polygons with the same attribute values or traversing along a network of the elements in a
topology graph. Topology can also be used to model how the geometry from a number of feature classes can be
integrated. Some refer to this as vertical integration of feature classes. Generally, topology is employed to do the
following:

    % Manage coincident geometry (constrain how features share geometry). For example, adjacent polygons,
         such as parcels, have shared edges; street centerlines and the boundaries of census blocks have coincident
         geometry; adjacent soil polygons share edges; etc.

    % De ne and enforce data integrity rules (such as no gaps should exist between parcel features, parcels should
         not overlap, road centerlines should connect at their endpoints).
                                                                  25

CHAPTER 4: MAPPING PEOPLE WITH CENSUS DATA

WHY CENSUS?
Some of the richest sources of attribute data for thematic mapping, particularly for choropleth maps, are national
censuses. In the United States, a periodic count of the entire population is required by the U.S. Constitution. Ar-
ticle 1, Section 2, rati ed in 1787, states (in the last paragraph of the section shown below) that "Representatives
and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union, accord-
ing to their respective numbers ... e actual Enumeration shall be made [every] ten years, in such manner as
[the Congress] shall by law direct." e U.S. Census Bureau is the government agency charged with carrying out
the decennial census.

               Figure 4.1: A portion of the Constitution of the United States of America (preamble and rst three paragraphs
                  of Article 1). Credit: Obtained from: http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_downloads.html

   e results of the U.S. decennial census determine states' portions of the 435 total seats in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. ematic maps can show states that lost and gained seats as a result of the reapportionment that fol-
lowed the 2000 census (Figure 4.2). By focusing on the U.S. state-by-state, we develop a variant on a choropleth
map. Rather than using color ll to depict quantity, color depicts only change and its direction, red for a loss in
number of Congressional seats, gray for no change, and blue for a gain in number of Congressional seats. Num-
bers are then used as symbols to indicate amount of change (small -1 or +1 for a change of 1 seat and larger -2 or
+2 for a change of two seats). is scaling of numbers is an example of the more general application of "size" as a
graphic variable to produce "proportional symbols" - the topic we cover in detail in the section on proportional
symbol mapping below.

                                                                  27

Congressional voting district boundaries must be redrawn within the states that gained and lost seats, a process
called redistricting. Constitutional rules and legal precedents require that voting districts contain equal popula-
tions (within about 1 percent). In addition, districts must be drawn so as to provide equal opportunities for rep-
resentation of racial and ethnic groups that have been discriminated against in the past. Further, each state is al-
lowed to create its own parameters for meeting the equal opportunities constraint. Whether districts determined
each decade actually meet these guidelines is typically a contentious issue and o en results in legal challenges.
Beyond the role of the census of population in determining the number of representatives per state (thus in
providing the data input to reapportionment and redistricting), the Census Bureau's mandate is to provide the
population data needed to support governmental operations, more broadly including decisions on allocation of
federal expenditures. Its broader mission includes being "the preeminent collector and provider of timely, rel-
evant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States". To ful ll this mission, the Census
Bureau needs to count more than just numbers of people, and it does.
THEMATIC MAPPING
Unlike reference maps, thematic maps are usually made with a single purpose in mind. Typically, that purpose
has to do with revealing the spatial distribution of one or two attribute data sets. In this section, we will consider
distinctions among three types of ratio level data, counts, rates, and densities. We will also explore several dif-
ferent types of thematic maps, and consider which type of map is conventionally used to represent the di erent
types of data. We will focus on what is perhaps the most prevalent type of thematic map, the choropleth map.
Choropleth maps tend to display ratio level data which have been transformed into ordinal level classes. Finally,
you will learn two common data classi cation procedures, quantiles and equal intervals.
MAPPING COUNTS

   e simplest thematic mapping technique for count data is to show one symbol for every individual counted. If
                                                                  28
                                         Chapter 4: Mapping People with Census Data
the location of every individual is known, this method o en works ne. If not, the solution is not as simple as it
seems. Unfortunately, individual locations are o en unknown, or they may be con dential. So ware like ESRI's
ArcMap, for example, is happy to overlook this shortcoming. Its "Dot Density" option causes point symbols to
be positioned randomly within the geographic areas in which the counts were conducted (Figure 4.3). e size
of dots, and number of individuals represented by each dot, are also optional. Random dot placement may be
acceptable if the scale of the map is small, so that the areas in which the dots are placed are small. O en, howev-
er, this is not the case.

                                                                  geog482fall2/c3_p17.html

An alternative for mapping counts that lack individual locations is to use a single symbol, a circle, square, or some
other shape, to represent the total count for each area. ArcMap calls the result of this approach a Proportional
Symbol map. When the size of each symbol varies in direct proportion to the data value it represents we have a
proportional symbol map (Figure 4.4). In other words, the area of a symbol used to represent the value "1,000,000"
is exactly twice as great as a symbol that represents "500,000." To compensate for the fact that map readers typi-
cally underestimate symbol size, some cartographers recommend that symbol sizes be adjusted. ArcMap calls this
option "Flannery Compensation" a er James Flannery, a research cartographer who conducted psychophysical
studies of map symbol perception in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. A variant on the Proportional Symbol approach is
the Graduated Symbol map type, in which di erent symbol sizes represent categories of data values rather than
unique values. In both of these map types, symbols are usually placed at the mean locations, or centroids, of the
areas they represent.

                                                                  29

MAPPING RATES AND DENSITIES
A rate is a proportion between two counts, such as Hispanic population as a percentage of total population. One
way to display the proportional relationship between two counts is with what ArcMap calls its Pie Chart option.
Like the Proportional Symbol map, the Pie Chart map plots a single symbol at the centroid of each geographic
area by default, though users can opt to place pie symbols such that they won't overlap each other ( is option
can result in symbols being placed far away from the centroid of a geographic area.) Each pie symbol varies in
size in proportion to the data value it represents. In addition, however, the Pie Chart symbol is divided into piec-
es that represent proportions of a whole (Figure 4.5).

Some perceptual experiments have suggested that human beings are more adept at judging the relative lengths
of bars than they are at estimating the relative sizes of pie pieces (although it helps to have the bars aligned along
a common horizontal base line). You can judge for yourself by comparing the e ect of ArcMap's Bar/Column
Chart option (Figure 4.6).

Like rates, densities are produced by dividing one count by another, but the divisor of a density is the magnitude
of a geographic area. Both rates and densities hold true for entire areas, but not for any particular point location.
For this reason, it is conventional not to use point symbols to symbolize rate and density data on thematic maps.
Instead, cartography textbooks recommend a technique that ArcMap calls "Graduated Colors." Maps produced
by this method, properly called choropleth maps, ll geographic areas with colors that represent attribute data

usually sorted into four to eight ordinal level categories. ArcMap calls these categories classes. Users can adjust
the number of classes, the class break values that separate the classes, and the colors used to symbolize the class-
es. Users may choose a group of prede ned colors, known as a color ramp, or they may specify their own custom
colors. Color ramps are sequences of colors that vary from light to dark, where the darkest color is used to rep-
resent the highest value range. Most textbook cartographers would approve of this, since they have long argued
that it is the lightness and darkness of colors, not di erent color hues, that most logically represent quantitative
data.
Logically or not, people prefer colorful maps. For this reason some might be tempted to choose ArcMap's Unique
Values option to map rates, densities, or even counts. is option assigns a unique color to each data value.
Colors vary in hue as well as lightness. is symbolization strategy is designed for use with a small number of
nominal level data categories. As illustrated in the map below (Figure 4.8), the use of an unlimited set of color
hues to symbolize unique data values leads to a confusing thematic map.

DATA CLASSIFICATION
As discussed earlier, all maps are abstractions. is means that they depict only selected information, but also
that the information selected must be generalized due to the limits of display resolution, comparable limits of
human visual acuity, and especially the limits imposed by the costs of collecting and processing detailed data.
What we have not previously considered is that generalization is not only necessary, it is sometimes bene cial; it
can make complex information understandable. Consider a simple example. e graph below (Figure 4.9) shows
the percent of people who prefer the term "pop" (not soda or coke) for each state. Categories along the x axis of
the graph represent each of the 50 unique percentage values (two of the states had exactly the same rate). Catego-
ries along the y axis are the numbers of states associated with each rate. As you can see, it's di cult to discern a
pattern in these data; it appears that there is no pattern.

                                                                  32

   e following graph (Figure 4.10) shows exactly the same data set, only grouped into 10 classes with equal 10%
ranges). It's much easier to discern patterns and outliers in the classi ed data than in the unclassi ed data. Notice
that people in a large number of states (23) do not really prefer the term "pop" as they are distributed around 0
to 10 percent of users who favor that term. ere are no states at the other extreme (91-100%), but a few states
whose vast majority (81-90% of their population) prefer the term pop. Ignoring the many 0-10% states where
pop is rarely used, the most common states are ones in which about 2/3 favor the term; looking back to `Figure
3.13, these are primarily northern states, including Pennsylvania. All of these variations in the information are
obscured in the unclassi ed data.

As shown above, data classi cation is a generalization process that can make data easier to interpret. Classi ca-
tion into a small number of ranges, however, gives up some details in exchange for the clearer picture, and there
are multiple choices of methods to classify data for mapping. If a classi cation scheme is chosen and applied
skillfully, it can help reveal patterns and anomalies that otherwise might be obscured (as shown above). By the
same token, a poorly-chosen classi cation scheme may hide meaningful patterns. e appearance of a themat-
ic map, and sometimes conclusions drawn from it, may vary substantially depending on the data classi cation
scheme used. us, it is important to understand the choices that might be made, whether you are creating a

map or interpreting one created by someone else.

Many di erent systematic classi cation schemes have been developed. Some produce mathematically "optimal"
classes for unique data sets, maximizing the di erence between classes and minimizing di erences within classes.
Since optimizing schemes produce unique solutions, however, they are not the best choice when several maps need
to be compared. For this, data classi cation schemes that treat every data set alike are preferred.

Two commonly used classi cation schemes are quantiles and equal intervals.  e following two graphs illustrate
the di erences.

   e graph above groups the Pennsylvania county population change data into ve classes, each of which contains
the same number of counties (in this case, approximately 20 percent of the total in each). e quantiles scheme
accomplishes this by varying the width, or range, of each class. Quantile is a general label for any grouping of
rank ordered data into an equal number of entities; quantiles with speci c numbers of groups go by their own
unique labels ("quartiles" and "quintiles," for example, are instances of quantile classi cations that group data
into four and ve classes respectively). e gure below, then, is an example of quintiles.

                                                                  34

In the second graph, the data range of each class is equivalent (8.5 percentage points). Consequently, the number
of counties in each equal interval class varies.

As you can see, the e ect of the two di erent classi cation schemes on the appearance of the two choropleth
maps above is dramatic. e quantiles scheme is o en preferred because it prevents the clumping of observations
into a few categories shown in the equal intervals map. Conversely, the equal interval map reveals two outlier
counties that are obscured in the quantiles map. Due to the potentially extreme di erences in visual appearance,
it is o en useful to compare the maps produced by several di erent map classi cations. Patterns that persist
through changes in classi cation schemes are likely to be more conclusive evidence than patterns that shi . Pat-
terns that show up with only one scheme may be important, but require special scrutiny (and an understanding
of how the scheme works) to evaluate.
AGGREGATED DATA: ENUMERATION VERSUS SAMPLES
Quantitative data of the kinds depicted by the maps detailed in the previous section come from a diverse array of
sources. In the U.S., one of the most important sources is the U.S. Bureau of the Census (discussed brie y above).
Here we focus in on one important distinction in data collected by the Census and by other organizations, a dis-
tinction between complete enumeration (counting every entity) and sampling.
Sixteen U.S. Marshals and 650 assistants conducted the rst U.S. census in 1791. ey counted some 3.9 million
individuals, although as then-Secretary of State omas Je erson reported to President George Washington, the
o cial number understated the actual population by at least 2.5 percent (Roberts, 1994). By 1960, when the U.S.
population had reached 179 million, it was no longer practical to have a census taker visit every household. e
Census Bureau then began to distribute questionnaires by mail. Of the 116 million households to which ques-
tionnaires were sent in 2000, 72 percent responded by mail. A mostly-temporary sta of over 800,000 was need-
ed to visit the remaining households, and to produce the nal count of 281,421,906. Using statistically reliable
estimates produced from exhaustive follow-up surveys, the Bureau's permanent sta determined that the nal
count was accurate to within 1.6 percent of the actual number (although the count was less accurate for young
and minority residences than it was for older and white residents). It was the largest and most accurate census
to that time. (Interestingly, Congress insists that the original enumeration or "head count" be used as the o cial
population count, even though the estimate calculated from samples by Census Bureau statisticians is demon-
strably more accurate.) As of this writing, some aspects of reporting from the decennial census of 2010 are still
underway. Like 2000, the mail-in response rate was 72 percent. e o cial 2010 census count, by state, was de-
livered to the U.S. Congress on December 21, 2010 (10 days prior to the mandated deadline). e total count for
the U.S. was 308,745,538, a 9.7% increase over 2000.
In the rst census, in 1791, census takers asked relatively few questions. ey wanted to know the numbers of
free persons, slaves, and free males over age 16, as well as the sex and race of each individual. (You can view
replicas of historical census survey forms at Ancestry.com) As the U.S. population has grown, and as its econo-
my and government have expanded, the amount and variety of data collected has expanded accordingly. In the
2000 census, all 116 million U.S. households were asked six population questions (names, telephone numbers,
sex, age and date of birth, Hispanic origin, and race), and one housing question (whether the residence is owned
or rented). In addition, a statistical sample of one in six households received a "long form" that asked 46 more
questions, including detailed housing characteristics, expenses, citizenship, military service, health problems,
employment status, place of work, commuting, and income. From the sampled data the Census Bureau produced
estimated data on all these variables for the entire population.
In the parlance of the Census Bureau, data associated with questions asked of all households are called 100%
data and data estimated from samples are called sample data. Both types of data are aggregated by various enu-
meration areas, including census block, block group, tract, place, county, and state (see the illustration below).

   rough 2000, the Census Bureau distributes the 100% data in a package called the "Summary File 1" (SF1) and
the sample data as "Summary File 3" (SF3). In 2005, the Bureau launched a new project called American Com-

                                                                  36

munity Survey that surveys a representative sample of households on an ongoing basis. Every month, one house-
hold out of every 480 in each county or equivalent area receives a survey similar to the old "long form." Annual
or semi-annual estimates produced from American Community Survey samples replaced the SF3 data product
in 2010.
To protect respondents' con dentiality, as well as to make the data most useful to legislators, the Census Bureau
aggregates the data it collects from household surveys to several di erent types of geographic areas. SF1 data, for
instance, are reported at the block or tract level. ere were about 8.5 million census blocks in 2000. By de ni-
tion, census blocks are bounded on all sides by streets, streams, or political boundaries. Census tracts are larger
areas that have between 2,500 and 8,000 residents. When rst delineated, tracts were relatively homogeneous
with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. A typical census tract consists
of about ve or six sub-areas called block groups. As the name implies, block groups are composed of several
census blocks. American Community Survey estimates, like the SF3 data that preceded them, are reported at the
block group level or higher. e unit types are organized with each higher type composed of some number of the
lower type as outlined above for blocks, block groups, and census tracts (Figure 4.16).

CHAPTER 5: LYING WITH MAPS

When you understand the technique of making maps in general, it is time to realize that how maps nally look
like to a great extent depends on how you present your data. Especially in choropleth map, how do you de ne the
data breaking points, and varied choices on symbology lead to di erent looking maps which might hide part of the
information what the real data truly present.

   is piece by Mark Monmonier warn us not only to be careful in designing maps, but also to be critical in reading
maps, and promoting a healthy skepticism about these easy-to-manipulate models of reality. Monmonier shows
that, despite their immense value, maps lie. Statistics of any kind can be manipulated. For professionals working in
the planning eld, who rely on lots of data to make public decisions, it is especially important to be skeptical about
what you are presented.
To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples
of the misuse of maps in situations through progressively more subtle treatments of data, each misleading, some
innocent and others malicious, until you begin to question all map abstractions entirely. It covers all the typical
kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimpli cations to the misleading use of color.

CHAPTER 6: TO STANDARDIZE OR NOT TO STANDARDIZE?

   e idea of data quality and standards are important especially in the urban planning eld because we make
decisions based on data collected from di erent institutions. If there is not a common standard to follow, it will
be frustrating to work if these data came with di erent quality. Besides, using low quality data might lead public
o cials and researchers to wrong conclusions, a ecting the decision-making process. is chapter by Yeung ex-
plains the importance of data quality and data standards, and their inter-relationships. ere are ways to quan-
titatively assess the positional and attribute accuracy of geo-spatial data. If you are interested, you can explore
census TIGER le to see how the1990 les di er from thee 2000 dataset.

   e chapter starts discussing concepts of geospatial data quality such as accuracy (degree to which data agree
with the description of the real world that they represent); precision (how exactly are measured and stored);
error (a measure of the deviation between the measured value and the true value), and uncertainty (lack of
con dence in the use of the data due to incomplete knowledge of the data). All these concepts are related to the
description and evaluation of data quality. Yeung also discusses the sources and types of errors in geospatial data
(inherent and operational errors), which are almost impossible to avoid.
In sum, Yeung describes seven dimensions of geospatial data quality: (i) lineage (document the sources from
which data is derived), (ii) positional accuracy (it is de ned as the closeness of values in the database to the
true positions of the real world), (iii) attribute accuracy (closeness of descriptive data to the assumed real world
values), (iv) logical consistency (describes the delity of the relationship between real world and encoded data),
(v) completeness (refers to whether the data exhausts the universe of all possible items), (vi) temporal accuracy
(refers to the representation of time in geospatial data), and (vii) semantic accuracy (measures how correctly spa-
tial objects are labeled in the data set). e positional and attribute accuracy are the most relevant.

   e presence of errors is a norm rather than an exception. us spatial errors need to be managed to reduce
uncertainty. ere are three perspectives to e ect the management of spatial data errors: (i) data production
(control de data quality during the data acquisition), (ii) data use (related to errors when data is used), and (iii)
communication between data producer and data user (evaluating the quality of the data so that users are aware
of the level of uncertainty).
To make sure the quality assurance and quality control of geospatial data is the expected the process of data col-
lection needs to be monitor because is the greatest source of errors in digital geospatial data. During the process
of geographic analysis there might be an accumulation of the e ects of errors. is is known as the error prop-
agation. Managing errors requires a pragmatic approach through, for example, sensitivity analysis, which is a
modeling technique to assess the subjectivity and variability in the parameters of spatial problem-solving model.

   e purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to test the model for output over a range of legitimate uncertainties. An-
other relevant aspect is the reporting data quality: information need to be e ectively communicated in the form
of `accuracy indices' and maps to all potential users. Geospatial data standards can provide a yardstick -- created
by consensus by a recognized organization -- against which quality can be evaluated, through the provision of
rules for common and repeated use. Yueng o ers four categories of standards: (i) application standards, (ii) data
standards -the most important-, (iii) technology standards, and (iv) professional practice standards. In general
geospatial data standards provide the means of communication between suppliers and users. ese are made up
of one or more of these four components: (a) standard data products, (b) data transfer standards, (c) data quality
standards, and (d) metadata standards. e development and acceptance of data standards was crucial not only
for allowing sharing data but most important, it helped to develop `open GIS'.

CHAPTER 7: GEOGRAPHIC CONSIDERATIONS IN PLANNING
PRACTICE

   is chapter is composed of two sections, a book chapter by O'Sullivan and Unwin on the Pitfalls and Potential
of Spatial Data, and a small compiled session on geo-coding. e book chapter identi es major problems in
the analysis of geographic information and statistical analysis of spatial data, related to spatial autocorrelation,
modi able area units, the ecological fallacy, scale, and non-uniformity of space and edge e ects. It also discusses
relevant geographic concepts central to spatial analysis such as, of distance, adjacency, interaction ( rst law of ge-
ography), and neighborhood. Finally, it discusses proximity polygons and shows how variogram clouds are used
to analyze relationships between data attributes and their spatial location, through matrices.

Spatial data require special analytic techniques thus standard statistic methods have signi cant problems to
analysis spatial distributions. ere are ve major problems. First, spatial data tend to violate assumption that
samples are random because in geography phenomena do not vary randomly through space, leading to the
given problem of spatial autocorrelation (data from locations near to one another in space are more likely to be
similar than data from locations remote from one another), which introduces the problem of redundancy due
to biased samples. Second, the modi able areal unit problem (when aggregation units used are arbitrary with
respect to the phenomena under investigation) tends to a ect the `coe cient of determination, R square. ird,
the ecological fallacy (when statistical relations observed at one level of aggregation are assumed to hold because
the same relationship holds when we look at more detail level). In this case the thread is that statistical relations
may change at di erent levels of aggregation. e fourth problem is related to scale, which might a ect spatial
analysis based on the geographic scale at which the phenomenon of interest is analyzed. Lastly, another problem
distinguishing spatial analysis from conventional statistics is the non-uniformity of space. is issue refers to the
fact that analysis might nd patterns -thus clusters-, simply as a result of where people live and work. An exam-
ple is the "edge e ect" (it emerges when arti cial boundary is imposed on a study).

Although geospatial referencing provides ways to look at data. ere are four useful concepts to analyze the
spatial distribution of associated entities and spatial relationships: (i) distance (it can be measure as the simple
crow's ight distance between the spatial entities of interest, though it can be measured in more complex ways).
(ii) Adjacency (it is of the thought as the nominal, or binary, equivalent of distance. It is argued that two spatial
entities are either adjacent or they are not: there is not a middle ground). (iii) Interaction (it is considered a com-
bination of distance and adjacency and rests on the ideas that nearer things are more related than distant things:

 rst law of geography). And (iv) neighborhood (there are many ways to conceptualize it (e.g., with respect to
sets of adjacent entities, a region of space de ned by distance from an associated entity, etc.). One way of pulling
these four concepts together is to represent them in matrices.

Lastly, the chapter discusses the proximity polygons, a tool used to specify the spatial properties of a set of
objects through partitioning a study region into proximity polygons. e proximity polygon of an entity is the
closest region to the entity. e variogram cloud is an exploratory tool (though di cult to interpret) that o ers a
general picture of relationships between the spatial locations of objects and the other data attributes. It does it by
plotting the di erences in attribute values for pairs of entities against the di erences in their location.

CREATING DATA THROUGH GEOCODING

Geocoding is the process used to convert location codes, such as street addresses or postal codes, into geographic
(or other) coordinates. e terms "address geocoding" and "address mapping" refer to the same process. Geoc-

oding address-referenced population data is one of the Census Bureau's key responsibilities. However, as you
may know, it is also a very popular capability of online mapping and routing services. In addition, geocoding is
an essential element of a suite of techniques that are becoming known as "business intelligence." We will look
at applications like these later in this chapter, but, rst, let's consider how the Census Bureau performs address
geocoding.
ADDRESS GEOCODING AT THE US CENSUS: PRE MODERNIZATION
Prior to the MAF/TIGER modernization project that led up to the decennial census of 2010, the TIGER data-
base did not include a complete set of point locations for U.S. households. Lacking point locations, TIGER was
designed to support address geocoding by approximation. As illustrated below, the pre-modernization TIGER
database included address range attributes for the edges that represent streets. Address range attributes were also
included in the TIGER/Line les extracted from TIGER. Coupled with the Start and End nodes bounding each
edge, address ranges enable users to estimate locations of household addresses (Figure 7.1).

CHAPTER 8: MANIPUL ATING GIS DATA

Before today, we have been mainly working on data that we downloaded from certain sources, or creating new
GIS shape les. We basically present whatever we have, and we haven't taken advantage of the greatest strength of
a geographic information system (GIS), notably the explicit spatial relationships. Spatial analysis is a fundamen-
tal component of a GIS that allows for an in-depth study of the topological and geometric properties of a dataset
or datasets. Geoprocessing is to provide tools and a framework for performing spatial analysis and managing
your geographic data. is chapter by Longley et al (2001) rst discusses what is spatial analysis, and continued
two major spatial analysis, one based on location, and the other based on distance.
While knowing geo-processing refers to tools that allow one to perform GIS tasks that range from simple bu ers
and polygon overlays to complex regression analysis and image classi cation, spatial analysis refers to e orts that
turns data into information: making what is implicit explicit, and what is invisible visible. is is especially true
for urban planners, whose needs require decisions to be based in data and from di erent disciplines. e kinds
of tasks to be automated can be mundane--for example, to collect di erent data and transform it from one for-
mat to another. Or the tasks can be quite creative, using a sequence of operations to model and analyze complex
spatial relationships--for example, calculating optimum paths through a transportation network, predicting the
path of wild re, analyzing and nding patterns in crime locations, predicting which areas are prone to landslides,
or predicting ooding e ects of a storm event.
One point to be highlighted is that, spatial analysis open the door for a lot of more sophisticated GIS tools to us.

   is does not underestimate the power of map making. e design of a map can be very sophisticated and that
maps provide a means of conveying geographic information and knowledge by revealing patterns and processes.
Map making itself, can be one way of conducting spatial analysis.

CHAPTER 9: RASTER DATA MODELS

We have learned that there are two major ways how GIS model the real world. Both the vector and raster ap-
proaches accomplish the same thing: they allow us to represent the Earth's surface with a limited number of
locations. What distinguish the two is the sampling strategies they embody. e vector approach is like creating a
picture of a landscape with shards of stained glass cut to various shapes and sizes. e raster approach, by con-
trast, is more like creating a mosaic with tiles of uniform size. Neither is well suited to all applications, however.
Several variations on the vector and raster themes are in use for specialized applications, and the development of
new object-oriented approaches is underway.
Although our course has mainly focused on the vector data model, raster data analysis presents the nal power-
ful data mining tool available. Raster data are particularly suited to certain types of analyses, such as basic geo-
processing, surface analysis, and terrain mapping. Some of them are very closely related to planning needs, such
as terrain analysis to identify buildable land in a county. While not always true, raster data can simplify many
types of spatial analyses that would otherwise be overly cumbersome to perform on vector datasets. Some of the
most common of these techniques are presented in this chapter. First, we want to summarize the advantages and
disadvantages of the raster model.

ADVANTAGES/DISADVANTAGES OF THE RASTER MODEL

   e use of a raster data model confers many advantages. First, the technology required to create raster graphics
is inexpensive and ubiquitous. Nearly everyone currently owns some sort of raster image generator, namely a
digital camera, and few cellular phones are sold today that don't include such functionality. Similarly, a plethora
of satellites are constantly beaming up-to-the-minute raster graphics to scienti c facilities across the globe. ese
graphics are o en posted online for private and/or public use, occasionally at no cost to the user.

Additional advantages of raster graphics are the relative simplicity of the underlying data structure. Each grid
location represented in the raster image correlates to a single value (or series of values if attributes tables are
included). is simple data structure may also help explain why it is relatively easy to perform overlay analyses
on raster data. is simplicity also lends itself to easy interpretation and maintenance of the graphics, relative to
its vector counterpart.

Despite the advantages, there are also several disadvantages to using the raster data model. e rst disadvan-
tage is that raster les are typically very large. Particularly in the case of raster images built from the cell-by-cell
encoding methodology, the sheer number of values stored for a given dataset result in potentially enormous les.
Any raster le that covers a large area and has somewhat nely resolved pixels will quickly reach hundreds of
megabytes in size or more. ese large les are only getting larger as the quantity and quality of raster datasets
continues to keep pace with quantity and quality of computer resources and raster data collectors (e.g., digital
cameras, satellites).

A second disadvantage of the raster model is that the output images are less "pretty" than their vector counter-
parts. is is particularly noticeable when the raster images are enlarged or zoomed. Depending on how far one
zooms into a raster image, the details and coherence of that image will quickly be lost amid a pixilated sea of
seemingly randomly colored grid cells.

   e geometric transformations that arise during map reprojection e orts can cause problems for raster graphics
and represent a third disadvantage to using the raster data model. We know that changing map projections will
alter the size and shape of the original input layer and frequently result in the loss or addition of pixels (White
2006)2. ese alterations will result in the perfect square pixels of the input layer taking on some alternate rhom-

carto International 21 (2): 19-22.

boidal dimensions. However, the problem is larger than a simple reformation of the square pixel. Indeed, the
reprojection of a raster image dataset from one projection to another brings change to pixel values that may, in
turn, signi cantly alter the output information (Seong 2003)3.

   e nal disadvantage of using the raster data model is that it is not suitable for some types of spatial analy-
ses. For example, di culties arise when attempting to overlay and analyze multiple raster graphics produced at
di ering scales and pixel resolutions. Combining information from a raster image with 10 m spatial resolution
with a raster image with 1 km spatial resolution will most likely produce nonsensical output information as the
scales of analysis are far too disparate to result in meaningful and/or interpretable conclusions. In addition, some
network and spatial analyses (i.e., determining directionality or geocoding) can be problematic to perform on
raster data.

SINGLE LAYER ANALYSIS
Reclassifying, or recoding, a dataset is commonly one of the rst steps undertaken during raster analysis. Re-
classi cation is basically the single layer process of assigning a new class or range value to all pixels in the dataset
based on their original values. For example, an elevation grid commonly contains a di erent value for nearly ev-
ery cell within its extent. ese values could be simpli ed by aggregating each pixel value in a few discrete classes
(i.e., 0-100 = "1," 101-200 = "2," 201-300 = "3," etc.). is simpli cation allows for fewer unique values and
cheaper storage requirements. In addition, these reclassi ed layers are o en used as inputs in secondary analyses.
In vector analysis, bu ering is the process of creating an output dataset that contains a zone (or zones) of a spec-
i ed width around an input feature. In the case of raster datasets, these input features are given as a grid cell or a
group of grid cells containing a uniform value (e.g., bu er all cells whose value = 1). Bu ers are particularly suited
for determining the area of in uence around features of interest. Whereas bu ering vector data results in a precise
area of in uence at a speci ed distance from the target feature, raster bu ers tend to be approximations represent-
ing those cells that are within the speci ed distance range of the target (Figure 9.2).

MULTIPLE LAYER ANALYSIS
A raster dataset can also be clipped similar to a vector dataset. Here, the input raster is overlain by a vector polygon
clip layer. e raster clip process results in a single raster that is identical to the input raster but shares the extent
of the polygon clip layer.

RASTER OVERLAYS

Raster overlays are relatively simple compared to their vector counterparts and require much less computation-
al power (Burroughs 1983)4. Raster overlay superimposes at least two input raster layers to produce an output
layer. Each cell in the output layer is calculated from the corresponding pixels in the input layers. To do this, the
layers must line up perfectly; they must have the same pixel resolution and spatial extent. Once preprocessed,
raster overlay is exible, e cient, quick, and o ers more overlay possibilities than vector overlay.

Despite their simplicity, it is important to ensure that all overlain rasters are coregistered (i.e., spatially aligned),
cover identical areas, and maintain equal resolution (i.e., cell size). If these assumptions are violated, the analysis
will either fail or the resulting output layer will be awed. With this in mind, there are several di erent method-

ologies for performing a raster overlay (Chrisman 2002)5.
Raster overlay, frequently called map algebra, is based on calculations which include arithmetic expressions and
set and Boolean algebraic operators to process the input layers to create an output layer (Figure 9.4). It is o en
used in risk assessment studies where various layers are combined to produce an outcome map showing areas of
high risk/reward. e most common operators are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In short,
raster overlay simply uses arithmetic operators to compute the corresponding cells of two or more input layers
together, uses Boolean algebra like AND or OR to nd the pixels that t a particular query statement, or executes
statistical tests like correlation and regression on the input layers.

   e Boolean connectors AND, OR, and XOR can be employed to combine the information of two overlying
input raster datasets into a single output raster. Similarly, the relational raster overlay method utilizes relational
operators (<, <=, =, <>, >, and =>) to evaluate conditions of the input raster datasets. In both the Boolean and re-
lational overlay methods, cells that meet the evaluation criteria are typically coded in the output raster layer with
a 1, while those evaluated as false receive a value of 0.

   e simplicity of this methodology, however, can also lead to easily overlooked errors in interpretation if the
overlay is not designed properly. Assume that a natural resource manager has two input raster datasets she plans
to overlay; one showing the location of trees ("0" = no tree; "1" = tree) and one showing the location of urban
areas ("0" = not urban; "1" = urban). If she hopes to nd the location of trees in urban areas, a simple mathemat-
ical sum of these datasets will yield a "2" in all pixels containing a tree in an urban area. Similarly, if she hopes
to nd the location of all treeless (or "non-tree," nonurban areas, she can examine the summed output raster
for all "0" entries. Finally, if she hopes to locate urban, treeless areas, she will look for all cells containing a "1."
Unfortunately, the cell value "1" also is coded into each pixel for nonurban, tree cells. Indeed, the choice of input
pixel values and overlay equation in this example will yield confounding results due to the poorly devised overlay
scheme.

THE DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL DEM

simplicity of the model, and its extensive so ware support. Each pixel value in these grid-based DEMs denotes

spot elevations on the ground, usually in feet or meters. Care must be taken when using grid-based DEMs due
to the enormous volume of data that accompanies these les as the spatial extent covered in the image begins to
increase. DEMs are referred to as digital terrain models (DTMs) when they represent a simple, bare-earth model
and as digital surface models (DSMs) when they include the heights of landscape features such as buildings and
trees.
From the elevation data in each pixel of the raster DEM layer, you are able to produce output layers to portray
slope (inclination), aspect (direction), and hillshading (Figure 9.5). ese topographic functions are typical
neighborhood processes; each pixel in the resultant layer is a product of its own elevation value as well as those
of its surrounding neighbors.

    % Slope layers exhibit the incline or steepness of the land. It is the change in elevation over a de ned distance.
    % Aspect is the compass direction in which a slope faces. From north, it is usually expressed clockwise from

         0 to 360 degrees.
    % Hillshading, which is cartographically called shaded relief, is a lighting e ect which mimics the sun to high-

         light hills and valleys. Some areas appear to be illuminated while others lie in shadows.

While these functions are raster processes, most can be mimicked in a vector environment by Triangulated
Irregular Networks (TIN). In addition, topographic functions can derive vector isolines (contours). Source: GIS

CONNECTIVITY ANALYSIS
Connectivity analyses use functions that accumulate values over an area traveled. Most o en, these include the
analysis of surfaces and networks. Connectivity analyses include network analysis, spread functions, and vis-
ibility analysis. is group of analytical functions is the least developed in commercial GIS so ware, but this
situation is changing as commercial demand for these functions is increasing. Vector-based systems generally
focus on network analysis capabilities. Raster-based systems provide visibility analysis and sophisticated spread
function capabilities.
SPREAD FUNCTIONS SURFACE ANALYSIS
Spread functions are raster analysis techniques that determine paths through space by considering how phe-
nomena (including features) spread over an area in all directions but with di erent resistances. You begin with
an origin or starting layer (a point where the path begins) and a friction layer, which represents how di cult--
how much resistance--it is for the phenomenon to pass through each cell. From these two layers, a new layer

                                                                  50
                                                 Chapter 9: Raster Data Models
is formed that indicates how much resistance the phenomenon encounters as it spreads in all directions (Figure
9.6).
Add a destination layer, and you can determine the "least cost" path between the origin and the destina-
tion. "Least cost" can be a monetary cost, but it can also represent the time it takes to go from one point to
another, the environmental cost of using a route, or even the amount of e ort (calories) that is spent.

              Figure 9.6. Spread Functions. is example shows that the shortest distance is not always the least cost distance.

VIEWSHED MODELING INTERVISIBILITY ANALYSIS
Viewshed modeling uses elevation layers to indicate areas on the map that can and cannot be viewed from a
speci c vantage point. e non-obscured area is the viewshed. Viewsheds are developed from DEMs in ras-
ter-based systems and from TINs in vector systems. e ability to determine viewshed (and how they can be
altered) is particularly useful to national and state park planners and landscape architects (Figure 9.7).

CORRELATION AND REGRESSION
Correlation and Regression are two ways to compute the degree of association between two (or sometimes more)
layers. With correlation, you do not assume a causal relationship. In other words, one layer is not a ecting the
spatial pattern of the other layer. e patterns may be similar, but no cause and e ect is implied. Regression is
di erent; you make the assumption that one layer (and its variable) in uences the other. You specify an inde-
pendent variable layer (sometimes more than one) that a ects the dependent variable layer (Figure 9.9).

                                                                  52

                  org/analysis/ - Correlation and regression tests allow you to overlay layers to test their spatial relationship.

With both statistical tests, you compute a correlation coe cient, which ranges from -1 to +1. Positive coe -
cients indicate that the two layer's variables are associated in the same direction. As one variable increases, the
other variable increases (both can simultaneously decrease too). e values closer to +1 describe a stronger
association than those closer to zero. A negative coe cient depicts two layer's variables that are associated but
in opposite directions. As one variable increases, the other variable decreases. Values closer to -1 have a strong
negative association. If the correlation coe cient is near zero, there is little to no association. Both of these pro-
cesses are raster based.

CHAPTER 10: THE FUTURE OF GIS

Planning support systems (PSS) emerged in the 1980's to include a widely set of computer-based tools provid-
ing `strategic support' to urban planners. By the 1990's with the availability of GIS PSS displaced the more rigid
"systems planning approach" and were widely used in most of the stages of the technical planning processes.
Currently PPS are applied to several and diverse planning proposes mostly because of three aspects related to
the transformation of the urban planning eld: (i) into a more fragmented and pluralistic eld; (ii) from a rigid
professionalism to collective negotiation, where the processes of communication to inform has become crucial;
and (iii) widely access to a diverse and constantly evolving computer technologies, through the internet and the
open source movement.
Among these new generic (GIS so ware, build in modules) and specialized `planning tools' technologies are: (i)
hardware able to process increasing amounts of data; (ii) convergence of computers and communications; (iii)
new powerful microprocessors; (iv) computer simulation models (agent-based, disaggregated) with three dimen-
sional visualization displays; (v) ability to communicate and interact among computers and participants using
visualization technologies (e.g. virtual reality theaters allowing public interaction).
Visualization and communication technologies revolve around interactivity using the Web. e Web is orga-
nized into four general styles: (i) vanilla-style Web pages that present information to users with no interactivity
other than hyperlinking; (ii) Web pages that enable users to download data and so ware to their desktops; (iii)
Web-pages enabling users to run so ware within their own Web; and (iv) Web-pages enabling users to import
their own data and run so ware remotely. ere are also `collaboratories' (online systems remotely linked that
enable users to communicate with one another and run so ware jointly), which are growing in popularity.
Although we are in the midst of a fragmentation of PSS tools, we can classify them into: (i) those serving the
technical planning process (e.g., problem identi cation, goal setting, etc.); (ii) processes focus on providing
opportunities for public participation (e.g. PP-GIS, 3-D virtual city models); (iii) those related to tasks (observ-
ing, measuring, predicting, etc.) related to how the city system is represented and manipulated (e.g., modeling
and simulation). Among the computer packages developed to do it are: GIS, land use transportation models
(LUTM), multi-criteria analysis (MCA), What if/; (iv) ne scale disaggregated models (agent based); (v) tools
focus on either spatial/non-spatial analysis or general/specialist tasks; (vi) GIS toolbox (e.g., free mapping and
visualization so ware on the Web).
Authors used three examples to illustrate many of the features and characteristics of the PSS: (i) long term fore-
casting: visualizing land use and transportation scenarios in the Greater London, through modeling (ii) Immedi-
ate forecasting at the local level: visualizing the impact of air pollution using a virtual city model for the Greater
London; and (iii) Describing and exploring spatial data: tools to enhance the understanding of urban problems.
Planning support systems (PSS) usually refers to a computer-based system that can integrate spatial mapping,
analysis and visualization, and further lead to operational and meaningful public decision making. is intro-
duction chapter in the book, which originated from a conference on PSS organized by Lincoln Institute of Land
Policy, provide an overview of planning and decision support system. is chapter highlights the movement
of urban planning over the past decades from a top-down, `professionals know best' attitude to a participatory
approach involving a broad spectrum of citizens, interest groups, and public o cials. Today planners and public
o cials interact with multiple communities and increasingly do so with digital technology. erefore, the visual-
ization of models and processes becomes the central part of planners' toolbox.
