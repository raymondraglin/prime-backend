Foreword To 1st Edition

by R. Kurt Barnhart, Ph.D., KSUP Associate Dean of Research

It gives me great pleasure to commend this work to you the reader after having spent a great
deal of time with the manuscript in recent weeks. Although still in draft form at the time of my
review, I can say with certainty that the breadth and quality of information you will find herein
is unparalleled in the unclassified sphere. This book will fully immerse and engage the reader in
the cyber-security considerations of this rapidly emerging technology we know as unmanned
aircraft systems (UAS). Many of these same vulnerabilities affect unmanned technology across
the board and regardless of mode, however the focus of this work is exclusively on those vehi-
cles which operate in the National Airspace System (NAS).

Aircraft without on-board human pilots have been around in various forms longer than piloted
aircraft. In 1783 Joseph-Michael and Jacques-Ètienne Montgolfier performed the first heavier-
than-air vehicle flight in Annonay France. The passengers were a sheep, a pig, and a chicken (at
least the chicken had a fighting chance if things went awry). It has, however, only been within
the last couple of decades that this technology has burst onto the modern stage driven by the
distinct technological advantages associated with eliminating the risks and limitations of pro-
tecting humans on-board. Advances in hardware and software have driven UAS capabilities far
beyond what many imagined just a few short years ago. Today we stand at the precipice of a
period in history where, looking forward, most vehicles in the air will not be occupied. As a
result, given that we in the U.S. are constantly on the receiving end of withering cyber-attacks,
a detailed treatment of this subject matter is of national importance as we protect and secure
our national interests.

When noted cyber-security pioneer and lead author professor Nichols and I began to engage
in a dialogue on this topic several years ago, it was clear that there were large and looming gaps
in unmanned systems that had already been exploited on the international stage from a cyber-
perspective. Many of those gaps remain unaddressed today. Understandably, commercial tech-
nology developers remain keenly focused on gaining a competitive advantage and delivering
products to market albeit often without thorough cyber risk assessments and mitigations. This
book will give system designers, users, and their management teams an introduction to what it
will take to begin to close many of the vulnerabilities associated with UAS in order to produce
systems that will serve the market better by being much more reliable, capable, and secure
than they would be otherwise. This book takes advantage of the extensive knowledge of mul-
tiple working experts in the realm of cyber-security and they have each done an excellent job
at uncovering and detailing the core issues at hand as we continue the march toward full NAS

x | Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the Cyber Domain
integration of UAS in the not-to-distant future. Let's take a brief look at what the reader will
find herein.

In Section one, "The UAS Playing Field" the reader will gain an understanding of the history and
scope of UAS as a technology and will come to have a greater understanding of the UAS market
and of the policies which both enable, and inhibit the deployment of the technology into the
NAS. In chapter three, the final in section one, some of the key vulnerabilities associated with
UAS are introduced and discussed.

In section two, "UAS Information Security, Intelligence, and Risk Assessment", the reader will
gain a more detailed exposure to the vulnerabilities of the information necessary for UAS to
operate and thereby will appreciate the differences between explicit, implicit, and derived
security requirements. Chapter four concludes with a paragraph which says that "Communi-
cations may need to have confidentiality, integrity, and availability protected". How that is inte-
grated into UAS design is of high importance. Chapter five examines types of, and sources of,
intelligence data and discusses common attack/defense scenarios for UAS. Finally, section two
concludes with case studies that highlight the vulnerabilities of UAS in the cyber-domain.

Section three is all about collision avoidance systems which are indeed the "heart and soul" of a
fully integrated and useful system of unmanned aircraft. Sense and avoid (SAA) systems are dis-
cussed in depth along with one significant antagonist of SAA systems which is "stealth design".
Finally this section concludes with a detailed discussion of a related system which is the `smart
skies' collaborative commercial project of which SAA is a critical component.

Section four primarily relates to the defense applications of Intelligence, Surveillance, and
Reconnaissance (ISR), weapon systems security, and electronic warfare considerations and
other information-centric operations. This section should not be dismissed by those without
a focus on military applications as often it is the military that simply encounters technological
vulnerabilities first given the dynamic operational environment they are associated with.

Section five looks at the data vulnerabilities of the various system components and explores the
relationships and associated vulnerabilities of intra-system communication pathways. Chapter
14 delves into the realm of electronic warfare from a detailed perspective including a discus-
sion of the intelligence information cycle as well as "jamming" operational vulnerabilities. This
section concludes with discussion of current international threats and considerations related
to still-emerging political scenarios where UAS technology is front and center.

As I conclude this overview of the work you are about to delve into I would encourage you
to read this work along with a ready-copy of today's most current headlines. In doing so you
will discover that the topics covered in this book are not only of interest today, but of critical
importance to the future of us all.

Foreword To 2nd Edition

by Alysia Starkey, Ph.D., KSUP CEO & Dean

I am delighted to write the forward for the second edition of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in
the Cyber Domain: Protecting the USA's Advanced Air Assets. The first edition was published in
2018 and quickly established itself as a must-have text for academic programs and individuals
looking to expand their knowledge in this emerging cyber discipline. Thanks to that text, con-
versations at conferences and other professional networking events this year were easy and
spirited. As soon as Kansas State University was spotted on my name tag, individuals asked if I
knew of the book and were eager to share their experiences.

The fact that the second edition follows so quickly after the first is indicative of the rapid pace
in which the manned and unmanned airspaces continue to converge and the need to fully
understand the direct impact on the civilian market. During the past year, I watched and lis-
tened as the authors electronically discussed and passionately debated the topics of national
interest presented in this text. Their collective intellect coupled with the depth of their profes-
sional experience challenged my assumptions and continued to do so as I read the completed
second edition.

As an educator, I appreciate that the second edition is structured in the same way as the
first. Each chapter starts with the student learning objectives found therein, include value-
added graphics, and concludes with scenarios and discussion questions for in-class use. This
brings increased efficiency when creating a course syllabus or developing content-related
assessments. The second edition further expands on the topics presented in the first edition.
Prior knowledge of manned and unmanned aviation regulations, military/civilian/commercial
unmanned applications, and basic cybersecurity concepts is beneficial for the reader to fully
engage with the material.

It is my expectation that this text will provide an effective learning experience and become
a referenced resource for students and professionals working to secure the national airspace
and reduce known and unknown threats with this developing technology.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) In the Cyber Domain: Protecting USA's Advanced Air Assets is
the working product of five talented authors to meet the needs of students enrolled in Kansas
State University Polytechnic's (KSUP) graduate Certificate in UAS - Cybersecurity. The book
also serves as one of the technical resources for the KSUP Professional Masters in Technology
(PMT) offering in their UAS - Cybersecurity discipline.

Interest in UAS-Cybersecurity Certificate / PMT specialty programs developed from two
directions; one internal and external to the college. Internally it dates to 2014, when the KSUP
Associate Dean for Research and Executive Director of the UAS Research Laboratory, Dr Kurt
C. Barnhart, met with Professor Nichols to discuss the possibility of state-of-the-art Cyber-
security Masters and / or Certificate program. These would meet the need for outside online
programs to enhance the University profit structure. Associate Dean Barnhart in 2014 approved
the concept of a Graduate Certificate in UAS - Cybersecurity and gave permission to move
forward with its development. The program was placed under the purview of the College of
Technology and Aviation. Final program approval was given by the KSU Board of Trustees in
January, 2017. The five courses in the Graduate Certificate UAS - Cybersecurity program were
also approved for the Professional Masters of Technology (PMT) in 2017.

In 2014, Professor Nichols had discussions with students and professionals in multiple schools
and states inquiring about the prospect of an Unmanned Aircraft Systems - Cybersecurity
Masters curriculum or graduate certificate program at KSUP, especially the on-line compo-
nent. Their perception was that there was a market of not only freshmen / transfers / graduate
students who might be interested in such a program, but a larger market of working profes-
sionals in need of skill advancement, and of a forum for the discussion of developments in
the industry. They also felt that the college could anticipate financial assistance from federal,
state, aviation, corporate, law enforcement, and defense organizations to get such a program
launched. There was considerable enthusiasm and a general feeling that a cybersecurity con-
centration to defend UAS assets and their Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
Intelligence, Reconnaissance and Surveillance (C4IRS) systems from cyber-attacks would serve
the interests of the college and its students, as well as those of the security / defense indus-
tries.

The outside interests from the intelligence and aviation communities became acute after the
2011 RQ-170 incident where Iran was credited with its capture. In addition, in 2014, Iran claimed
the downing of an Israeli Hermes 450 Drone over Natanz. Reports like these caused major gov-

xiv | Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the Cyber Domain
ernment concerns. Better risk assessment and teaching active cyber defenses is required to
protect UAS assets. Hence, the graduate Certificate program in UAS - Cybersecurity was born.

The new MPT / Certificate discipline in UAS - Cybersecurity is NOT about drone training like
that of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Its mission is CYBERSECURITY protection of
UAS / UAV / Drones as Information Assets in the Air, all the networked computer systems
related to the Intelligence / Counter Intelligence functions, and their payloads.

MISSION

A key concern is the safety of integration of UAS systems into the National Air Space (NAS). A
critical component of this safety is the hardening of UAS/ sUAS /UAVs to cyber-attacks.

The focus of this new program is on leadership, planning, and state-of-the-art practice for pro-
fessionals in UAS / UAV aviation concerned with protecting this advanced technology against
cyber-attacks or hostile/ intentional control of Command, Control, Communications, Com-
puters, Intelligence, Reconnaissance and Surveillance (C4IRS) systems, or Loss of Signal (LOS)
to critical navigational components. This program applies to all UAS / UAV personnel preparing
to act or working as pilots, operators, communications, payload, navigation, ground support,
satellite coordination with assets, or air-to-air delivery.

The Graduate Certificate Program in Unmanned Aircraft Systems - Cybersecurity requires five
three-hour credit courses for certification. Each course is required to reflect current knowl-
edge and practice in terms of cybersecurity, Information Security (INFOSEC), Communications
Security (COMSEC), and Risk Assessment (RA) as applied to both safe integration of UASs into
the National Airspace (NAS) and deployment for global Counter Terrorism operations (CT).

All courses in the proposed certificate focus on knowledge and skills to understand UAS / UAV
issues related to UAS cyber security. If students desire to complete a Professional Masters in
Technology (PMT), four courses from this certificate can be applied as electives towards the
professional Master's Degree in College of Technology and Aviation.

The certificate program has one concentration - cybersecurity. CyberSecurity (in the context
of cyber-conflicts) is defined in this document as, "the broad tree of investigation and practice
devoted to cybercrimes, computer forensics, Information Assurance, Information Security
(INFOSEC), Communications Security (COMSEC), and especially Cyber Counter Intelligence
(CCI)" (Nichols, 2008). Cyber Counter Intelligence indicates the involvement of computer-
based sensitive information, or information operations for three distinct sciences operating in
the cyber realm: Cyber Counter Sabotage (CCS), Cyber Counter Terrorism (CCT), and Cyber
Counter Espionage (CCE). (Nichols, 2008) In this book, Cybersecurity is limited to the prior
three investigation areas. Computer forensics is the discipline that combines elements of law
and computer science to collect and analyze data from computer systems, networks, wireless

                                                                                                                          Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the Cyber Domain | xv
communications, and storage devices in a way that is admissible as evidence in a court of law
(US-CERT, 2015)

The primary concerns of the graduate certificate program are protection of UASs / Small UAS
(sUAS) / Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) from cyber-attacks, through negligent or hostile
means, and teaching cyber security risk assessment principles to practitioners involved with
UAS operations on land, sea, air, or satellite platforms. The impact of Loss of Signal (LOS) or
intentional interference in UAS communications or navigation systems cannot be overstated.
At the lowest end of the scale is the risk of a downed vehicle, mid-range risk is collision and
failure to sense and avoid other vehicles or commercial / military traffic, and at the top of the
risk scale is the hostile takeover of a payload to be used against US or US interests. It is not
"good enough" to operate, fly or support UASs. Professionals must be concerned with protec-
tion of their charges.

Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) In the Cyber Domain: Protecting USA's Advanced Air Assets is
the authors attempt to provide some of the raw materials / tools for our students at a rea-
sonable cost. (Free download like the MIT Open courseware project under a CCL open license

UAS - CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATE PROGRAM COURSES

COT 680. Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Risk Assessment. (3) Fall. This course is an intro-
ductory course in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) history, elements, US aviation regulations,
operations, use of geospatial data, automation and safety issues; detect and avoid systems, sen-
sors and payloads, and human factors. Special attention to UAS Cyber Security Risks, Threats,
Impact, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures will be identified. Various risk assessment equa-
tions will be used for qualitative risk analysis of threats so identified.

COT 682. Open Source Cyber Surveillance / Intelligence. (3) Fall. One of the key public con-
cerns for safe integration of UAS into the NAS is privacy. This course questions the techni-
cal gaps, Intelligence Community (IC) assumptions, and important legal issues related to open
source cyber surveillance / intelligence with emphasis on UAS activities/ deployment. Topics
addressed include the responsible, legal, and ethical use of data and information gathered from
the use of unmanned, semiautonomous systems, web data mining, social networks, and other
modern technological systems.

COT 684. Advanced Topics in Cyber Data Fusion and Cyber Counter Intelligence. Prerequisites:
three of four courses in the sequence. (3) Spring. This course is scenario-based applying cyber
surveillance techniques and analysis of collected data to realistic, terrain-oriented problems.
Topics include the digital soldier and sailor, 360-degree battlefield awareness and the use
of unmanned, semiautonomous technologies. Risk assessment and cyber security counter-
measures are the "glue" to successful implementation of data fusion techniques. Various risk

xvi | Preface To 1st Edition
assessment equations and other methods will be used for qualitative risk analysis of identified
cyber threats. Cyber Counter Intelligence technology is applied to cases.

COT 686. Risk Management for UAS Operators, Pilots, and Ground Personnel. (3) Spring. UAS
operators, pilots, and ground personnel must be committed to safety if the goal of UAS integra-
tion into NAS is to be accomplished. The best tool for assessment and determination of safest
possible flight is risk management. This course introduces three risk assessment tools for UAS
operators, pilots, and ground personnel to manage the workloads associated with each phase
of flight.

COT 688. Sense and Avoid Technologies in UAS. (3) Summer / fall. This course is an advanced
course in Sense and Avoid (SAA) technologies for UAS. SAA is extremely important concept and
is the main obstacle for wider application of UAS in non-segregated airspace related to traffic
safety in civilian and military/ defense domains.

TARGET AUDIENCE

Clearly, the students in the UAS -Cybersecurity Certificate and MPT programs, along with
KSU's Aviation and Technology Department and UAS Research Laboratory, are the targets for
this book. Cyber attacks and hostile control of UAS should not be underestimated.. It is as real
as cyber attacks on computers, networks, personal identities, intellectual property loss, and
delivery of cyber weapons on the battlefield. The larger audience are UAS operators, pilots, and
ground personnel, owners and computer network analysts to manage the workloads associ-
ated with each phase of flight in any service: military, commercial, or recreational. Those con-
cerned with UAS communications, navigation, payload, battery, sense and avoid, emergency
components, satellite links, ground station links, materials construction and risk assessment /
management associated with novel designs may well benefit from our textbook. All are factors
in the vulnerable cyber domain.

STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK

Several themes covered in this text:

  · C4ISR, Payload recovery, communications interference in the many different platforms,
  · SAA and navigational functions and their interactions in the NAS (i.e. vulnerabilities)
  · Protecting UASs from hostile intent in the Cyber Domain, and
  · SCADA systems and how they may be exploited and protected in UAS vehicles.

Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) In the Cyber Domain: Protecting USA's Advanced Air Assets is
divided into five sections:

Section 1: The UAS Playing Field

                                                                                                                        Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the Cyber Domain | xvii

Preface to 2nd Edition

Summary

It has been less than a year since the first edition of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the Cyber
Domain: Protecting USA's Advanced Air Assets was published. Three different factors have
spurred the authors into updating their textbook. First, unmanned aircraft technology has seen
an economic explosion in production, sales, testing, specialized designs and friendly / hostile
usages of deployed UAS / UAVs / Drones. There is a huge global growing market and entre-
preneurs know it. Small UAS companies have been reproducing like rabbits. Only the FAA has
been stumbling block trying to balance UAS safe integration into the National Airspace against
hundreds of thousands new recreational and commercial operators testing their meddle in the
skies. FAA's best efforts surround its decision to register UAS and provide a process for Part 107
Certification. Certification brings sanity and education into a chaotic public market in the US.

Second, hostile use of UAS is on the forefront of DoD defense and offensive planners. They are
especially concerned with SWARM behavior. The author presented at several international C-
UAS conferences which were attended by commercial, educational and military organizations
for the purpose of hardening USA air assets against hostile drone activities. These were seri-
ous conversations and workshops - many of them behind closed doors and interacting with
military brass.

Third, UAS technology was outpacing our first edition. Everyday our group read / discussed
new UAS developments in navigation, weapons, surveillance, data transfer, fuel cells, stealth,
weight distribution, tactics, GPS / GNSS elements, SCADA protections, privacy invasions, ter-
rorist uses, specialized software and security protocols and more. As authors we felt compelled
to address at least the edge of some of the new UAS developments. It was clear that we would
be lucky if we could cover some of the more interesting and priority technology updates. The
2nd Edition adds six more chapters (see below) to harvest information on important advances
in the UAS theater. We were privileged to bring on Captain John P Hood (US Army) as our mil-
itary advisor and co-author.

Here is an outline of topics in the new chapters in our 2nd Edition:

  Chapter 17 looks at the promise of UAS High Altitude Platforms (HAPS). It follows a similar
  investment path as that of UAM (Urban Air Mobility) systems for transportation. Lots of money,
  lots of new technology, lots of players, and failure to complete the mission.

  Chapter 18 is an interesting look at Counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS), large scale
  UAS, and restrictions that the DoD and government has to suffer to extinguish UAS threats.

  Chapter 19 presents the research formulations / Intellectual Property of Professor Nichols
  which were presented at two 2018 conferences. 1 It discusses the technology behind use of
  loud ultrasonic sound at specific frequencies to disrupt the MEMS components driving the
  rotors of a Hostile UAS, forcing the aircraft into a destructive path. It works best with SWARMS
  because the number and organization can be matched by the LRAD weapons. Chapter 19 also
  presents the novel idea that the same frequencies that can be used to down a UAS can also be
  used to identify friend or foe (IFF) by creating a searchable library of sound frequency signa-

1. Prof Nichols was the Invited Keynote Speaker and Panel Moderator, (29-30 March 2019) 1st UAS CON for
  Law Enforcement and First Responders, speaking on Drone Wars: Threats, Vulnerabilities and Hostile Use
  of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Small UAS (sUAS), and Acoustic Defensive Countermeasures
  against SWARMS, Hazard Community & Technical College, Hazard, KY.He also was an Invited Speaker and
  Panelist (13-14 March 2019) 7th Annual DoD Summit, speaking on: Hardening USA Unmanned Systems
  Against Enemy Countermeasures, Alexandria, VA.

                                                                                                                            Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the Cyber Domain | xxv
tures. Currently IFF units are too expensive and require too many SCADA and power commu-
nications to be included in SUAS / mid-level UAS. Prof. Nichols and his team are seeking grant
/ funding for testing at a national anechoic chamber.

Chapter 20 addresses the legal and regulatory conditions in the US that UAS operators / own-
ers and defense planners face. Globally, restrictions are much lighter than in the US. It is a
mess that FAA and others need to solve for the industry to grow in a challenging multi-issue
environment.

Chapter 21 brilliantly addresses the Chinese Land / Sea New Silk Road Strategy and how UASs
are being deployed for ISR operations and people control as well as interference with other
nations assets. It presents a disturbing picture and one that should be taken to heart. The
reader should also engage in self - learning by reading two seminal texts on the subject: 1)
Brenner, J. (2011) America the Vulnerable: Inside the Threat Matrix of Digital Espionage, Crime
and Warfare. New York: Penguin Books; and 2) Corr, A., Editor. (2018) Great Powers, Grand
Strategies: The New Game in the South China Sea. Annapolis: The Naval Institute Press.

Chapter 22 presents a subject rarely discussed in public or regulatory offices - ethics. It looks
at UAS and AI interfaces and how they present a real problem for society and act as a market
barrier for an expanding UAS market. Several tough ethical cases are presented for evaluation.

We trust our 2nd edition will enrich our students and readers understanding of the purview of
this wonderful technology we call UAS.

Books such as this are the products of contributions by many people, not just the musings of
the authors. Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the Cyber Domain: Protecting USA's Advanced Air
Assets, 2nd Edition, has benefited from the review of numerous experts in the field, who gave
generously of their time and expertise. In addition to named subject matter experts, this book
was reviewed by sources in the two federal agencies who must remain anonymous. Their con-
tributions were especially helpful in not releasing protected information, classified or deemed
exportable categories. We will name only a few and clearly miss some special friends whose
contributions were noteworthy. For this we apologize in advance and beg your forgiveness.

                             of optical amplification based on the stimulated
Laser JDAM                   emission of electromagnetic radiation. The term
Laser rangefinder            "laser" originated as an acronym for "light
LGWs                         amplification by stimulated emission of radiation". A
Latency                      laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits
LCDR                         light coherently, spatially and temporally. Spatial
L/D                          coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot,
LDCM                         enabling applications such as laser cutting and
LEO                          lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam
LGB                          to stay narrow over great distances - collimation,
                             enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers
LGTF                         can also have high temporal coherence, which allows
LIDAR                        them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum. i.e.,
LFS                          they can emit a single color of light. Temporal
LIPC                         coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as
LJ                           short as a femtosecond. Used: for military and LEO
                             devices for marking targets and ,measuring range and
                             speed." (Gould, R.G. 1959)

 Chapter 1: A View of the UAS Market

  Student Learning Objectives - The student will gain an understanding of the current UAS mar-
  ketplace and barriers to UAS growth. Students will be introduced to the UAS cybersecurity
  issues in the UAM sector.
  Marketplace History
  Consider the US marketplace for UAS. The US UAS marketplace is comprised of three UAS
  sectors: commercial, consumer, and military. The UAS marketplace has evolved from the mili-
  tary to commercial rapidly over the last four years. Technological advancements for unmanned
  space vehicles has contributed to the rapid growth and opened new markets for UAS sales.
  Projections are for the UAS market to reach approximately $12 billion in 2021.1
  Is the UAS marketplace growing faster than we can secure? UAS technology growth in the
  consumer sector has a 40% compound annual growth rate.2 Commercial UAS registration was
  mandated after April 2016. FAA reported that they received about 1,000 registrations a week. In
  2017, UAS registrations exceeded 150% from 2016.3 See Figure 1-1. In 2015, the first year of -the
  UAS market growth, security researchers at DEF CON4 successful knocked an A.R. drone5 out
  of the sky.

    UAS Marketplace Drivers

    Key drivers in the development of the US UAS marketplace are: FAA regulations, public accep-
    tance, national / state infrastructure, and advancements in technology. The FAA regulatory
    environment, state law and international laws concerning UAS will be presented in Chapter 2.
    The key goal for all UAS regulations is the safe integration of UAS into the national airspace.

    Public Acceptance

    Before the retail marketplace can grow there needs to be a public acceptance of the UAS ser-
    vices. In 2016, the Inspector General of the United States Postal Service Office administered an
    online survey regarding UAS among 18-75-year-old residents in all fifty states and the District
    of Columbia.8 The findings paint a picture of uncertainty of nationwide acceptance. Overall,
    the three generational groups (Baby Boomers,9 Generation X,10 and Millennials11 think it is too
    soon for UAS delivery. Millennials are the largest U.S. population that would accept the concept
    of drone delivery. Forty-eight percent of Millennials believe it would be "safe" to integrate UAS
    systems into the National Airspace (NAS). This compares to 47 % of Baby Boomers that believe
    delivery of a package by UAS would be "unsafe."12 All three generational groups chose Amazon
    as their trusted brand for drone delivery.13 "Baby Boomers" traditionally are more conservative
    than other generations. For this reason, the US UAS marketplace growth may be delayed.

 7. Green circles represent hub-densities of UAS registrations.
 8. (United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General, 2016)
 9. Wikipedia (2018) Baby Boomers are generally defined as those born between 1945 and 1964. That would

    make the generation huge (71 MM) and encompass people who were 20 years apart in age.
10. IBID, Generation X, or Gen X, is the demographic cohort following the baby boomers and preceding the

    Millennials. There are no precise dates for when Generation X starts or ends. Demographers and
    researchers typically use birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1960s to the early 1980s.
11. IBID, anyone born between 1981 and 1996 (ages 22 to 37 in 2018) will be considered a Millennials
12. Safe and unsafe are relative terms. No definition was given in the survey. This presents a problem for the
    researchers because of the vagueness of the terms.

   Infrastructure Influence
   Along with government regulations, infrastructure in the U.S. has been a roadblock when it
   comes to growth of the UAS market in the U.S. The U.S. aviation infrastructure ranks low among
   other countries around the globe.14 According to the Air Help global survey,
   With poor infrastructure, the UAS industry has an uphill battle in building a diverse market-
   place in the U.S. To mitigate falling behind in the global UAS commercial market private corpo-
   rations have taken the U.S. infrastructure issue into their own hands. "Amazon, Google, Boeing
   and General Electric have joined forces with NASA to build out a privately funded and oper-
   ated air-traffic control network separate from current federal system." (Pasztor, 2018) One rea-
   son for the private industry taking the lead, is it is recognized that FAA is not able to process
   requests from commercial drone operators fast enough and/or reject a large amount of appli-
   cations. The current air-traffic control system is not compatible with the Low Altitude Autho-
   rization and Notification Capability (LAANC) that is needed to safely operate commercial UAS
   traffic in a highly populated area. U.S. will need to allocate more money and resources in UAS
   infrastructure to keep up with the globe.
   Restricting Drones Flight
   Some states have taken a negative view of UAS activity and have legislated restrictions on their
   use. See Figure 1-3.

   There are areas of restricted air space that UAS / drones are not permitted to enter or operate.
   It could be restricted for protection of the U.S. government or stealing plays of a major league
   football team. While a majority of UAS manufacturers have built in GPS Geofencing.15 this is not
   a "silver bullet" solution. Different methods of preventing drones in restricted areas are being
   tested. Airspace Systems has created a drone with sensors and artificial intelligence, to prevent
   unwanted drones.16

   The defensive drone, named Avlayan, is capable of high speed travel and uses a Kevlar net to
   capture the threatening drone away from the area. See Figure 1-4. Another drone blocking
   innovation is the SkyDroner camera, it detects and disables drones that enter an area.
   Commercial
   Commercial UAS use in the U.S. has primarily been limited due to FAA regulations. As a result,
   U.S. companies have gone abroad to Europe, Africa, and Asia to test their drone functional-
   ity and begin commerce. Recently the FAA began to change regulations in favor of the UAS

    generated--as in a radius around a point location, or a geo-fence can be a predefined set of boundaries
    (such as school zones or neighborhood boundaries). The use of a geo-fence is called geo-fencing, and one
    example of usage involves a location-aware device of a location-based service (LBS) user entering or exit-
    ing a geo-fence. This activity could trigger an alert to the device's user as well as messaging to the geo-
    fence operator. This info, which could contain the location of the device, could be sent to a mobile
    telephone or an email account." (Wiki-G, 2018)

   commercial market, however the change remains behind other countries. The U.S. commer-
   cial market consists of the following sectors: movie / film, agriculture, humanitarian aid, and
   retail industries. Retailers, like Amazon and FedEx, are exploring UAS delivery of goods to and
   services to consumers. UAS used for humanitarian efforts are moving at an accelerated pace
   through the FAA approvals. The U.S. remains behind in the global UAS race in the commercial
   market. The focus in the U.S. for commercial UAS remains on safety and pollution. The topic of
   security of the UAS is limited to military, law enforcement and intelligence organizations. The
   subject of security remains unaddressed at a formal level in the development of commercial UAS
   globally. Critical security factors of UAS could be used to develop the marketplace, allowing the
   U.S. to be an example for other countries.

   In December 2016, Amazon successfully completed one of the first ever commercial deliveries
   in Cambridge, UK.17 See example Figure 1-5. The U.S. based company chose to arrange the first
   delivery in the United Kingdom because of their regulations are ahead of the U.S. Amazon's first
   U.S. delivery occurred in March 2017, which is behind other countries. In 2016, China's largest
   ecommerce retailer began deliveries to customers. In 2016, Dominos started delivering pizzas
   to New Zealanders via UAS marketplace.

   Overall, Africa is leading the UAS commercial market, they established a drone corridor and
   working on building out the first drone port.18
   Zipline, a U.S. based UAS company, delivered blood to remote area of outside of Rwanda in
   2016. Rwanda was chosen by the sky ambulance company because of the lack of established
   infrastructure. By the end of 2018, Zipline is projected to be the world's largest drone delivery
   service. Zipline's commercial drones, backed by UPS, can travel 500 flights a day up to 80 mph.
   It is expected Zipline will conduct 2,000 medical deliveries a day by the Tanzania government.
   Zipline's currently planning to launch business in the U.S. by the end of 2018. The issue of secu-
   rity does not seem to be a Zipline priority. (Figure 1-6) This might be a grave concern in a coun-
   try / continent which has so many terrorist groups in the field.

    In May 2018, the FAA announce their UAS Integration Pilot Program (UASIPP), which is a pro-
    gram comprised of ten companies that would be paired with local governments to conduct
    commercial drone testing. Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, and DJI were not chosen
    to take part in the pilot.19 China's DJI is the world's top drone manufacture, owning 70% of the
    global marketplace.20 Among the ten chosen companies to participate in the FAA test program
    are Apple, Intel, Uber, and Zipline.
    UAS For Hire - Urban Air Mobility and E-VTOL
    Often compared to The Jetsons, Urban Air Mobility (UAM) remains a far-reaching idea for the
    public. UAM can be a manned or unmanned flying vehicles that transport one to six people,
    without delay, unlike automobile traffic. However, the reality of UAM is closer than the public
    would chose to believe. Uber announced Uber Elevate in Fall of 2016. Consult Figure 1-8. Ele-
    vate is a project that will make UAM a "common household name". Initially the project started
    with the idea of unmanned air vehicles landing on rooftops. Since the introduction of Elevate,
    it has evolved into so much more.

Uber was one of the companies approved for commercial testing by the FAA as part of the
UASIPP. This decision was a significant for the U.S. in the UAS race. Upon completion, Uber's
project Elevate will implement intra-city taxis that will be unmanned aerial vehicles. The
technology is often referred to as Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (E-VTOL). This on-
demand urban air taxi is fully electric and takes off and lands vertically. Uber is planning by
2023, to have a network of E-VTOLs distributed by vertiports. (Figure 1-7) The vertiports will
have multiple takeoff and landing pads. The pads will be equipped with charging infrastructure.
By 2030, Dubai is planning to be using E-VTOL to mobilize 25% of the population.21

    The consumer will be able to use their mobile device to request an Uber Elevate aircraft. After
    arriving at the vertiport, Uber's version of an UAV airport, the consumer will be weighted as
    they check in and assigned an aircraft.
    The consumer would then proceed to the assigned pad for departure.22 (See Figure 1-8) The
    author believes, that if the U.S. government continues to support Uber UAS creativity, the USA
    would be a front -runner in the inter-city taxi industry. See Figure 1-9 for a look at the future
    Uber UAM station.

It is estimated there are fifty companies creating E-VTOL aircrafts globally. The designs vary
from amount of motors, sensors, and propellers. As of 2017, the EHang 184 E-VTOL conducted
numerous tests for Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA). Passengers have been flown
in China and Dubai. The aircraft is being developed in China and in Redwood City, California.
The EHang 184 is a single passenger aircraft that has safety features such as sensors that pre-
vent it taking off in a storm. See Figure 1-10.

    In comparison, the Volocopter holds two passengers and boasts eighteen electric drives. It is
    estimated the Volocopter can move 1,000 passengers an hour by landing on rooftops, or as
    the company calls them "Volo-ports".23 The aircraft uses a fly-by-light (FBL) communications
    network that includes Gyroscopes, acceleration sensors, magnetic field measurement sensors,
    and manometers.
    UAS for hire is expanding to explore transporting more people for further distances. The Lilium
    is a five passenger VTOL, with the ability to move five times faster than a car. The unmanned
    taxi is estimated to transport from Manhattan to New York's JFK airport in five minutes verse
    the fifty-five minutes by car.
    E-VTOL Cybersecurity
    Cybersecurity protection of E-VTOL data is not respected as an issue - even though millions of
    customers have suffered breaches of personal data by well-respected companies. NASA is lead-
    ing a series of workgroups to research areas of pollution, and safety. Only recently has NASA

    integrated cybersecurity with the addition of one researcher. The hype to bring UAM to the
    marketplace has blinded the industry of reviewing the cybersecurity implications. The industry
    should learn from others that have come before them. Let's look at the Tesla company.
    In 2016, Tesla launched the first self-driving car. The automaker has been in the electric car
    business since 2008. They only became popular in 2015, selling over 50,000 vehicles.24 It took
    less than a year from record sales for the car to be compromised. Hackers were able to take
    remote control of a Tesla Model S from twelve miles. They were able to operate the brakes, door
    locks, dashboard computer screen and other electronically controlled components.25 26
    Additionally, another group from University of South Carolina made the car's autopilot believe
    it was seeing objects that were not actually there, causing the car to brake prematurely (Solon,
    2016). Tesla does run a bug bounty program, however their plan for ensuring security of the car
    was flawed. In 2017, the Tesla Model X was again compromised, turning on the brakes remotely
    and getting the doors and trunk to open and close while blinking the lights in time to music
    streamed from the car's radio.27 See Figure 1-11. Both compromises were completed by Keen
    Security Lab of Shanghai, China. As a result, Tesla released a statement, "They actively encour-
    age this type of research so that it can prevent potential issues from occurring. The risk to cus-
    tomers from such exploits is very low and Tesla has not seen a single customer ever affected
    by it."28 29

Agriculture
Agriculture is the fastest growing industry in the UAS commercial market. Drones equipped
with sensors are used for monitoring crops and providing soil analysis. Outside of the U.S. UAS
are used to apply fertilizer, pesticides, and irrigate crops. Farm animals can be tracked, and
health monitored by data collected by drones. A leading agriculture drone provider, Agribotix,
has created FarmLens. The cloud-based solution provides extensive data to the farmer regard-
ing their crops. This product is part of a partnership with AgrAbility, enabling farmers with
disabilities to continue in their profession. See Figure 1-12 for temperature study data for an
environmental permitting process performed by drone and analyzed by Nero software.
Architecture and Construction
The construction sector is projected to be the largest commercial buyer of UAS, totaling $ 11.2

14 | Chapter 1: A View of the UAS Market
billion globally by 2021.30 Architects use drones for site scanning, feasibility studies, and pre-
senting the client with the first virtual images of what the site will look like at completion. The
designers can use thermal imaging and multispectral cameras to provide critical data about
the land prior to building. Builders can use drones during the construction process to track
progress, monitor assets, and capture issues prior to inspection. Inspectors are able to use
drones to monitor for compliance to building regulations. After the construction is complete,
the collection of drone data can be used in selling the property. Currently, real estate agents
are using drones to enhance their business by providing aerial views of property for their con-
sumers.

   The global consumer market for drones continues to grow. Since the development of the DJI
   drone in by Frank Wang 2006, as part of his graduate thesis, the company holds 70% of the
   consumer marketplace. (Gan, 2018) See Figure 1-13. In 2017, DJI had $2.7 billion in sales com-
   prised of 30% of its revenues from China, the US, and Europe, respectively, and 10% from South
   America.31 Their manufacturing capabilities, infrastructure, and logistics is the key to China
   remaining a market leader in the consumer space. The U.S. has outsourced much of their man-
   ufacturing, therefore weakening their ability to produce and get to market in a timely manner.
   Additional, China has a large test market, supporting infrastructure, and consumer support.
   The U.S. continues to find it difficult to keep up in all areas.

   The U.S. consumer uses the drone primarily for photography and film. There are a number of
   drone hobbyists as well. Overall the impact to consumer grow has been stifled in the U.S. for
   same reasons as commercial market. The increasing regulations on UAS, across all sizes, has
   changed the consumer market in the U.S. The FAA has implemented the same risk assessments
   across all drones, limiting the marketplace. A consumer drone can be treated the same as an
   emergency services drone.
   The inability to change the process to recognize distinct UAS markets in the U.S. will continue

31. (Gan, 2018)

     16 | Chapter 1: A View of the UAS Market
to have dramatic impact. The marketplace for UAS is as wide as the imagination, however
the U.S. barriers of regulation, infrastructure, and technology advancements will place them
behind less developed countries.

Discussion Questions

  1. What are the impacts to the U.S. if the country is unable to keep up with the growth of
      UAS?

 2. How can security be included in the development of a product without having an impact
      in the race to market?

 3. What do you think about the security legacy issues for UAS components? How could It be
      improved by building in security up-front AND controlling the manufacturing supply
      chain? See: Dr Julie J.C.H. Ryan's PDF class handout on "An Exploration of Information
      Security Aspects Julie J.C.H. Ryan" [Also available by contacting Professor Nichols at KSU.]

Chapter 2: UAS Law - Legislation,
Regulation, and Adjudication

Student Learning Objectives - A set of considerations relating to the history, methods and
objectives of regulating Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Since the skies are already crowded,
drones adds complexity to the environment. Skies crowded with manned and unmanned air-
craft require regulations to ensure safe operation in a controlled environment. Much like the
rules of the road, airspace travel needs some degree of uniform operations of aircraft, respon-
sibility, and consequences for violating them. The history of regulation for automobiles, trains,
and other modes of travel provide over 150 years of historical data from which to learn. Stu-
dents will be introduced to the general principals of legislative, regulatory, judicial processes,
and their impact on UAS operation.
Law & Technology - The Tortoise and the Hare
In the Hare & the Tortoise, the Greek Fabulist Aesop wrote about the interplay between speed
and measured deliberate progress. As the fable goes the Hare teased the Tortoise for being
slow and not making progress to which the Tortoise challenged the Hare to a race to prove that
in fact his progress would be much faster than the hare believed. The Hare accepted the chal-
lenge. They agreed that the Fox would set the distance and act as judge. As the race started the
Hare sped out of sight, while the Tortoise slowly but surely ambled down the road. Given his
large lead the Hare decided to take a roadside nap to mock the Tortoise. When the Hare awoke
the Tortoise had slowly but surely passed the sleeping Hare and was nearing the finish line. The
Hare attempted to use his great speed to catch the Tortoise, but it was too late. The Tortoise
won the race. Aesop's moral was, "the race is not always to the swift" (Schlichting, 1993).

The relationship between technology and the law is complex and does not always result in out-
comes satisfactory to parties on either side of the issue. Students should keep this inherent
compromise in mind as we examine the interplay between the law and UAS technology. We will
focus upon the relationship between US legal system and technology. This is not to say that
other nation's legal systems are less sophisticated than the American system. Rather, it is in
recognition of the vast amount of information to be examined and the relatively short judicial
history of 250 years m XXX takes it easier study.
Transportation in the United States - Lessons from the Past Help Guide the Future
In the early 1900's the automobile went from an extravagant acquisition of the elite to a mass
produced stable in a relatively brief period. In 1908 Henry Ford began selling the Model-T.
The initial cost of the vehicle was $825 and approximately 10,000 vehicles were sold. In 1913
Henry Ford introduced the motorized assembly line method of mass manufacturing reducing
the Model-T chassis manufacturing time from 12.5 hours to 1.5 hours and the cost of the vehi-
cle to $575 (Ford Motor Company, 2018). Within sixteen years Ford had sold over ten million
Model-T automobiles (The Saylor Foundation, 2008). At the same time other companies such
as General Motors were also producing millions of automobiles annually (Figure 2-2).
With millions of new automobiles came new challenges. Roads needed to be financed and built.
Auto operation needed to be regulated to ensure public safety and operation predictability.
Coded laws were required to ensure that liability could be addressed through the legal process.

                                                                                  R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 21
Unregulated motor vehicle operation in the late 19th and early 20th century could, and in fact
did, result in traffic anarchy. In 1917 alone, the city of Detroit, Michigan, with approximately
65,000 autos on the road, had 7,171 accidents and 168 fatalities (Loomis, 2015).

       Motor Company

Mass production of the automobile created substantial problems for the government. How
could a safe and effective system of roadways and rules be developed without impeding the
evolution of automobiles?
This was the challenge of the day and in the first two decades of the 1900's large cities strug-
gled to design infrastructure and regulate motor vehicle operation to stem the tide of mass
carnage. Traffic fatalities increased by 3,000 percent between 1901 and 1923.
In fact, many cities were so devastated by the substantial number of children and adults killed,
they erected monuments to the fallen (Norton, 2008). Figure 2-3

  Unlike the introduction of the railroads in in the 1800's, automobiles presented a greater chal-
  lenge. Trains and trolleys were limited to travelling on rails, which made the design of infra-
  structure and regulation of operation less challenging1 By 1920 it was clear that affordable
  automobiles were the conveyance of the future. People were migrating away from the mass
  transit staples of trains, busses and trolleys, and opting instead for personalized on-demand,
  motorized transportation.
  The concept of regulating innovative technology requires a deep understanding as well as
  recognition of how overzealous regulation can stifle innovation. There is a delicate balance
  that must be struck depending upon circumstances. Imposing too much regulation can chill
  innovation, yet too little can lead to harm. For example, a regulator may define "success" as

1. This is not to say that the introduction of rail transport in was safe by any means. Pedestrians, other
  trains, animal drawn carriages and animals themselves were killed in large numbers due to being run over
  by a train.

                                                                                     R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 23
avoidance of a catastrophe. This is known as the "precautionary principle" of regulation, while
an entrepreneur would likely view it as the least favorable outcome of regulation and one that
makes it very difficult to innovate (Fenwick, 2017).
Regulation of the Automobile
As early as 1906 it was clear that the evolution from horse drawn carts to automobiles required
rules to protect the public and create an ordered traffic system. In 1906 Xenophon Huddy,
a New York lawyer wrote the first known law legal treatise on regulation of the automobile.
Huddy wrote of the need to embrace the modern technology, but also warned that rules of
manufacture, operation, vehicle safety and ownership would be needed to protect the public.
(Huddy, 1906)
The first codified embodiment of automobile and driving laws were adopted by New York City
in 1906. They were called the "Rules for Driving," drafted by aristocrat William Phelps Eno
and started to regulate operation on automobiles by focusing on speed, turns, and yielding to
pedestrians and emergency vehicles. Eno viewed these rules to, "substitute order for where
chaos now reigns almost supreme" and believed the most logical way to enforce these rules
was through the already existing police agencies (Norton, 2008).
Slowly nations, states, and local governments began to adopt their own laws and regulations, as
well as design and safety principles for the creation and expansion of the highway network. By
the 1920s most cities and states had enacted regulations sufficient to ameliorate the carnage
of 1900-1915.

The Next Transportation Challenge - Aviation
Commercial aviation followed closely on the heels of automobiles in the first two decades of
the Twentieth Century (Figure 2-4)
The National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) was created by Congress and the bill
signed by President Woodrow Wilson. The NACA created rules to establish order and safety in
aviation (Marshall, 2012)

       that keep air travel routine today. https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/g73/12-airplane-
       crashes-that-changed-aviation/

The advent of jet propulsion made trans-continental and trans-oceanic passenger travel a real-
ity. The age of "jet setting," as it was known in the 1960's, led to a massive increase in air traffic,
(Figure 2-5) which in turn heightened the need for regulations and oversight. Due in part to a
tragic midair collision in the Grand Canyon, 1958 President Dwight Eisenhower signed legisla-
tion establishing what is still known today as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 25
Concurrently, other nations were also enacting aviation regulations to maintain order and
safety in the skies. Rules for safe air transit of passengers and cargo had to be balanced with
increasing crowding, from simultaneous increases of military and private aviation. Great Britain
enacted the Aerial Navigation Act of 1911, with oversight vested in the Board of Trade. However,
with the outbreak of World War I in 1913, that responsibility was transferred to the Secretary
of State for War. After the Armistice ending WWI the Department of Civil Aviation was created
(Chaplain, 2011).

Since aviation provided the ability to travel great distances rapidly, with few physical restric-
tions or borders, the next logical step was global aviation regulation and air traffic control.
The treaty of Versailles in 1919 addressed the issue by creating the Convention for the Regula-
tion of Aerial Navigation, establishing global standards and rules for aviation over and between
nations. The convention specifically provided, "every aircraft of a contracting State has the
right to cross the air space of another State without landing. In this case it shall follow the route
fixed by the State over which the flight takes place. However. For reasons of general security,
it will be obliged to land if ordered to do so by means of the signals provided" (Treaty of Ver-
sailles, 1919).

The Convention was the first attempt to balance competing interests related to global navi-
gation, the need for free airspace transit over a nation, to assist commercial aviation develop,
with increased risk of attack by a non-military aircraft.

Even though World War II erupted less than two decades later, the need for civil aviation uni-
formity, predictability, and safety was still paramount in the minds of many. In to achieve this
goal, near the end of WWI a convention was held in Chicago called the International Civil Avia-
tion Conference, which resulted in the creation of the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO), with fifty-two nations being initial members. The ICAO promulgated rules that apply to
global civil aviation in international airspace defined as, "more than 12 miles from the sovereign
territory of a country as well as some domestic airspace by virtue of incorporation into a con-
tracting state own regulatory scheme" (Franzese, 2009).

Though each member nation established its own aviation regulatory body and laws, the provi-
sions of the ICAO were meant to create an acceptable level of uniformity and airspace access,
while permitting the growth of commercial air travel. But, aircraft and crews from distant
regions had to be able to effectively operate and communicate with air traffic control across
the globe. Additionally, global aircraft registration, pilot licensing, and safety still needed to be
developed.

The first and most pressing issue relating to civil aviation globally was to develop a uniform lan-
guage requirement so that aircrews could communicate effectively with air traffic and ground
controllers no matter their native language. Without language standards, neither pilots nor air
traffic controllers who did not speak the same language would be able to communicate. The

26 | Chapter 2: UAS Law - Legislation, Regulation, and Adjudication
lack of a uniformity in aviation communication, coupled with the exponential growth in civilian
air travel, would result in greater risk of collisions, crashes, and other tragedies. Recognizing
this issue, the ICAO in1951 adopted an international requirement that air traffic controllers and
air crew must communicate in English to reduce the risk of incidents caused by an inability to
understand each other (MacKenzie, 2010).
With thousands of aircraft airborne at any given time, the chance of collisions is a constant,
especially in congested skies over major metropolitan areas. Couple that with time of day,
weather, terrain, and the risk of mid-air, or even ground collisions, increases exponentially.
Unfortunately, simply requiring air traffic controllers and air crew to speak English proved
insufficient, as it became clear that language proficiency would also be required. In 1977 it is
believed that the lack of language proficiency was a primary cause of the largest loss of life
in aviation history. Two 747 aircraft crashed on the runway in Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain,
resulting in 583 fatalities. (Figure 2-6)

Aviation Design and Manufacture Standards
Aviation safety must extend beyond the flight crew and ground control operations. The design
and manufacturing of aircraft also need regulatory oversight. As part of its mission the FAA was
empowered by Congress to establish standards for the design and manufacture of commer-
cial aircraft. For a commercial aircraft to enter service in the US, regardless of its origin, the
design and manufacture must receive prior approval from the FAA. Currently there is a five-

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 27
step process to receive approval from the FAA, starting with the original design of the aircraft,
leading all the way through to the issuance of an airworthiness certificate, to allow it to com-
mence passenger service (Federal Aviation Administration, 2009).

Development, design, and manufacture standards are a complex process which requires a great
deal of collaboration between the FAA, and stakeholders, other nations, the ICAO, and advisory
organizations. Three of the most prominent advisory organizations include the Radio Technical
Commission for Aeronautics (RCTA) the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the Ameri-
can Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) (Marshall, 2012).

Aircraft design and manufacturing standards are developed and regulated to guide the aircraft
manufacturers in building aircraft within or operating foreign manufactured aircraft within the
airspace of a country. Many nations have, by agreement, adopted the same or very similar com-
mercial aviation design and manufacturing standards to allow uniform standards compliance.
For example, an aircraft manufactured by Boeing in its North Charleston, South Carolina plant,
is inspected for compliance by the FAA. Due to international uniformity in standards enforced
by the FAA, they can certify compliance to the aviation authorities of other countries (Federal
Aviation Administration, 2016). (Figure 2-7)

Not only do design and manufacturing standards require compliance, they are also monitored
by the government authority throughout the manufacturing and flight testing process. Most, if
not all, western aircraft manufacturing facilities are manned by FAA officials or other authori-
ties, to ensure compliance with applicable standards.

Some of the areas in which design and manufacturing standards are established and enforced
are through collaboration between Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM's) and the various
stakeholders previously discussed.

  1. Aircraft design, structures, avionics.
 2. Electrical and mechanical systems.
 3. Power plants.
 4. Equipment.
 5. Engineering flight testing (Government of Canada, 2017).

Regulation is not only vital to safety in the design and manufacture of commercial aircraft, it
may be most important when it comes to oversight of commercial air carriers. Day to day oper-
ation, crew training, aircraft maintenance and overall operation safety are key components to
safety and reliable operation. The FAA has adopted what is known as the Safety Assurance Sys-
tem (SAS) to better manage the certification and operation surveillance or air carriers.
The objectives of the SAS is defined as:

  · Verify an applicant can operate safety (sic) and comply with regulations and standards
      before issuing a certificate and approving or accepting programs.

  · Conduct periodic reviews to verify that a certificate holder continues to meet regulatory
      requirements when the environment changes, and

  · Validate the performance of a certificate holder's approved and accepted programs for
      Continued Operational Safety (COS) (Federal Aviation Administration, 2018).

While all the regulatory considerations discussed are vital, it should not be assumed that the
regulators themselves do not require oversight. Towards this end the US Department of Trans-
portation, under whose aegis the FAA operates, has established an Office of Inspector General,
created by the Inspector General Act of 1978.
The Inspector General of each agency of the executive branch of the US government is charged
with the duties of protecting the interests of the public and taxpayers. They are supposed to be

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 29
  non-partisan ombudsmen who detect waste, fraud, and abuse in their respective agency. The
  Inspector General is the watchdog of the watchdog (Brian, 2010).

  The importance of the function of the Inspector General cannot be overstated. For example, in
  2017 the FAA Inspector General issued a report of its investigation into Edward Carl Hernandez,
  an FAA Designated Airworthiness Representative, charged with aircraft parts fraud. Hernan-
  dez pled guilty to falsifying his certification of airworthiness of a hydraulic adapter fitting that
  he had never accessed or inspected (Federal Aviation Administration, 2018). Other more wide-
  spread abuses have been uncovered through whistleblowers who report irregularities and ille-
  galities in the aviation industry. One such instance, which was particularly troubling, was the
  claim that Boeing was installing defectively manufactured airframe parts on 737 aircraft where
  it was also alleged that FAA inspectors conducted a less than thorough review and investiga-
  tion of the claims. This exact reason is why an independent overseer is needed to prevent too
  cozy a relationship between the regulators and the regulated (Graves, 2006).

  The Inspector General plays an integral role in maintaining transparency and trust in the FAA,
  through oversight and regulation of UAS. In 2012 the FAA Inspector General commenced an
  audit of the FAA's oversight of domestic UAS operation, citing its belief that over 10,000 active
  systems would be in operation by 2017 (Guzzetti, 2012). Keep this important function in mind in
  the discussion of UAS regulation and the stresses their popularity will place upon regulators.

  Regulated Activity Coexisting with Unregulated Activity

  There was no formal regulation of airspace in 1903 when the Wright Brothers first flew their
  aircraft in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Just as was the case with the introduction mass produc-
  tion of automobile, the number of aircraft and air traffic increased rapidly. As discussed earlier
  the beginnings of air regulation were related to the advent of the air mail operations. It was
  clear early on regulation would greatly enhance safety. Between 1922 and 1925 the fatality rate
  for the air mail service was one per 789,000 miles flown while the rate for fledgling, non-regu-
  lated commercial fliers was one per 13,500 miles flown (Messier, 2016).2

  The Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce began to establish pilot licensing and
  training as well aircraft design and manufacturing safety certification, which led to safer avia-
  tion. Regulation and oversight still needed to balance safety with commercial viability. From the
  Wright Brothers to Charles Lindbergh to Amelia Earhart the rich tradition of private aviation
  remains. Consequently, aviation regulation had to be able to accommodate less regulated pri-
  vate aviation operating within increasingly crowded skies, simultaneously with increased com-
  mercial and military aviation.

A tragic example of the danger occurred in September 1978, when Pacific Southwest Airlines
Flight 182, a Boeing 727 collided with a private Cessna 172 over San Diego, California. The acci-
dent resulted in the death of 144 people including nine people on the ground. Figure 2-8. The
investigation pointed to many failures, not the least of which were air traffic control proce-
dures relating to minimum safe separation between aircraft and the complexity of the interface
between private commercial aircraft (National Transportation Safety Board, 1979).
Regulating Unmanned Aerial Systems - Smaller Aircraft Larger Problems
In January 1982, the FAA introduced National Airspace System (NAS) Plan to help enhance avia-
tion safety domestically and to comply with aircraft classification systems created by the ICAO.

                                 Figure 2-8 Tragedy in Pacific South West, 1978

       Source: National Transportation Safety Board (1979). Aircraft Accident Report - Pacific Southwest
       Airlines Flight, 182. Washington, DC: National Transportation Safety Board.

Broadly speaking there are five general classes of controlled airspace in the NAS as defined by
the FAA they are (See Figure 2-9):

       1. "Class A Airspace - Generally that airspace from 18,000 feet MSL up to and including
       FL 600, including the airspace within twelve nautical miles of any coast of the forty-
       eight contiguous States and Alaska, and designated international airspace beyond
       twelve nautical miles of the coast of the forty-eight contiguous States and Alaska,
       within areas of domestic radio navigational signal or ATC radar coverage, and within
       which domestic procedures are applied.

                                                                                  R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 31
       Unless otherwise authorized, all persons must operate their aircraft under Instrument
       Flight Rules (IFR)." (FFA-PH, 2018)

       2. "Class B Airspace - Generally, that airspace from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL sur-
       rounding the nation's busiest airports in terms of IFR operations or passenger enplane-
       ments. The configuration of each Class B airspace area is customized and consists of
       a surface area and two or more layers (some Class B airspace areas resemble upside-
       down wedding cakes) and is designed to contain all published instrument procedures
       once an aircraft enters the airspace.

       An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in Class B Airspace, and all air-
       craft that so cleared receive separation services within the airspace. The cloud clear-
       ance requirement for VFR operations is "clear of clouds". Arriving or transiting aircraft
       must obtain an ATC clearance prior to entering Class B airspace on the appropriate fre-
       quency and relation to geographical fixes shown on local Class B aeronautical charts.
       Departing aircraft require a clearance to depart Class B airspace and should advise
       clearance delivery of their intended altitude and route of flight.

       Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, aircraft must be equipped with an operable
       two-way radio capable of communicating with ATC on appropriate frequencies for
       that Class B airspace. Also, unless otherwise authorized by ATC, the aircraft must be
       equipped with an operable radar beacon transponder with automatic altitude reporting
       equipment.

       There are currently twelve airports with Class B airspace where the pilot must hold
       at least a private pilot certificate to take off and land. At other Class B airports, a
       student pilot or recreational pilot who seeks certification may take off and land if cer-
       tain requirements are met. The student or recreational pilot must receive ground and
       flight instruction from an authorized instructor and receive an endorsement from that
       instructor stating the student or recreational pilot is proficient to conduct solo opera-
       tions at the specific Class B airport & airspace.

       Mode C Veil A Mode C transponder with altitude reporting is required within thirty
       nautical miles of a Class B airport from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL. An aircraft that
       was not originally certificated with engine driven electrical system or which has not

       Mode C veil provide the aircraft remains outside Class A, B, or C airspace, and below
       the altitude of the ceiling of a Class B or Class C airspace area designated for an airport
       or 10,000 feet MSL, whichever is lower." (FFA-PH, 2018)

3. "Class C Airspace - Class C Airspace is generally defined as from the surface to 4,000
feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have
an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have a cer-
tain number of IFR operations or passenger enplanements. Although the configuration
of each Class C airspace area is individually tailored, the airspace usually consists of a 5
NM radius core surface area that extends from the surface up to 4,000 feet above the
airport elevation, and a ten NM radius shelf area that extends no lower than 1,200 feet
up to 4,000 feet above airport elevation.

No specific pilot certification is required to operate in Class C airspace. A two-way
radio and unless otherwise authorized by ATC an operable radar beacon transponder
with automatic altitude reporting equipment is required.

Two-way radio communication must be established with the ATC facility prior to entry
and thereafter maintain those communications while in Class C airspace. Pilots of arriv-
ing aircraft should contact the Class C airspace ATC facility on the publicized frequency
and give their position, altitude, radar beacon code destination, and request Class C
service.

Radio contact should be initiated far enough in advance from the Class C airspace
boundary to preclude entering Class C airspace prior to establishing two-way radio
communications. If the controller responds to a radio call with, "aircraft call sign,
standby" radio communications have been established and the pilot can enter the Class
C airspace.

If conditions prevent immediate provision of Class C services, the controller will inform
the pilot to remain outside the Class C airspace until conditions permit the services to
be provided.

It is important to understand that if the controller responds to the initial radio call
without using the aircraft call, radio communications have not been established and the
pilot may not enter the Class C airspace." (FFA-PH, 2018)

4. "Class D Airspace - is generally that airspace from the surface to 2,500 above the
airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational
control tower. The configuration of each Class D airspace area is tailored and when
instrument procedures are published, the airspace will normally be designated to con-
tain the procedures.

                                                                      R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 33
       No specific pilot certification is required. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, an oper-
       able two-way radio is required.

       Two-way radio communication must be established and maintained with the ATC facil-
       ity providing ATC services prior to entry while in Class D airspace. Pilots of arriving
       aircraft should contact the control tower on the publicized frequency, giving their posi-
       tion, altitude, destination, and any request(s). Radio contact should be initiated and
       established far enough in advance to preclude entering the Class D airspace boundary
       without it.

       If the controller responds to a radio call with, "aircraft call sign, standby," radio commu-
       nications have been established and the pilot can enter the Class D airspace. If condi-
       tions prevent immediate entry into Class D airspace, the controller will inform the pilot
       to remain outside the Class D airspace until conditions permit entry." (FFA-PH, 2018)

       5. "Class E Airspace - Generally, if the airspace is not Class A, B, C, or D, and is
       controlled airspace it is Class E airspace. There are no specific pilot certification or
       equipment requirements to operate in Class E airspace. Special VFR operations are per-
       mitted, but clearance must be obtained from the controlling facility." (FFA-PH, 2018)

       6. "Class G Airspace - is the portion of the airspace that has not been designated as
       Class A, B, C, D, or E. It is therefore designated uncontrolled airspace. Class G airspace
       extends from the surface to the base of the overlying Class E airspace." (Federal Aviation
       Administration, 2016). (FFA-PH, 2018)

       Routine access by UAS to the NAS is highly favored by the many stakeholders who
       design, manufacture and operate. Estimates of 200,000 hours of domestic UAS oper-
       ation in 2012 were projected to increase well beyond one million hours by 2020 UAS
       (Marshall, 2012).

       UAS will need to be capable of interacting with ATC systems and commands to operate
       at all levels of airspace simultaneously with manned aircraft. (Marshall, 2012)

For example, long endurance high altitude UAS are currently capable of operating in all classes
of airspace up, and including Class A. Having UAV's travelling at speed approaching the speed
of sound in the same airspace as commercial and military jetliners presents numerous safety
concerns. Imagine a Global Hawk UAV operating in Class A airspace losing ability to communi-
cate with its ground station and pilot. The risk of collision with commercial aircraft presents a
challenge to regulators which, if not successfully addressed, could lead to catastrophic conse-
quences. Alternatively, a civilian operator of a small UAV in Class G Airspace without mandated
ATC communication presents far less, but still import risk, to the safety of the NAS.
Regulating UAS Operation in the NAS
UAS operations present a different challenge, since there may or may not be a ground-based
pilot operating the vehicle at any point in the flight. Even with ground-based control there is
no pilot onboard to report, communicate, and execute commands. The easiest and safest way
to regulate UAS operation in NAS would be to ban the practice. Although effective, it is not a

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 35
practical solution, since it would stifle technology and allow other UAS "friendly" nations an
economic and military advantage.

Since the Department of Defense (DoD) was the primary operator of UAS in the NAS in the late
20th century its collaboration with the FAA in the development of approval criteria for Cer-
tificates of Authorization (COA) was logical. As the FAA was established to oversee the oper-
ation of manned aircraft in controlled airspace the advent of UAS presented new challenges.
First and foremost, the ATC system relies upon communication between air crew and ground
controllers. As technology such as radar, anti-collision, and ground proximity warning systems
were introduced, the safety and reliability of aviation increased. Much of the innovation was
designed at increasing pilot and controller information and communication.

The result was the issuance of FAA and DoD joint order 7610.4, special military operations in
2001. Once issued pursuant to FAA Order 7210.3, the COA or waiver would permit an operator
of a UAV in the NAS outside restricted or warning areas (Marshall, 2012).

For the DoD to receive a COA or waiver for UAS operation in NAS it had to supply the following
data and information:

  1. Detailed description of the intended flight operation, including the classification of air-
      space to be used,

 2. UAS physical characteristics (configuration, length, wingspan, gross weight, means of
      propulsion, fuel capacity, color, lighting, etc.),

 3. Flight performance characteristics (top speed, cruise speed, maximum altitude, rate of
      climb, range/endurance, means of recovery etc.),

 4. Method of pilotage and proposed method to avoid other traffic,
 5. Coordination procedures,
 6. Communication procedures,
  7. Route and altitude procedures,
 8. Lost link/ mission abort procedures, and
 9. A statement by DoD proponent that the unmanned aircraft is airworthy.

The issuance of a COA or waiver was an effective way of ensuring ATC and other aviation oper-
ators had prior notice of the nature and extent of a UAS operations in the NAS a system had to
be created to effectively apply and disseminate COA's or waivers once approved.

Under the provisions of joint order 7610.4 the FAA, in conjunction with the military, were able
to study the safety, reliability and efficacy of operating UAS in the National Airspace System, so
that by 2005 the FAA issued Interim Operational Approval Guidance for UAS entitled AFS 400
(Federal Aviation Administration, 2005).

Civilian UAS Operations - Striking Legislative Balance

36 | Chapter 2: UAS Law - Legislation, Regulation, and Adjudication
While FAA recognized the development of civilian UAS in the NAS, it still required civilian oper-
ators to follow the existing airworthiness certification process. In 2006 it took the additional
step of creating the Unmanned Aircraft Program Office (UAPO) in 2006.
In 2007 the UAPO created an online COA application for public operators; police, fire, meteo-
rological, etc. The old process was manual. The system is automated, thereby allowing swifter
approval. Networked transmission of COA issuance to required stakeholders to further study
UAS operations.

With increased reports of near-misses between UAV's and commercial aviation as the size,
speed and number of UAV's increases in the NAS, so does the likelihood of a catastrophic acci-
dent. Since such an occurrence could be devastating; caution must be emphasized when regu-
lating their expanded presence in all classes of airspace. Figure 9 details the damage potential
even when a small UAV collides with a commercial jetliner. In this situation, a LAM Mozam-
bique on January 5th, 2017 flight TM 1715, a Boeing 737 with eighty-six passengers and crew
onboard was approaching Tete airport in northwestern Mozambique. Crew members and pas-
senger reported a "bang" that was believed to be a bird strike. Upon examination after the air-
craft had landed, the authorities inspected the damage and determined that the jet had collided
with a drone, as there was no organic residue present at or near the damaged. Figure 2-11.
Although disaster was averted this incident calls needed attention to the risk of cohabitated
airspace. This risk is heightened with a small UAV with a small radar signature. From the per-
spective of a regulatory body the natural inclination is to heavily regulate private UAV opera-
tion, possibly to the extent of retarding development. Perhaps regulating body should consider
a balanced and proportional legislative response to risk.
UAS and Constitutional Rights
Some believe that when seeking legislative balance, given the risk for catastrophic conse-
quences, should tip in favor of more comprehensive regulation. Some believe that civilian oper-
ation of UAS at altitudes under 200 feet is best left to the state or local government where the
flight is taking place.

Representative Jason Hill introduced the Drone Innovation Act (H.R. 2930) in 2017, which pro-
vides for new a new designation of "local airspace," defined as under 200 feet in altitude.
Some of the highlights of Drone Innovation Act include:

  1. Standardize reasonable time, manner, and place limitations and restrictions across the
      nation.

 2. Aid states in adopting Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) and making limitations pub-
      licly available to all users.

 3. Create an environment that is friendly to innovation and fosters rapid integration of UAS.
 4. Prevents the FAA from authorizing the operation of an unmanned aircraft in local air-

      space above a property without permission of the owner.
 5. Preserves State and Federal statutes and common law rights
 6. Restricts the Secretary from impeding State and local government authority to define

      local property rights as they apply to UAS
  7. Ensures UAS can reach navigable airspace.
 8. Provides for the use of UAS on your property or right of way (Drone Innovation Act , 2017)

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 39
HR 2930 addresses several constitutional principles ordinarily not associated with UAS manu-
facturing, operation, regulation, and responsibility. First and foremost are provisions of the U.S.
Constitution and Bill of Rights. How does a document ratified in 1789 apply to UAS legislation
and regulation? Here is an example:
Scenario 1: Farmer 1 in Iowa wants to use a UAV to inspect his crops for infestation, hydration,
and monitor growth. Neighboring farmers use bi-planes to spray insect repellant on their
crops. Suppose that FAA regulations prohibit a private citizen from operating an UAS within
500 feet of another property where commercial or private fixed wing aviation occurs more
than once every thirty days? See: Figure 2-12 and Figure 2-13
The Fifth Amendment of US Constitution provides in the portion applicable to this scenario
that "No person shall...nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;
nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." (United States
of America, 1791).
The Fourteenth Amendment specifically applies the protections of the Fifth Amendment
through what is known as the "equal protection clause" which extends these protections to cit-
izens of individual states.

Some of the issues raised:
  · By enacting this regulation has the FAA deprived farmer 1 of the right to maintain their
      private property as they see fit?
  · Does this prohibition deprive farmer 1 of the liberty in that the UAS flight at low levels will
      be conducted solely upon farmer 1's property?
  · Does Farmer 1 have any ability to appeal this regulation or have it modified so that they
      can use UAS on their farm thereby depriving them of due process of law?

                                                                                  R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 41
  · Do the protections afforded farmer 2 in prohibiting farmer 1 from UAS operation deprive
      her of equal protection" under the law? Since it puts farmer 1 at a competitive disadvan-
      tage to farmer 2, simply because they each chose to employ different technology?

       Source: Hammond, K. (October 1997). Crop duster.

  · Can farmer 1 bring an action against the FAA? In which court? The Federal Court for the
      District of Iowa would have jurisdiction (officially conferred power to render decisions
      and judgment involving the subject of the case) because the claim presents what is known
      as "federal question" jurisdiction. It could also be brought in an Iowa State Court, since
      the dispute arises in Iowa where the State Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the
      Federal Court.

  · Should farmer 2 be named as a defendant, since they will be adversely affected should
      farmer 1 win?

  · If the FAA regulation is a violation of the constitutional rights of farmer 1, what is the
      remedy? Can the court award farmer 1 monetary compensatory damages (an order
      declaring that the FAA law is either unconstitutional as written or as applied to Farmer 1)?
      If so, how much?

Now let us address some of the legal implications which can result from the operations of a
UAS.

Scenario 2: Homeowner 1 lives at 1814 Todd Road in Manhattan, Kansas. Homeowner 2 lives
next door at 1812 Todd Road and has a "no trespassing" sign posted. Homeowner 1 is a customer
of Amazon and has signed up for its Prime-air service. (Figure 2-14 Scenario 2)

       figure, Scenario 2, partial. https://24tv.ua/amazon_tag1532/

Homeowner 1 orders peanuts from Amazon, with thirty-minute prime-air home delivery. While
calculating the UAV route the operator studies ground and aerial images and discovers trees
that might inhibit delivery. The pilot creates a course between the trees on Todd Road and the
home of Homeowner 1. The UAV travels over the front porch of homeowner 2 (Figure 13).
The Amazon UAV arrives to make the delivery to 1814 Todd Road. Due to an unforeseen soft-
ware glitch in the GPS when the number 4 appears in an address after the number 1 it treats it
as the number 2. The UAV delivers its payload to 1812 Todd Road, the residence of homeowner
2.
Homeowner 2 has a relative looking to relocate, due to a serious and life-threatening allergy to
peanuts. This person forgot to pack their Epi-pen, which could prevent them from going into
anaphylactic shock from a severe allergic reaction. As fate would have it no one else is home
when the UAV delivers its payload. Having never witnessed this modern technology the rela-
tive wanders outside and picks up the package. Unfortunately, Amazon package has left peanut
residue all over the box.
The relative of homeowner 2 immediately has a serious allergic reaction. Without his Epi-pen,
they succumb a blockage of their airway.

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 43
  Some of the Legal Issues Raised:

     · Did the Amazon UAV trespass on the property by landing, albeit unknowingly, violate
        Kansas Statutes Annotated (KSA) 21-3721, criminal trespass, or commit the tort of tres-
        pass?34

     · Was homeowner 1 contributorily negligent in signing up for Amazon prime-air delivery
        when a reasonable person might foresee the delivery landing at his neighbor's home,
        which had a posted no-trespassing sign?

     · Did the events which occurred because of the Amazon UAV pilot deciding to travel via the
        air space of homeowner 2 amount to a violation of the COA or other certification?

     · Did the flight through over homeowner 2's home constitute the crime of criminal tres-
        pass as defined in KSA 21-3721?

     · Could Amazon argue that it was unaware of the requirements of KSA-3721 when it sells
        signs on its marketplace specifically advising of the statute? (Figure 14)

     · Was Amazon criminally responsible and/or civilly liable for the death of homeowner 2's
        relative, since it was reasonably foreseeable that the UAV might mistakenly deliver
        peanuts, which are widely known to cause serious allergic reactions in many, to the
        wrong address?

     · Do the "Terms of Service" agreed to homeowner 1 and Amazon have any effect against
        legal or criminal claims brought by homeowner 2, the relative, or the survivors?

3. A tort is an act or omission that gives rise to injury or harm to another and amounts to a civil wrong for
   which courts impose liability.

4. It is illegal to enter or remain on any land, non-navigable body of water, structure, vehicle, aircraft or
   watercraft, or nuclear or healthcare facility without the owner or other authorized person's consent,
   according to Kansas Statute 21-3721. It's considered trespassing if there are signs or postings, or if there
   are fences, locks or other means of enclosed, shut or secured passages of entry. Criminal trespassing in
   Kansas is a Class B nonperson misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of no less than 48 consecutive hours
   of imprisonment and up to six months in jail.

  · Should the FAA investigate through the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)? If
      violations of laws or customs by Amazon and parties institute proceedings to revoke some
      or all their COA's or permits?

Common Law Fills the Technology Gap
Consider the many other legal ramifications and consequences in both scenarios. Is it possible
to legislate and foresee every possible contingency or event that may cause harm from the
operation of a UAS? Certainly not, so how can a broad range of possible accidents or intentional
acts be causing harm to be addressed? Common Law. "Common law is the system of deciding
cases that originated in England and which was later adopted in the U.S. Common law is based
on precedent (legal principles developed in earlier case law) instead of statutory laws. It is the
traditional law of an area or region created by judges when deciding individual disputes or
cases. Common law changes over time" (U.S. Legal, Inc., 1997)
The concept of common law is especially useful when dealing with new and rapidly changing
technology. Broadly applicable common law theories such as the theory of negligence is a per-
fect example of how the common law can bridge the gap. Just as in Aesop's fable of the tortoise
and the hare, the concept of common law finds its adaptability to changing times and technol-
ogy in the slow and steady way it has developed.

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 45
While the courtrooms of England of the 1600 & 1700's were not the place where UAV litigation
occurred, cases were being heard regarding safe design, manufacture, and operation of mod-
ern technology of the times. For example, common law established the same principles of neg-
ligence discussed in scenario 2 above. In the English Court of Common Pleas in the mid-1700's
"common carriers" such as horse drawn coaches and ships were could be held liable under the
theory of negligence for injuries caused by their activity. If the claimant could prove the carrier
was negligent in their transport they would be held financially responsible for damages sus-
tained (Kaczorowski, 1990). History contains many common themes that should be examined
before new legislation is enacted. When it comes to the creation of laws to address modern
technology, the adage "everything old is new again" takes on new meaning.

UAS Manufacturing and Design Standards

As discussed in relation automobiles and manned aircraft codes are essential tools in ensuring
the UAS produced and operating in the NAS have certain essential technologies and capabilities
which render them airworthy and capable of safely co-exist in public airspace. Just as Huddy
consulted many stakeholders ranging from automobile engineers, designers and manufactur-
ers to police, accident victims, and medical professionals for his book Rules of Driving, leg-
islators, regulators and jurists should consult informed stakeholders in the UAS regulatory
process. Groups ranging from educators to pilots to the ASTM should be the source of deter-
mining what areas relating to UAS require regulation.

Regarding design and manufacturing standards, enough time has passed that a large popula-
tion of individuals and groups can consult with the FAA in their promulgation. For example, an
engineer may suggest that what a standard for UAS anti-collision lights adequate to avoid col-
lisions while a regulator may suggest mandating more, such as onboard radar. While onboard
radar for all classes of UAS may make sense as a utopian concept, the cost, weight and size of
the technology may make engineering an affordable solution out of reach for all but commer-
cial operators. Yes, it would certainly effective but could never justify such a farfetched notion.
Such is overzealous caution in the regulation process. Perhaps Larry Downes of the George-
town Center for Business and Public Policy put it best when he observed:

"That solution -- to stay the course, to continue leaving tech largely to its own correctives -- is
cold comfort to those who believe tomorrow's problems, coming up fast in the rear-view mir-
ror, are both unprecedented and catastrophic. Yet, so far there's no evidence supporting shrill
predictions of a technology-driven apocalypse. Or that existing safeguards -- both market and
legal -- won't save us from our worst selves. Nor have tech's growing list of critics proposed
anything more specific than simply calling for "regulation" to save us. Perhaps that's because
effective remedies are incredibly hard to design" (Downes, 2014).

Conclusions

46 | Chapter 2: UAS Law - Legislation, Regulation, and Adjudication
As was the case with the automobile, airplane, personal computer and so much other innova-
tive technology, there will always be much fear caused by speculation and fear of the unknown.
Just ten or twenty years ago most people would never dream of, much less trust the idea of
doing their banking online, having their doctor keep their medical records electronically or
using a mobile phone to unlock the front door to their home. Concepts which were once con-
sidered futuristic, science fiction seem to be becoming reality with greater speed than ever.
Still it is prudent to proceed with caution in areas of unknown technology because there may
be hidden, or unknown risks associated with the adoption or use of the technology on a large
scale.

A perfect example occurred not too many decades ago in Pennsylvania. The Three Mile Island
nuclear power plant experienced what was called a "partial meltdown" on March 29, 1979 which
caused the release of radiation into the surrounding area. (Figure 2-16) While ultimately the
amount of radiation released was considered minimal by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
a long hard look at nuclear energy was undertaken and new, far more stringent design, manu-
facturing and operational standards were adopted (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion, 2018). The result of the regulations were in some ways beneficial and in some way not. As
an immediate matter the use and popularity of nuclear power in the United States became sig-
nificantly diminished. This was also fueled by the more devastating and significant meltdown
which occurred in 1986 in the then Soviet Union city of Chernobyl. Eventually nuclear power
plants were re-engineered and designed with the lessons learned from these accidents in mind
to create a safer way of harnessing nuclear energy to produce electricity.

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 47
The same lessons learned through aviation accidents and the tragic loss of life have resulted
common sense regulations, based upon knowledge acquired from these painful events which
have led to the safest period of commercial passenger aviation in history.

The challenge for the students of today who may be the legislators, regulators and adjudicators
of UAS law in the future is to strike a balance between enough regulations to ensure public
safety without overregulation. Too little oversight and safety may fall victim to profit and mar-
ket competition, too much and safety can also be negatively impacted by inhibiting the devel-
opment of innovative technologies which may enhance the safety of UAS in the future. This
paradigm has been a truism throughout the industrial revolution right through today and it is
a safe assumption that the future will yield comparable results.

Discussion Questions

1. At what altitude over private property, if any should the owner have right to privacy that
allows them to request the UAV depart or be held liable for trespass? Would your answer be
different if the UAV were equipped with highly sensitive audio and visual recording technology
or wireless data interception technology?

2. Should Federal, State or Local governments mandate that all non-military UAS operators
be required to carry liability insurance for damage or injury caused (including invasion of pri-
vacy) prior to allowing any UAS to be purchased or operated by any civilian or private entity?
If so should the liability insurance requirements vary depending upon the class of UAS and its
potential of causing damage or injury?

3. Law enforcement is called by a homeowner who says that a drone crash landed in his back-
yard, there has been no contact from anyone claiming to own the UAV nor did the homeowner
see any anyone in proximity to their property appearing to operate or control it. Further the
homeowner says there is a box below the drone which appears to be its payload leaking some
sort of bubbling liquid. How should the homeowner be advised? Should law enforcement treat
the UAV as an unidentified suspicious package presenting a Hazmat or other safety threat?

4. The local army navy store has a sale on used surplus military equipment. Upon visiting the
store, you recognize one of the items as a case of Perdix miniature military drones capable of
performing swarm attacks on designated targets. Based upon your knowledge of the technol-
ogy you understand the lethality of the threat they pose. What if any legal obligation do you
have to inform the store owner of the fact the items pose a danger? Suppose the store owner
dismisses your concern and says he is going to sell them anyway. Do you have an obligation to
report him to the police or other governmental authority? Should you decide not to do so, and
the drones are eventually used to attack a school and students are injured or killed. Are you
criminally liable? Should there be inventory control and disposal laws which prohibit the sale
of surplus UAS technology, even if modified for civilian use, to the public?

and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS:

Components, Autonomy v Automation,

Sensors, SAA, SCADA and Cyber Attack

Taxonomy

Student Learning Objectives

An introduction to the Problem of countering hostile use of UAS against U.S. national defense
interests will be introduced. The student will be able to identify critical components of an
Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), identify potential cyber vulnerabilities and understand the
taxonomy of UAS operations that may be compromised against USA interests. FAA rules and
US laws lag the UAS technology growth. In this chapter, UAS critical components, sensors, and
levels of self-reliance are identified. These components are viewed in terms of Sense and Avoid
(SAA) and SCADA environments. These components are then incorporated -into the Cyber -
Attack Taxonomy. (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

What Is The Counter -UAS Problem?

The risk of successful terrorist attacks on USA Air Defense Systems (ADS) via UASs is greater
because of improving commercial capabilities and accessibility. Advanced small drones, capa-
ble of carrying sophisticated imaging equipment and significant payloads, are readily available
to the public. A range of terrorist, insurgent, criminal, corporate, and activist threat groups
have demonstrated their ability to use civilian drones and gather intelligence. How does the
country defend against a growing UAS threat? This is also known as the counter - UAS Problem.
General James D Mattis, SECDEF summed up the Problem succinctly:

       "Unmanned Aircraft are being developed with more technologically systems and capa-
       bilities. They can duplicate some of the capabilities of manned aircraft for both surveil-
       lance/ reconnaissance and attack missions. They can be small enough and / or slow
       enough to elude detection by standard early warning sensor systems and could pose a
       formidable threat to friendly forces." (Chairman, 2012)

Operational Protection from Hostile UAS Attacks - A Helicopter View

"According to LCDR Boutros of the Navy War College, developing technologies do not paint
a pleasant picture of counter - UAS problem (Boutros, Operational Protection 2015). UAS has
seen a widespread proliferation among both state and non-state actors. This is a cause for con-
cern to US Operational Commanders." (Boutros, 2015) General James D Mattis, SECDEF con-
cluded:

       "The proliferation of low cost, tactical unmanned aerial systems demand we think about
       this potential threat now... we must understand the threat these systems present to our
       joint force and develop the tactics, techniques and procedures to counter the problem."
       (Chairman, 2012) (Myer, 2013)

It can be argued from the quantity and diversity of production that China is the current leader
in this technology. China is thoroughly exercising its UAS muscles in the Spratly Islands.

Over 90 countries and non-state actors have UAS technology. Many of these actors foster ter-
rorism. "Most of the UAS systems, except for China, Russia, USA, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and
Iran inventories are low-technology, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) plat-
forms." (Boutros, 2015) Experts believe that by 2025 China will produce over 50% of UAS sys-
tems. (Yan, 2017) China's commercial drone market to top 9B USD by 2020. The market value
would be tripled to 180 billion yuan by 2025, according to the guidelines made by the Ministry
of Industry and Information Technology. The estimate was much higher than a forecast by an
iResearch report last year, which said the overall market of UAVs, commonly known as drones,
could reach 75 billion yuan by 2025 in China. (Yan, 2017)

Iran has supplied long range, low technology Ababil UAS weapons systems to Syria and Sudan,
and to extremist groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and ISIS. Hezbollah's inventory is estimated at
over 200 UAS, which concerns the Israeli military commanders. (Zwijnwenburg, 2014)

Joint Publication (JP) 3-01 identifies friendly assets that an adversary may attack during a
campaign using UAS. A Theater Commander must plan for counter - UAS actions against air
defense sites, logistics centers, and national critical infrastructure. (Boutros, 2015) "Due to
their small size and unique flying signatures, many UAS are difficult to detect, identify, track,
and engage with current joint air defense systems. The increasing proliferation of global UAS
has exposed a critical vulnerability in the protection function of operational commanders,
requiring joint efforts to include intelligence, Electronic Warfare (EW), cyber warfare, (CW) and
FIRES." (Boutros, 2015)

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 53
  But UAS are not invincible. Neutralizing threats or mitigating risk includes active and passive
  defense methods with kinetic and non-kinetic FIRES.1 (US DoD - JP 3-0, 2012)

  Countering UAS Air Threats

  Advanced UAS can carry large payloads great distances. US Predator and Global Hawk UAS,
  "Chinese Pterodactyl and Soring Dragon counterparts, and Iranian Ababil can carry at least 500
  Kg payloads greater than 300 km." (Boutros, 2015) "They can be armed or unarmed, with ISR
  payloads, communications relays, Over-The-Horizon (OTH) target acquisition, and precision
  strike capabilities." (Boutros, 2015)

  "Shorter range, tactical, small/micro UAS may not have the distance or payload capacity of
  more advanced systems, but they can impact a campaign (or US Homeland Defense) in equally
  serious ways. Because of their size, their heat signatures are almost nonexistent. They easily
  evade detection. They offer more freedom of action. They can be launched from within US air
  defense zones and fly to their targets in less time than it takes for a coordinated response."
  (Boutros, 2015) [Nightmare alert: Imagine a swarm of UAS carrying small potent binary bomb
  payloads attacking a US Carrier at port less than one mile away from the UAS launch point.]
  The enemy can effectively balance space, time, and force (arguably frequency too). (Beaudoin,
  2011) "Small UAS (sUAS) can perform short-range ISR, be outfitted with explosive charges or
  chemical and biological agents for aerial dispersion, or simply fly over troops or civilians to
  demoralize." (Boutros, 2015) [Nightmare alert: Given the effectiveness of enemy use of IEDs in
  Iraq and Afghanistan, a mobile, airborne version would take the Problem to an entirely new
  level!] (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

  Vulnerabilities Perspective

  "sUAS are vulnerable to kinetic and non-kinetic outside influence in four different areas; their
  link to a ground station, the ground station itself, the aircrafts various sensors, and cyber
  weapons." The military recognizes the first three factors, the authors will concentrate on the
  fourth.

  "In 2009 Iraqi insurgents successfully hacked into US Reaper drones, crashing them." (Boutros,
  2015) (Horowitz, 2014). "In September of 2011, ground control stations at Creech AFB were
  infected by a virus, temporarily grounding the entire UAS fleet." (Boutros, 2015) (Hartman, 2013)
  UAS onboard sensors can be manipulated in many ways. "High intensity light directed at an
  optical sensor can blind it. GPS receivers can be cyber-spoofed, which consists of transmitting
  a stronger, but false, GPS signal to a receiver, resulting in inaccurate navigation. Influencing

1. FIRES definition (US DoD - JP 3-0) the use of weapon systems to create a specific lethal or nonlethal
  effect on a target.

   and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
  the local magnetic field can have adverse effects on both onboard hard drives and sensors that
  require magnetic orientation to operate correctly." (Boutros, 2015) (Hartman, 2013) The object
  is to better understand UAS subsystems, to facilitate exploiting their weaknesses.

  The author's contention is that: The hostile technology of remote-controlled warfare is difficult
  to control or abort; the best defense (counter - UAS) is to address the root drivers of these threats.
  The threat- roots are SAA and SCADA. Chapter 3 UAS landscape includes automation, collabo-
  ration, conventional vulnerabilities and countermeasures, commercial UAS primer, SAA Attack
  / Defense (A/D) A/D Issues and SCADA vulnerabilities.

  Conventional Vulnerabilities of Air Defense Systems (ADS), Attacks By sUAS and Counter-
  measures

  A simplified, non-classified view of the US Air Defense System (ADS) against a hostile UAS
  attack occurs in two stages:

     1. Early Detection and Identification of "Danger Close" (Myer, 2013)2
    2. Applied appropriate countermeasures with secondary goal of restricted collateral dam-

        age.

  The traditional ADS family of tools for Detection include:

     1. Active Radar Surveillance - generate waves, use rebound echoes on UAS to locate, esti-
        mate distance, approach speed, size, penetration vector and short-term trajectory, and

    2. Passive Monitoring - covers electromagnetic spectrum via visible, thermal infrared, radio
        waves on common communications channels.

  When considering hostile UAS defense planners need to consider several issues. The US ADS
  is optimized for missiles and aircraft deployed at high altitude and speeds. ADS data fusion
  (detection, identification, weapon lock-on, execute countermeasures) works better with larger
  targets, not very small ones like UAS / sUAS. US ADS is effectively reactive for longer ranges.

2. Danger Close Definition www.benning.army.mil/infantry/magazine/issues/2013/May-June/Myer.html
   Nov 14, 2013 - 1) Danger Close is included in the "method-of-engagement" line of a call-for-fire request to
   indicate that friendly forces are close to the target. ... Danger close is a term that is exclusive from risk
   estimate distance (RED) although the RED for 0.1 percent PI is used to define danger close for aircraft
   delivery. Pi = Probability of incapacitation. 2) Definition of "danger close" (US DoD) In close air support,
   artillery, mortar, and naval gunfire support fires, it is the term included in the method of engagement seg-
   ment of a call for fire which indicates that friendly forces are within close proximity of the target.

                                                                                     R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 55
Close reactive engagements are sub-optimal. US ADS are not optimal for sUAS /UAS. (Nichols
R.-0. , 2016)

There are clear vulnerabilities of the US ADS to UAS:

  · "sUAS can be launched into action close to target(s), less than 1 mile.
  · sUAS exhibit a small Radar signature. The detection phase is hindered.
  · Reactive dictates quick response near target. This is not always possible.
  · sUAS / UAS are designed for slow, low flight. Low flying sUAS avoids Radar identification.
  · sUAS / UAS electric motors are both quiet and have limited thermal signature. This

      makes for difficult detection for noise.
  · sUAS /UAS operate in urban areas. Urban sphere presents additional problems and

      potential collateral damage." (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

Conventional Countermeasures Against sUAS /UAS:

There are two families of conventional countermeasures used to disrupt /destroy hostile UAS/
sUAS systems (Regulatory ~ locked in firmware GPS No-Fly Zones, Registration, FAA rules
excluded).

Active Measures - Designed to incapacitate, destroy the sUAS/UAS threat in a direct way
(Ground-to- Air Defense (GTA), missiles or, acoustical gun, or simple cyber rifle)

However, there are some defensive issues to be considered:

  · GTA efficiency against sUAS, reactive targets is reduced, even less efficient in urban
      zones where public at risk.

  · Simultaneous attacks on multiple fronts (See Team or Swarm formats, Tables 3-1 and 3-2)
      very difficult to apply and defense measures are mitigated.

       UAS countermeasures research are improving. The goal is to increase ability of GTA to
       react and improve capabilities to a defined to a saturation limit. Team formation allows
       decoys and shields. Swarm formation is easier to detect. Arrival of a cloud of robot
       drones is hard to mask, but tough to neutralize. Commercial company Liteye has devel-
       oped an Anti-UAV Defense System (AUDS) which are able to detect, track, and disrupt
       sUAS operation by pulsed, brief focused broadcast of direction frequency jamming. Lit-
       eye has also developed a mobile version call M-AUDS. (Liteye, 2018) China has devel-
       oped a "5-sec" laser weapon to shoot down sUAS at low altitude (500 m) with a 10KW
       high energy laser beam. Its range is 1.2 mi and handles sUAS speeds up to 112 mph.
       (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

56 | Chapter 3: Understanding Hostile Use and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS: Components, Autonomy v Automation, Sensors, SAA, SCADA
and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
Passive - Designed to protect indirectly; physical protections around target, decoys, shields,
organized roadblocks, nets, jamming of sensors of the aggressor, GPS total or partial
cyber-Spoof of signals. Passive countermeasures have some positive outcomes. Decoys can be
effective if the ADS knows what the sensors employed for sUAS Kamikaze attack and how they
are used in the SAA subsystem. Communication jamming is effective against level 1 & 2 drones
(Table 3-1) which require pilot interaction. It can disrupt inter-drone communications required
for either team or swarm formations. Sensor Jamming - especially GPS signals - giving false
GPS information, camera/gimbal dislocation, and heading sensor demagnetization is effective
regardless of automation.

The 2011 Iranian incident taught US ADS planner's lessons about passive spoofing waypoints
and Loss of Signal (LOS) via GPS. LOS is an emergency condition. sUAS/UAS have programmed
responses. One of those responses may be," return to waypoint". Two types of spoofs were exe-
cuted. A complete spoof uses the friendly SAA to estimate course, ground-speed, time to target
to force a LOS and final waypoint change. A partial spoof reports false positions, during LOS
and changes waypoints for perceived emergency conditions. Both spoofs are difficult to detect
& effective (Editor, 2012)

Aggressor Counter-Countermeasures Specific to UAS Deployment - Swarm

The authors contend that a UAS swarm attack is practically unstoppable unless the defender
(US ADS) exhibits strong collaboration and ability to match/identify the SWARM locations in
a timely matter. This requires combined active & passive measures. This portends the ADS
computer networks must process, detect, identify, and target information (and make critical
decisions) significantly faster and more effectively than their enemies. Cost is an additional vul-
nerability factor. Swarms can be assembled, delivered, and targeted in a relatively inexpensive
weapons package. A swarm can use local counter jamming on target nets. (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)
The subjects of SWARM research, tactics and defenses, will be examined in later chapters.

Autonomy vs. Automation

Table 3-1 shows the normal five levels of automation that characterize UAS systems with exam-
ples of commercial vehicles. NASA presents a more detailed level of automation breakdown
based on the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide and Act) decision loops. (Barnhart, 2012) However,
Table 3-1 should suffice to understand the cyber-purview. Level 1 lave and Level 2 Automated
(minimal) are commonly found on UAS sold at Amazon, Walmart, and similar outlets. The pilot
makes all the decisions and has complete control of flying orders. Level 3 steps up the naviga-
tion capabilities using an a priori mission plan.

Levels 4 and 5 add higher level decision making capabilities; collision avoidance without human
intervention, complex mission planning in all weather conditions, expert systems intelligence
without human intervention i.e. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced Sense and Avoid sys-

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 57
tems (SAA). Level 5 is not commercially available; many designers are well on their way to a
fully operational Level 5 UAS.

                                                           Table 3-1:

                                                  UAS Automation Scale

       Level 1: Slave - assisting piloting, reaction to disturbance

       Level 2: Automated - maintains its flying orders and receives higher level orders

       For Levels 1 and 2 are common, require pilot intervention and continuous communication
       link; reasonable prices < $1500 US, small, weight < 10lbs: Drone Parrot, Quad Flyer GAUI

       Level 3: Automated Navigation (a priori mission plan)

       For Level 3 micro-UAS premium (< $20,000 US): Dragonfly, Microdrone Gmbh, Fly-n-
       Sense, Mikrokopter

       Level 4: Response from contextual data Collision Avoidance (CA) (w/o human interven-
       tion)

       For Level 4 minimum knowledge of surrounding environment, reacts to events, perform
       CA, uses active SAA, requires mission plan

       Level 5: Decision-Maker (expert system) from contextual data: navigation in unknown
       environment, complex missions, coordination and collaboration of signals

For Level 5 AI, decision making with heavy networked computer support, perceptive sensors
for space and time, complex mission in unknown environments, capable of intelligent adjust-
ments including mission rescheduling, key word- adaptive control

Levels 4 and 5 are confined to laboratories. (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

Table 3-2 UAS Collaboration shows four types of possible UAS collaboration. At the lower end
of a threat scale is the isolated UAS or a small group of UAS. The advantages lie in a specific
mission, which may be piloted or autonomous. They carry light payloads and are affordable.
They are easy to assemble in the field. An example is the Raven used by US Special Forces. The
disadvantage (countermeasure applied) is to identify the pilot or leader vehicle and destroy/
disable it. A UAS attack team is particularly effective against divided attack targets, Level 3
allows automatic navigation, synchronized actions, and limited updated mission information.
With increased team members, synchronization is not guaranteed. Disabling part of the UAS
Team does not guarantee that mission failure. The real vulnerability of the UAS team is the

58 | Chapter 3: Understanding Hostile Use and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS: Components, Autonomy v Automation, Sensors, SAA, SCADA
and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
Chief. All synchronization and updates go through the Chief. Disable/destroy the Chief and the
Team is rendered useless. Determining who the Chief is critical.

Far more dangerous is the Swarm configuration especially in the higher levels of autonomous
engagement. Swarms have several advantages. They are efficient based on numbers, they
demonstrate emergent large group behaviors and reactions. Even not controllable or auto-
mated, they show a decentralized intelligence - think shoal of fish with evolving local rules.
UAS Swarms are a highly resistant form, not changing based on survivability of members. There
is no hierarchy like a team. Destroy part of the swarm and the rest will continue their mission
without abatement.

The two known countermeasures are: 1) Disrupt / Change the Strategic Global View of Swarm
(its only real vulnerability) and 2) force defender collaboration. (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

China appears to be the leader in innovative UAS swarm intelligence, through the efforts of the
Chinese Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC). (Kania, 2017)

                                              Table 3-2 UAS Collaboration

       Type 1: Isolated Individual UAS

       Advantages: piloted or autonomous w/ specific mission to perform. Small, easy to
       assemble, affordable, light payloads.

       Countermeasures: Stop, Disable or Destroy Pilot, Threat removed.

       Type 2: Group of Individual UASs (Isolated with own mission but not coordinated)

       Advantages: sphere of action may be different for each mission, increased numbers, and
       increases success of attacks by defenses saturation

       Countermeasures: Stop, Disable, Discover and Deter or Destroy Pilot(s), Threat(s) may be
       removed.

       Type 3: Team of UASs (All members assigned specialized tasks and coordinated by
       Chief)

       Advantages: Particularly effective against divided attack targets, Level 3 allows automatic
       navigation, synchronized actions, but no update to mission plans based on field activi-
       ties.

       Disadvantages: Level 4 (w/o humans) yields surrounding reactions but may lose syn-
       chronization between team members. Level 5 permits continuous updates, communica-
       tions, commando style.

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 59
       Countermeasures: Stop, Disable or Destroy Team members. Determine behavior logic
       and intervene. Survival of team members is critical to defense actions. Threat mitigated.
       Type 4: UAS Swarm (Uniform mass of undifferentiated individual's w/o Chief at level 4
       or 5)
       Advantages: Efficient based on numbers, emergent large group behaviors and reactions,
       not controllable or automated, decentralized intelligence - think shoal of fish w/ evolv-
       ing local rules; highly resistant form, not changing based on survivability of members, no
       hierarchy
       Countermeasures: Disrupt / Change the Strategic Global View of Swarm (its only real
       vulnerability). Defender collaboration. (Kania, 2017)

Commercial Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Overview
There is a natural tendency to think that small unmanned aircraft systems present no threat,
especially to US defenses. They are simply recreational or commercial toys. But they present
a threat to National Airspace (NAS) - especially near airports. Figure 3-1 shows the results of a
sUAS crashing into a jetliner in 2016.

60 | Chapter 3: Understanding Hostile Use and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS: Components, Autonomy v Automation, Sensors, SAA, SCADA
and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
USA FAA Part 107 special rule forbids use of sUAS within a five-mile radius of an airport. (FAA,
2018)

Table 3-3 shows some of the available options and each year more capabilities are being added.
Imaging, camera capabilities, weather-proofing, and payloads all can be used to gather intelli-
gence, provide reconnaissance or deliver a lethal payload. They are radar resistant and deploy
with a very small heat signature, so they can be in close target quickly, before defenders can
activate countermeasures.

                                     Table 3-3 Commercial sUAS Parameters

  · "Flying Characteristics Available as RTF (off-the-shelf Ready to Fly); BNF (Bind and Fly
      -with custom transmitter); PNF (Plug and Fly with custom transmitter, receiver, battery,
      and charger). RTF and BNF - no prior flight experience required.

  · Models most rotary multicopter - quad (4), hexa (6) octo (8) variants. Fixed wing used for
      deployments in agriculture, public safety, emergency response and ISR (Intelligence, Sur-
      veillance, and Reconnaissance) many fully customizable to achieve specific capabilities,
      flight time, payload capacity, programmable flight, maximum speed and weather harden-
      ing.

  · Average SUAS flight time 18 minutes, average range approximately one mile, cost $600
      US, dry conditions" (Angelov, 2012)

"Specifications affecting hostile UAS operations

  · Payload capacity function (weight and size more than gimbal, camera, battery) LIDAR or
      infrared or experimental sensors require larger capacity and subject to easier detection.

  · Range function (signal transmission, LOS, image relay distance, battery and power con-
      straints).

  · Weather Proofing function (limited operating conditions, mostly dry. Upgradable to near
      military grade to operate in extreme conditions) Retrofit to harden for weather is a trade-
      off for weight, cost, flight time and payload capacity unless no of rotors increases.

  · Imaging function (available medium -high resolution cameras of > 12 megapixels, with
      still and video) Infrared and LIDAR installable.

  · Automated and Programmable Pilot / Follow Me settings function (predetermined flight
      mission path based on GPS coordinates (Fly-by-wire). Some with Follow Me autopilot set-
      tings enable the SUAS to automatically follow the operator." (Angelov, 2012)

Airborne Sensing Systems

There are two technologies available for airborne sensing of other aircraft; cooperative and
non-cooperative. Cooperative technologies receive radio signals from other aircraft's onboard

                                                                                  R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 61
equipment. Two requirements for cooperative behavior. First ATC Transponder, which
responds to ground-based secondary radar interrogations for air traffic control (ATC) usage.
Traffic Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) uses the same technology in FAA classes of air-
space. Second is the Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast systems (ADS-B). ADS-B
technology uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) or alternative navigational source to make
broadcasts of its own aircraft position, velocity, and data required to avoid collisions. (Angelov,
2012) Table 3-4 shows typical sensor coordinate systems. The first three cooperate with each
other, the latter five are non-cooperative technologies. (Angelov, 2012)

Sensor Parameters

Sensor technologies use standard parameters to provide a basis for comparison and ISR per-
formance. Table 3-5 Standard Sensor Parameters shows the base set:

                (Angelov, 2012)

SAA Critical Control Systems include circuitry to affect UAS movement, landing, control of
direction, detection, and correction of the aircraft. Many of these functions are incorporated
into a UAS Autopilot, if capable.

Autopilot

Table 3-6 shows the common components found in UAS autopilots. These provide the means
for UAS to affect movement, control, communications, detection, emergency operations, bat-
tery, waypoint delivery, and payloads.

                         Table 3-6 Common components found in UAS autopilots

(Clothier R. F., 2010) describes an ambitious SAA scientific research project involving multiple
vendors, research teams, multiple aircraft, control stations, global communications and pay-
loads known as the Smart Skies project. (Clothier R. F., 2010) Table 3-7 shows just a few of the
SAA technologies that Smart Skies employed.

SAA Subsystems

The purpose of a Sense and Avoid systems (SAA) function is replace a human pilot, to detect
and resolve certain hazards of flight. "These hazards consist traffic or objects presenting a risk
of collision. Air traffic includes anything that flies. Other hazards include terrain and obstacles
(buildings, towers, power lines.) Aircraft preservation is not the primary reason for SAA. SAA
must operate in emergency and diversionary events as well as throughout normal operations."
(Angelov, 2012)

The main components of SAA configurations are the aircraft and systems onboard, the off-
board control station, and the communication link(s) between these. The key distinctions are:

  1. "Whether the SAA surveillance system consists of sensors located onboard the aircraft,
      off-board, or both, and

 2. Whether the SAA decisions are made at the off-board control station or onboard the air-
      craft by its automation."

In both cases, there is volume of air above the ground stations in which the UAS flies. (See
Figure 3-2) "In one configuration, all decisions are made on the ground. In another configura-
tion, sensors and decisions are located aboard the aircraft, the ground station is monitor, and

64 | Chapter 3: Understanding Hostile Use and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS: Components, Autonomy v Automation, Sensors, SAA, SCADA
and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
depending on the level of autonomy" (Table 3-1 above) the UAS detects targets, declares threats
and selects maneuvers. In yet another configuration example, "sensors are located onboard or
ground, but threat and maneuver decisions (human) are made via the ground station and com-
municated via communication links to the UAS." (Angelov, 2012)
SAA Services and Sub-Functions
The SAA function supplies two services. These are:

  1. A Self-separation service to act BEFORE a collisions avoidance maneuver is needed, and
      could support earlier, gentler maneuvers, and

 2. "The collision avoidance service that attempts to protect a small collision zone and usu-
      ally is achieved by means of a late, aggressive maneuver" (Angelov, 2012)(see Figure 3-2
      Self -Separation and Collision Volume). (Angelov, 2012)

To achieve these services, the following list of SAA design sub-functions is required:
  · "Detect - various hazards and objects such as other aircraft, weather, terrain
  · Track - detected motion of object, determination of position and trajectory
  · Evaluate - tracked objects, against criteria that would need a SAA maneuver
  · Prioritize - tracked objects based on evaluation and tests performed
  · Declare - that paths of object and own aircraft reach a point of decision for movement
  · Determine - specific maneuver based on geometry of encounter
  · Command - own aircraft to perform maneuver
  · Execute - commanded maneuver" (Angelov, 2012)

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 65

Low Hanging Fruit

66 | Chapter 3: Understanding Hostile Use and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS: Components, Autonomy v Automation, Sensors, SAA, SCADA
and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
Many textbooks detail UAS SAA systems ad nauseum. Angelov's Sense and Avoid in UAS is by
far the best. The reader is directed to it as the aviation source. (Angelov, 2012) What makes the
present book unique is its concentration on hostile UAS activities and speculative cyber -vul-
nerabilities and attacks on the US ADS. The security fault "low hanging fruit" in UAS systems is
SCADA.
SCADA
There are hundreds of millions of SCADA systems. They are used to control every practical
machine you can imagine. SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition.
SCADA started in the 1940's to control manufacturing processes such as flow rates, tempera-
tures, valves, pressure, density, chemical, mechanical processes of all kinds. See Figure 3-4 for
Legacy SCADA system for Chemical Plant. (Nichols R., Nov 28-30, 2006)
SCADA systems have improved significantly over the decades in all areas except one - SECU-
RITY. SCADA systems are a security sieve. Figures 3-4 and 3-5 show examples of SCADA
Architectures. (Nichols R., Nov 28-30, 2006) An interesting example are the automated/com-
puterized systems in modern cars.

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 67

Everything is controlled by SCADA; tires, engine, seat belts, safety bags, oil pressure, even door
locks. However, cyber hackers can exploit SCADA to disable a car remotely, with the driver still
in it! Greenburg, Wired (2015). Hackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the Highway--With Me in It.

SCADA systems have plenty of cyber related vulnerabilities. Most are connected to computers.
Those vulnerabilities multiply when connected to the Internet. SCADA systems differ from the
IT structures. See Figure 3-7. (Shapiro, 2006) Table 3-10 Sample SCADA Design Vulnerabilities
apply to all systems including UAS. (Nichols R. , Nov 28-30, 2006)There are so many design
flaws and vulnerabilities in SCADA systems that the US government has a special SCADA test-
ing lab in Utah and has published copious recommendations to improve security. (NTSB, 2009)

Cyber - Attack Taxonomy

UAS SCADA systems susceptible to a broad range of cyber and network specific attacks on the
SAA modules in the aircraft and communication structures from the ground or satellite links.
These represent system threats and vulnerabilities of the UAS structure, increasing the risk
of hostile use or takeover. (Nichols R. , Nov 28-30, 2006)A UAS Cyber Attack Taxonomy is an
organized view of potential cyber threats to UAS assets. The Taxonomy is a list of agents that
increase risk of a successful attack on US UAS ADS assets. Remember the authors' contention,
the risk of success of terrorist attacks on USA Air Defense Systems (ADS) via UASs is higher
because of improving commercial capabilities and accessibility.

A qualitative view of information risk (also a measure of cyber-attack lethality) in a system such
as SAA or computer network is expressed as:

                 Risk = (Threats x Vulnerabilities x Impact / Countermeasures) Eq. 3-1

                              And at time state 0, this equation can be reduced to

                             Risk = function (Threats / Countermeasures) Eq. 3-2

                                                          (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

At time state =0, where Vulnerabilities & Impact are constants and drop out of the equation.

Threats are real, and if applied in the absence of appropriate countermeasures, will increase
the likelihood of a successful cyber-attack. Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the system that a
threat may or may not exploit. Vulnerabilities essentially in the system, ab initio. Threats can be
mitigated or improved based on the attack circumstances. Impact is an after-the-fact account-

76 | Chapter 3: Understanding Hostile Use and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS: Components, Autonomy v Automation, Sensors, SAA, SCADA
and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
ing of the cyber-attack. No matter what the magnitude, it is a constant. Countermeasures
are a host of technologies that can be applied to mitigate threats and reduce Risk. Increased
Threats means increased Risk. Increased Countermeasures means decreased Risk. In practice,
these equations require a qualitative legend to make comparable cases. Conversely, decreased
threats means decreased Risk and decreased countermeasures means increased Risk. (Nichols
R.-0. , 2016)Some authors use Vulnerabilities to assess Risk. (Garcia, 2006) Therefor our cyber-
attack taxonomy must work for either Risk approach. There are many approaches to evaluating
Risk. The authors choose the simplest approach to understand the attack vectors.

Espionage

Let us define some of its elements. First, we have espionage by foreign hackers. One of the
main culprits are the Chinese who both encourage stealing state secrets have been quite
successful. (Brenner, 2011) Hackers have successfully attacked U.S. Transportation Command
(TRANSCOM) networks, "Stole designs for advanced U.S. weapons systems, including:

  · F-35 Joint Strike Fighter,
  · F/A-18 Fighter Jet,
  · Patriot Missile System,
  · RQ-4 Global Hawk Drones,
  · P-8 Poseidon Reconnaissance Aircraft,
  · UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopter,
  · Littoral Combat Ship,
  · Army's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense Missile Defense System
  · Navy's Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program,
  · compromised White House computer systems for espionage against military offices, tar-

      geting: Interoffice communication;
  · Nuclear codes,
  · took temporary control of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA)

      weather satellites, and
  · Civil Reserve Air Fleet systems by compromising computers defense contractors." (Sood

      A.K. & Enbody, 2014)

Adding to our taxonomy, there are three Vulnerability classes exploited in UAS cyber-attacks:
"Software-based, Insider Threats, and Hardware-based. Software and hardware vulnerabil-
ities are result of poor coding practices and dearth of security understanding in developers.
Hardcoded passwords exist because programmers prefer an effortless way for recovery pur-
poses such as debugging. Vulnerabilities have drastic impact on security of software." (Sood
A.K. & Enbody, 2014) "Developers or programmers with malicious intent may implant computer
hardware with code as part of a targeted attack. Insider threat vulnerabilities are difficult to

                                                                                  R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 77
assess due to human element involved. Multi-layer defenses are required to combat vulnera-
bilities in software/hardware world." (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014)

Software - Based Vulnerabilities

"Military UAS defense systems deploy widely used software in their network devices: Operating
systems, open source software, routers, radio frequency devices, Internet Connection Sharing
(ICS) and SAA SCADA." (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014) UAS ground system network software may
have the standard vulnerabilities; "hardcoded passwords, backdoors in firmware, insecure pro-
tocols, Remote Command Execution (RCE), default passwords for Human-Machine Interfaces
(HMIs), Insecure authentication and authorization, malicious hardware, critical infrastructure
systems have hardcoded passwords embedded in firmware which may allow attackers to gain
complete access to system." (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014) It doesn't end there. Other software-
based vulnerabilities: "Backdoors exist for support or remote access purposes, Hardcoded
passwords easily obtained by: Reverse engineering firmware, analyzing functional compo-
nents," (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014) Remote Code Execution (RCE) which is an attacker's ability
to execute attacker's commands on target machine or target process remotely. Another RCE
vulnerability is a software bug that gives attacker way to execute arbitrary code or ability to
trigger arbitrary code execution from one machine on another. (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

Unfortunately," Remote Code Execution (RCE) can be triggered by exploiting security flaws in:

Operating system components, browsers," ICS, SCADA, routers, Microsoft Office, Adobe
Reader, and Java. Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a powerful threat to UAS and supporting
computer systems. "Attackers exploit security issues; buffer overflows (stack, heap, integer),
use-after free errors, race conditions, memory corruption, privilege escalations and dangling
pointers."

Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities keeps growing and RCE vulnerabilities allow
"attackers to execute arbitrary code on compromised systems, drive-by downloads, spear
phishing attacks." (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014)

ICS/SCADA is particularly vulnerable to remote code execution vulnerabilities. Another form
is SQL injections, "which exploits weaknesses in web applications to allow attackers' queries to
be executed directly in backend database" and allow attackers to extract sensitive information
such as credentials, emails, critical documents, intelligence. "Data stolen using SQL injection
can provide critical information for advanced UAS targeted attacks." (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014)

The final group in the software- based vulnerabilities set is "insecure authentication and file
uploading flaws. These allow remote attackers to access critical systems by exploiting weak
authentication design and uploading malicious code or firmware. This security issue persists
due to inability of systems to implement granular control through proper authentication and

78 | Chapter 3: Understanding Hostile Use and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS: Components, Autonomy v Automation, Sensors, SAA, SCADA
and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
authorization checks. File uploading attacks exploit a system's inability to determine type of
files being uploaded on server." (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014)

Insider Threat Vulnerabilities

"Insider threats involve a malicious employee or contractor that steals sensitive organizational
assets or otherwise diminishes integrity of organization." (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014) Insider
threats may be intentional or unintentional. The outcome is the same, increased risk.

Intentional Insider Threats (IIT): is "when contractors or employees turn malicious," their
motives: revenge, personal grudge, and /or greed. Regarding Unintentional Insider Threats
(UIT), "the US military defense outsources jobs to contractors, which presents a softer target
than military facilities. The result is compromised contractors' assets allows attackers to steal
intelligence from military defense networks. The contractor acts as a proxy to provide entry for
attacker, even though contractor has no intention to conduct spying / stealing assets." (Sood
A.K. & Enbody, 2014)

"Edward Snowden worked as a contractor for Central Intelligence Agency and NSA. Snowden
leaked copious amounts of information, including information of Government Communica-
tions Headquarters (GCHQ) and National Security Agency (NSA) project, `Anarchist; Hacking of
Israeli drone feeds; `The Drone Papers' - The Intercept and Leaks regarding drone usage in
Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia." (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014)

Hardware-based Vulnerabilities

The US sometimes picks the wrong vendors to supply its UAS critical hardware. Hardware
imported from China includes backdoor access to hardware after deployment. "Exported Chi-
nese manufacturing units compromised military-grade FPGA computer chips, circuits, and
counterfeit devices, such as scanners." "Zombie Zero malware has been implanted in software
of scanner hardware manufactured in China as part of attack targeting shipping and logistics
industries, especially printers. When scanners are connected to networks they provide plat-
forms for compromising networks. Counterfeit devices and circuits developed in China for U.S.
military and defense contractors to be used in warships, missiles, airplanes and

UAS." (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014) (Threat to all nations that receive hardware preinstalled with
malware.) (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

"Hardware based vulnerabilities observed in actual attacks on military defense systems (Army)
and applications include the following; backdoors and hardcoded passwords, compromised

GPS Satellite Communication (SATCOM) systems," SCADA systems vulnerable to buffer over-
flows, and compromised GPS SATCOM systems. The Navy had its share of hardware-based
threats; Remote Code Execution - "XMLDOM Zero-day vulnerability was exploited to attack

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 79
U.S. Veterans of Foreign Wars' website, SQL injections, Royal Navy website hacked, U.S. Army
website hacked, insecure protocols, spoofing and hijacking and attacks to spoof GPS commu-
nication to control U.S. drones." (Sood A.K. & Enbody, 2014)

Wireless attacks are the most generic form of hacking. "Strategies to compromise a system's
ability to be controlled by rightful owner include:

  · Password Theft
  · Wireshark
  · Man-In-the-Middle Attacks
  · Trojan Horse Virus
  · Gain Scheduling

          Fuzzing
          Digital Update Rate,
          Distributed Denial of Service,
          Buffer Overflow." (Rani, 2015)

Password cracking/theft. "Even complex passwords can be cracked using software tools such
as dictionary attacks and brute force attacks". Cracking programs are easy to obtain. "Statistical
methods such as Aircrack-ng" which is a "Wired Equivalent Privacy and Wi-Fi Protected Access
Pre-Shared Key cracking program is freeware." (Rani, 2015)

Wireshark. A robust tool to analyze and capture packets for wireless networks. It provides valu-
able and sensitive information of transmitted packets. Wireshark allows effortless access to
"client system and gain control over it." It displays a list of available interfaces. A victim's user-
name and password can be obtained on a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Another cyber-goodie is the Man-in-the-Middle (MIM) attack: "Attacker gains control of sensi-
tive data by furtively modifying communication link between two parties. End users are usually
unaware of manipulation performed by attacker." (Rani, 2015) "Attacker forms fake connections
between server and client. "Forms of MIM attacks are:

  · URL manipulation
  · Rogue Domain Name Server
  · Address Resolution Protocol poisoning
  · Duplication of Media Access Control
  · False Emails" (Rani, 2015)

Trojan Horse Virus. It is malicious program or software that causes detrimental effects. It can
monitor traffic over a network, damage hard drives, leverage of a security glitch, multiply/
replicate like rabbits, give attacker an access to system remotely, "Trojan can continuously

80 | Chapter 3: Understanding Hostile Use and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS: Components, Autonomy v Automation, Sensors, SAA, SCADA
and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
delete files and ultimately demolish Operating System and cannot be easily identified by anti-
virus programs." (Rani, 2015)

Gain Scheduling. A special form of cyber- attack. There are four classes: fuzzing, digital update
rate, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), buffer overflow. "Gain scheduling is used to control
non-linear UAS systems and hybrid UAS systems." (Rani, 2015) "UAS will need different gains for
control depending on states of UAS: Mass, Altitude, Speed, Flaps down." "In a hybrid system, a
system is assumed to have multiple modes of operation corresponding to take off, landing, and
cruising." "UAS will have different gains for controlling the vehicle. Control gains are often pre-
computed and trusted. Gain parameters are coded into on-board autopilots. Without strict
monitoring of software, an override of gains goes undetected. Changes to gains or gain sched-
uling logic can cause decreased performance in autopilot or instability in UAS." (Rani, 2015)
Attacker can manually override safety systems for an hour, shut down system, and take control.
Not much is required; IP address of SCADA Server, path to server and then a Trojan or back
door can be installed. (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

Gain Scheduling attack methods vary depending on UAS SAA systems. "There are generally five
methods of attacks:

  · Sensor spoofing to cause mode confusion,
  · Overriding gains through hacking,
  · Infinite switching between gains, will cause loss of control,
  · Causing Denial of Service (DOS) between controller gain block, and
  · UAS controller block by overloading the on-board processor." (Kim, 2012)

Fuzzing. "In UAS autopilot system, random inputs with expected distributions are not uncom-
mon, and Gaussian noise inputs are routinely accounted for however, unexpected, invalid, or
completely random inputs can cause unknown behaviors. Attacker can access any data flow
between components and corrupt them with bogus values." "Attackers use malicious fuzzing to
discover SAA vulnerabilities." Intentional white-box and black-box fuzzing tests can determine
system robustness of Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) algorithms. Avionic and UAS
programmers develop GNC for unmanned rotatory and fixed-wing aircraft. GNC algorithms
are key to counter-terrorist activities and targeting High Value targets (HVT). "Consequences
for a fuzzing attack: Aircraft instability, Process lock-up and/or invalid outputs to next SAA/
GNC process. Common fuzzing attack methods include buffer overflow attacks, sending mali-
cious packets with invalid payload data to UAS, and adding malicious hardware between com-
ponents." (Kim, 2012)

Digital Update Rate. UAS autopilots are digital computers. Inputs/outputs to/from the autopi-
lot are discretized. (Zaharia, 2012) "Any continuous inputs to autopilots are converted to
digital inputs through discrete sampling. If the autopilot was designed with a continuous con-
troller, it is also converted to a discretized form. For a discretized system, as sample time

                                                                                  R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 81
increases system becomes unstable/uncontrollable. For data collection, longer sampling peri-
ods will increase probability of data aliasing." (Kim, 2012) Hackers, knowing the above, have
created a few methods cyber-attacks; "changing sampling time of analog-to-digital convert-
ers through buffer overflow, hardware manipulation and Denial of Service (DOS) or Distributed
[networked] Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks that prevent processor from running controller
or navigator at desired update rate." (Kim, 2012)

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). "A large-scale intrusion method performed by a host
source which causes detrimental effects to legitimate users by withholding services. This
either causes system to shut down completely or rapidly drain system resources such as
computing power and bandwidth." (Rani, 2015) "Once attacker gains access new tools can be
installed to enable control of host. Infected systems continue to look for other vulnerable sys-
tems and attack them too. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks results in a master-
slave process where affected victim is controlled by the attacker." The attacker comes into
possession of controls of many systems. "Resources of system are exhausted rapidly, and flood-
ing of packets occurs on victim end. Attacker then removes all traces that could lead to locating
the source of attack by using spoofed Internet Protocol address preventing victim to permeate
illegal traffic targeted towards them." (Rani, 2015)

The question is how is a DDoS attack initiated and how related to UAS? Think team or swarm
configuration controlled at a ground-station network.

"Steps in initiating a complex DDoS attack:

Compilation of vulnerable agents

  · Network first scanned for vulnerable agents for attacker to compile list of agents to
      attack

  · Possible to attack systems by setting up automated software to scan network and take
      over vulnerable agents

Defuse

  · Flaws in security and agent vulnerability are misused by attacker
  · Software codes used to automatically attack and disband owner from controlling system
  · Actions are taken by attacker to safeguard code planted from being Distributed Denial of

      Service (DDoS)

Connection

  · Protocols such as TCP or UDP used to connect with numerous agents and plan attacks

82 | Chapter 3: Understanding Hostile Use and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS: Components, Autonomy v Automation, Sensors, SAA, SCADA
and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
      accordingly via scheduling
  · Attacks can be performed on either single or multiple agents

Intrusion

  · Features of victim such as port numbers are conformed
  · Attacker launches attack and alters properties
  · In favor of attacker since alteration of packets would lead to complications in identifica-

      tion of source of attack" (Rani, 2015)

"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Scanning attack techniques:

  · Random
  · Local subnet
  · Hit-list
  · Permutation
  · Topological

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) System Shutdown for at least five minutes:

          UAS Operations can no longer monitor or control process conditions
          SCADA locks up, must be rebooted
          When comes back on-line, locks up again

                Items Needed for DDoS:
                Ability to flood server with TCP/IP calls
                IP Address of SCADA Server
                Path to server" (Rani, 2015)

Buffer Overflow SCADA Attack. Exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability is to overwrite some
control information to modify flow of control in a program, exploiting and compromising con-
trol information to give control to the attacker's code. It involves overwriting return address
stored on stack to transfer control to code placed in buffer or past end of buffer. On hardware
implementations, stack grows downwards towards lower memory addresses.

When a function is called, the address of instruction following function call is pushed onto
stack, so that the function knows where to return control when it is finished. While the called
function is being executed, it allocates local variables on stack, variables and buffers, allocated
at lower memory addresses than return address. The process permits writes to base address
of buffer plus offset to return address, overwrites value of return address.

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 83
In a buffer overflow SCADA attack, if the return address is overwritten with some arbitrary
value, control will be transferred either to invalid location in memory or location that does not
contain valid executable code. This results in segmentation fault. If the overflow SCADA attack

return address is overwritten in a clever manner, it can transfer control to code inserted by the
attacker in a buffer overflow. Attacker can place executable code into the buffer, then over-
write return address with the address of buffer. Control will then be transferred to executable
attack code contained in buffer. (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

Control Acquisition Attack (CAA). The objective of attacker in a CAA is to assume direct control
of unmanned vehicle. A proven example is to use GPS spoofing to shift flight path of UAS to
suit purposes of attacker with limited control. If the attacker can gain complete control of
unmanned vehicle, the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack is promulgated. The attacker
could send falsified data to original controller to make it appear that vehicle is behaving nor-
mally, when it is being controlled by attacker. CAA is undetectable attack that is especially dan-
gerous. (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

General Attack Possibilities

Autopilot Hardware Attack. The attacker can link directly to UAS autopilot to give control over
UAS and/or tactical data. "They can corrupt data stored on-board autopilot or install extra
components that corrupt data flow. Hardware attacks affect UAS survivability, control and
allow tactical data to be collected. Hardware attacks can be carried out during maintenance,
storage, manufacturing, and delivery phases." (Kim, 2012)

Wireless Attack. "Attacks are carried out through wireless communication channels. They can
occur if an attacker uses wireless communication channels to alter data on-board UAS autopi-
lot. Worst case scenario is if an attacker can break encryption of communication channel.
Attacker can gain full control of UAS if communication protocol is known and then can use a
buffer overflow or like corrupt data onboard or initiate some event." (Kim, 2012) Another type
of attack is sensor spoofing. The attacker send false data through on-board sensors of UAS
autopilot. The danger of wireless attacks they can be carried out from afar while UAS is being
operated. (Nichols R.-0., 2016)

Control System Security. "Attacks that prevent hardware/CPU from normally

Include buffer overflow exploits through some input device, forced system resets to load mali-
cious code, and hardware changes or additions to system." (Kim, 2012)

Application Logic Security. These attacks use malicious manipulation of sensors or environ-
ment, providing false data to control system. The control system behaves as programmed
without fault, but some or all inputs to system are corrupted. Attacks include sensory data
manipulation

and Cyber Attack Taxonomy
Vehicle/system component state data manipulation, navigational data manipulation, command
and control data manipulation, to gain complete control over connected drone and gained
access to corrupt pre-programmed flight path. Since the communication channel between
ground station and flight controller of drone is based on an unsecured protocol, a hacker can
easily attack and gain real-time access to drone. (Nichols R.-0. , 2016)

Conclusions

Unmanned Aircraft Systems represent some of US most advanced air assets. They are critical
to the US ADS. Because they were designed on top of open communications, SCADA controlled,
and interact with the Internet for ground, air, sea, and satellite support, plus use COT soft-
ware/hardware, they are vulnerable to a host of cyber-attacks to control their destiny. Based
on the sheer diversity and number of potential cyber weapons that can be used at every stage
of the UAS mission, and the significant growth of UAS for defense purposes, the risk of hostile
use against US ADS is steadily increasing. Couple this with a huge growth and sophistication
in the UAS commercial technologies supporting and global sectors requiring UAS, the threat of
hostile use cannot be minimized.

Discussion Topics

1) You are a terrorist. Contemplate the Risk and Success of a hostile take-over or destruction of
a friendly UAS by the following four methods:

       1A - Spoofing GPS satellite communication

       1B - Corrupting authentication of ground station communication signals

       1C - Hijacking a UAS by hacking internal ASIC chip communication

       1D - ADS-B Spoofing / Jamming

What cyber tools from the Chapter 3 Cyber- Attack Taxonomy would you use to accomplish
the 1A- 1D goals?

2) Discuss the cyber counter measures that could be used to terminate/disrupt/destroy a
SWARM attack of fifty or more UAS on an ADS facility.

3) U.S Navy Vessel Collisions in the Pacific:

Facts:

In 2017, there were chain of incidents/collisions involving four U.S. Warships and one U.S
Submarine. On 20 August, the guided-missile destroyer USS John S McCain collided with the

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 85
600-foot oil and chemical tanker Alnic MC at 0624 JST. Ten sailors died. On 17 June, the
destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with the ACX 30,000-ton container ship at 1330 JST, leaving
seven dead. Records show that the ACX turned sharply right at the time of collision. The route
of the destroyer is not shown on maps because commercial tracking data does not include mil-
itary ships. Damage to the starboard side of the USS Fitzgerald indicates it would have been
on a bearing of approximately 180 deg. (South). The captain of the Philippine-flagged container
ship accused the Navy destroyer of failing to heed warning signs before the crash. On 9 May, the
guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain collided with a South Korean fishing boat off the
Korean Peninsula. There were no injuries. On 31 January, the guided-missile cruiser USS Anti-
etam ran aground dumping more than 1000 gallons of oil into Tokyo Bay. On 18 August, the
ballistic- missile submarine, USS Louisiana collided with the Navy Offshore Support Vessel in
the Strait of Juan de Fuca. No injuries.

US Navy Response

In all five incidents, the US Navy blamed their field leadership for not responding in an appro-
priate manner. Court marshals and relief from duty are the punishments of the day. The Navy
blames funding, lack of readiness, and lack of training. Investigations and maintenance "holds"
have been initiated. Reading between the lines, this response would imply that the Skipper/
XO/COB and at least five watch sailors on each Naval vessel (roughly -forty to fifty personnel
including bridge staff) were judged incompetent. Many US Navy careers were finished. Further,
this would also imply that all five vessels radar, emergency positioning alert systems, AIS, sonar,
and long-range collision avoidance equipment must have been functioning perfectly, without a
catastrophic failure or interference of any kind.

OR...

The Case for a Cyber Weapon

To this researcher, there appears to be valid evidence to support the theory that at least two
of the US Navy Warships above AND the commercial vessels they struck were the on the
wrong end of a cyber-weapon. They were receiving wrong GPS generated positional infor-
mation. The Cyber Weapon may have been deployed by UAS off a small, nearby vessel by an
adversary. The author believes, that the subject cyber weapon is an advanced modular entity
that can spoof the GPS signals received by all vessels in its range. Vessels given misleading
data will make incorrect decisions in terms of navigation and emergency responses - poten-
tial leading to collisions and deaths.

Contemplate and comment on the viability of the researcher's cyber-weapon theory.

Information Channels & Components

This chapter provides an overview of the basic concepts of information security to provide a
common set of terms and concepts for discussion and analysis. This is only an overview: stu-
dents interested in learning more should be aware that this discussion is cursory and there is
a wealth of knowledge out there to be discovered.

Student learning objectives. After reading this chapter, students should be able to do the fol-
lowing:

  · Identify, describe, and explain the three basic security policy questions
  · Define the three commonly used security attributes
  · Explain how security requirements can be systematically derived
  · Identify and describe the three security engineering phases
  · Explain the detection timeline
  · Differentiate between the classes of problems that need to be detected
  · Describe the types of activities that should be triggered by a detection event
  · Extrapolate types of security challenges for UAS
  · Identify how UAS information security challenges can be analyzed

Basic Concepts in Information Security

Information security is as old as information itself. Information has value; where the oasis is
located, how many warriors are in the opposing force, how to safely prepare medicines, etc.
Information security is not just about keeping secrets, although that is an important aspect. In
this section, we will describe the basic concepts of information security and define important
terms. Examples will illustrate concepts. Keep in mind that this is an abstraction of a very real
problem space. What you will be exploring is a model of information security. Like any model,
it simplifies and approximates reality to aid conceptualization. Just like an organizational chart
does not capture the complexity of office politics or a data flow diagram does not capture the
quality of the data, a security model has limitations. Its usefulness lies in that it gives you a way
of understanding and analyzing something enormously complex.

Policy Questions

Before any analysis can begin, you must know your starting point and your goal. We refer to
that as starting at first principles. We can start with the most obvious question; what infor-

                                                                                                      R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and
                                                                                                                                                                                  J.P. Hood | 115
mation needs to be protected? To answer that question, you require substantial information.
Depending on the size of the system or organization, distinct types of information can exist and
require varying levels of protection. It seems like such a simple question, but it is deceptive in
its simplicity. For example, consider yourself a target for a security analysis. What information
requires protection? Your personally identifiable information (PII) is an obvious choice; after
all, that is a target for identity thieves. What else requires protection? Usernames, passwords,
bank account information, and medical records are all sensitive information. There may also be
some relationships you would prefer to keep secret.

One side note: the information and systems considered in this question are not only the ones
owned and controlled by the enterprise, but also custodial files. The responsibilities associ-
ated with having custody of data, equipment, or personnel require special consideration. When
accepting custodial responsibility, you are tacitly or explicitly accepting the responsibility to
exercise due care and control of those assets. These considerations must be considered in your
analysis of the policy questions. In other words, it is not just the assets that establish your base-
line operational capability that you need to consider, but also the set of assets that flow in and
out of your enterprise. Two tools that can help you focus on where these challenges might lie
are data flow diagrams and functional decomposition diagrams.

How Much Protection is needed?

Each asset has different security needs as well, so another question needs to be asked; how
much protection is needed? Some information types require a great deal of protection, pos-
sibly layers of security. Others might require less. Another way of thinking about this question
is what is the minimal amount of security required? Think of common types of information
in your life. How much protection does your personal data (like your social security number)
require as compared to information about your residence? For the majority (those who are
not in the witness protection program, for example), personal data warrants more protection
than their address and phone number. Understanding these distinctions helps determine how
resources should be allocated in developing and ensuring protective mechanisms.

How long must the information be protected?

In addition to the question of `how much?' there is also the question regarding how long such
protection must be maintained. Some protections must remain in place for substantial time,
while others can be allowed to expire relatively quickly. For example, suppose one proposes
marriage to their partner, how long would that information need to be protected? It depends
on the variables, but the author believes we can safely say that once married, the information
is no longer sensitive and public access is acceptable. In contrast, consider an espionage agent
that has infiltrated the highest level of an adversary government. How long should this infor-
mation be protected? An argument could be made that the information should be protected
perpetually.

116 | Chapter 4 INFOSEC - Protecting UAS Information Channels & Components
To summarize, there are three policy questions that need to be addressed for competent secu-
rity analysis. Both the positive and negative versions of these questions need to be considered.

These three questions are:

-- What information requires protection? What information does not?

-- How much protection does asset require? Conversely, what is the minimum amount of pro-
tection required?

-- How long must security be kept in place? Conversely, how soon can it lapse?

There are risk implications to the answers, which will be explored in Chapter 6. Every decision
is a risk decision, but decisions are informed by the availability of resources and operational
circumstances. It is impossible to be risk-free, so the decisions on how and when risks are
accepted need to be made thoughtfully.

Security Attributes

The previous section discussed protection of information. Various aspects of protection are
called "security attributes." There are three commonly used security attributes in information
security. They are confidentiality, integrity, and availability, abbreviated as CIA in many publi-
cations. (Some researchers have proposed emphasis on other security attributes; keep an open
mind about what security attributes are important in your unique operational environment.)

Confidentiality refers to the need to keep information, operations, and transactions secret.
This applies to more than simply data. There are four distinct kinds of secrets that need to be
kept; actual secrets, relationship secrets, sources and methods secrets, and operational secrets.
We differentiate between these types because protecting them requires different approaches.
A relationship secret is not protected the same way a sources and methods secret is protected.
However, and this is a very important point, these types are not mutually exclusive. A secret
may require several of these characteristics simultaneously.

Consider some examples of the types of secrets to understand this concept. An example of an
actual secret might be something you did when you were seven years old. Perhaps you ate your
sister's cookie or broke a lamp and blamed the dog. Keeping that information secret requires
that access to the actual information be restricted; only those who are granted the highest level
of trust are granted access to that information. The gate keeper considers the access request
and either grants it or not, based on the adjudication of trust and need to know. The more
people who know increases the probability that the secret will be breached, so the decision to
grant access is made on a need to know basis.

Relationship secrets are secrets in which the relationship are what need to be kept secret.

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 117
Some relationships are regulated; there are legal requirements to keep them secret. An exam-
ple of this would be the relationship between two corporations considering a merger: before
an agreement is made, the government requires that the relationship between the organiza-
tions for the purposes of negotiating the merger be kept secret. Other times, the relationship
secret is a matter of protecting its illicit nature, such as an extramarital affair or membership
in a crime syndicate. And still others, the relationship between types of information is what
requires protection. For example, if a company has different pay scales by gender, the relation-
ship between employee gender and pay would be regarded as a secret. A very famous example
of this type of secret was the role of "Deep Throat" during the Watergate affair. It was obvious
that the data being leaked was coming from an insider and the data itself was being made pub-
lic. From the perspective of the participants, the most important secret was the relationship
between the reporters and the insider. They took extreme measures to prevent the relation-
ship from being discovered.

Sources and methods secrets refer to the need to protect sources of information and methods
by which operational goals are achieved. Protecting sources and methods secrets can be
tricky. For example, consider an advanced secret imaging platform that provides extremely
high-resolution images of targets. These images are useful, and secret, but an additional con-
sideration is protection of the source. Both the existence of the source and any clues as to
the existence of the source must be protected. The latter is the difficult part: steps must be
taken to remove or obfuscate any hint that the source exists. For our example of the imag-
ing platform, one way to protect the source would be to share only degraded versions of the
images. Similarly, methods for achieving some goal might need protection. For example, the
exact process of mixing ingredients in controlled humidity and temperature environments
could result in a superior product. In this example, the ingredients for the product are known.
It is the method that is the secret. Protecting this secret requires layering of operational pro-
tective measures.

Operational secrets are those secrets that are situationally based. The operational situation may
vary significantly in time or geography. For example, it may be well known that a bombing raid
is being planned, but it is the actual time of the attack that is the secret. Similarly, it may com-
mon knowledge that drones are in a general area, but the actual location at any point in time
may be secret. These types of secrets are considered separately from the others because of
their transient nature; as soon as the operational circumstances change, the secrecy require-
ments become moot.

Consideration of these distinct types of secrets is extremely helpful when attempting to
answer the three policy questions. It is easier to address the `what', `how much', and `how long'
aspects when possessing a sophisticated understanding of what type of confidentiality chal-
lenge needs to be addressed.

Integrity refers to the need to ensure the unchanging and unchangeable nature of data and

118 | Chapter 4 INFOSEC - Protecting UAS Information Channels & Components
transactions. There are three types of integrity challenges to pay attention to: data, transac-
tion, and communications integrity. During this discussion, we will also discuss the concept of
nonrepudiation as an integrity concept.

Data integrity refers to the allowable and unallowable variances or changes in the actual data.
This may seem like a strange concept: why would there be allowable variances? Shouldn't all
data be kept pristine and whole? Like everything else, there are tradeoffs to consider. Consider
image compression algorithms. Some are lossy, some are lossless. A lossy image compression
algorithm loses data by design, to balance between image quality and file size. The higher reso-
lution the image, the more bandwidth required to transmit it and the more storage is required
to store it. It may be acceptable to lower data integrity for the image file if the result is oper-
ationally adequate. The key here is to understand what level of data integrity is required, what
level of variance is allowable, and how to detect malicious variations to data integrity.

Transaction integrity refers to the unchanging and provable nature of a transaction. A well-
formed transaction has several qualities; the initiator of a transaction provably initiates the
transaction, the transaction is provably received by the intended and authorized recipient, and
the transaction is provably unchanged during the exchange. For example, suppose one deposits
a check into an account. The provability of the origination of the transaction is supported by
one's signature on the check, identifying it for deposit to a specified account. The provability
of the recipient of the transaction is supported by the bank receipt, further supported by the
updated ledger entry showing the exact amount of the deposit. Each one of these steps could
be subverted; there are many scams that do exactly that. For high transactional integrity signif-
icant protections are implemented to ensure a high degree of transaction correctness, consis-
tency, and completeness. An example of a transaction that needs very high integrity protection
would be the authentication protocol for sensitive area access.

A special case in integrity is referred to as nonrepudiation. The root word `repudiate' means to
deny. When someone repudiates something, they deny it. If either party can deny their partic-
ipation in the transaction or its content, it would not be a well-formed transaction. Consider,
what if one went to the bank, deposited a check, got a receipt, and then a few days later the
bank claimed that it never happened? The bank repudiates the transaction. It is serious enough
with one's own money but becomes even more serious when the transaction is a lawful order
to execute a military mission. Neither party would want there to be an ability to repudiate the
transaction. The person executing the order would want to prove that they are operating under
a legitimate order from a superior, while the superior would want to prove that they ordered a
lawful action in accordance with policy. As a result, engineering nonrepudiation into a system
is an important consideration.

Communications integrity refers to the unchanging nature of data while it is being transmitted
from one entity to another. In this aspect, our concern is that the message itself is not cor-
rupted. Keep in mind that this aspect of integrity is not just for digital communications, but

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 119
for all communications. The challenges to integrity can result from many different problems,
including the system itself. A fun way to explore this problem is to play the game of telephone.
In this game, many people sit in a circle. The first person whispers a message to the next per-
son, as clearly as possible. The second person whispers the message to the third, the third to
the fourth, and so on. Even if every single person tries as hard as they can to be clear and enun-
ciate, the message at the end of the chain will bear little resemblance to the message that orig-
inated. The point being that to ensure the integrity of the communications, you need to pay
attention to not only the message but also to the channel.

Availability refers to the need to be able to access and use data and systems when opera-
tionally required. Obvious? It is the most straight forward of the security attributes, but that
does not mean that it is simple or trivial. What does it mean to have access when needed? For
some organizations, it is simple. Maximum availability during operational hours and mainte-
nance as required. But what if there is no down time? Then it becomes complicated. Consider a
very large enterprise spanning multiple time zones; how does one calculate availability require-
ments across the entire enterprise? Is it 100% availability required? That is almost impossible
without a very large investment. Even highly reliable phone systems only measure availability
in "five nines", 99.999% available. When considering availability, one needs to account for the
availability of many various aspects, including the data itself, the tools (including both com-
putational and other, such as pens and paper), and the infrastructure components (including,
again, both computationally based, such as networks, and physical, such as secure areas and
safes).

In summary, there are three commonly used security attributes:

  · Confidentiality;
  · Integrity, with the special case of nonrepudiation, and
  · Availability.

Security Phases

There are three security phases that we think about; protection, detection, and reaction/
correction. There are two functions for these phases. The first use is to identify the viable solu-
tions for the security requirements for an enterprise. The second use is to manage security
operations for an enterprise.

Protection is the security engineering phase in which protective measures are implemented
to meet security requirements. Protective mechanisms can consist of product technologies,
processes, and methods. They come from the specialty areas of physical, personnel, adminis-
trative, electronic, communications, and computational security. No one protective measure
can suffice to meet the needs of an enterprise, so it is important that the protective measures
be integrated to meet the widest range of requirements within company resource limitations.

120 | Chapter 4 INFOSEC - Protecting UAS Information Channels & Components
Examples of protective mechanisms include locks, curtains, computer access controls, and
cryptography.
Detection is the term in which the processes and methodologies associated with discovering
potentially damaging situations. Detection works on a timeline and every activity on that time-
line triggers the occurrence of one or more additional activities. The amount of elapsed time
between activities is critical, but shortening that time requires additional resources. Figure 4-1
shows an abstraction of the detection timeline. Note that detection is closer to the middle of
the timeline than expected. This is a crucial point: there may be a significant amount of time
between the start of an event and the detection of phenomenology that indicates an event has
occurred (or may still be underway).

                                         Figure 4-1 The Detection Timeline

       Source: Ryan, J.J.C.H., (summer, 2018). Detection Timeline.

Detection is the default status for fully operational systems. Once the system is designed, devel-
oped, and implemented, all the security controls are in place, hopefully operating correctly and
consistently, and the security team is in place, on the alert for a negative incident to happen.
This is detection. Once a negative incident happens, then the status transitions to reaction and
correction, and eventually back to protection, and once more to detection. How fast the team
can transition between phases is a function of training, experience, capabilities, and the sever-
ity of the problem(s).
A design consideration for detecting problems is the detection mechanism must be in place
before the event occurs. In some cases, it is possible to detect problems without have specific
detective mechanisms (like reading corporate secrets on the front page of the newspaper), but
in most cases that simply is not true. If you are not collecting real time data or you do not have

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 121
intrusion detection systems in place, you will not be aware that a problem is occurring in near
real time nor will you be able to reconstruct the forensics evidence for evaluation. It does no
good to install an alarm on a door after the door has been forced open and the Crown Jewels
stolen.

There are five categories of problems that require detection. The first is the occurrence of prob-
lems against the Protected Class. The second category is the occurrence of problems against
the Unprotected Class. The third category is the occurrence of problems on the Unknown
Class. The fourth category is the misuse or abuse of privilege by insiders: The Insider Class.
Finally, the fifth category of problem is the use of activities, methods, or technologies designed
to reduce the probability of detection: The Counter-Detection Class. Each of these classes
requires different approaches to detection, which is why consider each individually.

When you are designing a security architecture, scarce resources will require that you make
compromises. Some problems can be protected against with a reasonable expenditure of
resources, some cannot. Some problems may require extremely expensive protective mecha-
nisms; other problems may have such a low likelihood of occurrence such problems are not
addressed at all. This choice creates the distinction between Protected Class detection challenges
and Unprotected Class detection challenges.

Protected Class

The Protected Class detection challenges fall into two subclasses. The first is failure of the pro-
tective mechanism: detecting the occurrence of problems even though the protective mech-
anisms are in place. This is significant; if one invests time and resources to address potential
problems, those problems are clearly a priority (otherwise, why bother protecting against
them?). If the problems occurs anyway, it means that the protective mechanisms have failed in
some manner. Problem detection both alerts one to the fact that security has been compro-
mised and the need to review the protections in place. The second subclass is degradation of
the protective mechanism. Simply stated, protective mechanisms must be continually assessed
to ensure they are correctly implemented, working correctly, and remain uncompromised.
Locks rust, software updates can subvert exploit counter-measures, and people can get lazy.
Ensuring protection functionality is critical.

The Unprotected Class

The Unprotected Class detection challenge is that the first line of defense against the problems
that you chose not to protect against is, in fact, detecting the occurrence of the problem. The
possibility of a data breach was then but intentionally ignored. Placing detective mechanisms
in place to trigger a reaction to the problem is the only thing you can do to minimize potential
damage.

Unknown Class

122 | Chapter 4 INFOSEC - Protecting UAS Information Channels & Components
The final three classes are more complicated. For the Unknown Class, you do not know what
you are seeking. So simply monitoring your environment for operational aberrations becomes
your first detection method. It seems simple, but one must understand they are looking for
unknown or newly conceived scenarios.

For example, consider a spike in help desk phone calls: one management reaction might be to
shrug and think, "must be a glitch in the system," while a different reaction might be to alert
and start analyzing what might be going on. Mindset makes all the difference in detecting the
Unknown Class of problems.

Insider Class

This is true for the Insider Class as well: insiders are, by definition, trusted to operate within
the enterprise. There are varying levels of trust, but each insider has at least some level of trust.
Detecting abuse or misuse of that trust requires the same sort of awareness, proactive analy-
sis, and operational surveillance that the Unknown Class requires, but with a difference; the
detection activities should be engineered to be able to establish agency of purpose.

Counter - Detection Class

Finally, for the Counter-Detection Class, the focus of the detective efforts is to determine when
protections and detective mechanisms are being subverted. The subversion can occur in many
ways. In a way, this class of detection effort combines all the aspects of the other four prob-
lems. To tackle this problem, the use of red teams periodically testing the detective mecha-
nisms is useful, as is constant analysis of detective mechanism performance.

The Reaction/Correction phase consists of the set of activities required to continue operating
while executing the activities needed to fully recover operational capabilities. There can be
significant overlap between detection activities and reaction/correction activities, particularly
for complicated problem sets, so best practice is to have each activity have dedicated people,
resources, and management structures. Reaction/correction activities include (at the very
least) the following efforts: investigations, forensics analyses, business continuity, crisis com-
munications, and business recovery.

To summarize, there are three engineering phases for security architectures:

  · Protection
  · Detection
  · Reaction/Correction

Risk

All decisions are risk-based decisions, even if one is not actively considering risk when decid-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 123
ing. When walking down the street at 2 A.M., one makes a decision-based risk assessment asso-
ciated with the activity. When a decision to purchase a certain type of computer system, one
considers several types of risk, including the risk that the company may go out of business and
leave the company with no support. Risk minimization is essential.

There are two elements to risk decisions: the assessment of risk in the current time state (Now
Risk) and an assessment of potential changes to the risk elements over time (Future Risk). As an
entity requiring evaluation, one can think of risk as a combination of the probability that a neg-
ative incident will happen and the impact that such a terrible thing would have. For example,
the risk of your secrets being exposed is analyzed by determining the probability that imple-
mented protective mechanisms could be defeated plus the impact of data exposure. Note that
this use of the term risk is slightly different than as it is used in common parlance. Typically,
the word risk is used informally as a substitute for probability without including the impact
assessment. However, when assessing risk associated with a potential decision, including the
impact assessment gives you the additional data needed to make the subsequent management
decisions on where to expend resources to reduce risk.

Now Risk is an evaluation of the elements of risk using the information that exists currently. In
the information security community, it is hard to impossible to get actual data on the proba-
bility of terrible things happening. So, it is common to perform the analysis by estimating the
chances of terrible things happening by investigating the elements of Threats, Vulnerabilities,
and Counter-Measures. Threats exploit vulnerabilities to do terrible things. Vulnerabilities are
exploitable by threats. Counter-measures reduce the ability of threats to exploit vulnerabilities
successfully.

Threats come in two varieties: natural and man-made. Natural threats include things like fires,
hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and the odd meteorite. Yes, security planning does need to
address these elements. For example, if you are operating in a flood zone, you should make the
risk decision to put your server farm on a floor that is above the flood plain. If you live in an
earthquake-prone area, like Japan, you might want to invest in earthquake mitigation technolo-
gies. Man-made threats are problems that originate in the mind of humans. They can be real-
ized though the actions of people or through the agents of people, including animals, robots,
and software.

When considering the elements that constitute viable threats, there are some aspects we can
tease out. A credible threat requires both capability and intent. If the potential threat has capa-
bility but not intent, we call that a trusted insider. If the potential threat has intent but no
capability, there is very little the threat can accomplish. Intent can be either organic to the
individual or programmed into the threat agent (through software, training, or design). Further,
capability requires several elements. To be truly capable, a threat requires three traits:

  · the knowledge, skills, and ability needed to act;

124 | Chapter 4 INFOSEC - Protecting UAS Information Channels & Components
  · the resources to plan, develop, and execute actions;
  · and access to the target.

Understanding those elements informs as to how to design counter-measures; what can be
done to reduce or eliminate any or all the components? For example, what can be done to
reduce the probability of a trusted insider developing the intent to act maliciously? How to
reduce the probability that a threat can acquire the resources needed to act? When consider-
ing these elements, it quickly becomes obvious that there are easy and difficult things that can
be implemented. A very summary of what can be done to counter risk activities are listed here:

Intent:

  · Motivate threat to not form intent
  · Intimidate threat through implication of personal harm or danger
  · Scare threat through implication of harm to reputation, livelihood, etc.
  · Discourage action through psychological motivations

Resources: Not much.

Knowledge, Skills, and Ability:

  · Limit knowledge of security details -keep the details and engineering data secret; keep
      plans and procedures secret

  · Use technologies, tools, and equipment that require highly specialized skills or training
  · Combine security elements in ways that limit the probability that a threat could easily

      develop the needed KSA
  · Pay for the development of unique systems that are not commercial off the shelf

Access:

  · Deny access through barriers
  · Deny access by use of technology such as locks
  · Deny access through checkpoints
  · Control access through I&A procedures
  · Minimize access available to all people
  · Limit speed of access
  · Limit speed of egress

Vulnerabilities, similarly, can be considered to come in two types: accidental and by design.
Accidental vulnerabilities are the result of lack of understanding, sloppiness, or unintended
consequences. The danger here is you do not know that they exist until the analysis is com-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 125
pleted. Efforts must include a search for such problems. One method used by large corpo-
rations is to search for vulnerabilities by having "bug bounties". This may work well for some
organizations but may be absolutely the wrong thing for other organizations. Vulnerabilities
that exist by design, on the other hand, should be the result of risk-based decision making.
These include decisions to connect to vulnerable networks to conduct business or using a less
than optimal engineering solution because a better one is not affordable. These types of vul-
nerabilities must be monitored, and detective measures should be considered to alert on any
attempt of a threat to exploit these vulnerabilities.

Taking the threat, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures into account gives one insight into
possible attack probability. Considering the impact of what the effects of an attack might be
provides a way to measure the relative importance of each potential. Decisions can then be
made about what to do, or not do, regarding each aspect of risk in the environment.

Now Risk decisions are based on knowledge of what is known regarding the current and past.
Future Risk analysis looks at the potential for change in the situation. Each element of a risk
decision has a change potential that varies over time. To do a competent analysis of what may
change that can cause a decision's effect to be moderated, it is necessary to do a futures analy-
sis. For example, a decision to plagiarize a dissertation made in 1987 might have been a fully
logical decision, while the impact of detection would have been very high, the probability of the
plagiarism being detected was relatively low. Fast forward to the Internet age, where plagiarism
checking is both automated and crowd-sourced, and the situation has changed tremendously.
The decision that seemed logical in 1987 has been turned on its head because of the unforeseen
technological evolution.

In considering the impact future decisions made now, one should take into consideration how
difficult it would be to change a decision should it become necessary or desirable to do so.
Some decisions simply cannot be changed, these are point decisions. The example of the pla-
giarized dissertation is a point decision. Once it is published, there is no taking it back. Other
decisions can be changed, but at a cost. Some costs are manageable. If one hires a spy, they can
be fired and then a cleanup. Some damage will be incurred, but the decision can be changed.
Some decisions more difficult to change due to costs. For example, making the decision to
standardize on a software suite for accounting and fiscal management has long term impli-
cations that can be pervasive. A more dramatic example of a long-term risk decision that can
have substantial future risk variability might be the decision to fund a new aircraft carrier: a
dramatic change in technology could make aircraft carriers obsolete.

To summarize, risk decisions are made now for future events and so all potential futures should
be considered while deciding. Over the life of a decision, future events should be monitored to
see what is emerging and what potential impacts of change might be.

Systems Engineering an Information Security Solution

126 | Chapter 4 INFOSEC - Protecting UAS Information Channels & Components
Using the ten pieces to the puzzle presented above, one now has the tools to think through an
architectural approach to developing and managing an information systems security solution.
To review, the ten pieces of the puzzle are:

  · The three policy questions
  · The three security attributes
  · The three security phases
  · The risk decision elements

Building on that, one can derive security requirements for the enterprise and then systemati-
cally identify a set of processes, technologies, and engineering approaches to address them. All
of these are done within a risk management envelope: all decisions are risk decisions.

Identifying Security Requirements for an Enterprise

Understanding what the security requirements are for an enterprise is the first step in devel-
oping and managing security solutions for that enterprise. One cannot possibly meet all
requirements; that would take more resources and have more operational impact than can be
tolerated. However, knowing which requirements are not being met gives one the ability to
monitor the unmet needs. Putting together a solution is an exercise in engineering a system,
or a system of systems. Further, every solution is time limited, so the system must be periodi-
cally re-evaluated, and the set of solutions revised, updated, and improved. This is not a point
solution effort; it is a life-cycle effort.

There are three basic types of requirements in systems engineering. These are referred to as
explicit, implicit, and derived requirements. These requirements are identified for the informa-
tion security of a system by systematically considering the three policy questions against the
three security attributes. By going through this exercise, one can concretely describe what is
required to protect the information in an enterprise. Table 4-1, a 3 x 3 matrix, specifies what is
needed in terms of policy questions and security attributes. In this table, the policy questions
are abbreviated to make it easier to read. But remember that it is important to consider the full
meaning of the questions for each cell in the matrix. Cells are renumbered to make it easier to
refer to in the discussion about requirements. Refer to this table to explore examples of secu-
rity requirements for a system.

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 127
                 Table 4-1

Confidentiality  What?  How Much?                                           How Long?
Integrity        C-1    C-2                                                 C-3
Availability     I-1    I-2                                                 I-3

When each cell is considered, requirements are identified. For example, in cell C-1, the full pol-
icy question consideration is:

       What data, systems, and operational elements need to have aspects of confidentiality pro-
       tected?

       What elements do not need confidentiality protection?

Then, as one proceeds through C-2 and C-3, one can elaborate on how much (or how little)
confidentiality protections are needed and how long they need to be kept in place (or when
they can be allowed to lapse). While this is a systematic and straightforward process. There
are many complexities in systems, addressed in previous examples, so a strong suggestion is
that this exercise be conducted by a diverse team with multi-faceted knowledge of the system
under analysis.

Explicit Requirements

The first requirements that will be identified will be the explicit requirements. These are the
ones that are defined as things that are needed in a system, independent of any implemen-
tation or technology solution. For example, an explicit requirement that may be identified in
cell C-1 could be that the existence of a sensor must be kept secret. That is an obvious type of
requirement to specify, as it reflects a specific secrecy need.

Implicit Requirements

For all explicit requirements, implicit requirements also exist. These are the requirements that
are implied by the need that is identified in the explicit requirement. What is implied by a
need to keep the existence of a sensor secret? There are many implied requirements to con-
sider. First and foremost, the sensor must be hidden from observation. Observation may be
accomplished though vision, imaging, signals interception, and other means. It is important to
then complete the analysis of the types of observation that the sensor might be subjected to.
Another implied requirement is that all individuals who observe or work with the sensor or the
sensor products must be approved to do so. Yet another implied requirement is that the sensor
products themselves be protected.

128 | Chapter 4 INFOSEC - Protecting UAS Information Channels & Components
In the matter of moments, three implied requirements have been created that come from
the single explicit requirement; more can develop as required. This is the power of working
through these analyses; by extrapolating what it would take to meet an explicit requirement,
we identify the systemic elements that also need to be considered. Nothing lives in an isolated
space; surrounding system components must be considered.

Derived Requirements

Beyond explicit and implicit requirements, there are derived requirements. Derived require-
ments are the things that are necessary conditions for the environment. These, unfortunately,
are sometimes simply assumed in a system. That can lead to hilarious outcomes, such as deliv-
ering a fully-compliant system to a customer that is totally unusable because it lacks a user
interface.

Derived requirements are important to consider; it is usually best to start by reviewing the
implicit requirements. One of the implicit requirements for the secret sensor system was that
all individuals who observe or work with the sensor or the sensor products must be authorized.
There are many requirements that can be derived from this single implicit requirement. One is
that a system exists to vet individuals for trustworthiness. Another is that only vetted individ-
uals are authorized to work or with the sensor. Another is that there are controls that check to
make sure that only vetted and authorized individuals get access to the sensor and to the area
in which the sensor is housed.

There is power in this approach to identifying explicit requirements and then identifying the
underlying implicit and derived requirements. Going through the exercise of thinking through
all these things can not only help one understand the management needs of the environment,
it can also point to possibilities for efficiencies in operational processes. At the very least, it
provides one with a comprehensive understanding of what the security needs are for a system,
a system of systems, or an enterprise.

Security Solutions Consideration

Once a set of requirements is created, one can start to parse out how to develop and implement
solutions for each requirement. Note well: no enterprise can afford all potential solutions, so
this will start out as a list of options, which would then need to be winnowed down based on
enterprise priorities, operational realities, and resource availability.

Table 4-2 presents a very simplified view of starting the process. Simplified because informa-
tion exists in many divergent phases. A trivial way of thinking about the information phases
include processing, storage, and transmission. That is a normal abstraction, but it overlooks
some very specialized states that may warrant separate consideration according to enterprise
needs. A more layered approach to information states is that of input, output, processing, local
communications, external communications, temporary storage, permanent storage, and dis-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 129
play. In any event, when considering how to select security solutions, it is important to con-
sider which states the solution works for and which ones it fails.

                                                                                       I-RC

                                                                                       A-RC

Look at an example of how this table can be used to explore security solutions. For cell C-P,
assume that requirements have been identified for protecting the confidentiality of informa-
tion in the display state. Some technologies that can contribute to meeting this requirement
include putting curtains on the windows and restricting access to the area. But these solutions
would be useless if the operational environment were an economy seat on a commercial flight.
In this case, other solutions would be considered. The crucial point? The solutions need to
match the operational environment as well as meet the statement of requirement.

UAS Security Challenges

Now with a basic understanding of how to think about the information security challenges in
an operational enterprise, consider what that mean for UASs. Again, any specific security solu-
tion will need to be unique to the enterprise; solutions appropriate for commercial delivery
drones may not be sufficient for national security operations of a sensitive nature. Some ele-
ments that may require security consideration; communications, data processing systems,
sensors, location, and control systems.

Communications may need to have confidentiality, integrity, and availability protected. Data
processing systems may have high integrity needs as well as some availability needs. Sensors
may need high confidentiality and integrity requirements. Location may be sensitive based on
mission and so may have contextual security needs. Control systems may need to have strong
integrity and availability needs.

Discussion Questions

Test your understanding of the material presented in this chapter by thinking through the fol-
lowing questions. Discuss them with other people. There are some subtleties that are fascinat-
ing to explore.

  1. Explore the differences and similarities of confidentiality and privacy. How do the con-

130 | Chapter 4 INFOSEC - Protecting UAS Information Channels & Components
      cepts overlap? How are they distinctly different? What does that mean in terms of man-
      aging privacy?
 2. How is the concept of integrity different from truthfulness?
 3. How is the concept of ownership different from availability?
 4. How does custodial responsibility for information translate into security requirements?
      What are some of the explicit, implicit, and derived requirements?
 5. What security requirements are needed during the acquisition of sensitive equipment,
      material, or information? What are some of the explicit, implicit, and derived require-
      ments?
 6. What security requirements are needed for the management of systems, particularly
      information processing systems? Think about installing patches or software updates:
      what security controls are needed during these processes?

Chapter 5 Intelligence & Red Teaming

This Chapter will introduce the basic concepts in intelligence and build upon these concepts
to explore their role in attack/defend scenarios.

Student learning objectives. Upon completion of this chapter, students should be able to:

  · Identify, describe, and explain the intelligence cycle.
  · Identify common problems in intelligence data collection.
  · Distinguish between reputation, reliability, and quality of intelligence sources.
  · Describe the types of sources for intelligence data.
  · Identify distinct types of open sources.
  · Describe how open sources can be used to develop intelligence assessments.
  · Describe the concept of attack/defend scenarios in intelligence requirements terms.
  · Develop attack/defend scenarios for UAS.

Basic Concepts in Intelligence

The word intelligence can have several meanings. In one instance, it is an estimate of how capa-
bly a person can reason and think. In another, it refers to the data that has been collected for
purposes of divining purpose, capability, or meaning. In yet another, it refers to the process by
which information is collected and processed. In this chapter, intelligence refers to processes
by which intelligence data are collected, processed, and analyzed.

The fundamental reason for having an intelligence process is to collect and evaluate informa-
tion that informs personnel about the operating environment. Governments have intelligence
functions to make better informed decisions. Businesses have intelligence functions to be more
effective and competitive. This is nothing new; intelligence functions are as old as mankind
itself. As expected, they have grown more sophisticated and capable, with the advances in
both product and process technologies. By integrating such technologies into intelligence
processes, the timeliness and the scale of the data collected is greatly improved. Further, the
integration of information processing technologies into everyday life has vastly increased the
opportunities for data collection.

The Intelligence Cycle

The functions related to intelligence occur in phases known as the intelligence cycle. In simple
terms the cycle consists of four phases: requirements, collection, analysis, and reporting. This

                                                                                                      R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and
                                                                                                                                                                                  J.P. Hood | 133
  section will describe the phases general terms. Note that some organizations have specific
  terms for the functions that are addressed here.1

  The requirements phase defines/identifies data of interest to the organization. For example,
  a business executive may identify the pricing strategy of competitors as desirable data. The
  executive would create a requirement statement for the business intelligence function, which
  would have the responsibility to try to meet the requirement. Similarly, a government leader
  may want to understand the military readiness of an adversary. That leader would, through
  established processes, require a statement of requirement to be generated and entered the
  intelligence community processes.
  The aggregated set of requirements statements are the tasking for the intelligence process: and
  determines what data needs to be collected. When a requirement is generated, it is catego-
  rized in three ways; importance, transience, and complexity. These three categories help prior-
  itize resource allocation to meet requirements. Obviously, the importance of the required data
  is something that should impact collection priority. Critical data needs should be met before
  a low priority data requirement. The transience of data is also a principal factor. Transience
  refers to how long the data will be available. The data may be fleeting in nature, like a radioac-
  tive emission, or may be available for collection only during a limited window. Finally, the com-
  plexity of the data needed affects how much planning must be done to assure successful data

  book. Chapter 14 also covers the intelligence process in terms of vulnerabilities of UAS and EW.

requirements. Please note: these are hypothetical examples for illustrative purposes only.

Once requirements are prioritized, they are transferred to the collection function. The job of
the collection function is just that, to collect data. Several types of data can be collected in
diverse ways. To specify how the data will be collected, appropriate mechanisms need to be
identified and allocated to the collection effort. I.E., sources of data and methods for data col-
lection must be considered.

For example, collecting the data associated with a competitor's pricing strategy for a contract
can be tricky. One strategy would be to infiltrate the organization and steal the strategy. This
approach has obvious legal implications that make it less attractive option. Another method
would be to go dumpster diving, sift through the garbage thrown out by the competitor, to
extract clues and hints. This approach would only work if the garbage was both accessible and
not shredded. A third alternative would be to send people to the local establishments to eaves-
drop on conversations. Each of these approaches requires different collection strategies and
resources.

The data collected may or may not, fully or partially, fulfill the stated requirement. Collected
data that fully meets the requirement is complete and unambiguous. Data that only partially
meets requirement may have some ambiguity or be missing some aspects. Data that does not
meet any requirements is found to be useless; lacking in specificity and/or trustworthiness.
The collected data is adjudicated during the analysis phase of the cycle. There are three steps
in the analysis phase are structural analysis, content analysis, and fusion. Structural analy-
sis consists mostly of describing the data. The descriptions can contain identifiers, such as
index numbers and metadata, as well as actual descriptive data, such as statistical information.
Structural analysis is important for both administration (record keeping) and post hoc studies
conducted on the aggregated data. Content analysis is what most people think of as analysis,
examining the actual data to derive meaning and insight. Fusion occurs when multiple types or

R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 135
multiple source data are analyzed together. The benefit of fusion is that increased nuance can
be parsed out of the data.

Once the analysis is completed, the results of the analysis is reported. The reporting phase
consists of several several types of reporting efforts. First, and most obviously, there is results
reporting, the delivery of the analyzed data to the required personnel. Results reports can
include more than the data itself. The results can also include ancillary information discovered
that relates to the original need, an assessment of the implications of the data, and caveats
associated with the estimated reliability of the information. A second type of reporting is feed-
back reporting. Feedback reporting provides information to the other phases of the cycle.
Types of reports that might be included are work product flow rates, percentage of needs met,
identification of derived data needs based on the analytical process, and quality assessments.
Finally, strategic intelligence reports can be generated based on aggregated analysis of many
different results reports over a significant portion of an area of interest. Figure 5-1 shows the
intelligence cycle in graphic form.

Common Problems in Intelligence

The motto for an intelligence analyst should be to believe nothing fully until it verified through
multiple and distinctly dissimilar sources. There are too many people trying to obfuscate and
too many challenges in interpreting the actual meaning from many different scraps of data.
There are also many challenges associated with collecting and analyzing intelligence that go
beyond simple access to the information. In general, there are three primary problems that
must be considered. These are quality of data, bias in data interpretation, and circular report-
ing.

Data quality is an obvious issue for intelligence processes. This general problem set includes
counter-intelligence activities, such as deception. When estimating the quality of the collected
data, both the source and any methods that the data has been subject to must be weighed.
Sources of data should be rated for truthfulness and informativeness. This discussion includes
all types of sources, from instruments to people.

Truthfulness is an estimate of how close the data is to actuality. This can be an interesting mea-
sure, in that the data may be a complete falsehood but an accurate replica of actual data. For
example, a business may be setting a pricing strategy based on wildly inaccurate material cost
estimates. Thus, the data collected that reveal the inaccurate cost estimates is a truthful set of
data, even though it reveals false information. A better example would be sending out info on
false target knowing signal interception is a certainty.

A source may be rated as having a reputation for providing truthful data, sometimes truthful
data, or mostly untruthful data. While sources that have a reputation for providing truthful data
are obviously prized, a source that is known for repeatedly providing untruthful data can also

136 | Chapter 5 Intelligence & Red Teaming
be useful for understanding the nature of the competitive landscape. Consider the repeated
provision of untruthful data can hardly be considered an accident or coincidence. Ergo, the
type and content of the untruthful data can provide insight into the adversary. All data is useful,
just for different purposes.

Informativeness is the measure of how much added value the source provides to the intel-
ligence process. High informative data sources provide a significant added value, while low
informative sources provide little. Low informative sources are not necessarily bad; sometimes
gathering a lot of low informative data sets can be extremely revealing in the aggregate. For
example, a highly informative data source could provide you with the actual pricing strategy
document for a company. Alternatively, low informative data sources could provide you with all
the component elements that feed into a pricing strategy; salaries, qualifications, etc.

Combining truthfulness and informativeness provide a way of rating data sources. For scientific
instruments, this is generally couched in terms like type 1 and type 2 error rates, as well as cal-
ibration. For publication sources, this might be discussed in terms of media bias, peer review,
and impact factor. For human sources, terms such as reliability and reputation might be used.

Bias is a challenge for both human and algorithmic interpretation of data. Why algorithmic?
Because humans write the algorithms. There are conscious and unconscious forms of bias, all
of which must be addressed. A personal preference for uniformity of data may lead an analyst
to treat various kinds of data differently, inadvertently skewing the results. Another type of bias
may arise from a desire to see data that confirms suspicions. When such data is seen, it may be
treated with more gravity than other data. Sufficiency introduces another type of bias, when
analysts are satisfied that the data is complete, they may stop looking, even though they have
only a small percentage of available data. Yet another form of bias can arise from the analyst
overlooking subtle clues in favor of obvious data. Over-reliance of single source information
also leads to interpretative bias. The bottom line is that data interpretation is a subtle art that
must be approached carefully.

Circular reporting can sneak into intelligence processes in ways that make it difficult to recog-
nize and manage. A circular reporting problem occurs when data that is collected and analyzed
by one component of an intelligence function serves as input to another component, mas-
querading as new data. To the uninitiated, this may seem like a bizarre problem, but it happens
too frequently in both very large intelligence functions and in news reporting. Examine a hypo-
thetical news report. News service A reports that seven civilians have been killed in a suicide
bomb attack. The wire services pick this up this report and publicize it. News service B then
republishes the material but alters some of the wording. The wire services pick up this second
report and repeat the process. News service A sees that report and takes it as confirmation
of its original report, even though it is nothing more than its original report repackaged. This
problem of circular reporting compounds the problems of bias in the analysis of intelligence
data significantly and must be addressed.

Sources of Intelligence Data

Intelligence data has many diverse sources. Some of the more common sources are described
in this section.

The earliest form of intelligence source is also the most easily understood. Human intelligence,
or HUMINT, is intelligence data that is collected by human beings. HUMINT includes collec-
table information: stolen papers, intercepted letters, overheard conversations, observations,
and physical artifacts. HUMINT need not be collected by specially trained agents, although
that is a key role for them. HUMINT can come from travelers returning from a vacation, from
chance encounters at conferences, or from interactions at parties. Because of the power of the
human brain as a general processing system, HUMINT can be an amazingly important source
of information.

Some technical data requires special technologies for collection. Humans are great at observ-
ing information in the visual light spectrum and hearing things within normal hearing ranges
but are not much good at collecting infrared or encoded digital signals. For these types of
data, special sources are required. Imagery Intelligence, or IMINT, uses imaging capabilities to
collect data. Signals Intelligence, or SIGINT, is a combination of different intelligence sources.
SIGINT includes Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronics Intelligence (ELINT).
COMINT is the collection and analysis of communications through various channels. This
includes the content of the communications (the internals) and the external routing informa-
tion; the return address, the intended recipient, the content and time of the transmission, etc.
Sometimes referred to as metadata; the data that describes the facts of the communication.
ELINT is like COMINT, in that it is the collection of signals electronically transmitted.

As information technology expands and becomes incorporated into everyday life, specialized
forms of intelligence data collection and analysis have been developed to focus on the material
from special sources. Some of these are obvious, such as Financial and Geographic Intelligence.
But other sources are sufficiently specialized to warrant designation. These include Measure-
ment and Signature Intelligences (MASINT) and Cyber Intelligence.

Countering these extremely specialized technical sources is Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).
OSINT takes advantage of the Internet and other open sources of information, to build robust
analytical portraits of targets of interest. For example, consider an OSINT analysis of a com-
petitive business. The types of open source information may include employment ads, floor
plans, financial filings, and leadership profiles. Consider a business that is running employment
ads for quantum computer specialists, whose floor plans include laboratories, whose financial
filings include speculative notices regarding technological risk associated with research, and
whose leadership includes people who have long histories in the communications business. Are
they more likely to be developing a quantum communications capability or a space vehicle?

138 | Chapter 5 Intelligence & Red Teaming
The fact of the matter is that the residue of an enterprise's operations are an incredibly rich
source of information. Open source data can be extracted from social media, conventional
media sources, scientific publications, press releases, public speeches, financial filings, legal
filings, official documents, and administrative documents. With the availability of powerful
datasets at local libraries, it can be quite cost effective to leverage open source intelligence.

Combining data from different sources can assist in intelligence analysis. One use is detecting
deception. Another of use is building a more complete and sophisticated knowledge of capabil-
ities. Combining static imagery, video, and signals data can provide a structured understanding
of the control and capabilities of a smart munition.

Understanding Attack/Defend as a Tool

It is one thing to collect information and analyze the capabilities and intentions of an adversary.
Using that intelligence to create attack/defend scenarios takes it to the next level. There is
tremendous training experience gained from engaging in attack/defend exercises. Building
attack/defend scenarios forces one to determine the extent of one's knowledge base, poten-
tially identifying latest information requirements. Practicing attack/defend scenarios can
reveal strengths and weaknesses on both sides, which can lead to strategy development, tactics
refinements, and organizational changes.

Such scenarios can be conducted with varying levels of abstraction. At one end of the abstrac-
tion scale are simulations. At the other level are real world exercises, that use real equipment in
actual conflict conditions, albeit with constraints. In between are many different combinations
of games and exercises.

Simulations include table top games, computer programs that mimic real world interactions,
or mathematical algorithms that generate outcomes based on input values. For attack/defend
exercises, table top exercises are quite common and even have their own acronym, TTX. A
benefit of table top exercises is that complex scenarios that require human decisions can be
worked through and discussed as the game progresses. A limitation of table top exercises is
that there is typically little fidelity to real world conditions.

Real world exercises are conducted using actual equipment in conflict conditions with limita-
tions and constraints for safety and security. The benefit of real world exercises is that par-
ticipants significantly advance their knowledge and experience. The downside of real world
exercises is that they tend to be enormously expensive, expend resources, take significant time
to plan, and require extensive safety and security protocols.

Attack/defend scenarios can be viewed as a series of activities conducted by teams. The red
team acts as the adversary, attacking opponent's capabilities. The blue team acts as the defend-
ers, detecting and countering red team activities. Because these are exercises, it is important
to have safeguards and strictly delineated boundary conditions. For example, if the attack/

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 139
defend scenario includes cyber activities, a typical safeguard would be to ensure that there is
no Internet connection. This prevents adversaries from spying on the exercise, but can also
prevents accidents, such as the inadvertent penetration of a non-participatory network. While
it may appear as if it could never happen in a well-managed system, the fact of the matter is
humans make mistakes. Better safe than sorry.

Red Teaming

Red teams act as the adversary. What does that mean? One implication is that the red teams
need to know technologically how to execute attacks on the target. If the red team mimicking a
specific adversary, the members of the red team must also be knowledgeable about the strate-
gies and tactics of the actual adversary. This can include methods of attack, cultural assump-
tions about how activities occur, and organizational constraints on command and control.

To technologically execute attacks on the target requires a set of activities. First, the target
must be identified. In attack/defend scenarios, this might or might not be specified. Assuming
it has not been specified, the first thing to do would be to conduct reconnaissance activities
to identify potential targets. There are interesting implications here. Conducting reconnais-
sance is much more than simply a visual assessment. Depending on the type of target and its
location, diverse types of intelligence sources might be needed to collect the information to
identify potential targets. This challenge is particularly tricky when the potential targets are
moving, such as airborne platforms.

Once the potential targets have been identified, then the capabilities and weaknesses need to
be cataloged. This is done by probing and testing. For example, if the target of a red team exer-
cise is a computer system on an unmanned aerial system, then one-way weaknesses can be
potentially identified through analysis of attempts to connect to the system. Error messages
can be useful, in that they can reveal information about why an error occurred.

After the capabilities and weaknesses of the targets are cataloged, an attack plan is created.
This plan allocates resources in a prioritized pattern to execute a strategy to achieve a spec-
ified result. Resources include both human operators and tools, such as weapons. If the red
team is mimicking an actual adversary, this plan must mirror the normal processes of the
adversary. If not, then the red team is free to develop their own plan. Once the plan is in place,
the red team executes the plan, possibly making real time adjustments in response to changes
in conditions, discovery of new information, or to ward off defenses.

The most important result of the red team exercise is knowledge. It should be collected at
every step of the exercise. All activities should be noted. This can accomplish through film-
ing, recording, instrument readings, or taking notes. Generally, it is best to have one or more
observers collecting the data. After the exercise has concluded, it is very important for the
actual team members to immediately conduct a hot wash-up; a real time review of what was

140 | Chapter 5 Intelligence & Red Teaming
successful, what as not, and lessons learned. Their individual impressions and observations can
be extremely valuable to developing the knowledge and capabilities of the enterprise.

Blue Teaming

The blue team is the defending team. Their challenge is as complex, perhaps more so, than the
red team. In order to defend a target, the blue team needs to have full knowledge of the tar-
get, including technical capabilities and weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and operational patterns.
There should be detection mechanisms in place to alert the blue team to adversarial actions.
Additionally, the blue team needs to be on the lookout for stealthy or unexpected adversarial
activities. Finally, the blue team needs to be able to stop adversarial actions and remediate any
harm done.

Having full knowledge of each potential target is a daunting task. Obviously, not any one person
can full knowledge of a complex system. This is where team composition becomes important.
The team must possess a variety of capabilities, spanning technical to operational knowledge
sets. Running many exercises can assist in identifying areas that need additional expertise as
well as broaden experience. One possible problem in some systems is that the knowledge of
the vulnerabilities and remedies may be extremely sensitive. It may be necessary for some blue
teams to have compartmentalized knowledge areas; a common set, a sensitive set, and a closely
held set. This becomes a challenge for both constituting the team and managing the interac-
tions of the team members.

The detection mechanisms the blue team relies on should be ubiquitous. It does no good to
have special detection mechanisms simply for exercises. The blue team needs to be operating
in as close to a real environment as possible. The conduct and result of the exercise should be
a substantial input to planned improvements in the system. The feedback from the blue team
is an important part of that.

Recall in Chapter 4 the author discussed the classes of events that needed to be detected. The
blue team needs to address each detection challenge while planning their defenses, including
detection of the unanticipated or exotic activities. The blue team cannot simply rely on detec-
tion capabilities but must be on the alert for any unusual activity and be prepared to react as
necessary. The red team is motivated to overcome blue team defenses. The blue team needs to
be on constant alert.

When the blue team detects red team activities, they need to have plans and procedures on
how to mitigate these actions. This implies that the blue team has considered and practiced
reacting to various activities. Part of that practice should include command and control of
actions. Clean lines of communications with fail-over procedures, if a link in the chain of com-
mand is disabled or unavailable, is critical to effective team action. Ad hoc responses may be
necessary, particularly in the case of unexpected red team activity, but the command and con-

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 141
trol of the ad hoc response execution is just as important as it is to preplanned activity execu-
tion.

Blue team experiences are just as important to knowledge development as red team expe-
riences. During exercises, all activities should be logged, just like red team activities. Again,
this can be done through filming, recording, instrument readings, or through taking notes.
Observers should be responsible for collecting data. The blue team should also conduct a hot
wash-up of their experiences. Both the team members' individual impressions and observa-
tions are extremely valuable to developing the knowledge and capabilities of the enterprise.

Benefits

An obvious benefit of attack/defend exercises is building expertise. Another obvious benefit is
testing the target system and developing improvements to its defenses. Less obvious benefits
include developing new tactics and techniques, discovering innovations, and creating stronger
team relationships.

Operator expertise is an important benefit. While marginal improvements for individuals can
be achieved simply by working through a scenario, improving how the team interacts is also a
desired outcome. When teamwork improves, sharing of knowledge is an added benefit. Team-
mates who trust and value each other share information, ideas, and techniques, improving both
individuals and the team. Leveraging this synergy during team activity reviews can result in
powerful advances. The secret is to truly value each person's contribution; no person should
be marginalized or made to be a scapegoat for any real or perceived failure. The value of exer-
cises is in learning and improving. There should be no penalties for making mistakes. Learning
occurs from making mistakes and seeing the consequences.

Testing the target system in not simply a matter of seeing what the red team accomplish.
The target system is comprised of technologies, people, and organizational constructs. Each
of these can potentially be improved and refined through probing, testing, and attacking.
Improvements that are discovered through attack/defend exercises can be as trivial as
improving the chain of command. Table top exercises in disaster recovery scenarios often
reveal that there are few plans for replacing people who fall ill or are unable to communicate
with the rest of the team. In fact, one of the best stress tests for organizations is to do a table
top exercise of a common operational scenario and then randomly remove players how the
organization reacts without them. Simple insights can lead to easy improvements that greatly
benefit the organization as a whole. Individual interactions with technologies during exercises
can also reveal needed changes. Reviewing all the collected material from the exercise should
be done with these types of insights in mind.

While attack/defend scenarios tend to focus on how well the defense is conducted, one of
the more powerful outcomes could benefit the offense; the development of new tactics, tech-

142 | Chapter 5 Intelligence & Red Teaming
niques, and procedures in adversarial situations. Careful recording of red team activities and
enabling members to test innovative approaches can be very important benefits to the entirety
of operational needs.

Discussion Questions

Test your understanding of the material by thinking through the following questions. Discuss
them with other people. Can you think of more questions that would be useful?

  1. Devise a table top exercise for a kinetic attack on a surveillance drone. Identify an adver-
      sary, select a kinetic attack, and lay out the attack scenario in phases. Who should partici-
      pate in this exercise? What questions and decisions should be considered at each step in
      the exercise? Consider all the elements of national power while creating this exercise;
      diplomacy, information, military, and economy.

 2. What kind of intelligence would be needed to set the stage for such a table top exercise?
      What sources would need to be used?

 3. Imagine that you have been asked to command a blue team for a UAS ground station
      attack/defend exercise. What types of people would you want on your team? How would
      you organize your team?

 4. Imagine instead that you have been asked to command a red team for a UAS ground sta-
      tion attack/defend exercise. What types of people would you want on your team? How
      would you organize your team?

 5. For the attack/defend scenario imagined in challenges 3 and 4, how would you organize
      the observation aspects? What types of technology would you want to use? How would
      you collate and curate the information collected? What kinds of reports would you want
      to develop at the end of the exercise?

 Chapter 6: Case Studies in Risk for UAS

  This chapter illustrates the material presented in Chapters 4 and 5 using case studies. These
  cases are drawn from news reporting, with sources provided.

  Student learning objectives. After reading this chapter, students should be able to do the fol-
  lowing:

  -- Apply pragmatic risk analysis to operational decisions;

  -- Understand the benefits of studying the history of how things go wrong; and

  -- Appreciate the integration of security and intelligence.

  Case 1: When the Enemy Hacks Your Data Stream

  On February 23, 2016, Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian on suspicion of hacking into
  Israeli drones.1 Details of the case are meager, but it appears that Majd Ouida, 22 at the time
  of his arrest, had managed to breach protections and obtain access to Israeli surveillance data
  from the drones from 2011 to 2014.2 Alternatively, he may simply have just collected the trans-
  missions using appropriate antennas and processing technology; they are broadcast, after all.
  As David Axe pointed out, "what's really impressive is the fact that Israeli authorities caught
  him allegedly doing so. That's because there's no straightforward way to know whether some-
  one has intercepted your drone video."3

  The question that bubbles up to the top is: "how did the Israelis know that their data was being
  collected by unauthorized people?" This is a classic confidentiality detection problem. When
  secrets have been stolen in physical form, at least the physical artifact is missing. But when
  a copy is surreptitiously made, or a conversation is overheard, how can you detect that your
  secrecy has been compromised? Think back to the example of the competitor's pricing strategy
  in Chapter 5. If someone snuck into the building and took a photo of the strategy, how would

the competitor know that their secrecy had been violated? If no detection capabilities were in
place, such a theft might remain undetected indefinitely.

There are ways to detect violation of confidentiality, but most of them must be engineered
into an enterprise before the compromise occurs. These include both technical and procedural
solutions. Identifying the potential for secrecy compromise is an important first step. This sce-
nario is where attack/defend exercises are valuable. Challenging a red team to figure out how
to access the information collected by a sensor will reveal interesting weaknesses and oppor-
tunities to engineer solutions.

Questions to consider:

  · What are the tactical implications for the adversary having access to your surveillance
      data?

  · What are the strategic implications of the adversary having access to your surveillance
      data?

  · How would you design an attack/defend exercise to focus on confidentiality compro-
      mise?

  · How would understanding the intelligence efforts of an adversary help you to understand
      which weaknesses to focus on?

  · What surveillance efforts are available in discovering the compromise of secrets?
  · What are the costs and benefits of implementing cryptography for broadcasts from

      drones?
  · Could you use this known compromise as a way of inserting misleading information into

      the adversary's decision processes?

Case 2: When Your Drone Goes Missing

Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are, by nature, unmanned. This implies the control of the sys-
tem, such as navigation, is comprised of some combination of remote control and autonomous
pre-programmed decision. In the event of loss of remote connectivity, the UAS is typically pro-
vided with a set of pre-programmed safe landing sites that conform to its mission profile.

When a UAS is sent into hostile territory, one foreseeable risk is the adversary may attempt to
shoot it down. Another foreseeable risk is capturing the UAS, either in whole or in part.

This happened in December 2011, when Iran captured and displayed, to great propaganda fan-
fare, a surveillance drone operated by the U.S. The drone, a Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel,
had been operating over Afghanistan near the Iranian border. The Iranians claimed that they
captured the RQ-170 through cyber warfare means. They later claimed that that they were able
to decode all the stored data from the RQ-170 sensor systems. Various claims have been made
by both the US and Iran on how the capture was made and under what circumstances. These

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 145
  claims include GPS spoofing, cyber intrusion into the control system, and physical damage. The
  US demanded the return of the RQ-170. Iran countered those demands by alleging that Iranian
  airspace had been violated and that international laws had been violated. By 2016, Iran claimed
  to have reversed engineered the design of the RQ-170 and created their own version. The event
  remained in the news for several years.4

  Questions remain; did the drone fail or was it intentionally brought down? One possibility is the
  RQ-170 failed in flight and crash landed in an area where Iranians recovered it before friendly
  forces could. The question of what caused the failure is somewhat tangential. Did the sys-
  tem simply die? Were navigation systems were compromised? Was there some sort of physical
  damage to the aircraft?

  An obvious question that arises is, "why was there no self-destruct capability embedded?" After
  all, if you expect to fly near or over hostile territory, then there must be a remote risk of cap-
  ture. Refer to history for risk analysis; The U-2 piloted by Francis Gary Powers, shot down
  by the Soviet Union in 1960. The U-2 had the hallmarks of stealth (extreme altitude) and risk
  was considered low. But even so, it was shot down.5 An auto-destruct system could have been
  triggered remotely when it was determined that the system was not in friendly control. Alter-
  natively, a destruct mechanism could be logically triggered by lack of signaling, an extended
  period without authorized contact could be used as a triggering event for auto-destruct.6

  Since no system is perfect, alternatives to such a capability for self-destruction should be con-
  sidered as well. In this line of analysis, more questions come to mind. "What security con-

  trols were in place to detect the compromise of the sensitive data and equipment?" and "when
  detected, what reactions were engineered into the system to reduce the risk of data and equip-
  ment being exposed?" For example, a localized destruct capability (explosive, acid, etc.) could
  be built into the protective casing of the systems. The detect mechanism could be integrated
  into the casing itself through various means, the easiest being as an elemental part of the cas-
  ing. If the casing were to be opened, the integrity of the case would be destroyed, triggering the
  reaction. In this case, the result would be the destruction of data and/or equipment. A real-life
  example of this type of integrated detection/reaction capability can be seen in any museum.
  Fine grids of wire are integrated into casings, which, when parted, cause an electrical circuit to
  be broken, which triggers an alarm.7

  Questions to ponder:

     · How could a table top exercise have helped in discovering this risk?
     · What information would you need about adversary capabilities to understand the level of

        risk? How could you obtain that information?
     · When should you include minimal risk, but high impact problems, in your engineering

        analysis?
     · How did the capture of this UAS impact the risk to friendly forces?
     · How did the capture and analysis of the UAS alter the balance of power in the near and

        far term? Consider allies of Iran while pondering this question.

  Case 3: When Pilots Are Targeted for Assassination

  In 2016, it was widely reported that the Islamic State had compiled and published a list of US
  drone pilots, including home addresses and photographs. The list was posted online with an
  accompanying message urging followers to attack the pilots by any means available.8

  Clearly, the knowledge that you personally are a specific target differs from the usual warfare
  rules of engagement. , where a person in a uniform is a general target while on the battlefield.
  This type of tactic has occurred at least once previously, in the case of the USS Vincennes
  shoot-down of an Iranian civilian airliner.9

          pilots?

      · What types of security controls should be put in place to protect that data?
      · How would those security controls increase the complexity of UAS operations?
      · What are the risk trade-offs?

    Case 4: When Commercial Drones Spy Domestically

    In 2017, stories began to emerge alleging that a commercial drone manufactured by DJI, Inc,
    a Chinese company, was collecting data about U.S. infrastructure and sending it back to
    China.101112 The stories stemmed from a memo that was issued in August 2017 from the Los
    Angeles office of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The memo stated that the office
    assessed, "with moderate confidence that Chinese-based company DJI Science and Technol-
    ogy is providing U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese gov-
    ernment" and "with high confidence the company is selectively targeting government and
    privately owned entities within these sectors to expand its ability to collect and exploit sensi-
    tive U.S. data."13 The memo, originally classified as Law Enforcement Sensitive, was leaked.14

    It is not optimal to use equipment that surreptitiously collect data about your facilities and
    locale. This has been a repeated theme through the years. For example, a Popular Mechanics

   article from 1997 recounted the story of a camera placed inside a Xerox copying machine.15
   Another interesting story related to Acoustic Kitty: a cat that was operated on to embed listen-
   ing electronics inside its body for espionage purposes.1617

   Questions to be considered:

      · How do you know if you can trust your equipment?
      · Assume your equipment is in perfect working order. How would one detect clandestine

         operations?
      · How would you craft a security policy regarding equipment probing?
      · What types of operational risks does this type of activity pose, and how can one engineer

         countermeasures to mitigate it?
      · How would one use an attack/defend exercise to test for these activities?
      · What would an adversary gain from this type of intelligence activity?
      · What risk did DJI expose China to when they implemented these measurements into their

         equipment? Consider all the elements of national power; Diplomatic, Information, Mili-
         tary, and Economic (DIME).
      · What could one gain from discovering and exploiting this intelligence capability without
         exposing one's knowledge to the adversary?

   Case 5: The Drone That Steals Your Wi-Fi Password

   Security researchers have discovered substantial activity of small UASs, including spying, data
   theft, and other nefarious acts. The "Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform, or WASP, ... is
   equipped with an HD camera, a cigarette-pack sized on-board Linux computer packed with
   network-hacking tools including the BackTrack testing toolset and a custom-built 340-mil-
   lion-word dictionary for brute-force guessing of passwords, and eleven antennae." As one
   researcher, describing his invention, said "This is like Black Hat's Greatest Hits. And it flies."18

   As a rare spot of good news, other researchers have developed detection capabilities for this
   type of activity, "someone using only a laptop and an object that flickers can detect if someone
   is using a drone to spy on them."19 Meanwhile, UASs are getting smaller and are being imple-
   mented in swarms.

   These are both security and intelligence issues. The confidentiality issues are paramount; hav-
   ing secrets stolen electronically or using video is a significant problem. The next level of threat
   to be concerned about is the infiltration of bad data, misleading data, meaconing signals, and
   jamming signals into SOP.

   Questions to ponder:

      · What types of intelligence could help detect whether data integrity is being attacked?
      · What level of surveillance is required to detect unauthorized UASs operating near or in

         your sensitive areas?
      · What level of operational security training for personnel is required to reduce the poten-

         tial impact of these types of attacks?
      · How can these threats be included in attack/defend scenarios?

   Concluding Thoughts

   These five cases are real world examples. Unfortunately, the enemy always gets a vote. Keeping
   up with developments and news from the security and intelligence communities can be time
   intensive. A management best practice; divvy up the work. Have team members research
   diverse sources and report back on interesting developments. Make learning about advances
   an important part of team activities. Learn from your peers. Participate in professional net-
   works. Go to conferences and listen to the experts. There is too much to know for any one per-
   son, so you need to develop your personal team as well as participate in a professional team.

Conflict Detection

Student Learning Objectives

In Chapter 3: Understanding Hostile Use and Cyber-Vulnerabilities of UAS: Components, Auton-
omy Vs. Automation, Sensors, SAA, SCADA and Cyber Attack Taxonomy, the student was exposed
to the Counter UAS problem and UAS Vulnerabilities. The heart of any UAS system are its Sense
and Avoid Systems (SAA). It is the key to understanding threats and vulnerabilities of the UAS.
Understanding SAA methodologies, conflict detection and conflict resolution principles is best
practice. In Chapter 7, the student was introduced to SAA sensing practice and a logic case
for conflict detection and resolution using the sensing data. Along with Chapter 8: Designing
UAS systems for Stealth and Chapter 9 Smart Skies Project, the student should be versed on the
dynamics and importance of SAA.

Sense and Avoid (SAA) Function

"The purpose/function of SAA is to remove and replace a human pilot, to detect and resolve
certain flight hazard s. Hazards consist of other traffic or ground objects; anything that pre-
sents a risk of collision. UAS is unmanned. SAA systems are not necessarily designed to pre-
serve the aircraft. SAA is certainly designed to prevent collisions, ground personnel, and
collateral damage to property. SAA must operate for emergency and diversionary events as well
as normal operations." (Zeitlin, 2012)

"Human pilots on manned aircraft are required to See and Avoid (also identified as SAA) haz-
ards. They do this with regular visual scans across their Forward Field of View (FFoV) to detect
another A/C." Pilot "scanning may be focused toward areas where operations are on-going
or informed by controller over radio traffic or by electronic display on an Automated Iden-
tification System (AIS) for collision avoidance." (Zeitlin, 2012) Traffic spotted means the pilot
must judge "its trajectory relative to their own A/C and determine the risk of collision and
whether an A/C maneuver is required. (Zeitlin, 2012) Humans are at disadvantage for the See
and Avoid process especially in poor weather, when backgrounds are confusing, when visibility
is reduced, or pilot workload is excessive.

UAS come in all sizes and capabilities. Those that can be outfitted with robust SaA equipment,
can overcome the human limitations. "Some UAS are too small to carry weighty SAA equip-
ment. These A/C can operate within direct radio communication of the pilot and to maintain
a Visual Line of Sight (VLoS) between pilot and A/C." (Zeitlin, 2012) Small UAS may have addi-

154 | R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter,
and J.P. Hood
  tional restrictions that preclude operating over densely populated areas, near airports, or total
  weight capacities.

  System Configurations and Subsystems

  Chapter 3 addressed onboard / off-board SAA configurations, sensors and surveillance vol-
  ume, sensor capabilities, typical sensors, coordinate systems, ground-based sensing, sensor
  parameters, self-separation schemes, SAA services and sub-functions with timeline, and
  SCADA. Additional material to these topics follows.

  Sensor Categories

  UAS robotic aircraft flights are primarily to collect data. The data collected can be broken down
  into two broad categories: in situ1 and remote sensing. These two methods are used to collect
  vast amounts of intelligence, including an enemy's dispositions of forces and probable inten-
  tions. (Marshall, 2016)

  In situ Sensing

  In situ sensing in a UAS means the aircraft is transported to the location where measurements
  are to be made. There are two methods: brute force on the aircrafts control inputs [such as
  turning into a storm to measure the vehicles responses] or measure an attribute at the loca-
  tion directly. In the former, the UAS is forced to respond to a stimulus or environmental or
  state parameter. In the latter, the environmental or state attribute is measured at the location
  while the aircraft transits the location. Measuring gas composition and temperature changes
  are examples of the latter, more passive approach. (Marshall, 2016)

  Remote Sensing

  Remote sensing is the process of measuring an object of interest from a distance. This is
  done by detecting and measuring the effects of said object, usually in the form of emitted or
  reflected particles and/or waves. (Marshall, 2016) Remote sensing is not dependent on plat-
  form or application. There are three broad categories of remote sensing: terrestrial, airborne,
  and space-based. It is the Airborne Remote Sensing (ARS) from UAS category that is the topic
  here. ARS has a broad range of sensor options, from large multiple arrays to single sensor pick-
  up systems. There are four classes of ARS: framing, push broom, scanner, and receiver systems.
  All four classes of ARS work on most of the EMS. (Marshall, 2016) ARS work on all UAS platforms.
  Figure 7-1 (Pater, 2018) shows the wide range of drones with size comparisons. ARS equipment

1. In situ comes from Latin "in place" Merriam Webster's Dictionary defines it as "in the natural or original
  position or place."

                                                                                    R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 155
is not limited to large drones. (Marshall, 2016) The sensors performance, function and size may
vary, but they can be installed on platforms.
The emitted or reflected particles and/or waves often associated with ARS is sunlight, or EMS
Visible Light. (EMSVIS) (Marshall, 2016) Payloads that use Electro-Optical (EO) or digital cam-
eras, the sunlight enters through the lens and strikes a sensor. The light receiving lens on the
EO camera is aimed at a target and collects the sunlight that the target reflects. The target is
at a distance and the sunlight reflected to the camera is collected and the data converted to
useful intelligence.

Remote sensing systems can be divided into two categories; active and passive. Active sensors

emit EM radiation, directed at a target and then measure the reflected signal. (Marshall, 2016)
Passive sensors do not emit EM radiation, instead measuring what is emitted by other sensors
after it is reflected or as the target emits it. In UAS ARS the external target is almost always the
sun.
The EMS is broken down into bands. EM bands are segments of energy grouped together by a
common property and defined by a specific range of v It helps to understand the terminology:
Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTRA) defines the following: VNIR = Visible
light and near infrared (NIR) 400 - 1400 nm, 0.4 - 1.4 µm wavelength range (MIR); SWIR=Short-
wave infrared, 1400-3000 nm, 1.4 -3.0 µm wavelength range; and TIR = Thermal infrared = 8000
- 15000 nm, 8 -15 µm (TIR) vibrational wavelengths. (Marshall, 2016) In ARS, the bands most
commonly dealt with are in Table 7-1. (Schowengerdt, 2007)

                              Table 7-1 2007 Listing Remote Sensing Use of EMS

       Source: (Schowengerdt, 2007)

Table 7-1 illustrates that different spectrums have various sources and different surface prop-
erties that are measured by wavelength. The imaging sensor responds to specific wavelength
of incoming EM radiation. This response can be measured and calibrated. (Marshall, 2016) The
calibration process is called radiometric calibration. Once a sensor is calibrated for a subset of
the EMS, the sensor response can be linked directly to an individual component wavelength
of the EMS being reflected by the target. (Marshall, 2016) Another powerful aspect of ARS is
spatial continuity, which is the ability to know what is happening at a target location at every
location surrounding the target for quite a distance. (Marshall, 2016)

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 157
Units
Since chapter wavelengths are referred to in SI units, Table 7-2 shows the common units used
for EMS radiation bands.
Sensor Types
Two general types of ARS: Those that build images (Imaging sensors) and those that do not
(spot sensors).
Spot sensors
Spot sensors measure single locations and do not create an image library. They do not facilitate
special continuity, rather they opt for simplicity. (Marshall, 2016)

                Table 7-2 Common Wavelengths units for Electromagnetic Radiation

       Source: (Cummings, 2007)

Imaging Sensors

158 | Chapter 7: UAS SAA Methodologies, Conflict Detection
There are three basic ways to generate images for an ARS: Line scanners (push- brooms) and
array sensors. Line scanners move a single or small number of sensors elements back and forth
to build up a picture of the target acquisition. It is limited by pivot distance, movement speed,
and sensor processing time to build the image. Push-brooms have a fixed array of sensors,
which are the width of the final image product across the A/C path, but only one element tall.
Array sensors are like digital cameras, in that when triggered the entire array "flashes" simul-
taneously. (Marshall, 2016)

Camera

The most common UAS remote-sensor is the camera. There are four types of ARS cameras:
Visible Spectrum, Near Infrared, Infrared and Hyperspectral. (Marshall, 2016)

Visible Spectrum Cameras (VIS) and Near-Infrared (NIR) Cameras

VIS and NIR cameras operate on the same principles, the only difference being the NIR camera
sensor is sensitive to the NIR wavelengths (See Table 7-1). A VIS image consists of three pri-
mary colors, red, green, blue (RGB) to create a full color image. NIR images can capture green,
red, and NIR reflectance. The human eye cannot see NIR. Therefore, the NIR band of colors
is artificially shifted to form human-visible colors. The standard is called Color InfraRed (CIR).
(Schowengerdt, 2007)

Long-Wave Infrared Cameras (LWIR)

LWIR sensors respond to heat striking the sensors. The temperature change causes an elec-
tronic signal to be generated. Bright spots or high heat flashes can wipe out the thermographic
images. (Schowengerdt, 2007)

Infrared sensors beyond 1800 nm of the EM range can not use the same sensor materials as
for VIS or NIR cameras. (Marshall, 2016) The concept of influx of radiation into a 2-D array of
sensor element is the same. The physical and material properties of the LWIR camera recep-
tors is different. Thermographic images can be created by cryogenic cooling of camera sen-
sors. Another approach is to use room temperature sensors which have individually calibrated
sensors reacting to incoming radiation.

Hyperspectral Images

Hyperspectral images use hundreds of color channels per image (not just the single RGB chan-
nel). The resulting image is called a Hyper Cube and multi-band image. Think of taking many
pictures all at the same time and merging them. Problems for UAS use: prohibitive cost, vibra-
tion, requirement for stable Position and Orientation System (POS), power consumption, and
weight. (Marshall, 2016)

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 159
LIDAR
Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is the game changer for ARS. LIDAR uses a laser beam
and a receiver to measure the distance to the ground. LIDAR sensor systems can discriminate
between multiple return reflections of a single light pulse. (Marshall, 2016) Flash LIDAR is the
recent evolution of technology which uses a single point source emission variant of previous
versions using separate scanners and emitters. (Marshall, 2016) Research is close to having a
Geiger mode LIDAR than can measure the return of a single photon. LIDAR systems require a
very accurate measurement of time, sensor pointing angles, and sensor-spatial location. Effi-
ciency decreases with height. Range is a function of UAS capabilities. (Marshall, 2016)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
SAR systems are radar systems that map by using a band of EM spectrum in the range of 1 m
-> 1mm. (Schowengerdt, 2007) SAR sends out a radar pulse and uses the reflected radar signal
and the receivers motion to construct either a 2-D or 3-D image of the returning echoes. "The
resolution can be as high as a few centimeters (depending on the wavelength used)." (McGlone,

SAR is very computer intensive, uses long wavelengths that can pass through clouds, smoke,
and dust in the atmosphere to produce a high spatial resolution that can pick up on surface
features, such as waves and textures. (Marshall, 2016) See Figure 7-2 for an example of SAR
RADAR geometry for strip mapping option.
Live Video Gimbals for VIS, MWIR and LWIR Cameras
Live streaming images from anywhere via drone cameras use a gimbaled system, which allows
operation in a 360-degree arc. This allows continuous observation of a ground target. Many
commercially manufactured gimbals are built for military use and ISR operations. Figure 7-4
shows a TASE 500 that works with VIR, MWIR and LWIR cameras.

Predicting Conflict
"Non-recreational UAS systems are used for DDD (Dull, Dangerous, and Dirty) missions. UAS
deployment requires an ability to navigate in unknown territory, to avoid static obstacles, to
avoid moving obstacles like airplanes, birds, intruder UAS, and anything else (missiles or a
drone jammer)." (Kopiva, 2012) Figure 7-5 looks at a Drone Jammer Gun Model KWT-FZQ used
for Police interception.

162 | Chapter 7: UAS SAA Methodologies, Conflict Detection
  Unless the frequency and range are right, drone jammers are not always successful.2 UAS sys-
  tems with special counter jamming modules can maneuver away to safety.3 Military and com-
  mercial UAS systems must do their DDD work in any weather conditions, especially inclement.
  Military UAS systems must be able to detect "Identification Friend or Foe" (IFF) situations. Of
  special importance is a UAS near or in commercial controlled airspace. (Marshall, 2016) "The
  UAS must be able to Sense and Avoid (SAA) potential conflicts regarding air-traffic regulations."
  (Kopiva, 2012)

  Collision Detection and Resolution (CDR) systems are the next generation automated SAA.
  (Marshall, 2016)They use many of the sensors described here. CDR systems for UAS were the
  product of ideas and engineering development "from airport management automated tools
  like the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) (Anonymous, 2018) and the Precision Run-
  way Monitor (PRM)." (Kopiva, 2012) "Both systems are used to increase safety in the NAS and
  the mobility of air- traffic." (Kopiva, 2012) "A separate domain of investigation came from the
  robotics and AI research facilities." Scientists studying these disciplines were interested in "tra-
  jectory planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms for aerial, ground, and maritime systems."
  (Kopiva, 2012) CDR has been investigated by several researchers; two of importance are Krozel,
  who presented a survey of CDR methods, and Albaker who concentrated on CDRs for UAVs.

  Conflict Detection and Resolution Principles

  Angelov defines "Conflict as an event in which the horizontal or vertical Euclidian distance
  between two aircrafts breaks the minimal defined separation criterion." (Marshall, 2016) "The
  criterion varies based on the airspace the UAS is flying in and may be different for different
  UASs." (Kopiva, 2012) Recall Figure 3-2 Self -Separation and Collision Volume. (Marshall, 2016)

  "The Safety Zone (SZ) is defined as the horizontal and vertical separation criteria which form
  a cylindrical airspace volume around the UAS. The UAS is centered in that volume. Safety Zone
  (SZ): defined as the horizontal and vertical separation criteria which form a cylindrical airspace
  volume around the UAS. In figure 3-2 that volume is defined by 1000 ft radius and 200 ft height.
  It is assumed that initially the UAS is in the center with 100 ft above and below the A/C. Under
  no circumstances may the SZ be violated by another UAS. For CDR systems different horizontal
  and vertical criteria may apply." (Kopiva, 2012)

CDR Architecture
The Conflict Detection and Resolution (CDR) architecture is simple. "It involves five processes:

  · Sensors - Sensing for both Cooperative and Non-Cooperative A/C
  · State Prediction - Trajectory predictions and results from Sensing stage
  · Conflict Detection - Conflict as an event in which the horizontal or vertical Euclidian dis-

      tance between two aircrafts breaks the minimal defined separation criterion. Conflict as
      an event in which the horizontal or vertical Euclidian distance between two aircrafts
      breaks the minimal defined separation criterion.
  · Conflict Resolution - Determines / generates commands to pilot / autopilot
  · Evasion and Maneuver - Move in predefined programmed ways including return to Way-
      point." (Kopiva, 2012)
"The function of the CDR system is to detect a potential collision and provide the resolution in
terms of an evasion maneuver which will be executed by the UAS's autopilot.
The CDR block logic is simple." (Kopiva, 2012) The actual mathematics of predictions and mod-
els to elucidate these predictions to be carried out in real-time by the UAS autopilot are a
totally different story.

164 | Chapter 7: UAS SAA Methodologies, Conflict Detection
Sensing

The subject of sensors and various technologies used was discussed early in this chapter.
"Their purpose is to monitor the surrounding environments for both static and dynamic obsta-
cles using the onboard systems. There are two distinct types of sensors of interest; cooperative
and non-cooperative." (Kopiva, 2012)

Cooperative Sensors

"Cooperative sensors are those that receive radio signals from another aircraft using on board
equipment." (Zeitlin, 2012) "Cooperative sensors provide the ability to sense the environment
and to communicate with aircrafts equipped with the same type of sensors by establishing a
communications link." (Kopiva, 2012) The Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-
B) is an example of a cooperative sensor. (Angelov, 2012) The ADS-B transfers longitude,
latitude, altitude, speed, direction over ground, and unique UAS identification. Advanced coop-
erative sensors can transfer entire flight plan data and weather conditions. (Angelov, 2012)

Non-Cooperative Sensors

"Non-Cooperative Sensors sense the environment to gather information about obstacles and
other aircraft or UAS." (Kopiva, 2012) There are no communications links to another aircraft or
intruder UAS. "Sensor information needs to be processed to get the correct environment state
knowledge." (Kopiva, 2012)

"Types of non-cooperative sensors include Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Laser Range
Finders (LRF), Stereo Camera Systems (SCS), Single Moving Camera (SMC) and radar" Active
radar is used on the larger UAS. SMC and SCS systems are used on the smaller UAS." (Kopiva,
2012)

Intruder Aircraft

What is an intruder aircraft? As seen in Figure 7-6, Bageshwar shows that an intruder aircraft
is any aircraft that breaks the self-separation threshold, from any direction, not necessarily in
the collision path of the UAS. (Bageshwar, 2015) Note the path of intruder, the potential col-
lision point in space, the decisions and executable commands that must be processed in real
time and the maintenance of the Collision Avoidance Threshold (CAT).

Non-cooperative aircraft miss some very good information. Consider the TCAS II. Figure 7-7
shows sample terminology of Traffic Alert (TA), Resolution Advisory (RA), Proximity Intruder
Traffic (PIT) and Non-Threat Traffic (NTT) for specified criteria. (Anonymous, 2018) Figure 7-8
shows the TCAS II Conceptual framework. (Anonymous, 2018) Figure 7-9 shows what the pilot
sees in his cockpit. Wikipedia has a worthwhile description of TCAS II, its operational modes,
maneuver commands, TAs, RAs, configurations, and plenty of references.

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 165
Trajectory Prediction
"To detect and resolve a conflict, it is necessary to compare the trajectory of the UAS and the
trajectory of the sensed object." (Kopiva, 2012)
The trajectory is produced by the trajectory computation unit from the raw sensor input data.
There are four basic models for trajectory prediction. "In the nominal method, the trajectory
is predicted directly from the sensor data without considering any uncertainty of change."
(Kopiva, 2012)

"The output of the nominal trajectory predictor a single trajectory computed from the last sen-
sor scans." (Kopiva, 2012) This is very similar to boat navigators use of dead reckoning from last
known positions determined by landmark or sky information.

"The trajectory may be computed by various mathematical approaches; linear, non-linear, Tay-
lor series, or Kalman filter. The nominal prediction is good for short- predictions, where prob-
ability of change is low. " (Kopiva, 2012)
"The worse-cast prediction covers the full range of maneuvers that an aircraft may perform
and using a look-ahead time parameter computes the area where the aircraft may occur. This
computed area is the predicted trajectory." (Kopiva, 2012)
"In the probabilistic prediction approach, the uncertainties are used to model the potential vari-
ations in the trajectory. All possible trajectories are generated, and each trajectory is evaluated
by the probability function. This model is a trade-off between the nominal method and the
worse-case method. Decisions are based on the likelihood of the conflict." (Kopiva, 2012)
"The flight plan approach works only with cooperative sensors. Intruder aircraft and home air-
craft exchange flight plan data. The exact trajectory is known, and no predictions are required.
The plans are exchanged as a set of way-points together with SZ parameters. The advantage of
this model is the exact knowledge of the future trajectory. This model requires high bandwidth
for the data transmission." (Kopiva, 2012)
Conflict Detection
"Conflict is detected based on the flight plan representation obtained from the trajectory pre-
diction unit. The unit checks the flight plans (cooperating A/C) of both planes and checks

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 169
whether the safety zone of any airplane has been violated. If so, then the parameters (position
and times of possible conflict) are passed to the conflict resolution unit. Conflict detection can
be expressed in 2D Horizontal Plane, 2D Vertical Plane or 3D display." (Kopiva, 2012)

Conflict Resolution

According to Kopriva, "there are eight methods that the conflict resolution modules use to
avoid collisions: rule-based methods (RB), game theory methods (GT), field methods (F), geo-
metric methods (G), numerical optimization methods (NO), combined methods (C), multi-agent
methods (MA) and other methods (O)." (Kopiva, 2012) C and O designations are not considered
in this chapter.

  1. "Rule-based methods use a set of prescribed rules to avoid conflict. The sets of rules are
      fixed during the system design phase. This is a limited solution because it only works with
      planes in a shared air-space. This method does not permit changes or integration of fur-
      ther intentions. Little communication between planes is required." (Kopiva, 2012)

 2. "Game-theory methods (GT) use game theory to model the differential behavior of the two
      planes. GT is useful for non-cooperative conflict resolution for the short-term solution.
      Recall that non-cooperative sensing data which may be used for GT methods are gener-
      ated from radar, laser range finders, stereo cameras, moving cameras, IR cameras and EO
      cameras." (Kopiva, 2012)

 3. "Field methods (F) treat each airplane as a charged particle and are very close to a reactive
      mechanism. The field is computed based on current configuration, state, positions of the
      airplanes, weather and other uncertainties. The UAS based on its own positional data in
      this field applies control actions depending on the state of the airplane with respect to
      the field. Evasive maneuvers are generated based on the repulsive forces between the
      field. Field methods are computer intensive." (Kopiva, 2012)

 4. "Geometric methods (G) Geometric methods are really limited to two planes in the CV.
      They solve an optimization objective function based on trial evasive maneuvers. Multi
      intruder planes present a complex sub-optimal problem solution, especially when chang-
      ing parameters of altitude, velocity, and heading are factored in." (Kopiva, 2012)

 5. "Numerical optimization methods (NO) use a kinematic model of the aircraft along with a
      set of constraints and cost metrics to determine the best evasion maneuver." These are
      formal, elegant solutions to the CR problem. However, the more intruder planes, the NO
      methods become intractable. "Defining the set of constraints becomes the real challenge
      for this method." (Kopiva, 2012)

 6. "Multi-agent methods (MA) use a multi-agent framework for solution generation. Each air-
      craft is controlled by one agent. The agents communicate. The agents negotiate the solu-
      tion using various utility functions." (Kopiva, 2012)

Evasion Maneuvers

170 | Chapter 7: UAS SAA Methodologies, Conflict Detection
"The last stage in the decision model is evasion and maneuver. The output from the conflict
resolution system/module is proposed evasion maneuvers to avoid conflict and collision. UAS
have multiple maneuver options: speed-up, slow-down, keep the same speed, turn-left, turn-
right, climb, and descend. Combined maneuvers are also possible, i.e. change speed while turn-
ing left." (Kopiva, 2012)

CDR Taxonomy

Angelov proposes a taxonomy for Collision Detection and Resolution System. His Figure 6.5
(Angelov, 2012) illustrates all the subgroups expressed in the previous paragraphs. In his Table
6.1 on the following page, he describes the attributes and abbreviations used for CDR classifi-
cation broken down by the five classes in his taxonomy. (Angelov, 2012)

Discussion Questions

  1. Which one of the five CDR logic systems would be most susceptible to cyber-attacks and
      why?

 2. Propose a method to disrupt the trajectory predictions by 5% and which would report
      this error to the conflict detection stage.

 3. Research the maritime Automated Identification System for Collision Avoidance (AIS) sys-
      tem. Note the similarities to the TCAS II. Note also the GUI and information parameters
      are superior to TCAS II. Design / report on a CONOP to use the best elements and display
      of parameters of AIS to upgrade TCAS II to TCAS III

174 | Chapter 7: UAS SAA Methodologies, Conflict Detection
Chapter 8: Designing UAS Systems for

Stealth

Student Learning Objectives - The student will be introduced to the design requirements for
making a UAS stealthy, i.e. having reduced signatures for sonic, visual, thermal and radar detec-
tion.

Designing a UAS for Stealth

Stealth means "to resist detection." Stealth applies to the air vehicle and materials visible to the
enemy plus the internal SAA systems that control / create noise, heat, electromagnetic ema-
nations, and changes in light. For ISR platforms and missions, it is essential the UAS systems be
undetected in operation. "It is desirable not to alert the enemy (military) or criminals (police)
to the ISR operation." It can be assumed that the enemy is using counter-UAV operations and
weapons. Stealth design protects the air vehicle from these counter - UAV measures. Stealth
in civilian operations results in minimal environmental disturbances. (Austin, 2010)

From a personal privacy standpoint or in civil airspace it is desirable to have the UAV stealth
features turned off. [It should be as if we had flicked a switch.] (Austin, 2010)

Detection Signatures

UAS / UAVs are detected by their signatures: noise (acoustic), optical (visible), infrared (ther-
mal) and radar (radio). "These acoustic or electromagnetic emissions occur at the following
wavelengths: (Austin, 2010)

       A) Noise (acoustic) [16 m-2 cm, or 20 - 16000 Hz]

       B) Optical (visible) [0.4 - 0.7 um]

       C) Infrared (thermal) [0.75 um - 1 mm]

       D) RADAR (radio) [3 mm - 3 cm]" (Austin, 2010)

If the designer is to "reduce the vehicle detectability to an acceptable risk level, it is necessary
to reduce the received emissions or reflection of the above wavelengths (expressed as frequen-
cies) below the threshold signature value. A good portion of the UAS signatures are a function

A student might look at the answers above and ask what is the significance? What does this
really mean? Let's take a short sojourn down EMS lane. Military planners used to think in terms
of ground, sea, and air. Space came later. Now there is a "fifth realm" the electromagnetic spec-
trum (EMS). For EMS, we think in terms of frequency. The enhancement in our ability to com-
municate using the EMS is making significant changes in the way we conduct warfare. (Adamy
D. -0., 2015)
Radio communications and wireless transmissions using tuned transmitters and information
explosion of the Internet were the heart of a warfare-revolution. (Adamy D. -0., 2015)The cer-
tainty of intercept of radio communications and radar signals, and the ability to locate trans-
mitters had a significant impact on military operations. (Adamy D. -0., 2015) Intercept, jamming,
emitter location, message security, and transmission security became fundamental to war-
fare. (Adamy D. -0., 2015) The basic destructive capabilities (energy) employed in warfare have
not changed a lot. (fast-moving projectiles, significant overpressure, heat, and sound). How-
ever, the ways they are employed have changed significantly through use of the EM Spectrum
(EMS). (Adamy D. -0., 2015) Now, we guide the destructive energy of weapons towards their
intended targets using the EMS in many ways. Also, the EW specialist uses EMS to prevent
those weapons from hitting their intended targets (US), (Adamy D. -0., 2015) Sometimes the
destruction of communications capability by an enemy is a goal.
The battlespace, which once had only four dimensions (latitude, longitude, elevation and time
[before radio]) now has a fifth dimension: frequency. (Adamy D. -0., 2015) See Table 8-1 Battle-
space Dimensions.

Bandwidth is defined as the range within a band of wavelengths, frequencies or energy. Think
of it as a range of radio frequencies occupied by a modulated carrier wave, assigned to a service
over which a device can operate. Bandwidth is also the capacity for data transfer of electri-
cal communications system. Range has a significant impact on radio transmission. Depending
on the environment, the strength of a received signal, T, is a function of the square or fourth
power of a distance, d, from the transmitter.

A closer transmitter will do a better job of receiving a signal and can usually locate the
transmitter more accurately. (Adamy D. -0., 2015) Once we depend on inputs from multiple
receivers, the network becomes central to our war making ability. [Think UAS Team collabora-
tion.] We have now entered net-centric warfare. (Adamy D. -0., 2015)

Thinking again about a team or swarm of UAS, the low-hanging fruit target is US communica-
tions. We depend on connectivity in everything we do: daily lives, social interactions, business,
manufacturing, government, transportation, computers and warfare to name just a few in the
extensive list. Connectivity is any technique for the movement of information from one location

           R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 177
or player to another. Consider the economic impact of having our critical infrastructure (bank-
ing, air transportation, etc.) shut down. Damaging the connectivity of system is real damage.
We measure connectivity in terms of information flow. In warfare, this is called Information
Operations (IO). Fundamental to IO is the frequency at which the information is transmitted or
received.
Returning to stealth with respect to UAS design, we note that the intelligence, surveillance,
reconnaissance and weapons payload-delivery functions of UAS. These are all IO operations
and frequency is at the heart of their success against or denial by the enemy. (Adamy D. -0.,
2015)
Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS)
The German company, Tontechnic-Rechner-Sengpielaudio (TRS) has put together some clever
tools for conversions of wavelength to frequency (visa versa) "for Acoustic Waves (sound waves)
and Radio Waves and Light waves in a vacuum." (TRS, 2018) Start with Figure 8-1 EMS. Note the
inverse relationship between frequency, f and wavelength L (lambda - Greek).

"Acoustic waves and Sound Waves in Air
Sound waves are EMS waves which propagate vibrations in air molecules. The 1986 standard
speed of sound, c, is 331.3 m/s or 1125.33 ft/s at a temperature, T = 0 degrees Celsius." (TRS,
2018)
"The formulas and equations for sound are: c = L x f; L = c /f = c x T; f=c /L,
T = time- period or cycle duration and T = 1/ f and f = 1 / T. The unit for frequency is Hertz =
Hz =1/s. the unit for wavelength, L is meters, m. The time-period or cycle duration, T is sec, s.
The wave speed or speed of sound, c, is meters/sec, m/s." (TRS, 2018)
Austin states that the design limit for UAS Stealth for acoustic (noise) or sound waves is "[16
m-2 cm, or 20 - 16000 Hz]." (Austin, 2010) Use the bottom of the page converter {Basis: Speed
of sound c =  × f = 343 m/s at 20°C} for 16 m L = 21.4375Hz. This compares to the Austin value
of 20 Hz. For the 2 cm = 0.02 m, the resulting valued for f = 17650 Hz. This is above the 16,000
Hz limit from Austin. This might be due to the 20-degree Celsius basis difference. This tells the
UAS designer that the upper end of noise - Stealth acceptability 17,150 Hz. The Stealth range
is 20 Hz - 17,150 Hz.
"Hearing range describes the range of frequencies that can be heard by humans, (aka range of

180 | Chapter 8: Designing UAS Systems for Stealth
levels). The human range is commonly given as 20 to 20,000 Hz, there is considerable variation
between individuals, especially at high frequencies, and a gradual loss of sensitivity to higher
frequencies with age is considered normal. Sensitivity also varies with frequency, as shown by
equal loudness contours" (Rosen, S, 2011). See Figure 8-5.
"An equal-loudness contour is a measure of sound pressure (Db SPL) over the EMS spectrum,
for which a listener perceives a constant loudness when presented with pure steady tones. The
unit of measurement for loudness levels is the phon and is arrived at by reference to equal-
loudness contours. Two sine waves of differing frequencies are said to have equal-loudness
level measured in phons if they are perceived as equally loud by the average young person
without significant hearing impairment." (Staff, 2016) (Fletcher, 1933)

The formulas and Equations for radio waves and light waves in a vacuum are the same. How-
ever, the constant c is different. Lower-case c is the speed of light waves and the speed of radio
waves in a vacuum. The speed of light in free space (vacuum) is the speed at which electromag-
netic waves propagate, including light waves." (TRS, 2018) "Instead of the speed of sound in air,
the speed of light c, is 299,792,458 m/s (or 983,571,056 ft/s.) needs to be used in the formulas
as speed of propagation. Wave frequency in Hz = 1/s and wavelength in nm = 10 (**-9) m." (TRS,
2018)
"Radio waves and microwave radiation are both forms of energy known as Electromagnetic
Radiation (EMR). Sunlight contains other EMR forms: ultraviolet rays, infrared (heat) waves, as
well as visible light waves. These EMW spread in a vacuum at the speed of light ~ 300, 000
km/s as electromagnetic radiation." (TRS, 2018) The propagation speed of electrical signals via
optical fiber is about 9/10 of c or ~270, km/s. "Copper as a medium is worse slowing the prop-
agation speed c, to ~200, 000 km/s." (TRS, 2018) Sound is also shown on the EMS chart, but it
has no electromagnetic radiation. "Sound pressure is the deviation from local ambient pressure
(sound pressure deviation) caused by a sound wave - mainly in air." (TRS, 2018) Wavelength is
sometimes given in Angstrom units. 1 A = 10 (**-10) m = 0.1 nm. See Figure 8-6 EMS Reduced.

1 nm = 10 (**-3) um (micron-meter) = 10 (**-6) mm (millimeter)= 10(**-9) m

We have covered Austin's noise, optical and infrared stealth signatures. RADAR is not as simple
without another trip down RADAR lane. RADAR is extensively discussed and written about
in the 20th century. It is certainly one of the most influential inventions in the last century,
arguably more relevant than the cellphone. Our concern is to "paint" or recognize the UAS sig-
nature from a distance. If we can "see" the hostile UAS coming, it can be tracked, disabled,
destroyed or intercepted and "turned" to a new waypoint or objective.

RADAR / EW / Range Equation
From Austin, we know that the upper frequency for a UAS RADAR signature is 0.03 m = 3 cm.
This is approximately 10 GHz frequency. See Figure 8-8. RADAR is usually thought of in terms
of frequency Bands. See Figure 8-9 RADAR Bands and their Usage. (ITR , 2019)

The key to understanding Electronic Warfare (EW), its role in detecting a UAS approaching a
target, is understanding of radio propagation theory. If we understand how radio signals propa-
gate, we can then intercept, jam, or protect in a logical progression. (Adamy D. -0., 2015) Adamy
has written five stellar references on EW, use of dB logarithmic mathematics to solve EW equa-
tions for strength, gains, losses, radars, interceptors, jamming technologies, current threats,
defense systems and more for the reader to research and enjoy. (Adamy D. -0., 2015)
RADAR is Radio Detection and Ranging. It is the use of radio waves and their propagation in
the EMS to determine the battlespace elements for an approaching aircraft, UAS, ship, subma-
rine, or any moving vehicle. We are only interested in two equations to understand the RADAR
(radio) signature of a UAS. They are the link equation and the RADAR Range Equation, both
presented without derivation. "The operation of every type of RADAR, military communications,
signals intelligence, and jamming system can be analyzed in terms of individual communications

links." (Adamy D. -0., 2015) "A Link includes one radiation source, one receiving device, and all
events to the electromagnetic energy as it travels from source to receiver." (Adamy D. -0., 2015)
"Sources and receivers can take on many forms. When a radar pulse reflects off the skin of a
UAS or airplane, the reflecting mechanism is a transmitter. It obeys the same laws of that apply
to a walky-talky when the transmit button is pushed. Yet there is no power source and no cir-
cuitry to the reflection." (Adamy D.-9. , 1998)
One - Way Link Equation
"The basic communication link, known as a one-way link, consists of a transmitter, receiver,
transmitting and receiving antennas, and propagation losses between the two antennas along
the path." (Adamy D. -0., 2015) See Figure 8-10 Path Through Link.

"The diagram shows signal strength in dBm and increases and decreases of signal strength
in dB." (Adamy D.-9. , 1998) Figure 8-10 shows the Line-of-Sight link. "The transmitter and
receivers can electronically see each other. However, there are interferences / exceptions. The
link must not be too close to water or land or in severe weather or asymmetric non-line-of-
sight propagation factors. To calculate the received signal level (in dBm), add the transmitting
antenna gain (in dB), subtract the link losses (in dB), and add the receiving antenna gain (in dB)
to the transmitter power (in dBm)." (Adamy D.-9. , 1998)
"A simple example of the link equation in dB format is:

186 | Chapter 8: Designing UAS Systems for Stealth
Transmitter Power (1 Watt) = + 30 dBm
Transmitter Antenna Gain = +10 dB
Spreading loss = 100 dB
Atmospheric loss = 2 dB
Receiving Antenna Gain = +3 dB
Received Power = =30 dBm + 10 dB - 100 dB - 2 dB +3 dB = - 59 dBm" (Adamy D.-9. , 1998)

Effective Range
The question is what is the maximum range that a RADAR can "see" a UAS in any form: individ-
ual, group, team or Swarm? The RADAR range equations can be used to estimate maximum dis-
tance to detect a UAS. The smaller the UAS the less reflective area is present to "return "a radar
pulse back to its transmitter source. See Figures 8-11 and 8-12 which give the one-way and two-
way (return trip) for determining the maximum range of a RADAR unit. At the maximum link
range, the received power is equal to receiver sensitivity. "Receiver sensitivity is defined as the
smallest signal (lowest power strength) that it can receive and still provide the specified out-
put." (Adamy D. , 2001)

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 187

If the received power level is at least equal to the receiver sensitivity, communication takes
place over the link. The amount of design signal delta over the minimum receiver sensitivity is
called the margin. Both Figures 11 and 12 show the derivations (in normal and dB forms) of the
RADAR Ranging Equations for limited environments. Other forms of the basic RADAR Ranging
Equation, derivations, definition of terms and examples of radar units for surveillance, tracking
and jamming applications can be found in Toomay's simplified reference. (Toomay, 1982) Read-
ers interested in the RADAR units for mariners (picking up a hostile UAS over a ship) can refer
to Monahan's (Monahan, 2004) or Burch's references. (Burch, 2015)
Example - Given the operating frequency is 100 MHz, the atmospheric and normal terrestrial
loses are minimal. Assume the transmitter output power, Pt = 10 watts. [About double the nor-
mal marine VHF set.] The transmitting gain antenna, GT is +10dB, the receiving antenna gain,
GR, is +3 dB, and the design receiver sensitivity, Sens = - 65 dBm. {If we find that the received
power level (say -59 dBm is at least equal to the sensitivity, then the communication takes
place. The margin is this example would be 6 dB higher}. Assume line-of-sight between the two
antennas. Calculate the maximum range we can see to the hostile UAS, not using Stealth tech-
niques to reduce the radar visibility. Let PR = received power in dBm. Let d = distance in km.
Setting Sens = PR = -65 dBm. Convert to dB math. Plug in the values and solve for 20 log (d).
[Logs are base 10 not base e}

188 | Chapter 8: Designing UAS Systems for Stealth
Sens = -65 dBm = PR = PT + GT -32.4 -20 log (f) - 20 log (d) + GR
20 log (d) = PT + GT -32.4 -20 log (f) + GR - Sens
And PT = 10 W = +40 dBm, GT = 10 dB, Gr = +3 dB, [20 log (f=100] = +40 dB
20 log (d) = +40 +10 - 32.4 -40 +3 +65 = 45.6
D = antilog (20 log (d)/20) = Antilog (45.6/20) = Antilog 2.28 = 190.54 km = 118.6 miles

We can see the UAS (multiple with bead on leader) at 119 miles from our radar transmitter.

We have come full circle back to the question of designing a UAS for stealth and to get closer
to the target.

Closer

In this example, 119 miles gives the US defender some time to respond to his radar set bleep.
However, as a hostile actor, suppose the plan is to reach within 5-10 miles of the US target. If a
slow UAS is travelling at 60 mph, in the 5 seconds that it takes to spot the UAS on the defender
RADAR set, the UAS has travelled about 1 ½ football fields.

{60 mph / 60 min /hour = 1 mile/ per min = 5280 ft /min / 60 sec / min = 88 ft / s x 5 sec =
440 feet / 3 feet /yard = 146.66 yards / 100 yards football field = ~ 1 ½ football fields travelled}
Many USAs are designed to travel at over 100 mph.

To reduce the UAS RADAR detectability "(signatures") "to an acceptable level it is necessary
to reduce the received emission or reflection of the above frequencies (wavelengths) below a
threshold value. This is often just a function of the height the UAS operates at." (Austin, 2010)
Hostile UAS fly lower and at greater speeds. The idea is to hit the target with surprise from
above. "An unmanned air vehicle has advantages, compared to manned equivalents, in its inher-
ent ability to achieve lower signatures. These advantages are:

  · It has dense packaging. No air crew or their support equipment means a dimensionally
      smaller vehicle. In general, the vehicle mass is less for UAS missions;

  · It has shape. UAS shape is not limited to accommodations for crew and need for access or
      external vision ports. UAS designs consider aerodynamic efficiency and detection - sig-
      nature reduction." (Austin, 2010)

Acoustic Signature Reductions

"Aircraft noise may be the first warning of its presence; however, it may not immediately be
directionally/locatable for detection." "UAS noise emanates predominantly from vortices, tips
of wings, rotors, or propellers. Lowering wing span or blade span enhances acoustical stealth."
Conventional propulsion systems are a concern because of the noise of combustion. Electric

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 189
motors develop virtually no noise. "Reducing mass and aerodynamic drag of the UAS reduces
noise generation." (Austin, 2010)

The human ear is a problem for the designer. "It is most sensitive to frequencies around 3500
Hz and can hear sound down to a practical threshold of 10 dB. For a given sound pressure
level, attenuation of sound with distance in air and insulating material varies as the square of
the sound frequency. Low frequency sound presents a greater problem for UAS stealth design."
(Austin, 2010)

MALE and HALE systems do not present acoustic issues "noise from their high frequency gen-
erators is attenuated by the time it reaches earth. The greater noise problem is posed by
smaller UAS using piston engines." (Austin, 2010) Sound comes from their internal combus-
tion and exhaust systems. Sound emanation can be achieved with sound-absorptive materials,
silencers and mufflers and directing the intake and exhaust manifolds upward. "Lastly, the level
of sound detected depends on the level of background noise for sound contrast." (Austin, 2010)

Visual Signature

"The human eye operates within a small range of the EMS, between 0.4 and 0.7-micron
(um) meters peaking at a maximum efficiency approximately 0.55 um. Criteria that determine
whether a human can see a UAS in the sky regardless of cloud conditions: a) size and shape of
the UAS, b) background contrast and sharpness of edges that contrast; c) atmosphere; d) move-
ment; e) exposure time; f) stability and soberness of observer; and g) glint." (Austin, 2010)

"Size and shape of the UAS combine to determine a threshold of detectability (sic, at a flying
altitude of the UAS) Contrast C, is defined as a ratio of the difference in luminance between an
object and its background to the luminance of its background. So,

                                             C= (B - B1) / B1 = delta B / B1

Where B is the luminance of the object and B1 is the luminance of the background, cd/m**2."
(Austin, 2010)

Laboratory tests have shown that "there is a 50% probability of detection by the unaided
human eye if it subtends an angle of about 0.15 mrad." (Austin, 2010) Other effects of atmos-
phere, movement, exposure time, stability of observer, and glint require further study.

Thermal Signature

"Infrared (IR) radiation is emitted from a heat source and propagates in the same way as
light. The detectability of the radiant body is determined by its contrast with the background."
(Austin, 2010) "IR radiation is absorbed well by the atmosphere, particularly water and CO2
molecules, more so than visible light. The major windows for IR to pass through the atmos-

190 | Chapter 8: Designing UAS Systems for Stealth
  phere are in the 3-4 and 8-12 micron -meter wavelength bands. Receivers are designed to oper-
  ate in one of these two bands." (Austin, 2010)

  Design factors include materials to insulate the power plant exhausts and using low-emissivity
  materials. Sky is cold and offers an excellent contrast for IR detection. However, the technology
  has not matured, and long-range IR detectors are limited to a 5-degree field of view. "The
  detection range is a function of temperature (K) to the fourth power. Reducing the target emis-
  sions temperatures is an effective evasion tactic for IR detection." (Austin, 2010)

  Radio / RADAR Signature

  "The radio signature relates to the radio frequency emissions from the UAS and SAA systems
  and should be minimized." RADAR / Radio signature is reflected frequency "generated by an
  emitter which is scanning the sky from ground and looking for a return (reflected) pulse from
  a body entering its sector." (Austin, 2010) "The stealth designer aims to prevent these pulses
  being reflected to the detector." (Austin, 2010) There are three methods to minimize UAS
  reflection of pulses to a receptor:

     · "Use radar- translucent materials such as Kevlar or glass. Problem is that to protect a UAS
        sufficiently, the thickness of materials may be prohibitive;"

     · "Cover the external surfaces with radar-absorptive materials. Unfortunately, this solution
        is both material and frequency dependent" and

     · "Shape the aircraft externally to reflect radar pulses in a direction away from the trans-
        mitter." This is more efficient proposal than a) or b). The goal is to reduce cross-section
        areas to not be at 90-degree angles to the radiation. The latter yields a clean pulse return.
        "It is also a design goal to avoid surfaces meeting at 90 degrees as this act as a radar "cor-
        ner reflector" to give strong returns." (Austin, 2010)

  Low flying UAS - Use Navigation Collision Avoidance RADAR

  The author has been experimenting with a low flying UAS1 flying over calm (< 10 knot winds)
  Chesapeake Bay water at 100 above mean sea level. With a tailwind the Drone can clock
  upwards of 50-60 mph. The DJI Phantom 4 Pro Plus (PRO+) Drone is not designed for stealth.
  Experiment results: Can the Drone be detected? Yes. At what distance? Using the marine ref-
  erence Boaters Bowditch equation for RADAR Geographic Range over water, the author calcu-
  lated the detection range from the pulses of the boat's radar to the UAS.

  Distance (nautical miles) = 1.22 X [ square root (Height of the Antenna (ft)) + square root (Height
  of the Target (ft)) ]. (Hubbard, 1998)

  If the antenna on a cruiser is at 20 ft and the UAS is flying at 100 ft at 55 mph toward the boat
  on a bow heading, what is the detection range? Answer 17.7 nautical miles.

  The question then is how low should an aircraft / UAS fly to avoid radar detection?2 The
  answer is "it depends." It depends on the radar and the aircraft itself. Search radars are often
  usually located on well elevated land-forms to extend the line-of-sight (LOS) distance to the
  horizon. A conventional (non-stealthy) UAS aircraft flying just above surface level (100 ft up
  above water could theoretically be seen, as it comes over the horizon line, if there were no
  obstacles, radio towers, seaplanes, or large freighters to obscure it. The atmosphere attenu-
  ates the transmissions from the radar and can distort them.) The atmosphere over land has
  contaminants that can obscure radar pulses; dust, sand, smoke, rain, bugs, birds, water vapor,
  fog, clouds etc. These contaminants bend, scatter, and/or absorb transmissions showing up
  as "noise" on the radar screens. Noise reduces the effective range of the radar. Some noise can
  be electronically filtered so that the UAS can be distinguished from the noise. Chesapeake Bay
  has clean atmospheric conditions in fair weather - no contaminant density.

  Assume a radar antenna mount on a hill might at 230 ft above ground level. [This is the height
  of three Radio Towers on land near Annapolis, MD.] If the aircraft is flying 100 ft above the
  ground, it will be at 30.7 nautical miles distance from the radar as it comes over the horizon. At
  that distance it will be seen clearly because atmospheric disturbances at that short distance are
  not an issue. That is what a US capital ship at sea might encounter if looking at a strike fighter
  or cruise missile coming at 11 nm/m with 3 minutes to impact. Let's now mount the radar on a
  mountain top (say ski Round Top in Camp Hill, PA). Its antenna is approximately 2600 ft above
  mean ground level. The UAS aircraft flying at 100 ft will come over the horizon and be detected
  at ~ 74.4 nautical miles. 100 ft is not realistic unless over the sea on a calm day.

  Stealthy UAS aircraft are a problem for radars. Stealth doesn't make them invisible, but it
  greatly reduces the limit of detection. In the case of our first example, a fast stealth UCAV
  fighter coming over the horizon at ~18 nm will probably not be seen immediately. The human
  lag time for the radar operator could be 1-2 minutes, bringing the UCAV within 60 seconds of
  the radar receiver or ship before discovery - not much time for lethal countermeasures

  Discussion Questions

     1. Why is RADAR detection of a UAS over water different from in the air?
    2. Check the Austin signature limits and track them down on the EMS charts.
    3. What stealth measures would be employed for a UAS / drone specific to maritime service

        - say in the Spratly Islands?

Chapter 9: Case Study Smart Skies

Project

Student Learning Objectives

Chapters 7 and 8 covered SAA systems, collision avoidance technologies and designing UAS for
stealth. In Chapter 9, the student advances the SAA principles by investigating one of the more
interesting published research projects in SAA known as the Smart Skies Project. Smart Skies
was a defining project that has spurned many different research papers, funded projects, tech-
nology advancements and improved conditions at airports.

Safety

The primary goal of UAS is safe, predictable flying in the NAS. To do this UAS must have SAA
"capability that replicates a human function: to see and avoid." (Wilson, 2012)

This is quite a challenge and has been the delaying factor for wide-spread "integration of UAS
into the NAS" other, then limited classes of airspace. Further, the level of safety achievable by
UAS designers must be at least equal to that of "manned aviation. Until Sense and Avoid (SAA)
for UAS reaches equal or better capability to See and Avoid," FAA will continue to restrict oper-
ations of UAS in the NAS. (Wilson, 2012)

See and Avoid

Visual Flight Rules (VFR) "require pilots to see and avoid aircraft and other objects while flying
visual meteorological conditions." (Wilson, 2012) Current see and avoid technology has clearly
prevented collisions, however the state-of-the-art is far from reliable. "Some of the limiting
factors are: human visual system, demands of cockpit tasks, and physical and environmental
conditions. These combine to make see and avoid an uncertain method of traffic separation."
(ICAS, 2012) Wilson (2012) presents several studies that show that pilots do not perform well for
unalerted visual searches. Another study showed that pilots "spent more time looking inside
the cockpit than outside and that the average scanning performance would leave them vulner-
able to late detection of aircraft conflicts" and adequate reaction time. (Wilson, 2012)

Case Study: The Smart Skies Project

"The Smart Skies Project (SSP) was a 3-year AUD $10M joint venture amongst ARCAA, QUT,
BR & T, and Insitu Pacific. The Smart Skies Project was, created to enable technologies for
UAS operations in non-segregated airspace." (Wilson, 2012) Specific objectives of SSP were

                                                                                                      R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and
                                                                                                                                                                                  J.P. Hood | 195
to, "develop and demonstrate automated separation management technologies that facilitate
use (sic) of the national airspace system by both manned and unmanned aircraft." The second
objective was to, "use (sic) the information and experiences gained to support the further
development of standards, regulations and safe operating practices for civil and commercial
UAS in Australia and overseas (USA)." ARCAA accomplished both goals. Later in the chapter
the author will summarize several practical research projects that SSP inspired. "SSP describes
"development of an automated separation management system," aircraft-based sense-and-act
technologies, and a mobile aircraft tracking system." (Clothier R. R., 2011) More specifically, the
enabling technologies that support Class G airspace are MATS, "a network-enabled Mobile Air-
craft Tracking System, for detection and tracking" of local air traffic. (Clothier R. R., 2011) MATS
has multiple sensors supporting "UAS in non-segregated airspace. MATS uses a cost-effective
primary radar and cooperative surveillance systems." (Wilson, 2012) The second enabling tech-
nology is the "Vision-based Sense and Act (SAA) - an automated system capable of replicating
the See-and-Avoid function of the human pilot." (Clothier R. , 2017) In the SSP environment,
SSA "refers to the capability of a system to detect, track, and resolve potential collisions with
other aircraft (A/C) or obstacles on the ground. SSP explores the development of automated
aircraft-bases SAA "systems capable of avoiding dynamic obstacles (other A/C) or static obsta-
cles (trees, powerlines, or radio towers)." (Clothier R. R., 2011) The automated Static Obstacle
Avoidance (SOA) system is particularly effective at low-altitudes aircraft operations. The last
enabling technology is the Automated Separation Management System (ASMS) is designed to
reduce workload for the Automated Traffic Management by increasing automation. It consists
of three systems; the "Automated Dynamic Airspace Controller (ADAC)", the "Common Infor-
mation Network (CIN),and the Predictive Flight Management System (pFMS)." (Clothier R. R.,
2011) All the theory would be useless without flight tests to prove the innovative technologies.
"An important objective of SSP was to integrate, demonstrate and validate the performance
these enabling technologies through a series of eight integrated flight-test activities." (Wilson,
2012)

Smart Skies Architecture

"The SSP architecture diagram is shown in Figure 9-2 The system includes manned and
unmanned aircraft, virtual aircraft, public mobile data and Iridium satellite links," the ADAC and
MATS. What is special about the flight testing in SSP " architecture is that the manned and
unmanned flight tests occurred in Kingaroy, Australia, and the SAA control system, the ADAC
was in Palmdale, California." (Wilson, 2012) "All the systems in the SSP architecture are linked
to the Internet by the Iridium satellite communication network and a 3G public mobile data
network. The Iridium satellites provide global coverage at low bandwidth communication. The
public mobile data network provided high bandwidth communications, but in a limited geo-
graphic coverage." (Wilson, 2012)

field-deployable surveillance system (see Figure 9-6)." (ICAS, 2012)

       tem That Supports Unmanned Aircraft Operations, 27th International Congress of The Aeronauti-
       cal Sciences. http://www.icas.org/icas_archive/icas2010/papers/474.pdf

MATS was "designed to support UAS operations in non-segregated airspace. It uses commer-
cial off-the-shelf (COTS) primary radar and tracking system, Automated Dependent Surveil-
lance Broadcast (ADS-B) and filtering, display and communications systems." (Clothier R. , 2017)
MATS also sports a "VHF voice transceiver and a server that performs data fusion and commu-
nications management. The UAS flight crew may be located inside the MATS trailer or inside a
remote GCS." (Wilson, 2012)
The MATS Radar System
MATS enables two interfaces to work with SAA. "One interface enables MATS to provide infor-
mation to the UAS pilot. The radar's TCP/IP data networking capability allows tracks and plots

200 | Chapter 9: Case Study Smart Skies Project
to be sent remotely to the CGS." (Wilson, 2012) "This is a pilot/operator in-the-loop SAA sys-
tem, where MATS provides the sense function and the pilot provides the avoid function by
maneuvering the UAS." (Wilson, 2012) MATS uses a second interface to "provide information
about cooperative and non-cooperative aircraft to external systems - the ADAC. In this case
the avoid function is automated. ADAC accesses the airspace situation and provides updated
flight plans to avoid collisions/conflicts." (Wilson, 2012)

"A key part of MATS is the primary surveillance radar system. It has two parts; a front-end COT
marine radar and a back-end that performs the detection, tracking and display functions. The
Furuno radar operates at three pulse rates; 0.07 us for 10.5 m, 1.2 us for 180 m, and 0.3us for an
approximate distance of 45 m." (ICAS, 2012) "The Accipiter® permits multi-target tracking and
uses a specially designed Multiple-Hypotheses-Testing (MHT) and Interacting-Multiple-Mod-
els tracker (IMM) that locks on to targets that have a Low Radar Cross section (LRC). All radar
information is mapped, and multiple layers can be displayed." (ICAS, 2012)

The MATS ADS-B Receiver

"The ADS-B receiver that MATS used is an SBS-1 from Kinetic Avionics Products Limited. The
SBS-1 is portable, low-cost 1090 MHz ADS-B receiver. It provided the tracking and logging of
information about ADS-B equipped Aircraft." (ICAS, 2012)

MATS Performance and Flight Characterization Testing

In March 2010, MATS was an innovative approach to ground-based tracking. The SSP team
wanted MATS to detect and accurately track manned and unmanned airspace users and use
that information to maintain separation minima. MATS performance had to be superior to
ground observers or observers situated in a chase plane. MATS was used to detail responses to
failures of navigation systems and to track recovery of the A/C. MATS was a key component in
the ASMS.

MATS strength main component was its Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR). SSP team used flight
simulations that were augmented with human spotters to compare against MATS' PSR. The SSP
team varied "target cross-sectional area - by using different A/C and target A/C range, veloc-
ity, altitude maneuvering and clutter." (Clothier R. R., 2011)

MATS Results

"MATS radar characterization testing verified that the PSR can track a Cessna 172 in a low clut-
ter environment out to a range of 15 nm." (Clothier R. R., 2011) Tracking consistency improved
at closer ranges. "MATS also tracked A/C flying on designated air routes at ranges between 16
- 20 nm." (Clothier R. R., 2011) MATS was able to track small fixed-wing UAS targets. MATS data
provided additional situational awareness and provided valuable lessons for UAS operators.

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 201
Sense-and Act

"Sense-and-Act (SAA) refers to the capability of a system to detect, track, and resolve potential
collisions with another A/C or obstacles on the ground." (Clothier R. R., 2011) SSP explored
"development of automated aircraft-based SAA systems capable of avoiding dynamic obstacles
(other A/C) or static obstacles (trees, power lines and radio towers)." (Clothier R. R., 2011)
The ARCAA C172 was used with full closed-loop control of its navigation systems. SSP per-
formed "controlled experiments involving head-on and over-taking scenarios with a C182. SSP
explored range of FoV, image processing and control law configurations." (Clothier R., 2017)

Dynamic SAA

The challenge of SAA is for the system to meet or exceed human "see-and-avoid" capabilities
"provided by a pilot under suitable VFR conditions." (Clothier R. R., 2011) At all times the SAA
must "maintain a visual lookout for other A/C and if necessary, initiate maneuvers to avoid a
potential collision scenario." (Clothier R. R., 2011) Clothier discusses the legal scenarios where
SAA must qualify and the limitations of human see-and-avoid abilities. The dynamic Sense-
and-Avoid algorithms are discussed in detail in the same paper.

SAA Experiments

Since MATS was designed to "support UAS operations, an interesting place to operate a UAS is
a small non-towered airport in Class G space. Some of A/C coming into the airport will carry
a VHF. These A/C can easily communicate their position and intent. Unfortunately, a percent-
age of the A/C will not carry a VHF radio, therefore, coordinating UAS activities will not be
possible." (Wilson, 2012) MATS PSR is the only way to track these A/C. "Non-cooperative air-
craft without a VHF represent the most challenging class of airspace user for both manned and
unmanned aircraft." (ICAS, 2012)

Consider a non-cooperative intruder aircraft. If MATS PSR can detect it, "what actions should
a UAS pilot take to avoid conflicts with the intruder? So, the scenario that SSP explored was:

  · A small UA operating in a non-towered airport,
  · UA operations are supported by a PSR whose role is to detect A/C beyond the range of

      observers at the airport,
  · Intruder A/C are non-cooperative and without VHF radio,
  · Intruder A/C can arrive from anywhere, anytime and any altitude in class G
  · Intruder A/C intentions are unknown (fly-over, sight-seeing, overfly and join a traffic

      pattern, or land)
  · Intruder A/C has a speed advantage over a small UAS. The UAS cannot outrun the

      Intruder.

The UA may need to move to a new location or change altitude to mitigate the risk of collision.

The airport and USA FAA or Australian Civil Authority sets the AGL rules flying near an airport,
city, or populous area." (Wilson, 2012)

UAS Actions

Wilson (2012) describes four geographic areas with locations oriented toward an intruder A/C
that UAS may determine its course of action(s). "Danger - the UA is between the intruder and
the airport but outside the circuit area." The Circuit ring is 3 nm radius from the runway. The
far end of the danger zone is 6 nm in radius. For the Transit area, the "UA is outside the cir-
cuit area but is the likely transit of the intruder." It extends to the 6 nm and starts at 3 nm on
the same bearing as the intruder. The Hold area is where the UA "is positioned laterally to the
current flight path of the intruder." "Lastly, the Circuit area is generally set by the speed capa-
bilities of the UAS." (Wilson, 2012) For the Flamingo, the Circuit area was a radius of 3 nm.

       "The UAS actions, when the UAS is in each area are as follows:"

       AREA UAS COMMAND

       Danger "Descend to less than 400 ft AGL and orbit"

       Transit "Track to a hold area and orbit"

       Hold "Orbit or maintain speed and heading, whichever is safer"

       Circuit "Track to the dead side of the circuit at 400 ft AGL and orbit." (Wilson, 2012)

Three other actions were simulated but discarded generally by the SSP team; land (potential
accident on the ground and it becomes a hazard for the intruder trying to land), climb (climb
rate is much slower than intruder A/C and fails as avoidance maneuver) and join a traffic pat-
tern (mixing a difficult to see small UAS with larger manned A/C where traffic density may be
high.)

SAA Results

The results were a dramatic success. SSP may have been the "first in the world to demonstrate
a fully automated real-time onboard collision avoidance using a vision-based SAA system. It
used real aircraft, real hardware, and real conditions." (Clothier R. , 2017) More than eighty data
sets were collected. In addition the SSP SAA system demonstrated detection ranges more than
6.421 miles to the closest point of approach (CPA). The SSP solved the problems of vibration
compensation and prevention. The SSP team found optimal configurations to minimize MDR
and "FAR across a range of atmospheric, cloud, and lighting conditions." (Clothier R. , 2017) The

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 203
SSP team proved their Concept of Operations (CONOP) and laid out a plan to use multi-spec-
tral sensors.
Sense-and Act Systems (Static)
"A second challenge to UAS operations is avoiding ground obstacles. This is a risk for fixed-
wing aircraft performing at low altitudes (crop dusting), helicopter operations for SAR power-
line inspection, radio tower avoidance, winching operations, taxiways obstructions, and animal
detection." (Clothier R. R., 2011) The SSA project called this a Static Obstacle Avoidance system
(SOA) and it was "suitable for close range (<30 m) for Rotorcraft UAS operations at low alti-
tudes." (Clothier R. , 2017) ARCAA researches explored several design components; LIDAR and
2D scanning laser and stereo camera sensor.
SSA SOA Results
"SSP team demonstrated that the SOA successes in an automated, beyond visual range of oper-
ation, in an unknown obstacle environment. Sixty flights were completed in a range of single
and multi-sensor configurations. LIDAR produced the most reliable avoidance capability with
an 84% success rate. It detected trees out to 23m, and a microwave tower out to 18m. The wide
(270 degrees) horizontal field of view of the laser allowed it to continue sensing obstacles even
when flying alongside of them." (Clothier R. , 2017)
Automated Separation Management System (ASMS)
Figure 9-7 shows the ASMS architecture.

       CT: ASMS, see: http://www.kinetic.co.uk/DownloadFiles/Assorted/SBS1-eR-ReferenceMan-
       ual.pdf

The ASMS consists of three basic systems; "The Automatic Dynamic Airspace Controller
(ADAC), the Common Information Network (CIN), and the Predictive Flight Management Sys-
tems (pFMS)." (Clothier R. R., 2011) The ADAC continuously "maintains situational awareness of
the state of the airspace system by receiving aircraft tracking information and changes within
the airspace environment (weather, dynamic/ temporary airspace activation.) The ADAC also
monitors the airspace system state, and if necessary, transmits recommended control infor-
mation to cooperative airspace users where there is a potential for a Loss of Separation (LOS)."
(Clothier R. R., 2011)
The CIN is the computer backbone of the ASMS. It provides communications (multi-channel)
"infrastructure to network aircraft and other sensors (surveillance and weather) to the ADAC.
CIN can support multiple redundant and geographically distributed ADAC systems." (Clothier
R. R., 2011)

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 205
"The pFMS system enables communication with the ADAC, but all the participating aircraft
required a modified flight management system to include predictive capabilities." pFMS func-
tions include "estimation of the current and future aircraft states (position, attitude, time, and
uncertainties), management of multiple communication links within the CIN, receiving, loading
and execution of ADAC generated commands, the intelligent management of onboard sensors,
and sensor information and display." (Clothier R. R., 2011)

ASMS Results

The AMSM demonstrated unqualified success for fifty trials "for real aircraft, real communi-
cations links, real sensors in complex scenarios involving real and simulated aircraft. It was a
truly global systems test providing a completely automated separation service from Palmdale,
CA to Queensland, Australia. Trials included non-cooperative aircraft detected using the MATS
and SAA systems in mixed-mode separation." (Clothier R. , 2017) The ASMS was able to ensure
"quality of the separation service under variable communications performance factors such as
latencies and drop-out. ARCAA researchers believed that their ASMS was the first in the world
to autonomously command and control UAS using a civil mobile cellular network." (Clothier R. ,
2017)

The SSP project has spurred hundreds of publications and innovative steps based on the ARCAA
team's results. "A few samples are seen here. Sahawneh, L.R, et.al (2017) wrote about a Ground-
Based Sense-and Avoid System for Small Unmanned Aircraft. The paper describes the devel-
opment of a small frequency-modulated continuous-wave phased-array radar system that
provides three-dimensional surveillance volume. Contarino, V.M. et.al (23 May 2011) wrote a
paper on All Weather Sense and Avoid System (AWSAS) for all UAS and manned platforms. They
discuss a new collision avoidance system that would overcome current FAA stated deficien-
cies so that military and national security agencies can use the NAS in unfettered mode. Lai, J.,
Mejias, L & Ford, J.J. (2011) wrote about an Airborne Vision-Based Collision-Detection System. This
paper describes the development and evaluation of a real-time, vision-based collision-detec-
tion system suitable for fixed-wing aerial robotics." (Wilson, 2012)

Discussion Equations

  1. The global market for UAS / UAV is exploding globally. How might terrorist use the UAS
      as a weapon? What countermeasures would you propose to stop a team or swarm of UAS
      attacking USA national critical infrastructure?

 2. What cyber techniques could be used to change parameters in the SAA systems to take
      control of an enemy UAS.

 3. Research three papers or peer-reviewed articles on the state-of-the-art SAA compo-
      nents. See if you put the dots together for how the SSP might have influenced the chosen
      works.

Chapter 10: UAS Intelligence,

Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)

Student Learning Objective

The student will gain knowledge on UAS intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sys-
tems. Topics include sensors, missions including history, the current state of industry, and
planning and execution considerations for gathering datasets using this technology.

History/Background of UAS ISR

UAS for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance is a well-known application of the tech-
nology. "The clear majority of UAVs are used purely for intelligence, surveillance, and recon-
naissance (ISR) missions. In current military usage, they range from the Global Hawk, with a
wingspan greater than a Boeing 737 airliner, to Nano-helicopters that weigh a few grams, and
all points in between" (Lambeth, 2006). FLIR Systems produces the Black Hornet 3 and, "At 32
grams, offers the lowest size, weight, and performance for UAS available...flies 2 kilometers
at speeds of over 21 kilometers an hour. The Black Hornet 3 also incorporates sharper imag-
ing processing featuring the FLIR Lepton® thermal micro camera core and a visible sensor to
allow greater image fidelity, (with) an improved encrypted military-approved digital datalink,
enabling seamless communications and imagery significantly beyond line-of-sight and in
closed areas" ("FLIR Launches Next-Generation Black Hornet 3 Nano-UAV," 2018).

A UAS is simply a "truck" for the sensor system. It is the tool that is used to move, power, and
task the sensor in the air. With such a wide variety of "trucks" available today, ISR appears to
be limited more by human innovation and imagination than technology itself.

The ability to extend missions, gather previously unknown or unavailable information, and keep
human operators out of harm's way forms the basis of why UAS are more suitable for the dull,
dirty, and dangerous missions. UAS do not get bored, tired, lose focus, require minimal train-
ing as compared to humans and do not carry the bias of humans, the data gathered is "truth"
to the sensor system. "The physical movement of drones is only one aspect of their potential
vulnerability. The still image or video cameras routinely fitted to UAVs serve as a live link back
to their operators - and enable drones to be used as highly maneuverable real-time eyes in the
sky." (CyberRisk, 2017) "They provide the visual and location information they carry and yield a
high-value target for malicious third parties." (CyberRisk, 2017)

The tactics and techniques that are applied to today's technology stem from the field of remote
sensing. Remote sensing has a long history as it began with humans attempting to see and

210 | R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter,
and J.P. Hood
sense phenomena from a distance; from using pigeons to balloons to aircraft satellites, to UAS.
Now UAS are coupled with space-based platforms for information and command and control.
This field of study has allowed advances in military movement, attack and defend, as well as
civilian surveying, and developing, freedom of movement throughout our world.
During Napoleon's campaigns, the French used observation balloons to monitor enemy activ-
ities. In 1831 Napoleon understood the true importance of remote sensing for shaping the
battlefield as he stated, "If I always appear prepared, it is because before entering on an under-
taking, I have meditated for long and foreseen what may occur" (Napoleon Bonaparte, 1831).
This technique continued through the U.S. Civil War.
Remote sensing as defined by Lillestand and Keifer is, "the science and art of bating informa-
tion around an object, area or phenomenon through the analysis of state acquired by a device
that is not in contact with the object, area or phenomenon under investigation" (Lillesand,
Kiefer, & Chipman, 2014). In simple terms, it is the ability to study different point of interest
from afar without having to physically sample the item.

History of Photography

The history of photography is one that started with the early Greeks and pinhole cameras.
These were very basic, and the image was upside down and was not permanent (Bellis, 2017).
It was not until the 1800s that an image was able to be permanently stored on media. Cameras
and film were progressing at different speeds. They finally came together in the 1830s.
Nicephorus Niepce and Louis Daguerre, both of France, created the capability to produce per-
manent images that could be replicated. Nicephorus Niepce died before France recognized the
achievement, and because of that, the first photographs were known as daguerreotypes. One of
the problems that continued to plague the early photographers was the amount of time it took
to develop the film. Prior to 1829, it was not unusual for a film to take eight hours to develop
the film.

                                                                                 R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 211

Prior to 1829, it was not unusual for a film to take eight hours to develop. Daguerre discovered
a method that took less than thirty minutes (Lucibella, 2013). Once the photographic and film
development methodology was published, aerial photographs were taken with a wide variety of
objects - most typically kites and balloons. The first American to take aerial photographs was
James Wallace Black, who took photographs of the Boston harbor in 1860, see Figure 10-1. The
1906 San Francisco earthquake photographs were taken from a kite (King, 2012).
Remote Sensing
Remote sensing systems continue to change the way wars are fought. Information is gathered
and analyzed that allows leaders to "see more, understand better and decide quicker." Observ-
ing enemy activity using high ground to survey the battlefield and then relay this information
to military leaders goes back to ancient times. Military leaders understand the importance
of high ground. With remote sensing systems, this high ground can be extended far beyond
humans' normal observation abilities.
The introduction of the airplane by World War I enhanced the world's military capability to
gather intelligence beyond enemy lines; gathering aerial photographs that would provide vital
intelligence before, during and after a battle.
Limitations on airplanes, photography systems, and the time required to process intelligence
lead to ever-increasing research and development by militaries around the world.

212 | Chapter 10: UAS Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)
The US recognized the limitations of using standard aircraft for its intelligence gathering and
began research on new remote sensing systems to improve its intelligence gathering capability.
These platforms would be designed to fly undetected at higher altitudes, faster airspeeds, and
with advanced camera systems. This capability assisted in tracking enemy equipment, move-
ments, as well as their research and development programs. Early systems would offer the abil-
ity for the first time in the US to have an "eyes on" ability for treaty verification, something that
the Soviet Union was not prepared for, nor did it want the US to have.

"The U-2 project was undertaken in the early 1950s; first flight occurred in August 1955. This
project was created by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) because they required better
intelligence gathering systems to amass intelligence on the Soviet Union. Collection efforts
against the Soviet Union with modified bomber aircraft had taken place. However, those mis-
sions were vulnerable to counterintelligence observation, anti-aircraft fire, and fighter inter-
cepts. It was thought a high-altitude aircraft such as the U-2 would be hard to detect and
almost impossible to shoot down. Understanding the principles of high ground, the CIA began
working on platforms that could be used specifically for reconnaissance operations." (Malesky,
2002)The U-2 gained public attention, "during the U-2 Crisis when pilot Francis Gary Powers
was shot down over Soviet territory on May 1, 1960." (Malesky, 2002)

"The U-2 aircraft that was funded by the CIA and built by the U.S. starting in the 1950s. It
became the subject of many "incidents," or diplomatic confrontations, with the Soviet Union
during the Cold War. The most famous of these run-ins is referred to as the U-2 incident began
on May 1, 1960, and what was to have been the twenty-fourth U-2 overflight of the Soviet
Union." (FAQS, 2018) At this time, Gary Powers was one of the most experienced U-2 pilots in
the world and "the overflights had become routine to him." (Malesky, 2002) The CIA issued its
U-2 pilot's cyanide capsules and a poison needle hidden in a bisected silver dollar. Powers never
took them along. Even more alarming was that, "Powers had become more and more cavalier.
The morning of departure for Peshawar, he even packed his wallet with an assortment of Amer-
ican German and Turkish money for his layover in Norway; his wife packed him a lunch for the
shuttle flight to Pakistan" (Barnes, 2005).

"Gary Powers took off from a U.S. air base at Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The mission profile on this
flight codenamed Grand Slam was to be the most ambitious U-2 flight yet. Powers flight plan
would take him from Turkey to Soviet nuclear-weapons facilities in the Ural Mountains, then
over various railroads, then to intercontinental ballistic missile sites in Siberia, then back across
northern Russia, finally to several shipyards before leaving Soviet airspace above the Arctic Cir-
cle and landing in Bodo, Norway." (Malesky, 2002)

"Powers was detected by Soviet radar while still fifteen miles from the Afghan-Soviet border.
The radar detection was not unusual. In fact, all previous U-2 flights over the Soviet Union had
been detected at some point. The previous U-2 flights had not counted on stealth to save them,
but on the fact that the Soviets had no fighter jets or, for the first few years, surface-to-air mis-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 213
siles that could fly high enough to shoot it down. However, the newly developed surface-to-air
missile, designated as the SA-2 had improved capabilities" (Malesky, 2002).

The U-2 program would again be in the spotlight on October 14, 1962, when it, "photographed
the Soviet military installing nuclear warhead missiles in Cuba, precipitating the Cuban Missile
Crisis. However, later in the Cuban missile crisis, another U-2 was shot down, killing the pilot,
Major Rudolph Anderson." (Burr, 2012).

The CIA armed with the knowledge that the Soviets had developed Surface to Air Missiles
(SAMS) that could intercept the U-2, began development of a faster, higher-flying reconnais-
sance aircraft, even before the U-2 became operational. Lockheed Martin proposed an air-
craft codename OXCART that later became the famous USAF SR-71, unofficially known as the
"Blackbird." Although the intent of the system was not only to enhance the US intelligence
capability, it was more survivable. The speed of the SR-71 would prove to be its survivabil-
ity capability. "The SR-71 remained the world's fastest and highest-flying operational manned
aircraft throughout its career. From an altitude of 80,000 ft (24 km), it could survey 100,000
square miles per hour (72 square kilometers per second) of the Earth's surface. On July 28, 1976,
an SR-71 broke the world record for its class - an absolute speed record of 2,193.1669 mph
(3,529.56 km/h), and a US "absolute altitude record" of 85,068.997 feet (25,929 m)." (Haynes,
1996). The SR-71 had been fired upon many times, the standard countermeasure was simply to
accelerate. Twelve aircraft are known to have been lost, all through non-combat.

Original capabilities for the SR-71 included Optical/Infrared Imagery systems, (the infrared
systems were discontinued in the later years of the program) Side Looking Radar (SLR), later
Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS-1) an Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) gathering sys-
tem. Onboard systems recorded sensor information and maintenance data (Malesky, 2002).

UAS now usher in a new era of capabilities and vulnerabilities. "Protocols implemented on the
ground station applications enabling communications with the UAVs (and permitting users to
pilot them via wireless remote control) were found to be unsecured. This allowed hackers to
install malware on the systems running the ground stations. In addition, the telemetry feeds
used in monitoring the vehicles and facilitating information transfer through wireless trans-
mission were vulnerable to interception, malicious data injection, and the alteration of pre-set
flight paths," (CyberRisk, 2017) Forward progress is not without tradeoffs, as depicted in the
chart below, each ISR platform has limiting factors and tradeoffs. See Table 10-1.

Product/ Economic Opportunity:

Information is the product that ISR creates, and unmanned vehicles can provide unprece-
dented amounts of it. However, there is a need to manage the flood of data. "Data is the new
oil," Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, he cited a growing competitive "separa-
tion" between companies that collect and understand their data and those that do not. A single
autonomous car can generate the same data trove as 3,000 people surfing the Internet, while
a small drone fleet could easily create 150 terabytes of data per day. (Tyson, 2016). A singe UAS
in a single mission can create even more data than a single autonomous car.

Hacking drones is now becoming a market sector all on its own. "Military technology compa-
nies from around the world are rushing to design, build, and sell drones that hack and track,
while others want to own the business of hacking of the drones themselves. The burgeoning
market is foreshadowing battles that could play out in the skies and, for some companies, bring
significant profits" (O'Neil, 2018).

Power by the hour offers the ability to sell the information once to a specific customer or to
offer it to several customers, allowing for a greater rate of return. A turn-key UAS offering may
include the information as a product with training and support of the equipment with a host
country owning/controlling/maintaining and operating system or a combination of product
sales and service support contracts.

Mission Drives the Sensor Requirements
The mission drives the payload choices, and the payload should drive the platform. In reality
this tends to be the reverse. The platform creates compromised trade-offs between a higher
quality sensor that weighs more and consumes power versus a lower quality sensor that is less
expensive, lighter, but will require more passes to get useable information or will provide a less
clean data set. "As military UASs continue to evolve and shrink-think of swarms of tiny drones-
their resulting payload footprints pose numerous SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) design space
constraints and tradeoffs, together witeh sensor processing, data link bankwith and security
issues as well" (Cole, 2016). Keeping in mind that the more passes to collect data can increase
the cyber footprint and create needless cyber vulnerabilities. "You can get information much
faster if you do the processing in near-real time onboard the aircraft and then get the data
down the link" (Cole, 2016).
Standard ISR Camera Sensors
The average payload on a UAS is a passive sensor that does not emit any signals or energy,
it sends and or records this data entirely in passive mode. Standard ISR payloads consist of a
sensor, normally a camera such as the popular Go-Pro cameras shown below, that offer many
user-friendly features while still acquiring high-quality data that can be processed onboard the
aircraft, sent down on a live downlink for processing on the ground, or a combination of these
techniques. "Military UAS users are seeking actionable intelligence from their sensors in real
time-whether the sensor is part of a radar, electronic warfare or ISR sensor chain" (Cole, 2016)

Newer designs include the modularity of cameras including a camera that is a, "drone that
comes with a 4K camera and has autonomous features... (and is able to) transform the drone
into something that can fly, a home security camera, a wearable, or a camera mounted on a
stick. It's a versatile product packed into a single device" (McKalin, 2018).
Multispectral and Hyperspectral Sensors
To gain additional insight into target areas, the use of multispectral and hyperspectral sensors
allows for extended data collection. "The main difference between multispectral and hyper-
spectral is the number of bands and the bandwidths. Multispectral imagery generally refers to
three to ten bands. To be clear, each band is obtained using a remote sensing radiometer.
A hyperspectral image could have hundreds or thousands of bands" These sensors tend to need
copious amounts of power to operate and create pairing issues for datalinks that can handle
the amount of data being generated. This is a consideration if the data is going to be encrypted
as the data rates will be derogated and real-time monitoring may not be possible. "Multispec-
tral and hyperspectral imagery gives the power to see as humans (red, green and blue), gold-
fish (infrared) and bumble bees (ultraviolet). We can see even more than this as reflected EM
radiation to the sensor"("Multispectral vs Hyperspectral Imagery Explained," 2018). Pictured in

proximity of the sensor to target.

       "Hyperspectral imaging combines taking pictures of a scene or object, with a spectral
       view at each point of resolution in the scene. The result is a 3-dimensional data set
       that can be sliced to view multiple images at separate wavelengths or sliced to show
       how the spectra vary along different spatial positions across the image in one direction.
       If the acquisition system or the object is moving, the 4th dimension of time is added."

A Changing World Creates a Changing Target Set and Sensor Requirement- SWIR

220 | Chapter 10: UAS Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)
Since 9-11, the requirements for ISR capabilities quickly moved from the ability to photograph a
military installation, or large piece of equipment such as a tank, to the difficult requirement to
locate individuals or small groups. "Past reconnaissance needs were more strategic in nature,
today's needs are highly tactical, demanding an elevated level of persistence and the ability, in
many cases, to identify individual humans in the field of interest. Many approaches have been
employed and proposed, but in recent years, the exceptional capabilities of shortwave infrared
(SWIR) technology have made SWIR the "Next Generation" of imaging technology for ground,
airborne and space technology." ("Using SWIR in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
(ISR) Military and Security Systems," 2018)

Pictured here is image (Figure 10-5) with eight Shortwave InfraRed (SWIR) bands which are
ideal for material identification and mapping. Visible imagery is shown on the left and classi-
fication using SWIR imagery is shown on the right. Note that different roof top materials that
look the same in the visible imagery are clearly differentiated in the SWIR imagery (Young,
2018).
SWIR cameras and sensors can see reflected light in the shorter wavelengths. Small targets
such as humans become distinguishable, with the "typical difference being that all hair shows
as white due to the lack of moisture in hair. Conversely, skin shows darker, due to its high mois-
ture content. It is said that long and medium wave sensors provide detection, while SWIR and
visible sensors provide recognition." ("Using SWIR in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnais-
sance (ISR) Military and Security Systems," 2018). This spectrum is illustrated below, and it is

Bomb-Sniffing Drone Technology
UAS can be outfitted with sensor suites that can detect improvised explosive devices and other
active landmines from past wars. This not only offers direct security, but it also offers a safer
way to detect landmines. "Sensors look for gamma rays or other particles with the signatures
of specific materials, such as explosives or a nuclear device. It is the same technology used at
security checkpoints to scan luggage and shipping containers in airports, but the breakthrough
for the UW-Madison scientists was making the radiation source small enough to mount on
a drone" (R. Schultz, 2016). Drug and bomb-sniffing drones can detect dangerous chemicals
from 1.8 MILES away." Unmanned drug-sniffing drones have been introduced in the Nether-
lands. They fly over houses (video), sniff for weed and scan for grow lights. Police say they are
not breaking the law because the samples can be taken without entering the building." (Zenpus,
2009). See Figure 10-5 for bomb sniffing logic for UAS Figure 10-5 for bomb sniffing logic for
UAS.

Cave Mapping
Unique missions' development will mean the UAS uses are only limited to the innovation of
the operator and limits of physics. One such application is the mapping of underground mines,
normally a dangerous job attempted by humans, it is one that UAS are well suited to accom-
plish. UAS, "will be able to carry out safety checks by monitoring the build-up of water and
checking the extent of roof collapses, and search for valuable mineral deposits that may have
been missed" (Hambling, 2017).
A standard quad-copter UAS is outfitted with, "powerful LED lights, cameras, and sonar. Ini-

222 | Chapter 10: UAS Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)
tially, they tried flying it using the drone's on-board camera to guide them, an approach known
as First Person View (FPV) piloting" (Hambling, 2017).

Using a multi-mission sensor suite, the variety of data that can be collected and stored in a
brief period is far superior to human lead collections. "Sonar sensors, which use sound waves
to detect objects, produce less data than video cameras. This means they can be used to cre-
ate a 3D model more quickly, possibly even in real time...the sonar model is less accurate; a
yet-to-be-published paper shows that it provides effective navigation. Given that it uses fewer
data and therefore less processing power, the mapping could potentially be done onboard the
drone" (Hambling, 2017).

UAS offers the ability to create modular designs for sensor suites, allowing many options for
data acquisition to be tested in a short amount of time. This offers the ability to determine the
best mix of sensors, platforms, and data acquisition capabilities, "we are also experimenting
with lidar, which maps using lasers. Also, they are running tests with data from X-ray fluores-
cence analyses, which detect different elements, to train machine learning to identify minerals
in rock walls." (Hambling, 2017).

Mission and Sensor Planning and Considerations

Several issues must be considered in planning a successful UAS mission in order to acquire
the required data in a useable format, in a timely and secure manner as "the next front in the
cyberwar is literally above your head" (O'Neil, 2018). Information can be stored on the vehicle
for later retrieval, or it can be real time or near real time sent back to the ground for process-
ing. Several factors will determine the optimal method to obtain and secure the information,
including encryption threat environment, timeliness, and the consequences (if any) if the infor-
mation is intercepted or compromised. "Maldrone backdoor malware kit has been developed
as a universal hack, applicable to all makes and models of UAV. Maldrone silently interacts with
a drone's device drivers and sensors, allowing the user to hijack and control the UAV remotely"
(CyberRisk, 2017). The below graphics offer some sense of planning that must be done in look-
ing at flight paths and sensor limitations, including security of the information.

One technique for securing information that must be sent using non-secure or hackable meth-
ods is to obfuscate the true data that is being collected. This can be done by increasing the
number of passes and collecting a larger dataset than the mission requires, effectively flood-
ing the sensor with data so an adversary would not be able to discern the truly valuable data
from the noise. "Poorly secured or unsecured wireless networks are particularly vulnerable,
with attack scenarios envisaged where compromised or purpose-bought UAVs could be flown
or discreetly landed near a hot spot and used to stage Man in the Middle (MIM), data injec-
tion, and similar attacks over guest and short-range Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other wireless con-
nections. The success of such attacks might be bolstered by the fact that traditional security

224 | Chapter 10: UAS Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)
measures operate on the assumption that no-one could get close enough to such short-range
wireless connections to pose a serious threat". (CyberRisk, 2017)
"As depicted in Table 10-2 below a mission that might only need one or two passes at a lower
altitude, instead might be flown at multiple altitudes and additional passes over the target
allowing for the obfuscation of the true targeted data. This technique also allows for additional
data analysis on an area, however, due to storage, data links, timing and threat environments
this technique is not always employed." (Bosak, 2014)
"One easily can deduce 72km2 map surface in a single direction straight flight.
However, assuming returning flight and only 60% overlap, one gets (100%+40%) *720m=1008m
strip width and only one hour of flying in one direction.
This yields only 50.4km2 map surface with returning flight." (Bosak, 2014)

Importance of stabilized head
"Since increasing overlap is so costly in mission time and so important in urban areas, UAS
can use roll-stabilized head and has aerodynamic design successfully attenuating oscillations
in pitch and yaw axes. The use or roll-stabilized head increases useful surface during turns
and increases processing success rate thanks to overall more predictable photo properties. See
Figure 10-8." (Bosak, 2014)

"Both small UAV like flying wings and even large UAS with several meters wingspan tend to
respond for navigation with changing 0-5 deg roll both directions even when ordered to `fly
straight' over the ground. The reason is, while the ground path is straight, the wind blows in
any direction, usually as much as 45 deg different at altitude than at ground level, with little
direction change but much more wind speed variation. This means the UAS has to bank left and
right all the time in order to stay on its path"
Protecting the Systems from the Cyber Threat
Sensors, datalinks, platforms and power supplies tend to be built independently without cyber
protection standards built in leaving the systems vulnerable. The very nature of "plug and play"
tends to create incompatibility in cyber protection with virtually no data standards.
"Analysis of the configuration and flight controllers/microprocessors of several popular UAV
models having multiple rotors revealed weaknesses associated with both the telemetry links
streaming data to and from a drone via serial port connections (in which information could be
captured, modified, or injected), and the UAVs' connections to their ground station interface
(whose data link could be spoofed, enabling hackers to assume complete control of the vehicle)"
(CyberRisk, 2017).

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 227
The dangers of weak security protocols is becoming more apparent as reported by CNN on
December 17, 2009 as, "Insurgents were able to use a mass-market software program to view
live feeds from U.S. military Predator drones monitoring targets in Iraq. There also is evidence
that UAV feeds also have been hacked in Afghanistan, but there was no evidence the militants
were able to take control of the remote aircrafts' systems in either country. The inexpensive
software, created by a Russian company called SkyGrabber, is downloadable off the Internet.
It allows users to take advantage of unprotected communication links in some of the UAVs"
(Mount & Quijano, 2009).
An attacker can have many objectives in launching an attack. Possible goals include the loss of
data integrity, the link to the vehicle, or the payload. An example of an attack tree that demon-
strates different branches of attacks based on a MIM attack is shown below in Figure 10-7.
"The loss of integrity (Level 1 of the attack tree) is achieved by manipulating the communication
stream between the client and the server creating cyber-physical impacts. The branches of the
tree represent the methods attackers can achieve their goal. The arrows in the attack tree indi-
cate the sequence through which each attack proceeds" (Ahmad Yousef et al., 2018).
Encryption offers some level of protection.

However, compromises occur due to mission requirements. Encryption can overload data links,
take up valuable bandwidth and cause undesirable flight and control characteristics if a real
time data link and control is required for the mission. Not using encryption is a trade-off that a
Pentagon official said, "that many of the UAV feeds need to be sent out live to numerous peo-
ple at one time, and encryption was found to slow the real-time link. The encryption therefore
was removed from many feeds. Removing the encryption, however, allowed outsiders with the
correct tools to gain unauthorized access to these feeds" (Mount & Quijano, 2009).

"Is there a perfect solution to the security issues involved in UAS operations? No. There is
always a degree of risk to be mitigated." (Nichols, 2002) However, what if a the UAS payload or
flight control systems is lost to a hacker or an enemy nation it would be advisable to build a
way of remotely disabling or destroying the information, sensor and or vehicle? Over the years
many concepts and ideas have come forward including the idea of a "zero out" chip that would
automatically delete all information on a UAS upon a compromised status. Cornell University
and Honeywell Aerospace in laboratory testing is developing a method of vaporizing electronic
circuits, without laying a hand on the actual device.

The design method is, "When the shell is exposed to a certain frequency of radio waves, tiny
graphene-on-nitride valves between the cavities open, allowing the chemicals to mix and react.
Along with applications such as data protection, it is hoped that the technology might also find
use in things like environmental sensors that can be remotely vaporized once they're no longer
needed" (Coxworth, 2018).

Conclusions

Although ISR payloads have increased in capability and the wide range of data collections, the
goals and mission of remote sensing platforms remain constant. The ISR platforms and the sen-
sors that they carry stared off as balloons, and went into airplanes, then into satellites, and are
now being put into unmanned aerial systems with modular payloads, allowing vast amounts of
information to be collected.

The wide variety of sensor payloads should drive the missions and data collects, however in
the real world it is often the platform that dictates the sensors choices, which can impact the
ability to collect the data required. The weight and power requirements of the sensor must
be considered when planning the flights. The mission profile (number of passes and angles)
are all considerations when pairing a sensor with a platform including all mission data collec-
tion parameters that drive the ISR requirements. Sensor data security and the threat of attacks
within the cyber domain must be addressed. Mission planning will require tradeoffs between
access to the target area, sensor capability and availability, information time dominance and
cyber/data security requirements.

Students are encouraged to continue researching and learning about the new sensors systems,
data links and cybersecurity techniques for use on UAS. As the market expands, more sensors
will be built and optimized specifically for UAS, leading to more cyber attacks and the vulnera-
bility of the data, as well as the UAS vehicles before during and after missions.

Discussion questions

  1. How could you use physical security and UAS flight characteristics to supplement a UAS
      cybersecurity plan?

 2. How has UAS changed the nature of ISR after the attacks on 9-11?
 3. What sensors would you use to map the health of agricultural crops?
 4. What is the best way to secure the data collected by UAS, collecting it and storing

      onboard or using data links to process the information on the ground? Please explain
      your answer.
 5. Name three unique missions that UAS payloads are configured for today that in the past
      humans would have been assigned to do. Research three additional missions' payloads
      and discuss how these payloads are being integrated on UAS.

Chapter 11: UAS Weapons

Student Learning Objective
The student will gain knowledge of UAS weapons, both lethal and non-lethal options, and the
current state of industry and planning and execution considerations for weapons employment.
The student will examine how world events are driving the UAS weapons industry as well as a
glimpse at the future of weapons for UAS platforms.
History
Unmanned vehicles have been around for quite some time. Some were even weapons in and
of themselves. The first consistent use of a UAS, or RPV as they were called then, was in Viet-
nam. The Lightning Bug program using the BQM-34 Firebee was equipped with both grav-
ity weapons and missiles. "The Navy, meanwhile, canceled the most extensive armed UAV
(unmanned aerial vehicle) program in U.S. history the same year the armed Firebee was tested,
retiring its QH-50 DASH drone helicopter, which carried torpedoes and even nuclear depth
bombs that were never used in combat." (Whittle, 2015).
The Firebee underwent weapons testing late in the war. The only "weapon" used during the
war was the leaflet bombs. The Firebee weapon set included MK-82 varieties that included
early laser-guided bombs, early maverick missiles, early cluster bombs, TV guided weapons and
unattended sensors. The BQM-34 series with various designations flew over 3,500 missions
(Northrup Grumman Brochure) in Vietnam. See Figure 11-1. Most were reconnaissance, but a
considerable number were decoy missions to address the enemy's surface to air missile sys-
tems. "Despite the drone successfully destroying various mock enemies on the ground, the Air
Force lost interest in the project. For one, after the Vietnam War formally ended in 1973, Wash-
ington slashed defense spending across the board." (Joseph, 2016).

Desert Storm: Though UASs were used to excellent effect during Desert Storm, other than
cruise missiles, and armed UAS were not used.
Events in 2000
"The first predator flight over Afghanistan was on September 7th, 2000." (Kaplan, 2016) "An
unmanned spy plane called the Predator begins flying over Afghanistan, showing incomparably
detailed real-time video and photographs of the movements of what appears to be Bin Laden
and his aides. It flies successfully over Afghanistan sixteen times" (9-11 Commission Report,
2004). "The Predator has been used in the Balkans and Iraq since 1996. President Clinton is
impressed by a two-minute video of Bin Laden crossing a street heading toward a mosque
inside his Tarnak Farms complex. Bin Laden is surrounded by a team of a dozen armed
men creating a professional forward security perimeter. One Predator crashes on takeoff and
another is chased by a fighter, but it apparently identifies Bin Laden on three occasions. Its
use is halted in Afghanistan after a few trials, as seasonal winds are picking up. It is agreed to

resume the flights in the spring, but the Predator fails to fly over Afghanistan again until after
9/11" (Derek, 2000). (Kaplan, 2016)
"The USAF BIG SAFARI program office managed the Predator program and was given direction
on 21 June 2000 to explore options to arm the aircraft. This led to it being fitted with reinforced
wings and stores pylons to carry munitions, as well as a laser designator. The RQ-1 conducted
its first firing of a Hellfire anti-tank missile on 16 February 2001, over a bombing range near
Indian Springs Air Force Station north of Las Vegas, Nevada. An inert AGM-114C successfully hit
a tank target. This led to a series of tests on 21 February 2001 in which the Predator fired three
Hellfire missiles, scoring hits on a stationary tank with all three missiles. Following the Febru-
ary tests, the decision was made to move immediately to increment two of the testing phase,
which involved more complex tests to hunt for simulated moving targets from greater altitudes
with the more advanced AGM-114K version." (Derek, 2000).

Post 9/11/2001
War on Terror: In a much-accelerated program, the Predator UAS was pressed into service
with weapons. The designation for the weaponized version became the MQ-1. See Figure 11-2.
Predators had been flying surveillance missions up until that point. Predators were armed with
Hellfire missiles. Soon they were flying over Afghanistan. Dull, dirty, and dangerous are often
cited as the reasons for unmanned vehicles, especially armed UAS. However, the driving force
behind the proliferation of armed UAS in the war on terror has been shortening the kill chain
and persistence in the target area. "Subsequent to 9/11, approval was quickly granted to ship
the missiles, and the Predator aircraft and missiles reached their overseas location on 16 Sep-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 235
tember 2001. The first mission was flown over Kabul and Kandahar on 18 September without
a weapons payload. Subsequent host nation approval was granted on 7 October, and the first
armed mission was flown on the same day." (Derek, 2000). "The one pictured here was deployed
in Afghanistan, where it became the first drone to fire Hellfire's in combat. In all, it flew 261
sorties in Afghanistan, totaling more than 2,700 hours, before the Air Force donated it to the
Air and Space Museum in 2003." (Bodwden, 2013).
The combination of persistence and weapons capability turned out to be very effective. "And
yet the most important breakthrough was still to come. The original drones broadcast a view
only to operators on the ground. As the United States continued to fight in Afghanistan and
Iraq, the drones' cameras and sensors were linked to the global telecommunications system.
Now a drone could be piloted--and its live feed viewed and its missiles aimed--from anywhere
in the world. The pilots could be insulated from the risks of combat" (Bodwden, 2013).
The U.S. military quickly mounted "caps," or permanent observation platforms, over large areas.
Using computers to analyze data feeding continuously from drones, military and spy agencies
isolated and tracked targets night and day. Whole enemy networks could be mapped simply
by following a target's moves and contacts over time, tying together visual imagery with other
kinds of intelligence; intercepted phone calls, e-mails, and text messages. Munitions could be
fired at the time and place of a drone operator's choosing (Bodwden, 2013).
"An Iraqi MiG-25 shot down a Predator performing reconnaissance over the no-fly zone in Iraq
on 23 December 2002. This was the first time in history a conventional aircraft and a drone
had engaged each other in combat. Predators had been armed with AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air
missiles and were being used to "bait" Iraqi fighters, then run. In this incident, the Predator did
not run but instead fired one of its Stingers. The Stinger's heat-seeker became "distracted" by
the MiG's missile and missed the MiG. The Predator was hit by the MiG's missile and destroyed."
(Knights, 2005). This became the first air-to-air engagement by an armed UAS.

In 2007 the Predator was joined in Afghanistan by the Predator B which later was renamed
as the Reaper and designated as the MQ-9. "The MQ-9 is fitted with six stores pylons. The
inner stores pylons can carry a maximum of 1,500 pounds (680 kg) each and allow carriage of
external fuel tanks. The mid-wing stores pylons can carry a maximum of 600 pounds (270 kg)
each, while the outer stores pylons can carry a maximum of 200 pounds (91 kg) each. An MQ-9
with two 1,000 pound (450 kg) external fuel tanks and one thousand pound of munitions, has
an endurance of 42 hours. The Reaper has an endurance of fourteen hours when fully loaded
with munitions. The MQ-9 carries a variety of weapons including the GBU-12 Paveway II laser-
guided bomb, the AGM-114 Hellfire II air-to-ground missiles, the AIM-9 Sidewinder[16], and the
GBU-38 JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition)." (Grier, 2009). The JDAM weapon was added to
the list in 2017.
"The pilots first conducted combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan in the summer of 2007.
On 28 October 2007, the Air Force Times reported an MQ-9 had achieved its first "kill," suc-
cessfully firing a Hellfire missile against Afghanistan insurgents in the Deh Rawood region of
the mountainous Oruzgan province. See Figure 11-3. By 6 March 2008, according to USAF Lieu-
tenant General Gary North, the Reaper had attacked sixteen targets in Afghanistan using 500
lb. (230 kg) bombs and Hellfire missiles (Tirpak, 2000).
The Reaper can carry as many as sixteen Hellfire missiles, but the typical load is as pictured
with four Hellfires and two GBU-12 or GBU-38. "On 13 September 2009, positive control of an
MQ-9 was lost during a combat mission over Afghanistan, after which the control-less drone
started flying towards the Afghan border with Tajikistan. An F-15E Strike Eagle fired an AIM-9
missile at the drone, successfully destroying its engine. Before the drone impacted the ground,
contact was reestablished with the drone, and it was flown into a mountain to destroy it. It was

the first US drone to be destroyed intentionally by allied forces." (Reichhardt, 2009). See Figure
11-4.
"On 27 June 2014, the Pentagon confirmed that a number of armed Predators had been sent
to Iraq along with U.S. Special Forces following advances by the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant. The Predators were flying thirty to forty missions a day in and around Baghdad with
government permission, and intelligence was shared with Iraqi forces." ("Unmanned aircraft
Predator armed with Hellfire missiles used in Iraq to protected U.S. advisers," 2014). Combat
operations have continued into 2018 in Iraq and Syria to combat ISIS.
"During his eight years in office, Mr. Obama authorized roughly 550 drone strikes in Pakistan,
Yemen, Somalia, and other nations in which the U.S. was not explicitly at war.
In just his first twelve months, Mr. Trump green-lighted at least eighty strikes in those coun-
tries and "is on pace to surpass the strike tempo of both of his predecessors, which perhaps
signals a great willingness to use lethal force," the survey says." (Wolfgang, 2018). Operations in
and around Afghanistan have also increased the number of strikes.

Weapons Systems (Lethal)
Hellfire: The combination of the Predator/Reaper with the Hellfire missile brought the armed
UAS into its own. There are several varieties of Hellfire missiles, but the weapon of choice

238 | Chapter 11: UAS Weapons
has been the AGM 114K with the semi-active laser guidance. It is simple, accurate, and useful
in a variety of environments. It is not without its limitations, which will be discussed later.
"AGM-114K. One of the newest missiles in the Hellfire family, this missile features dual war-
heads, electro-optical countermeasure immunity, and a programmable guidance section for
trajectory shaping/seeker logic changes. This missile is referred to as the Hellfire II missile.
The missile is sixty four inches long and weighs one hundred pounds." (AH-64D Longbow Hell-
fire Modular Missle System, 2009).

As an active emitting missile that is inertially guided and radar-assisted, "the RF Hellfire missile
uses an active RF signal to detect and track targets. It emits RF energy and homes-in on
the reflected RF energy. The missile is sixty nine inches long and weighs one hundred eight
pounds" (AH-64D Longbow Hellfire Modular Missle System, 2009). The RF version would allow
all-weather operations including launching through an under cast, but this weapon is not yet
used by any UAS. It is the primary weapon of the Longbow helicopter.

"The AM-114M version was originally developed for the Navy. Its warhead is solely blast frag-
mentation, which is effective against boats and lightly armored vehicles.

The AGM-114N variant uses a thermobaric ("metal augmented charge") warhead that can suck
the air out of a cave, collapse a building, or produce an astoundingly large blast radius out in
the open" (AH-64D Longbow Hellfire Modular Missle System, 2009).

A new AGM-114R "multi-purpose" Hellfire II is scheduled to go into production, with some
guidance and navigation improvements and, "goes one step further than the K-A variant: it's
intended to work well against all three target types: armored vehicles, fortified positions, or
soft/open targets. The Romeo is the mainstay of the future Hellfire fleet, used from helicopters
and UAVs, until and unless Hellfire itself is supplanted by the JAGM program" ("US Hellfire Mis-
sile Orders, FY 2011-2017," 2017).

"There are multiple kinds of HELLFIRE warheads to include a High-Explosive Anti-Tank, or
HEAT, weapon and a Blast-Fragmentation explosive along with several others.

  · The HEAT round uses what is called a tandem warhead with both a smaller and larger
      shaped charge. The idea is to achieve the initial requisite effect before detonating a larger
      explosion to maximize damage to the target.

  · The Blast-Frag warhead is a laser-guided penetrator weapon with a hardened steel cas-
      ing, incendiary pellets designed for enemy ships, bunkers, patrol boats and things like
      communications infrastructure, according to Army documents.

  · The Metal Augmented Charge warhead improves upon the Blast-Frag weapon by adding
      metal fuel to the missile designed to increase the blast overpressure inside bunkers,
      ships, and multi-room targets.

  · The Metal Augmented Charge is penetrating, laser-guided and used for attacks on

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 239
      bridges, air defenses, and oil rigs. The missile uses blast effects, fragmentation and over-
      pressure to destroy targets." (Osborn, 2017).

The HEAT warhead is primarily designed for armored targets. It can penetrate the defenses on
all current tanks, including reactive armor. The K version uses a shaped charge warhead with
a scored steel fragmentation sleeve for counter personnel and light skinned vehicle purposes.
The frag pattern is significantly affected by the impact angle of the weapon. The steeper, the
better.
"There are five basic considerations for using laser spot trackers (LSTs) or laser-guided
weapons (LGWs):

  · LOS must exist between the designator and the target and between the target and the
      LST/LGW.

  · Pulse repetition frequency (PRF) codes of the laser designator and the LST/LGW must be
      compatible.

  · The direction of attack must allow the LST/LGW to sense enough reflected laser energy
      from the target for the seeker to acquire and lock onto the target.

  · The laser target designator must designate the target at the correct time, and for the cor-
      rect length of time. If the length of time is insufficient, the seeker head could break the
      lock, and the flight pattern of the LGW becomes unpredictable.

  · The delivery system must release the LGW within the specific LGW delivery envelope to
      ensure the weapon can physically reach the target.

There is an increased hazard to friendly forces when aircrews release weapons behind friendly
positions. The final decision to release standoff LGWs from behind friendly positions in a CAS
environment rests with the ground commander." (Close Air Support-Joint Publication 3-09.3,
2014).

In open terrain this weapon, with its semi-active laser seeker, is relatively easy to employ from
altitudes flown by the Reaper (Predators have been retired). However, when operations move
to the more urban environment, laser operations have additional challenges. Chief among them
is the ability to keep the laser spot on the target throughout the entire weapon flight time. This
includes the entire slant range due to the altitude of the Reaper. Example approximate times of
flight: "1 km- 3 s / 2 km- 7 s / 3 km- 10 s / 4 km- 14 s / 5 km- 19 s / 6 km- 24 s / 7 km- 29 s
/ 8 km- 36 s" ("Hellfire," 2018). The aircraft's motion during this time could place a building in
the line of sight or cause part of the laser beam to reflect off a closer object or elevated terrain
(hill, bridge, vehicle, etc.) The weapon guides to the first reflected laser energy. The taller the
urban canyon, the more difficult it becomes.
A Hellfire launched from a Reaper at altitude has a significant WEZ (Weapon Engagement
Zone) that can extend out to twelve kilometers. The weapon can also literally hit a target that
is behind the wing line of the aircraft; although that zone is quite small. In Figure 11-5, the
bounded green area is the projected successful WEZ. The red area reflects the weapon's mini-
mum range limitations, i.e., arming. The gap from the minimum range to the WEZ is a function
of the altitude that the aircraft is flying. Airspeed and altitude both change the shape of the
WEZ.
Although the Hellfire missile has a relatively small warhead, it still can produce a significant
amount of collateral damage. Often a significant amount of time is spent waiting for non-com-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 241
batants to leave the lethal zone of the missile. Sometimes the entire attack is thwarted for this
reason. The typical blast/frag radius is about 15 to 20 meters.

a. GBU-12: "The Guided Bomb Unit-12 (GBU-12) utilizes a Mk82 500-pound general purpose
warhead. The operator illuminates a target with a laser designator and then the munition
guides to a spot of laser energy reflected from the target. See Figure 11-6. The GBU-12 is
a member of the Paveway II series of laser-guided bombs (LGBs)" ("Guided Bomb Unit-12
(GBU-12) Paveway II," 2017). Laser guided bombs made their debut in the Vietnam War, but rose
to prominence in Operation Desert Storm. The guidance system uses a bang-bang methodol-
ogy. When the weapon is no longer pointed directly at the laser, the guidance fins go to full
deflection to correct the error. This generates a sinusoidal type of path about the direct line of
sight. The reason this is important is twofold. First it uses up the bombs energy which starts
out low due to the Reaper's low speed at launch. Second, the bomb tends to spend more time
on the low side of the direct line of sight, causing the bomb to fall short of the target in some
scenarios. Techniques to overcome these effects include raising the spot location slightly on
the target when possible and/or using a release point that ensures the bombs dive angle to the
target is greater than 45 degrees. At that point the bomb gains energy throughout the engage-
ment.
The GBU-12 provides a significant degree of both blast and fragmentation. See Figure 11-7.

The weapon can destroy a wide variety of targets. Certain targets, like tanks, require a direct
hit or a coupling effect from the blast to be effective. A miss distance of ten feet or less can
produce the desired coupling effect. The GBU-12 is affected by the same laser limitations in
urban terrain as the Hellfire, but more pronounced. Because of the collateral damage area of
the 500 lb. warhead, it is not normally the weapon of choice in populated areas for a war on
terror scenario. The collateral damage radius can extend to about 2,500 ft. This effect makes
the weapon ideal for groups of combatants in the open or in a building. When targeting com-
batants or equipment inside of a structure, a small delay fuse is incorporated into the overall
fuse to ensure detonation occurs inside the structure for maximum effect. Above is an example
of a Paveway II bomb delivery envelope. Actual ranges for a Reaper will generally be shorter due
to the lower launch speeds of the aircraft ("Guided Bomb Unit-12 (GBU-12) Paveway II," 2017).

b. GBU-38/GBU-54: "The Air Force has added the Joint Direct Attack Munition (GBU-38) a
GPS-guided bomb, to the Reaper drone force, dropping the first one in a combat strike in
Operation Inherent Resolve..." (Clark, 2017). The weapon has the JDAM GPS/INS tail unit and
a nose laser guidance unit. Operational use was started with just the tail unit and the weapon
being dropped on pre-programmed coordinates. "It also has a selectable fuse...." "I can target
the third floor of an apartment building, or we could target an enemy vehicle, or we could tar-
get enemy personnel in the open all with the same weapon because I know I can adjust the fuse
with this weapon and I just don't have that option with the GBU-12." The GBU-38 is "also more
useful in cloudy weather" because it uses coordinates and is not laser guided" (Clark, 2017). See
Figures 11-8 and 11-9.
The GBU-54 is expected to replace the GBU-38. It also includes the JDAM tail unit and a laser
guidance nose unit. Although the laser guidance unit is relatively new, it is currently scheduled
to be incorporated into the overall guidance package. The GBU-54 makes it easier and more
effective to take out moving targets.

GBU-39B/B: The Air Force has awarded a contract to General Atomics to integrate this weapon
capability into its MQ-9 Reaper. Work is expected to be completed by 2021 but is already oper-
ational with the Special Operations Command. The GBU-39B/B is a laser-guided version of the
small diameter bomb. The wings that deploy on release will give the Reaper a 40 nm stand-off
weapons capability. The GBU-39B/B (Figure 11-10) also has INS/GPS precision guidance.

The choice of laser guidance or GPS guidance is a function of several considerations such as

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 245
weather, laser spot size at longer ranges and whether the target is moving or stationary. "The
Laser, Small Diameter Bomb variant, planned for the Reaper integrates the JDAM's semi-active
laser, enabling the bomb to hit targets moving at up to 80 km/h (50 mph) and has been fielded
by the U.S. Special Operations Command since 2014" (Fergus, 2017). Because the Laser Small
Diameter Bomb (LSDB) is approximately half the weight of the GBU-12/38/54 type bombs, the
Reaper can double the number of precision bombs that it carries. The LSDB also has a signif-
icantly smaller collateral damage zone. Thus, making them more user-friendly in urban and
near-urban environments. Since all of these weapons have a laser guidance capability, it is key
that the designating aircraft or ground unit has the matching code for the weapon about to
be employed. Otherwise, the weapon will not guide. Also, the different codes allow multiple
weapons to be guided to separate targets by multiple aircraft or ground units.

Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) Codes

"Laser coding permits the simultaneous use of multiple laser designators and laser-guided
weapons/seekers. Laser designators and seekers use a PRF coding system to ensure that a spe-
cific seeker and designator combination work in harmony. By setting the same code in both the
designator and the seeker, the seeker tracks only the target that is designated with that code.

Code Description

The system uses either a three digit or four-digit numeral system, depending on the type of
laser equipment. Three-digit settings range from 111 to 788, while four-digit settings range from
1,111 to 1,788. All three and four-digit designator/seekers are compatible. Lower numbered PRF
codes provide higher quality designation due to faster pulse repetition.

Code Allocation and Assignment

Laser guided weapons system codes must be controlled and coordinated". (JPJT, 2018) (Glob-
alsecurity, 2016)

c. Future weapons for UAS that are smaller than the Reaper system: Several variant weapons
are in design and testing phases that provide a smaller UAS with a precision weapons capability
and a weapon with a much smaller collateral damage radius. Below is a chart of the current
group of smaller weapons. See Table 11-1.

Weapons (Non-lethal)

Law enforcement use of UAS is still in its initial stages. However, several pilot programs and
policy efforts are underway to add non-lethal weapons into the mix. Tasers and tear gas
canisters are early contenders. "While no state in the US allows the use of deadly force by
drones, North Dakota allows officers to equip them with stun guns and other non-lethal
weapons" (Kozlowska, 2017). North Dakota police are authorized to use drones with tasers
and pepper spray. The Israelis are examining stun grenades, rubber pellet grenades, coloring
agent grenades, and sticky gel grenades. "The U.S. Army is seeking non-lethal warheads to
be deployed on tiny UAVs; the U.S. Army describes the possible uses of the non-lethal UAV.
"Potential commercial applications might include, but are not limited to: crowd control for
local law enforcement; border protection for Homeland Security; or temporary incapacitation
of non-violent criminals for local SWAT teams and/or law enforcement" ("U.S. military seeking
non-lethal UAVs," 2012).

The military can use these types of non-lethal weapons in certain circumstances. The bat-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 247
tlefield, however, lends itself to addition non-lethal weapons. Also, the increased size of the
unmanned military systems provides other options. Non-lethal can be further delineated by
the type of target; either anti-personnel or anti-material.

       Retrieved from https://quizlet.com/26596148/hellfire-flash-cards/

Anti-personnel non-lethal weapons include chemical agents, optical weapons, acoustics,
directed energy, and restraining mechanisms. Anti-material non-lethal weapons include chem-
ical, biological, directed energy, and restraining mechanisms. See Figure 11-11.
Anti-Personnel:
Chemical Agents: "Non-lethal chemical capabilities generally include agents that induce sleep
or produce irritation (calmative, neural inhibitors, irritants, and odor producing chemicals)"
(Siniscalchi, 1998). These types of weapons lend themselves to small areas and favorable
weather conditions
Optical Weapons: Low energy lasers directed against the eyes or night vision goggles. Flash
weapons are also effective directly against personnel. Examples include flash-bang grenades
and high-power strobes.
Acoustics: The two main types of acoustical weapons are the loud hailer and the low-frequency
wave. The loud hailer uses directed high decibel sound to disorient, discourage and potentially
disabling a target. The low-frequency system (below 50 Hz) is used to disorient or even cause
nausea.

248 | Chapter 11: UAS Weapons
Directed Energy (High Powered Microwaves): These weapons can be dialed up or down to
produce the desired effect. Additionally, certain frequencies generate specific effects. Exam-
ples include pain rays (active denial system), systems designed for nausea and disorientation
or even incapacitation. At the highest settings, some of these weapons can cause permanent
damage or death.

Restraining mechanisms: These are typically used to restrict operations in certain areas or
protect a location, building or personnel. These include things as simple as net guns to sticky
foam or super-slick liquids.

Anti-Material

Chemical/Biological: These are typically used as a more clandestine method of attacking vehi-
cles, supplies, or infrastructure. This category includes "Supercaustic agents, derived from
chemical, biological, or biological enzymes, can rapidly deteriorate rubber, plastics, or spoil
petroleum supplies. These are claimed to be millions of times more caustic than hydrofluoric
acid and can be delivered as a liquid or aerosol. Liquid metal embrittlement agents can alter
the molecular structure of metals making them weak and susceptible to structural failure. The
embrittlement agents are normally formulated for a specific metal or alloy which may compli-
cate the flexibility that is needed for combat employment. Polymer agents are extremely strong
adhesives. Polymers, called stick-ems, can be applied as a liquid or foam to deny the mobility
of equipment and personnel. Alternatively, super-lubricants (slick-ems) are being developed as
an anti-traction capability that could disrupt the movement of vehicles" (Siniscalchi, 1998). The
target area for these kinds of weapons are typically finite but can have broader effect; such
as railroad tracks, pipelines, truck parks, or supply depots. Plants are another potential target.
The use of genetically engineered blights on rice, cocoa, poppies, etc. could have a very out-
sized effect on the conflict. Defoliants have been used with success but with very harmful side
effects. New defoliants without the side effects can make a significant impact in certain regions
of the world.

Directed Energy/Electromagnetic Pulse (DE /EP):

"This technology offers a significant capability against modern electronic equipment suscepti-
ble to damage by transient power surges. This weapon generates a very short, intense energy
pulse producing a transient surge of thousands of volts that kills semiconductor devices. See
Figure 11-12.

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 249

The conventional EMP and HMP weapons can disable non-shielded electronic devices includ-
ing practically any modern electronic device within the effective range of the weapon. The
effectiveness of an EMP device is determined by the power generated and the characteristic of
the pulse. See Figure 11-13.

The shorter pulse waveforms, such as microwaves, are far more effective against electronic
equipment and more difficult to harden against. Current efforts focus on converting the energy
from an explosive munitions to supply the electromagnetic pulse. This method produces sig-
nificant levels of directionally focused electromagnetic energy" (Stoker, 2012). These conven-
tional weapons are designed to engage a finite area unlike the potential widespread effect of a
high altitude nuclear weapon. Weapons in this category could target a single UAS or take down
a whole electrical grid.
Restraining mechanisms: Many of these weapons are designed to stop a vehicle. The police
use many of these technologies to assist with ending a pursuit without further endangering the
lives of the fleeing criminals. These include Spike Strips, Grapplers, and a variety of wheel nets.
Grapplers are the only ones attached to a pursuing vehicle and used to capture the wheel of
the vehicle in front. Some wheel nets are designed to capture the wheels of the vehicle while
anchored firmly to the ground to stop the vehicle. Other nets combine the net effect with
the spike strip effect. With the proliferation of small UAS comes the advent of counter UAS
weapons. A couple of those weapons use nets to capture and secure the UAS. See Figure 11-14.

      Availability Anti-Spoofing Module).
  · Threat: Susceptible to the enemy using high powered microwaves against the UAS or the

      weapon.
  · Response: Electronic hardening and shielding efforts.

      being used to control the UAS from a remote location.
  · Response: Military hardened commercial satellites.
  · Threat: Susceptible to the enemy waging a cyber-attack on the controlling facility.
  · Response: UAS control isolation from other information assets in the facility. Securing
      possible attack entry points to the control station, including power.

Conclusions

Armed UAS came into their own during the long-running war on terror, forever changing the
nature of warfare. Their persistence in the target area and the ability to immediately prosecute
the target has given the U.S. and its allies a significant advantage in an area of the world that
historically proved very difficult for outsider militaries. This is true especially in the rugged
areas of Afghanistan and surrounding countries. Unmanned aircraft are not limited by ter-
rain. What was the enemy's advantage in this arena has become part of their weakness. The
Predator/Reaper has been the focus so far for the U.S. armed UAS effort. Initially, their only
weapon was the Hellfire Missile. The advent of the Reaper UAS with its larger payload capabil-
ity added the 500 lb. Laser guided bomb to the equation. The continued success of the Reaper
in the war has brought it several new versions of the 500 lb. weapon. The latest version is
the GBU-54, with both INS/GPS and laser guidance, handle stationary and moving targets in
a variety of weather conditions. Still, the Reaper can only carry two of these precision bombs
along with four Hellfire missiles. Thus, a new weapon is being added to the mix; the GBU-39B/
B. At approximately half the weight of the GBU-54, the Reaper can double its bomb load to
four. The GBU-39B/B also gives the Reaper a 40nm standoff range. The next major effort is
the arming of smaller UAS. A significant variety of weapons have emerged as contenders for
this role. All are precision weapons. Some are rocket powered. Some are gravity weapons. All
produce a much smaller collateral damage radius, which is ideal for both urban and rural oper-

252 | Chapter 11: UAS Weapons
ations, where non-combatants could be a factor. In parallel with this development program is
the advent of combining unmanned aircraft, especially smaller ones with non-lethal weapons.
There is a significant amount of overlap in non-lethal weapon types between the military and
law enforcement. Law enforcement has taken some of the early steps in advancing their non-
lethal capabilities. Their early weapons of choice have been a type of Taser, pepper balls, tear
gas and flash/bang grenades. This will give law enforcement and the military a whole new set
of tools for a wide variety of mission types. One of the most significant tools for the military
is likely to be the use of directed energy weapons. Though non-lethal, they can have a major
impact on both personnel and material targets. Weaponized unmanned vehicles are still in its
early stages, but due to their significant success so far, expect to see many more varieties in
the future. Protecting these assets against the current and future cyber-attack challenges will
play a major role in their continued success.

Questions

Information Dominance (ID)

Student Learning Objectives - The student will be introduced to the concepts of Information
Dominance (ID), Information Superiority (IS), Offensive Information Operations (OIO), Net-
work-Centric Operations (NCO) and deployment objectives for the US Coast Guard in areas of
operation using unmanned air and sea vehicles. This chapter will hone in on the Information
Dominance (ID) goal that UAS/UAV systems present opportunities for excellence in Offensive
Information Operations (OIO), and Network - Centric Operations (NCO).

UAS in Military and Commercial Service

At first glance most developed UASs are applicable to both military and civilian deployment.
The military forces use UAS in dull, dirty, dangerous (DDD) roles in which human pilots would
be at risk. These roles have expanded far beyond the DDD boundary. (Austin, Unmanned Air-
craft Systems: UAVS Design, Development and Deployment, 2010) The reason civilian UASs
have not outnumbered military UAS (in the CONUS) is because of the restrictions in the civilian
market.

Civilian uses require operations in open airspace, rather than on a battlefield or within a mil-
itary enclosure. Regulating authorities have not yet accepted their general operation. (Austin,
Unmanned Aircraft Systems: UAVS Design, Development and Deployment, 2010) FAA is in
charge of protecting the National Airspace (NAS). The FAA regulations regarding UAS seem to
center on preventing injury to persons and damage to property due to failures of the UAS and
preventing injury or damage caused by collisions between UAS and other airborne vehicles.
(Austin, Unmanned Aircraft Systems: UAVS Design, Development and Deployment, 2010) In the
former case, FAA has made effective regulations to assure the airworthiness of the systems and
meeting these requirements to insure protection of persons and property. If there are draw-
backs, they are cost and bureaucracy.

UAS collisions in the NAS is another thing entirely. Authorities are still searching for a com-
pletely reliable method of sensing the presence of another airplane vehicle and avoiding colli-
sion with it. (Austin, Unmanned Aircraft Systems: UAVS Design, Development and Deployment,
2010) This requirement is true in open airspace and in dedicated UAS space. Cost of the SAA
and product support may also be inhibiting the civilian UAS market. Both UAS markets are
subject to the principles of Information Dominance (ID) because UAS / UAV systems are an
essential component of the collection technologies used. As an intermediate step to full com-
mercialization, FAA may require a Part 107 waiver process in controlled airspace. (FAA, 2018)

Information Dominance (ID)

"Information warfare (IW) -based technologies are categorized by their information operations
roles and by three distinct levels of technology maturity:

  · Core Technologies - current state-of-the-art, essential technologies necessary to sustain
      the present level of information.

  · Enabling technologies -concerned with the next generation of IW capabilities. They rep-
      resent a significant enhancement in operations. [Tactical level changes]

  · Emerging technologies - far on the horizon applications where feasibility is demonstrated.
      These are so call Black Swan events which involve radical improvements in capability and
      approach to information operation." [Strategic level changes] (Waltz, 1998) 1972 RSA
      changes to public -key cryptography represented a Black Swan (Taleb, 2010) event in the
      crypto - world. (Rivest, 1978)

Numerous DOD technology studies have evaluated the potential developments that may
impact Information Warfare with respect to UAS / UAV / UUV systems. A few samples:

Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap Fy2011-2036 covers interoperability, autonomy, air-
space integration, and manned-unmanned teaming (MUM) (Army, 2013)

The Navy Unmanned Undersea Vehicle: (UUV) Master Plan covers the important mission cat-
egories for use of UUVs. These include ISR, mine countermeasures (MCM), Anti-submarine
warfare (ASW), Inspection and Identification (ID), Oceanography, communications / navigation
network node (CN3), payload delivery, information operations (IO) time critical strike (TCS),
barrio patrol and sea base support. (Navy, 2004)

Joint Publication JP 6-01, Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Operations covers the
entire spectrum of offensive and defensive electromagnetic spectrum operations for all levels
of defense activities. (Army-M, 2012)

US department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity Strategy- a fascinating document that cov-
ers risk identification, vulnerability reduction, threat reduction, consequence mitigation and
enabling cybersecurity outcomes. (DHS, 2018)

The U.S. Navy's Plan for Information Dominance - a broad ranging document about US Navy
policies to gain ID and to use information as a weapon. (NavyID, 2010)

The Military Critical Technologies List Part II: Weapons of Mass Destruction Technologies. An
older document that enumerates critical technologies for directed energy weapons (DEW) and
information warfare. (DoD-IW, 1998)

"Information Dominance as defined by the US Navy is the operational advantage gained from

258 | Chapter 12: UAS System Deployment and Information Dominance (ID)
fully integrating the Navy's information functions, capabilities and resources to optimize deci-
sion making and maximize warfighting effects." (Google, 2018) There are other definitions:

"Information Dominance - the degree of information superiority that allows the possessor to
use information systems and capabilities to achieve an operational advantage in a conflict or
to control the situation in operations other than war while denying those capabilities to the
adversary." (Army6, 1996)

"Information Dominance - A condition that results from the use of offensive and defensive
information operations to build a comprehensive knowledge advantage at a time, place, and on
decision issues critical to mission success." (Griffith, 1997)

"Information Superiority - the capability to collect, process, and disseminate an uninterrupted
flow of information while exploiting or denying an adversary's ability to do the same." (Chiefs,
2014)

The definitions above have conceptual similarities. The author actual prefers the Information
Superiority approach which involves technologies for collecting data, processing that data into
knowledge and disseminating that knowledge to live respondents. Table 12-1 is a condensed
form of (Waltz, 1998) Table 10.1 pages 362-363 specific to IW/ID. Table 12-1 is essentially a
top-level matrix for Information Warfare based on enabling and emerging core technologies.
Recognize that the prime goal of the broader purview of Information Warfare is Information
Dominance and by inclusion Information Superiority (IS)

As seen in Table 12-1, information dominance technologies fall into "three general areas: col-
lection, processing and dissemination. Collection includes methods of sensing physical phe-
nomena and platforms that allow sensors to carry out their missions. These include direct and
remote sensing devices along with the relays of data to user." (Waltz, 1998)

Processing (power) refers to the numbers of operations per second, information storage capac-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 261
ity (in bits). Technologies to increase processing power are many, subtle, overt, heterogeneous,
involving hardware, software, networks, machine / human interface, autonomous, knowledge-
management, indexing and beyond the scope of this work.

Dissemination technologies are communications technologies to increase bandwidth and effec-
tive use of bandwidth (compression techniques, data / knowledge organization). Enhance-
ments to these technologies include increased storage and shortened latency times.

Unmanned aircraft systems play a significant role in the collection technologies. Collection
technologies include the advanced platforms and sensors to acquire a depth of data. (Waltz,
1998)

High-Altitude Endurance (HAE) and Medium - Altitude Endurance Unmanned Air Vehicles
(UAVs)

"The Global Hawk (HAE) and Predator models (MAE) introduced penetrating airborne sur-
veillance with a broad area search capability. HAE UAVs provide long dwell times over target
areas. Both the Global Hawk and the Predator series complement short - and close-range
UAVs, which do not have deep penetration capability, and satellite surveillance, which does not
have revisit rates." (Waltz, 1998) Close-range UAVs support small unit operations with ranges
to 30km and short-range UAVs have medium-altitude endurance (30-50 hours with 150 to 300
km range)

Both the Global Hawk and Predator sport communication relay capabilities, precision SIGINT,
local precision navigation capabilities, and operate a sensor network with autonomous and
cooperative behavior in hostile space. (Waltz, 1998)

Offensive Information Operations (OIO)

The names and definitions have changed since Waltz's signature work in 1998, on the subject of
Information Warfare, but the operations remain the same - but more sophisticated, networked
and complexity-rich. (Waltz, 1998) Our objective is to see where UAS /UAV systems fit into his
various taxonomies of IW / ID. Coverage of Waltz's work, in this chapter, is only "helicopter
-view" and compressed. The reader is encouraged to explore further the wealth of literature
on this subject.

"Offensive operations are uninvited, unwelcome, unauthorized and detrimental to the target;
therefore, the term Attack to refer to all of these operations." (Waltz, 1998)

"Offensive information operations are malevolent acts conducted to meet strategic, opera-
tional, or tactical objectives of authorized government bodies; legal, criminal or terrorist orga-
nizations; corporations; or individuals. The operations may be performed covertly, without

262 | Chapter 12: UAS System Deployment and Information Dominance (ID)
notice to the target, or they may be intrusive, disruptive, and destructive. The effects on infor-
mation may bring physical results that are lethal on humans." (Waltz, 1998)

President Obama used drones to great success tracking down terrorist High Value Targets
(HVTs) and assassinating them. Because of his elevated use of UAVs for this purpose, he left
somewhat of a legal mess in his wake. (Zenco, 2016) However, the information dominance side
of the operations were an unqualified success.

Offensive information attacks have two basic functions: to capture or to affect information.
Information here refers to data /information / knowledge content. ID is measured in terms of:

  · "Functions - broken down into offensive measures of capture and affect used to effec-
      tively gain a desired degree of control of a target's information resources. Capturing
      information is an act of theft of a resource if captured illegally, or technical exploitation if
      the means are not illicit. Affecting information is an act of intrusion with intent to cause
      unauthorized effects, usually harmful to the information owner." (Waltz, 1998) Both cap-
      ture and affect by UAS are collection processes.

  · Tactics - Attack tactics -the operational processes employed to plan, sequence, and con-
      trol the countermeasures of an attack. These tactics consider objectives, desired effects
      [covertness, denial, disruption of service; destruction, modification, or theft of informa-
      tion], degree of effects; and target vulnerabilities." (Waltz, 1998)

  · Understanding attack mechanisms helps information security designers to prepare for
      defense. In the information business, the common standard of information security
      (INFOSEC) is CIA, which means confidentiality, integrity and availability. (Nichols R. K.,
      2002) Reviewing the attack tactics - factors above, brings to mind Parker's brilliant
      expansion of the CIA basis for securing information. (Parker, 2015)

  · "Parker expanded the traditional INFOSEC framework. Traditionally, users were con-
      cerned with preservation of: confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) information
      from disclosure, modification, destruction, or use; by prevention, detection, recovery; to
      reduce loss or reduce risk of loss. Parker was ahead of his time. He saw INFOSEC as preser-
      vation of six elements: availability, utility, integrity, authenticity, confidentiality, posses-
      sion of information; from accidental or intentional destruction, interference, use of false
      data, modification or replacement, misrepresentation or repudiation, misuse or failure to
      use, access, observation or disclosure, copying, stealing or endangerment. This was done
      by: avoidance, deterrence, prevention, detection, mitigation, transference, sanction,
      recovery, or correction to meet a standard of due care,

       Avoid loss, reduce loss, or / and eliminate loss." (Parker, 2015) Parker even envisioned
       the means to accomplish his information security framework. Two controls were to be
       robustly instituted: government controls to include: employee clearances, the principle
       of need-to-know, mandatory access control, classification of information, and cryptog-

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 263
       raphy and business controls include: need-to-withhold, discretionary access control,
       copyright and patent, and digital signatures. (Parker, 2015)

  · "Techniques -the technical means of capturing and affecting information of humans -
      their computers, communications, and supporting infrastructures." (Waltz, 1998)

  · Motive - varied but most common are: ideological, revenge, greed, hatred, malice, chal-
      lenge, theft.

  · "Invasiveness - Attacks may be active or passive. Active attacks invade and penetrate the
      information target. Passive attacks sit on the line and observe behaviors, information
      flows, timing, and energy." (Waltz, 1998)

  · "Effects -may vary from small- harassment to theft, from narrow, surgical modification of
      information to large-scale cascading of destructive information that brings down critical
      infrastructure." (Waltz, 1998) The Stuxnet attack on the Iranian centrifuges in in 2015 was
      a brilliant example of large-scale effects on critical infrastructure. (Holloway, 2015)

  · Ethics and legality- Traditional intelligence activities are allowed in peacetime (capture
      information by UAS) but information attacks that affect information are not covered ade-
      quately by law. Unlike real property, information is a property that may be shared, abused,
      copied, and stolen without evidence or the knowledge of the legitimate owner.

A taxonomy of attack countermeasures may be viewed in a two-dimensional attack matrix:

Rows are labelled perceptual, information, or physical. Columns are headed by attack category:
capture or affect. From a UAS standpoint, we are only interested in characterizing the infor-
mation infrastructure level of the attack. Before we extract the Figure 8.1 Attack Matrix row in
(Waltz, 1998) page 255, two more avenues of approach are available to the attacker:

  · "Direct, or internal, penetration attacks this involves penetrating a communication link,
      computer, or database to capture and exploit internal information, or to modify, add,
      delete, insert, or install a malicious process." (Waltz, 1998)

  · "Indirect, or external, sensor attacks - perfect for UAS / UAVs flying above the targets.
      The attacker presents open phenomena to the systems sensors or information to sources,
      media, Internet, satellite, third parties, to achieve counter information objectives. These
      attacks include insertion of information, spoofing of information (GPS), to sensors or
      observation of behavior of sensors or links interconnecting fusion nodes." (Waltz, 1998)

Extracting just one information row from Waltz's Attack Matrix (Waltz, 1998) we have:

Modern military activities are focused on network- centric operations. They are concerned
with the primary threats to networks and especially the messaging and interconnecting links.
The explosion of wireless and IoT devices has ramped up INFOSEC concerns. Some system
designers are now trying to mitigate the treats to their networks based on Blockchain tech-
nology. Blockchain is harped as a revolution in cryptographic protection. Started with Bitcoin,
proponents would use Blockchain technologies to protect business, money and military net-
works. (Tapscott, 2016) "The managing author disagrees with this approach on many grounds
including reviewed security holes, privacy issues, single-source point of failure and the fifty

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 265
-one percent emersion/ dominance attack. (Jay, 2018) Lastly, the data is held in the dark web
where the worst of malevolent actors anonymously play." (Nichols R. K., 2018)

Going back to first principles of INFOSEC, primary active threats to networks and network
messaging (includes communication links, EMS vectors, interconnected nodes, wired / wire-
less hardware, and access points, frankly everything that talks to anything in the networks).
The messages may have different formats, however, they are known. UAS systems are not just
collectors of information or signals in the sky. They can convert, modulate, attenuate, insert,
delete information as programmed to do so, and can initiate a network attack! (Nichols R. e.,
2016)

There are five types of network intrusive actions: Access, Denial, Inter-message or spoofed
message, Intra-message, and data storage. The functional objective of access is for an invalid
user to gain access to the system, and the unauthorized user elevates his/her access at a
higher level than authorized. The functional objective of denial is to deny service requests and
to disrupt the flow of messages in the system, rendering it completely inoperable or reduced
in operating capacity to some degree. There are four inter-message intrusive actions: spoof-
ing (like GPS in naval situations), modification, replay, and leakage. All these are compromises
of identity, authentication, message, or content in transit. Intra-message violations are either
repudiation (Didn't order the book) or security content (breach of firewall or security device
/ rule). Data storage intrusions include message pre-plays or direct corruption of sources or
integrity while in storage (sending random bits into backup disks is an example). (Waltz, 1998)

A simple NCO attack strategy can be initiated from any source including UAS over the target
network. (Nichols R. e., 2016) Phase 1 is Reconnaissance begins by searching for and collecting
passwords or cryptographic password files to be computer-brute-forced; gaining access, find-
ing unused accounts, and establishing covert access. Phase two is penetrate and act which
involves gaining entry, check for surveillance, gain system control, attack by searching direc-
tories, acquiring useful data, searching for evidence and destroying both evidence and audit
trails, and surveillance if possible, then replacing control and logging off as if the attacker was
never there. (Nichols R. e., 2016)

Practically every known computer system is vulnerable to attacks. Clark wrote the Red Team
Field Manual of software attacks on every modern system and structure on the market, includ-
ing *NIX, Windows, networking, web, databases, programming and wireless. (Clark, 2013) To
be fair, White and Clark also wrote a Blue Team Field Manual which covered countermea-
sures such as scanning, vulnerability analysis, network discovery, service disabling, firewalls,
detection (visibility) PCAP tools, NETCAT tools, respond and analysis, remediation, tactics, inci-
dent management, and security incident identification (SCHEMA). (White, 2017) One of the best
books on practical countermeasures for network security is by (Nichols R. R., 2000) entitled
Defending your Digital Assets against Hackers, Crackers, Spies and Thieves.

Network-centric Operations (NCO)
                                      Figure 12 -1 UAS Surveillance Network

       Source: Austin, R, S: (2010), CT: Unmanned Aircraft Systems: UAVS Design, Development and
       Deployment. London: Wiley Aerospace Series.

UAS systems - especially military ones - rarely operate in a vacuum. They receive and process
information from many sources, which include satellites, manned aircraft, naval vessels and
ground-based systems. UAVs may be the top supplier of information to a network. Figure 12-1
illustrates a surveillance network using airborne systems. (Austin, Unmanned Aircraft Systems:
UAVS Design, Development and Deployment, 2010) Every theater of war and all their military
activities may be coordinated through a network. This is called network-centric operations
(NCO). An "NCO has four characteristics using robust technologies:

  · Secure communications between systems via multiple links,
  · Standardization of interfaces between key systems,
  · Adaptable and user-friendly interfaces with human operators,
  · Coordinated radio frequency bandwidth." (Austin, Unmanned Aircraft Systems: UAVS

      Design, Development and Deployment, 2010)
The strength of a UAS NCO is that the UAS leader is not limited to surveillance. It is not just the
collection agent / technology. The HALE UAS may disseminate information which it has self-
acquired or received. The UAS is one of the reasons for information dominance achieved via

(Austin, Unmanned Aircraft Systems: UAVS Design, Development and Deployment, 2010)
However, NCOs do have weaknesses. If a major system fails, like GPS, then the whole network
may be subject to catastrophic failure. Most NCOs have both fail-safe and fall back options.

Coast Guard Roles
The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) plays a vital role in Information Dominance (ID). The National
Fleet Policy in 2014, established the partnership of the USCG and USN to enhance both
branches capabilities and identify emerging threats. With the combination of Department of
Defense and Homeland Security in the maritime infrastructure the partnership brings the U.S.
ability to gather intelligence to the next level. (See Figure 12-3) However, this is not the first
time the USCG took part in the world of intelligence. The CG-210, a 75-foot Coast Guard patrol
boat, was the first boat in U.S. history to become a signal-intercept ship. (Bennett, 2016) During
the 1920's the CG-210 employed counterintelligence to stop illegal rum runners. Over 12,000
rum-runner messages were decrypted in a three-year span by Elizabeth Friedman. (Bennett,
2016)

As of today, the Coast Guard "sees a clear opportunity to perform many of its missions faster,
cheaper and more safely through the use of short-range unmanned aircraft systems," said Lt.
Cmdr. Ryan Lampe, short-range UAS platform manager in the Office of Aviation Forces. (Har-
ing, 2018) The sUAS of choice, (Host, 2018), is used to gather intelligence, surveillance, recon-
naissance and provide real time imagery. Real time imagery includes taking photos of the ocean
surface, checking for anomalies, and alerting the aircraft's operator for further investigation.
The ScanEagle can provide VHF/UHF communications relay and Target illumination. How-
ever, after seven years of use the ScanEagle will be challenged by the USCG acquisition of
the Aerosonde. The Aerosonde (Figure 12-4) is larger sUAS that has the capabilities to fly over
150,000 flight hours in temperature extremes. The sUAS also has communications relay, but
the stand out feature is the available day and night full-motion video.

There is one other sUAS the USCG is exploring to add to their inventory. The Puma (See Figure
12-5) is the USCG hand-launched sUAS that is current being tested. The Robotic Aircraft Sensor
Program for the Maritime Environment (RASP-M), under the DHS, has allowed for the testing
of Puma in Mississippi and Connecticut. The advantage of the hand-launched sUAS is the ease
of launch and the ability to carry a payload, such as a high definition camera. This provides
intelligence ranging from if an approaching vessel has weapons to data of a maritime environ-
mental incident.

The Coast Guard uses National Security Cutters (NCS) or commonly referred to "go-fast boats".
(Biesecker, 2018) for sUAS. The NCS are technology advanced, capable of launching small boats
and serve as a flight deck. NCS perform homeland Security and defense operations in the mar-
itime space.
"Unmanned aircraft systems have the potential of being major force multipliers for the Coast
Guard," said Cmdr. Dan Broadhurst, UAS Division Chief for the Office of Aviation Forces
(CG-711). (Haring, 2018) "They can provide persistent, tactical wide-area surveillance, detection,
classification and identification functions that we currently do not have access to." (Haring,
2018) (See Figure 12-6)

USCG is currently researching to acquire long-range, 24-hour endurance, UAS. The long-range
drone would be used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Additional
USCG requirements include the UAS to conduct operations at a 15,000-foot mean above sea
level and various maritime sensors, including electro-optic and infrared full-motion video, sur-
veillance radar, radio frequency and direction finding, and tactical communications radio and
datalink. (Biesecker, 2018)
Often referenced as the forgotten service, the USCG is far from being retired. The USCG has
a long history with their intelligence and counterintelligence skills. The USCG is evolving with
technology, not just by using UAS functionality. They have used UAS for the past eight years.
The Coast Guard has ongoing research that allows for the branch to identify and obtain the
best in industry UAS for intelligence and reconnaissance missions. They will continue to be a
valuable partner to the USN in defense at sea and protecting the homeland.

Discussion Questions

  1. UAS systems are both collection agents and directive information agents. Enumerate the
      points in the network- centric model that are most vulnerable to UAS surveillance or
      intrusion.

 2. How vital is the UAS platform in terms of Information Dominance on the battlefield?
 3. The USCG seems to be a silent service, with a huge mission with limited personnel active

      over all our water and coastlines. Research and report on five areas where they use UAS
      as effectively as any of military services.
 4. Do the same research but focus on Civilian components / uses for UAS surveillance, col-
      lection and intrusion actions - specifically on a computer network.

Chapter 13: Data Links Functions,

Attributes and Latency

Student Learning Objectives

The student will learn about the data-link function of the UAS which allows for bi-directional
communication and data transmissions between UAV and its ground station. The Data Link is
a vital component of an UAS. The student will learn the respective functions of each compo-
nent part and considerations are necessary and how to evaluate their importance when devel-
oping a UAS. While the focus of the lesson will be on military applications, the considerations
will be equally important for those designing and deploying UAS for civilian purposes. While
the design of the Datalink must have requisite attributes that allow the system to function as
intended in various environments globally, it must be able to do so securely and effectively.
Issues such as Data Link security, interception, deception and signal latency are all attributes
that must be balanced to achieve fast and secure data communications between the compo-
nents of the UAS.

What are the Types of UAV's and how are they Categorized?

UAV's are most often divided into four categories based upon their mission duration and oper-
ational radius.

  · High Altitude, Long Endurance ("HALE") most often deployed for reconnaissance, inter-
      ception or attack;

  · Medium altitude, moderate range most often used for reconnaissance and combat effect
      assessment;

  · Low cost, short range small UAV's. (See Figure 13-1.)

Components of the UAS Data-Link and their functions

The UAV and Ground Control Station

There are four essential communication and data processing operations the UAS must be able
to efficiently and effectively carry out. These functions are vital to the ability of the remote
operator or autonomous operation system (auto-pilot) to immediately issue a command, have
it processed and executed and send feedback to the operator or auto-pilot confirming its exe-
cution by the UAV.

                                                                                                      R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and
                                                                                                                                                                                  J.P. Hood | 277
  · UAV Base System. Bi-Directional communication between the UAV and the ground sta-
      tion, providing sensor data to the operator confirming that the command was carried out.

  · UAV Sensor System, which in military applications would likely include cameras, INS GPS
      and radar, where data is collected and processed by the sensors and base system and
      thereafter communicated to operator or autonomous operation system (auto-pilot).

  · UAV Avionic System. Which coverts control commands from the operator or auto pilot to
      the UAV avionic functions, including engine operation, flight surfaces such as flaps, rud-
      ders, spoilers and stabilizers as well as responsive feedback to the operator after the
      command is executed.

  · In-flight communication, always wirelessly between the ground stations via line of site or
      indirect communication via satellite (Hartman K. &., 2013).

The Datalink - Essential Operations, Functions and Capabilities

278 | Chapter 13: Data Links Functions, Attributes and Latency
The Data-Link is essentially the neurological system for the UAS transmitting data from the
eyes and ears of the operator, which is processed in their mind and then communicated
through the Data-Link to the UAV either directly via line of sight, radio communication from
the ground station, indirectly via satellite or via cloud-based multi-UAV networks. (See Figure
13-2 for example of a remote-controlled attack UAS, MQ-9. Think about the data-links required
for this UAS.)
No matter the category of UAV, the UAS must at a minimum have the capability of the remote
operator having the ability to communicate data commands to the UAV wirelessly and the UAV
in turn, must be able to receive data, process commands and transmit sensor, avionic and per-
formance data which then must be transmitted back to the ground station all of which must be
safely and securely transmitted via wireless radio frequency communication.
When designing, developing and deploying UAS, there are many considerations that are vital
to the successful development and robust deployment for a given application. At its core an
unmanned system is designed to operate remotely in theatre by a pilot located a few feet or, as
in military applications thousands of miles away.
The Data-Link is the pathway by which the UAV communicates with the ground station and
operator as well as how the operator send commands to the UAV to control the its mission,
evaluate changing threat vectors, navigate, respond to terrain and atmospheric condition dur-
ing the mission and respond thereto as well as control intelligence gathering and in military
applications, payload delivery.
The challenges presented to the UAS designer, especially when it comes to the Data-Link is
how to maximize the strength of the Data-Link signal while maintaining the security of the data
transmitted while protecting against possible countermeasures and threats including, but not
limited to Data Jamming ("DJ), Data or Signal Deception and Anti-Radiation Munitions ("ARM")

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 279

All essential functions required of the UAS Data- Link communication system are:
  · A ground station from which the operator can communicate via radio uplink permitting
      the operator to control the UAV, in terms of navigation and payload deployment.
  · A downlink which is used to relay sensor, payload, and avionics data from the UAV back to
      the ground station and to the operator of the UAS.
  · Bi-directional communication regarding distance and azimuth to the UAV to aid in pre-
      cise navigation and targeting accuracy (Fahlstrom, 2012).

In addition, the Data-Link must be designed to seamlessly interface with systems onboard the
UAV through the Air Data Terminal (ADT) and associated antenna arrays needed to receive
radio signals from the Ground Station or satellite relayed signals in UAS that operate in beyond
line of sight UAS designs.

280 | Chapter 13: Data Links Functions, Attributes and Latency
Once received by the ADT the data must then be processed, sometimes compressed, and then
instantly transmitted to the appropriate subsystems onboard the UAV such as navigation, flight
surface, engine operation and targeting. Similarly, the Ground Station must also have the same
abilities to receive downlink data from the UAV directly from the satellite relay. Once the down-
link data is received it to must be processed, possibly compressed or converted, and then for-
warded to the appropriate systems, sensors, displays or databases at the ground station.
No matter the method of transmission of the uplink or by Radio Frequency ("RF") signals of
varying frequencies are usually secured by spread spectrum techniques. (Kakar, 2017). See Fig-
ure 13-3 for a simple Data-Link.

Attributes to consider in the design of the Data Link
"It is important to understand that the concept of data security in terms of the transmission,
processing, storage and interpretation. It is not so much a static process but a fluid one. Given
the speed with which modern technology is developed or hacked, the UAS designer should
view security as a temporary" (Schneier, 2000).

       "If you think technology can solve your security problems, then you don't understand
       the problems and you don't understand the technology." (Schneier, 2000).
It is a certainty that the security of the Data Link will never be a static secure condition, it must
have a robust and reactive architecture that allows it to function in geographically diverse and

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 281
distant theatres globally. What may be an effective Data Link in a Nebraska field may not be in
the mountains of Afghanistan.

The current consensus is that there are seven "must have" attributes of the Data Link for a UAS
(Fahlstrom, 2012).

Globally available secure frequency with sufficient bandwidth and assignability. Absent this
Data Link will be unable to support regular global training, testing and immediate deployment
should the need arise.

  · Resistance to unintentional interference. This attribute is a vital considering a myriad of
      other RF activities or sources may be operating simultaneously in theatre or nearby.

  · Low Probability of detection and interception. The Data Link must be difficult to detect
      to reduce the likelihood of interception. If the Data Link signal is intercepted it becomes
      significantly easier for an adversary to use direction finding technology to locate and dis-
      able or destroy UAS components.

  · Signal Encryption and Security. If an adversary is successful in detecting the Data Link it
      should not be able to locate any component of the UAS. Accordingly, Data Link encryp-
      tion and decryption must be engineered into ground station, satellite and UAV.

  · Anti-Deception Capability. The Data Link must securely transmit, receive and relay legit-
      imate transmissions. Data and commands between the ground station, satellite relay and
      UAV must be capable of differentiating legitimate from counterfeit signals.

  · ARM Resistant Capability. This attribute is especially important to the Ground Station /
      Operator as an Anti-Radiation Missiles ("ARM") pose a significant threat since the Ground
      Station transmissions to the satellite relay and UAV are especially susceptible to this type
      of munition.

  · Anti - Jam Capability. Similarly, to the Anti-Deception and Signal Security attributes the
      Anti-Jam capability requires the Data Link to maintain its functionality and efficacy, espe-
      cially considering the proliferation of new and more effective Jamming technologies
      presently available and in development.

There is a significant amount of crossover between technologies and design elements of one
attribute which may also influence another. We will discuss those "tradeoffs" in the next chap-
ter.

Global Radio Frequency Functionality and Adaptability

What is Radio Frequency? Broadly defined in the context of UAS Data Link development it is
electromagnetic radiation (EMR) being used to transfer energy and information by radio waves.
Most Data Links currently use some form of wireless RF communication. Consult Figure 13-4
EMS. Certain frequencies or bands may not be available in disparate regions of the globe where
conflicting RF frequencies may be in use or may not be available. Failure to account for this

282 | Chapter 13: Data Links Functions, Attributes and Latency
likelihood can result in decreased range, quality or overall efficacy of the Data Link. One of
the simplest and most overlooked design attributes is limiting the use of known conflicting
or unavailable frequencies, thereby enhancing robust peacetime training and actual combat
deployment.

Without designing a UAS with global availability, the likelihood of training and testing blackout
zones increases, thereby compromising rapid global deployment. The best practice is an ample
consideration and allocation of frequencies available to meet known as well as unexpected con-
tingencies. Considering that by some estimates in 2035 commercial UAS usage significantly
exceed military, and governmental UAS deployments (Kakar, 2017).
Table 13-1 demonstrates the airwaves are populated with a wide array of civilian, commercial,
and military Radio Frequency applications. Table 13-2 shows the RF band designations. Con-
sidering future technologies, such as global Wi-Fi, the availability of bandwidth will likely con-
tract, while the risk of unintentional interference expands. Given the crowded low frequency
airwaves, the design trend is towards VHF and even L band Data Links. This may have a positive
effect upon the UAS since using higher frequency bands allows more data to be transmitted
faster (Jain, 2017).

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 283

Resistance to Unintentional Interference
Many of us who are old enough to remember the analog age will remember the heyday of AM
(amplitude modulation) radio broadcasting from the 1950's to mid - 1970's. Although not capa-
ble of providing high quality sound, AM radio was an excellent broadcasting technology for
long distances where terrain and structures may cause line of sight challenges. The downside
of AM broadcasting is that is it subject to significant interference from other electromagnetic
interference such as powerlines, fluorescent lights, environmental conditions and competing
broadcasts. The result can be static, inconsistent signals, or even signal echo on the same fre-
quency.

The availability and allocation of overused civilian frequencies may result in new spectrums
which may be more robust, powerful and secure. Incorporating new communication technolo-
gies into the UAS will help to ameliorate the challenge of Data Link interference from uninten-
tional or environmental sources (Jain, 2017).
Examples of recently implemented tools to mitigate interference include using cellular tech-
nology and power control framework (Yajnanarayana, 2018). Encryption of RF signals may
provide additional interference protection as will new cable, connector and power supply
shielding (Cannon Corporation, 2017). Lastly novel approaches are currently being developed
including a self-interference cancellation solution where the UAS Data Link will self-detect and
correct interference by situationally moving to other RF bands and frequencies (Chen, 2014).
Low Probability of Intercept ("LPI")
LPI is a vital attribute for the Datalink if for no other reason than it is the most likely source of
human casualties. In most instances it is desirable to have the ground station in proximity to
the operator or pilot of the UAV. Distance matters in UAS design since the greater the distance
data must travel, the greater the latency.

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 285
The threat of interception of the RF emissions from the ground station an essential attribute
of the uplink design. Less likely, though still a design concern is in certain instances the down-
link can be targeted for interception. One scenario where interception risk to the downlink
increases is when a UAV is hovering for extended periods of time. Not only will this put the
UAV at risk of attack but also the risk that the downlink communications may be intercepted
increases and consequentially the target of the surveillance may be alerted to its presence,
causing them to camouflage or cease activities.
Electronic Support Measurement (ESM) systems allow adversaries to locate the source of RF
emissions in an area. This technology is especially effective in locating the ground station since
it is usually stationary for extended periods of time. The longer a source emits radiation, the
greater the chance of interception. Since it is not feasible to constantly move the ground sta-
tion increasing LPI can seem to be daunting task. Another relatively simple, yet effective meth-
ods to minimize the risk of intercept is by increasing armaments and location of the ground
station. Shielding vital components and pilots from an attack can help ensure UAS and per-
sonnel survivability in the case of a successful interception attack. Finally, designers should
not be comfortable in the assumption that LPI is inherent higher in a moving UAV. Innovative
technologies capable of detecting and intercepting signal emanations from moving objects are
becoming more effective and readily available.
Effective enhancement of LPI can be accomplished by some of the following tactics and tech-
nologies:

  · Ground Station Handover Method. (GSHM)
  · Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
  · Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).
  · Dynamic power management. (DPM)
  · Directional transmission. (DT)
  · Low duty cycle methods (LDCM) (Okcu, 2016). See Figure 13-5 Overlay.

Signal Encryption and Security
Best practice in all areas of information security is constantly enhancing inaccessibility of the
data and components of a network or system. This seemingly simple concept is no less relevant
when designing a UAS Data Link. The wireless RF Data Link is an enticing target one which if
successfully attacked can disable or damage multiple systems connected to the Data Link. Here
is a list of some recent Data Link hacks upon civilian, commercial and military UAS.

  1. Maldrone, where malware is injected into critical areas of the UAS operation system
      through security flaws in the Datalink.

 2. GPS Spoofing is a hack which essentially can alter or delay UAV commands via GPS and
      accordingly can cause collisions, faulty guidance and theoretically virtual UAV hijacking
      whereby a civilian UAV can be turned into an attack vector against military UAV's even
      though military GPS systems are well protected. This was used by the Iranian military to
      capture a United States military drone in 2011.

 3. Zigbee and Killerbee which are essentially sniffing and penetration tools which when
      successful can cause a major threat to UAS by Denial of Service attacks (Rodday, 2015).

Data encryption is a vital tool to create a secure Data Link. Just as in wired computer networks,
the wireless UAS employs CPU's and operating systems to perform functions involving massive
amounts of data which must be immediately processed and transmitted internally and exter-
nally.
An exciting new protocol is the Commercial Solutions for Classified Program ("CSfC"), devel-
oped United States National Security Agency - Central Security Service. This is a layered

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 287
approach to data security for UAS where two or more commercially available encryption and
cybersecurity protocols provide enhanced Data Links security. The layered approach is ben-
eficial since it reduces development time and expense while leveraging crossover of cyberse-
curity threat similarities across civilian, commercial or military applications (Keller, 2016). See
Figure 13-6 Harris KGV-72 encryption device for secure messages.
Whatever the protocol or technology Data Link security must not only address the threats
known today but also capable of adjusting to new threats as they are discovered. Constant
evaluation, testing, and even "white hat" hacking is one of the best insurance policies against
attacks. It is far better to discover a vulnerability or security flaw while the UAS is being tested
and used for training as opposed to during an actual operation.

There is no security without physical security. It has been estimated that up to 95% of all secu-

288 | Chapter 13: Data Links Functions, Attributes and Latency
rity incidents in 2014 were the result of human error (Howarth, 2014). The best Data Link secu-
rity requires constant technological examination as well as robust physical security. Physical
security and access controls must be implemented and enforced for all who operate, meet,
provide third party support or services to the UAS design and operations team.
Resistance to Deception
A closely related, yet separate attribute of Data Link design is avoidance of deception by an
adversary. Spoofing an apparently authentic command or GPS direction data can cause a UAV
to become uncontrollable or even crash. Deception resistance is currently a focal concern with
respect to the data uplink between the ground station and UAV. Just one deceptive command
can cause a UAV to crash, be captured, hijacked or even attack a friendly target.
Not only can deception cause these types of undesirable consequences, a successful effort can
also jeopardize a wide array of secrets and information. Although it remains unclear whether
jamming or deception was used, it is believed that Iran has re-engineered a US built RQ-170
Sentinel Drone which was captured by some form of deception or jamming in December,
2011(Opall-Rome, 2018). See Figure 13-7 Enemy Captured RQ-170.
Currently there are multiple methods to achieve an acceptable level of resistance to this form
of attack. Many methods that help protect the Data Link from other security threats will also
provide protection against deception attacks. Those include, Spread Spectrum Data Link trans-
missions using secure authentication codes. These codes can be a software embed in the
ground station transmission to the satellite relay or UAV. Both the UAV and ground station will
have encoding and decoding software to authenticate commands without direct modification
to the uplink. (Fahlstrom, 2012) If a satellite relay is implemented in the UAS it can also have
authentication software thereby establishing end-to-end data security. Anecdotally, AJ and LPI
can also be enhanced by encoding Data Link transmissions.

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 289

One particularly promising GPS spoofing detection systems was hypothesized by a team at
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. This spoofing detection system essentially "spoofs' the
Spoofer. Below is a figure of the proposed system architecture for this yet potential anti-
deception system.
As depicted above, three Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites whose signals
would be tracked in the non-spoofed case: satellites j-1, j, and j+1. It also shows the potential
location of a Spoofer that could send false versions of the signals from these same satellites.
The Spoofer has a single transmission antenna. Satellites j-1, j, and j+1 are visible to the receiver
antenna, but the Spoofer could "hijack" the receiver's tracking loops for these signals so that
only the false spoofed versions of these signals would be tracked by the receiver" (Psiaki, 2013).
See Figure 13-8 Spoofing the Spoofer.

This and other recent technologies which can aid in securing the UAS Data Links of civilian,
commercial and military UAS applications is an important reminder of the fluidity of the disci-
pline. As the ancient Chinese Philosopher Sun Tzu wrote of 2500 years ago in "The Art of War",

       "The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent."
       Words matter when it comes to avoiding detection, but perhaps more importantly
       understand that the unexpected should always be expected when (Giles, 2013)
When it comes the securing a UAS Datalink designers would be wise to live by these it comes
to technological warfare and cyber -attacks against military technology.
Anti-ARM
Anti-Radar Missile (ARM's) sense and target sources of RF signals radiation to provide an attack
vector to destroy the emission source. Since a UAS Data Link, especially the uplink, emits RF
radiation from the ground station transmission antenna, it is susceptible to being attacked by
ARM weaponry.
ARM threat only exists when RF radiation is emitted. Limiting RF transmissions to instances
when commands are being sent is a simple yet effective Anti-ARM defense. In addition, various

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 291
decoy technologies exist to reduce the ARM threat as well as placing the transmission antenna
farther away from the Ground Station to minimize ARM damage. Finally, various signal spec-
trum spreading techniques, not to mention physical armor for the Ground Station itself will all
increase the Anti- ARM characteristics of the UAS Datalink. (Fahlstrom, 2012)
Other proposed Anti - ARM capabilities involve hardening the Ground Station and particularly
the antenna array. On such proposal is to quickly identify and then react to the signature of an
incoming ARM and rapidly recoil a more heavily armored antenna before an ARM which suc-
cessfully penetrates other Anti-Arm defenses. This proposal is an important example of physi-
cal security, even the age of technology can still be an excellent defense. When one considers
the millions of dollars involved in design, development and deployment of UAS, it makes sense
to harden its battlefield armor. It most certainly better to be able to have a UAS survive an
ARM attack and be re-deployed to re-engage the enemy. (Czeszejko, 2013) See Figure 13-9 ARM
Processes.

Anti-Jam (AJ) Capabilities
If one considers ARM threats an attack vector based upon the source of the Data Link commu-
nications, then jamming can be considered UAS countermeasure designed to address signals
containing commands that are transmitted by the ground station. Jamming is a countermea-
sure used to inhibit the ability of a UAV to successfully communicate with its operator by
directing powerful electromagnetic radiation ("noise") at the Data Link in order to "drown
out" communications and data transfer. Similarly, global navigation satellite system jamming
can impede the pilot's ability to fly the UAV increasing risk of a catastrophic failure or crash
(Droneshield , 2017).
Jamming the GNSS data flow between the UAV and pilot takes away the eyes and ears of the
UAS. Without the ability to guide itself or be flown by a pilot using GNSS data, exponentially
increase the risk of crash, mission failure, loss of life and investment.

       tronics and Telecommunications, 59(3), 285-291.

Jamming is an attack similar in nature to a brute force attack upon a network. Instead of using
technology to randomly generate massive amounts of passwords or passphrases, jamming is
intended to overwhelm the Data Link with RF noise or static (remember the AM radio example).
Recent history demonstrates the efficacy of successful jamming. During the Russian incursion
into Crimea and Ukraine separatist conflict in 2014 Russian jamming effectively kept the eyes
and ears of the world from observing their activities (Hudson, 2016).
Increasing the AJ of a UAS can be achieves in multiple ways. First necessary to determine the

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 293
amount of jamming radiation (noise) the Data Link can withstand before its ability to function
falls below minimal acceptable levels. This is referred to as the AJ margin and is usually mea-
sured in decibels (dB) (Fahlstrom, 2012).
One technique for increasing the AJ margin U is implementing Spread Spectrum Communica-
tion.
"Spread spectrum is a means of transmission in which the signal occupies a bandwidth in
excess of the minimum necessary to send the information; the band spread is accomplished by
means of a code which is independent of the data, and a synchronized reception with the code
at the receiver is used for dispreading and subsequent data recovery." (Pickholtz, 1982)
Other techniques to increase AJ Margin include:

  · Adaptive Filtering (AF)
  · Time - Frequency Domain Filtering (FDF)
  · Adaptive Antennas (AA) (Iqbal, 1991).

One technique, Bilinear Signal Representations ("BSR"), also seems to hold great promise.
Essentially BSR identifies jamming signals, separates them and then re-synthesizes legitimate
Datalink signals (Kandangath, 2003) (Collins, 2013). See Figure 13-10 and Figure 13-11 for BSR
Representations.
It is also important to remember that jamming is solely a concern in relation to the uplink, in
fact preprogrammed flight instruction can still allow a successful mission when jamming suc-
cessfully drowns out signal from the Ground Station to the UAV. However, if the downlink is
jammed the ability for the operator to receive real time data can be diminished or disrupted
thereby eliminating the flexibility for the controller to make on-the-fly adjustments or changes
to the mission (Fahlstrom, 2012)

Additional Considerations
Digital vs Analog
Analog signals are a method of data transmission data which vary with time, they are inherently
low-latency because they travel at the speed of light (Reid, 2017). The evolution of wireless
Data Links favors digital modulation. This makes sense since most data processing activity
throughout the UAS requires digital data or analog data converted to digital. Higher interfer-
ence margin, ease of interfacing between components and systems support conclusion that to
the extent practical, Data Link communication should favor digital data transmission(United
States Marine Corps, 2015) (Fahlstrom, 2012).
One caveat to the favored use of digital data transmission. Digital transmission handles far
more data much faster than analog. If successfully intercepted and decrypted an adversary can
extract massive amounts of data, intelligence, intellectual property and even top-secret infor-

296 | Chapter 13: Data Links Functions, Attributes and Latency
mation. An example of such a threat occurred in 2017 when the United States Army banned the
use of DJI drones, a Chinese manufacturer. (Mortimer, 2017) See Figure 13-12 US Army Warning
Letter.
System Interface Considerations
Maximizing the efficacy of the Data Link requires that transmission be secure and resilient
while capable of swiftly delivering accurate data. The Data Link payload must be capable of
interfacing and supporting four types of critical UAS functions:

  · Aircraft Control, everything but payloads and weapons
  · Payload, product and control
  · Weapons, kinetic and electronic
  · Situational Awareness (United States Department of Defense, 2005).

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 297

Data Link delivery of secure, high-speed data allows electronic systems to interface seamlessly
with mechanical system must also be capable of concurrent self-monitoring and agile reaction
to attacks. This attribute allows accurate communication between the ADT, ground station and
entire UAS network (Fahlstrom, 2012).

298 | Chapter 13: Data Links Functions, Attributes and Latency
Lastly a cautionary note. Meeting data requirements may negatively impact AJ margin and
deception resistance which can be far more difficult and expensive to remedy after the original
design process (Saeedipour, 2005). Simply because UAS design deals largely with the cyber
realm, should not be taken as license to ignore brick and mortar reality. Specifically, Newton's
Third Law, "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction" takes on new significance
when considering which Data Link attribute should be emphasized and which may be subject
to trade-off (Sunil, 2008).
Data-Rate
Data rate is a vital since the pilot sends commands through the uplink to the UAV the result
of the command execution are confirmed by onboard sensors, video or other indicators to
confirm execution. If the data rate of the downlink is not sufficiently robust latency comes
into play. In NLOS configurations, the execution data is sent by the ADT to a satellite and
then relayed via downlink to reach the operators eyes. Inadequate data rate can cause many
unwanted consequences from duplicate commands, expired intelligence, total failure of the
mission or loss of the UAV.
The data lifecycle of a UAS underscores the imperative of data rates capable of handling vast
amounts of data during a UAV mission. As the figure below depicts just a UAS functions demon-
strate the importance of rapid data transmission, as well as high speed onboard and ground-
based data processing. See Figure 13-12 Data Lifecycle of UAS.

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 299

It is important to note the figure above only depicts the en route portion of a mission. In actu-
ality the bi-directional data flow commences with pre-flight communication and instruction,
continues through departure, en route, arrival and post-flight. Coupled with payload, han-
dover, contingency, time stamping and emergency contingency planning to the data flow to
these phases it becomes readily apparent that data rate is a seminal issue in the UAS design
process. (International Telecommunication Union, 2009)
Finally the exponential growth of UAV's in service globally, consideration of the finite supply
of bandwidth and how to best account for the available bandwidth will most certainly involve
attribute trade-offs. Difficult choices will need to be made regarding bandwidth availability
as it relates to specific missions, geography and available wireless technology. Accordingly,
instead of designing regional as opposed to globally adaptable UAS, best practice as well sound
budgetary policy dictates that interchangeability and interoperability be prioritized.
Closed Loop Control
Certain aspects of UAS design can benefit from employ using loop control between a UAV and
the same or another location. While it is possible to pre-program the UAV recovery process,

300 | Chapter 13: Data Links Functions, Attributes and Latency
human intervention in this phase of the mission will ensure an agility in adapting to changing
physical, environmental or threat conditions in the landing zone.
Given the highly variable conditions in the landing and retrieval zone, it is often the case that a
separate closed loop Data Link, between the UAV and pilot can enhance safely and effectively
retrieving the UAV. Closed loop Data Links require a additional reception and processing capa-
bility onboard both the UAV and ground station.
The threats to closed loop control systems are no different than in the main Data Link. Latency,
restricted bandwidth, AJ, deception, and line of sight are important considerations. Although
discussed latency later in the chapter when it comes to closed loop control, especially video
transmission of approach and recovery, the margin of error becomes smaller with declining
altitude, limited runway length, environmental and physical conditions in the landing zone.

Imagine operating a video game or flight simulator on a desktop or gaming console and the
visual representation presented on the screen was actually delayed by 2 seconds (ie. Aircraft
appears to be 1 mile away from target when it is actually .6 miles away from the target). A
command to reduce power and altitude on a one mile glidepath subject to a 2 second delay
becomes far more challenging. Suffice it to say the game would not last very long, nor would it
be very successful. See Figure 13-14 Flight Simulation Game.

Interchangability, Interoperability and Standarization

At first glance it appears Interchangeability and Interoperability ( I & I) are the same thing. In
reality they are distinct concepts which require separate analysis and consideration of the UAS
design process (Yu, 2016).

Some, such as Fahlstrom consider I & I separate and distinct attributes, writing "interoperabil-
ity would mean that an ADT from one data link could communicate with a Ground Data Ter-
minal ("GDT") of another and vice versa." (Fahlstrom, 2012) p. 201-202. While others such as Yu,
seem to blend I & I into one concept citing the 1999 Joint Chiefs of Staff definition is, "The
ability of systems, units or forces to provide services from other systems, units or forces and
use the services so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together." (United States
Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2016) (Yu, 2016).

Finally, standardization must be considered from the moment of initial design of the UAS. If
the system is to have a sufficient service life thereby justifying the expense of its development,
standardization with the myrad of other systems is essential.

Standardization is a set of "requirements, specifications, guidelines, or characteristics that can
be used consistently to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their
purpose." (Standardization, 2017) In 1998 NATO began to consider methods by which technol-
ogy can be built with uniform standards and interoperability. As unmanned warfare accelerated
towards the end of the last century, NATO began to develop protocols to enhance and ensure
standardization between member nations and their technology.

STANAG 4856 - Standard Interfaces of UAV Control System (UCS) for NATO UAV interoper-
ability was created in order to maximize communication between, "different UAV's and their
payloads, as well as different Command, Control, Communication, Computers and Intelligence
systems. The integration of components from different sources as well as the interoperability
of legacy systems." (Marques, 2017) Designers must not just consider the reality that interop-
erability between allied UAV's, they must also consider the challenge of maximizing interoper-
ability with other assets. Figure 13-15 JTIDS view below demonstrates just some of the myriad
of systems which must to be able to operate and communicate, in real time, as seamlessly as
possible.

The challenge to designing Interoperability and Standardization (I&S) in UAS design is multifold
with the battlefield attributes of central command, communication and coordination taking
center stage. The ability of allies to communicate is vital for cohesive, coordinated and effective
operations.
Recognizing the importance of I&S, the Department of Defense is developing a Joint Architec-
ture for Unmanned Systems, ("JAUS"), National Information Exchange Model ("NIEM") and most
recently Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE). The objective of FACE is to develop a
"Technical Standard for a software capability designed to promote portability, and create soft-
ware product lines across the military aviation community." (Blais, 2016).
Datalink Latency
The Current Environment
Latency is defined as the interval between the time when data is processed and a signal is
transmitted and when the signal is received and then processed in order to be displayed and

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 303
interpreted by the operator. To help understand latency ask yourself why do we see lightning
before we hear thunder? See Figure 13-16 Lightning Strike and Latency.
Light is an electromagnetic wave which needs no through which to travel. It moves at
300,000,000 meters per second, so a lighting strike in your general vicinity is seen by the
naked eye almost immediately. On the other hand thunder is sound, a mechanical wave which
needs to travel through a medium, in this case air molecules. Sound travel through air at a
speed of 340 meters per second which is approximately one million times slower than the
speed of light. Hence lightning will be seen before thunder is heard due the latency of the
transmission of sound as opposed to light (Park, 1997).

Returning to the UAS datalink, line of sight visual transmission and reception is ordinarily
nearly instantaneous because of the speed of light. Unfortunately line of sight, environment
and distance significantly limit UAV operational radius. Even LOS operation of a UAV can be
hindered by weather, vegetation, time of day and topography. Air and ground traffic density

304 | Chapter 13: Data Links Functions, Attributes and Latency
become more problematic with greater latency (International Telecommunication Union,
2009).

According to some estimates domestic airspace must be able to accommodate up to 10 million
combined air vehicles a day by 2035. When you consider that in 2015 that in US airspace was
traversed 50,000 times per day such an exponential increase will be problematic (Atkinson,
2015).

Flight Control Technology

Presently there are 3 classes LOS UAV operation:

  · Low Endurance
  · Medium Endurance; and
  · High Endurance (Valavanis, 2013).

Low Endurance:

Operate almost exclusively in line of sight with a minimum of automated onboard flight control
technology. Usually LOS UAS employ C Band frequency with low frequency of between 3.7-4.2
GHz for the downlink and 5.9-6.4 for the uplink. One of the main reasons for C Band datalinks
in Low Endurance UAS is that low frequency signals are less susceptible to weather related
degradation.

Medium Endurance

Operate in primarily in LOS applications however some do have Beyond Line of Sight ("BLOS")
capability. To the extent they are operating in LOS missions lower frequency C Band is used,
if the Medium Endurance UAS is deployed BLOS then they usually will usually be operating on
Ultra High Frequency ("UHF") (300 MHz) to Ku Band (15 GHz). The downlink is between 11.7 -
12.7 GHz and the uplink between 14-14.5 GHz.

High Endurance

High Endurance UAS deployed BLOS operate on Ultra High Frequency ("UHF") (300 MHz) to
Ku Band (15 GHz). Downlink frequency is between 11.7 - 12.7 GHz and uplink between 14-14.5
GHz. High Endurance UAS may also employ Common Data Link ("CDL") technology on either
I-band satellite communication ("SATCOM") or KU band between 14.5 and 15.38 GHz. To mini-
mize SATCOM latency autopilot is often favored in LOS RF operations (Valavanis, 2013).

The trade-off between security and latency is a difficult balance to achieve. US Air Force Major
General James Poss. (Ret.) put it best.

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 305
"Even the Air Force struggles with this problem because the more secure they make their links,
the more control latency and potential for link loss they introduce. At least with today's tech-
nology. Air Force Predator pilots routinely deal with a five to eight second delay on their con-
trols when flying BLOS due to encryption overhead and the time it takes to relay commands
via satellites" (Poss, 2017). Consult Figure 13-17 Security - Latency Trade-off.
While there are options to minimize latency while balancing the attributes needed for a robust
and effective UAS Data Link, latency is a constant in any transmission travelling any distance.
The greater the distance, the more time to travel. The greater the data payload the more time
to transmit.
Innovative technologies designed to address latency in UAS Data Links are presently being
studied. One that may hold much promise is the introduction and continued development Arti-
ficial Intelligence in UAS design. To be sure the less data that needs to be sent to the UAV on
the uplink or back to the ground station on the downlink, the less latency in executing com-
mands and near-real time UAV control. (Bennis, 2018) AI holds much promise but must also be
considered a risk. Just as a UAV pilot could become incapacitated or go rogue, the same risks
exist with AI implementation in UAS.

Discussion Questions
  1. Since so many attributes of a UAS have distinct levels of importance depending on envi-

306 | Chapter 13: Data Links Functions, Attributes and Latency
      ronment, mission and payload, how can the designer create a system that is agile, and
      globally deployable, thereby increasing service life and efficacy while still being sensitive
      to the cost of development?
 2. How would you rate each of the attributes discussed in this chapter and are there other
      attributes you think need consideration?
 3. If UAS countermeasures continue to evolve, what is the best method of ensuring that cur-
      rent attributes and functions remain effective?
 4. Bearing question 3 in mind, at what point does cost of development exceed the value ser-
      vice life of a UAS? How would such an analysis be made and what factors would you con-
      sider relevant?

via Electronic Warfare (EW) and

Countering with Low Probability

Intercept Signals (LPI)

Student Learning Objectives

In previous chapters, we have studied the EMS, Data-links and cyber-vulnerabilities of UAS.
This chapter introduces electronic warfare as a method of overwhelming, destroying, or con-
trolling the information, transmitted by communication data-links, to alter the mission of the
UAS deployment.

Modern Communication Threats to UAS

Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are in widespread use for reconnaissance, EW, and weapons
delivery. They are extremely dependent on interconnection with ground stations by com-
mand and data links. (Adamy D. , 2001) The increased use of Low Probability Intercept (LPI)
[Introduced in Chapter 13 Data - Links Functions, Attributes, and Latency] has become a sig-
nificant challenge to electronic warfare (EW) communication links. (Adamy D., 2001) This
chapter explores LPI and Jamming, after a circuitous route through Intelligence / Information
Operations (IO), followed by EW. The student should then have enough background to under-
stand the criticality of LPI and Jamming of UAS communication links. Air defense missiles and
associated radars make significant use of interconnecting links. (Adamy D. , 2001) SUAS some-
times use cellphones to command and control the UAVs. Cell phones are widely used for com-
mand and control function in nonsymmetrical warfare situations. (Adamy D. , 2001) ISIS and
other terrorist groups use cell phones to trigger improvised explosive devices.

Cybersecurity attacks on data communications links are highly classified. Similarly, modern
radar threats to hostile installations are also generally classified. So, in this chapter, description
of EW techniques is generalized; no classified information. This way if the student must apply
EW in real-world situations, they can plug in the parameters learned from classified sources.
Before examining LPI and communications signals/link- jamming, we first review the EW envi-
ronment specific to UAS.

  Nichols (2000) defines Cybersecurity in terms of cyber-conflict. (Nichols, 2008) Alford (2000)
  authored effective definitions for the DoD. These will illustrate the bigger picture of Informa-
  tion Operations (IO) and the subset known as Electronic Warfare (EW).

  Cybersecurity (in the context of Cyber conflict) is defined as, "the broad tree of investigation
  and practice devoted to cybercrimes, Computer Forensics (CF), Information Assurance (IA),
  Information Security (INFOSEC), Communications Security (COMSEC), and especially Cyber
  Counter Intelligence (CCI)." (Nichols, 2008)1

  "Cyber Warfare (CW / CyW). Any act intended to compel an opponent to fulfill our national
  will, executed against the software controlling processes within an opponent's system. CyW
  includes the following modes of cyber-attack; cyber infiltration, cyber manipulation, Cyber
  assault, and cyber raid." (DAU, 2018) (DAU, 2018)

  "Cyber Infiltration (CI / CyI). Penetration of the defenses of a software-controlled system
  such that the system can be compromised, disabled, manipulated, assaulted, or raided." (DAU,
  2018) (DoD, 2018)

  "Cyber Manipulation (CM / CyM). Following infiltration, the control of a system via its soft-
  ware which leaves the system intact, then uses the capabilities of the system to do damage.

  For example, using an electric utility's software to turn off power." (DAU, 2018) (DoD, 2018)

  "Cyber Assault (CA / CyA). Following infiltration, the destruction of software and data in the
  system, or attack that compromises system capabilities." (Alford, 2000) Includes viruses and
  system overloads via e-mail (e-mail overflow)." (DoD, 2018; DoD, 2018)

  "Cyber Raid (CR / CyR). Following infiltration, the manipulation or acquisition of data within

1. Intelligence involves computer-based sensitive information, or information operations for three distinct
  sciences operating in the cyber realm: Cyber Counter Sabotage (CCS), Cyber Counter Terrorism (CCT),
  and Cyber Counter Espionage (CCE). In the UAS - Cybersecurity Certificate offered at KSU, Cybersecurity
  focuses on the prior three investigation areas. Additional concerns are 1) protection of UAS/ UAV/ Drones
  from cyber-attacks by negligent and hostile means and 2) teaching cybersecurity risk assessment princi-
  ples to practitioners involved with UAS operations on land, sea, air, or satellite platforms. The impact of
  Loss of Signal (LOS) or intentional interference in UAS communications or navigation systems cannot be
  overstated. At the lowest end of the scale is the risk of a downed vehicle, mid-range risk is collision and
  failure to sense and avoid other vehicles in commercial/military traffic, and at the top of the risk scale is
  the hostile takeover of a payload to be used against the U.S. or U.S. interests. It is not "good enough" to
  operate, fly or support UASs; professionals must also be concerned with protection of their charges.

"Network Centric Operations (NCO). NCO involves the development and employment of mis-
sion critical packages that are the embodiment of the tenets of Network Centric Warfare
(NCW) in operations across the full mission spectrum. These tenets state that a robustly net-

of information, the quality of awareness, and improves shared situational awareness. This
results in enhanced collaboration and enables self-synchronization improving sustainability
and increasing speed of command, which ultimately result in dramatically increased mission

tary operations and other activities to:

  1. Identify those operations that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems,
 2. Determine what indicators adversary intelligence systems might obtain that could be

      interpreted or pieced together to derive critical information in time to be useful to adver-

initions fit into the puzzle? Note that EW is a key component of IO, but not the singular domi-
nant puzzle piece. EW "boxes" will be discussed under the EW section below.

Figure 14-2 shows the DoDs JOPES (Joint Operation Planning and Execution System) plan for
2025. In this plan, Information Operations (IO) are integrated across the military commands
and equipment / knowledge / software is supplied by both the military and commercial busi-
nesses. (DoD-02, 2018)

Figure 14-3 is a look at the DoD Vision of the future of the Internet where IO and IW are gamed
into a fully integrated global network system. (Merrick, 2016) All three figures above show how
information operations encompasses all the information collection and action activities of the
intelligence, defense, military, computer technology, and civilian organizations for common
missions of cybersecurity and information superiority. What is not so obvious is that UAS sys-
tems are an integral part of IO planning and actions. Further, global investment in the UAS
market are growing exponentially and the leader in development is China, not the USA. Much
of China's investment billions are for PLAN which is hostile to USA interests. In Chapters 15 and
16, we address China's "Grand Strategy" in Africa (a UAS testing ground for several powers) and
the Spratly Islands (Intelligence center in the South China Seas).

Electronic Warfare (EW) Purview
Adamy sets the standards for EW instruction. Moir summarizes the topic with respect to mil-
itary operations, UAS, and military avionics systems. (Moir, 2006) (Toomay, 1982) and (Burch,
2015) bring Radar to the non-specialist reader. A Google search on the key = RADAR yields
296,000,000 results (0.49 seconds). There is substantial material on the subject. The challenge
is determining the UAS applicability.
Warfare is conducted by adversaries who go to great pains to understand their enemy's inten-
tions, strengths, weaknesses, and to minimize the threats to their own forces and territory.
The detection and interception of messages/data, combined with ground observations, pro-
vide an ability to observe troop movements and facilitate counter-actions by opposing forces.
As communication developed (satellite, MW, IR, Cell, Radars) so did the methods of intercep-

  tion. Radar started as a simple detection mechanism and grew into a means of surveillance and
  guidance. (Moir, 2006)

  Communication Links for UAS are critical and must be secured

  Modern warfare is conducted in a rich electromagnetic environment with radio communications
  and radar signals from many sources. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) / UAV / UUV / Drones
  are an integral part of modern warfare. UAS communications networks and links to ground sta-
  tions are critical to the successful military use of UAS. Securing UAS links from EW attacks is a
  fundamental concern to military planners and civilian authorities. The USMC takes UAS contri-
  butions to its Close Air Support (CAS) military planning. Figure 14-4 shows USMC PCAS Vision;
  precise, digital, portable air-ground strike coordination.2 This scenario is part of the USMC
  Guardian Angel program.3 In September 2016, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, stated
  the importance of UAS in the USMC battle plans of the future:

          "Marine Corps must: develop layers of persistent, armed, multi-spectral, and beyond-
          line-of-sight (BLOS) UAS above our units to produce responsive intelligence and tar-
          geting information, extend our command and control (C2) across a shifting battlespace,
          and deliver non-kinetic and kinetic fires in support of MAGTF operations."4

  UAS BLOS communications require stable communications. Disrupting these communications
  links is a goal of hostile forces.

2. Several definitions are necessary to discover the power of Figure 14-4. PCAS = Persistent close air sup-
   port; CAS = Common situational awareness; FRAGO = Fragmentary Order - to send timely changes of
   existing orders to a subordinate; MAGTF = Marine air-ground task force; MEB = Marine expeditionary
   brigade (14,500 marines and sailors); MALE-T =Medium altitude long endurance - tactical UAS; UUNs /
   DUNSs = Urgent / deliberate universal needs statements; HUD = Heads-up display; JTAC = Joint Terminal
   Attack Controller; JFO =Joint fires observer; JDAM = Joint direct attack munitions; Maverick Missile = The
   AGM-65 Maverick is an air-to-surface missile (AGM) designed for close air support. It is the most widely
   produced precision-guided missile in the Western world, and is effective against a wide range of tactical
   targets, including armor, air defenses, ships, ground transportation and fuel storage facilities; APKWS =
   Advanced precision kill weapon system and PGM = Precision guided missile.

  In a theater-wide scenario, with combined land, sea, and air forces operating against enemy
  territory, which in turn, are defended with similar forces, we can envision multiple roles for
  UAS. These include military planning, air defenses, air superiority aircraft, defense suppres-
  sion, HVT assassination,5 maritime operations, offensive operations, naval forces, land forces,
  cyber forces, TV reporters, mobile telephone traffic, and sound satellite links. (Moir, 2006) The
  radio frequency spectrum (and EMS) covered by emitters used by the forces is broad as was
  illustrated in Figures 8-1, 8-3, 13-4 and Table 13-1. No single transmitter /receiver can cover
  this range for transmission or reception. Most communications and radar systems are designed
  for use in specific bands, designated by international convention. (Moir, 2006) See Figure 8-8
  Radio frequency bands and Figure 8-9 Radar frequency bands.
  The key role of EW is to search these radio-frequency bands to cull information that can be
  used for intelligence analysis or by front-line operators. (Moir, 2006) The information gath-
  ered may affect a tactical advantage on the battlefield, or in any stage before or after. (Moir,
  2006)
  Intelligence Cycle

In the CIA, intelligence is viewed as a continuous cycle of activities to keep ahead of adversaries
always (peace, transitions, war). Figure 14-7 shows the Intelligence Cycle.

The cycle begins with a user requesting intelligence be gathered on a scenario. The analysts
will develop a set of requirements for the collection stage. Intelligence is then gathered via sur-
veillance platforms; espionage, co-operative exchange, or open source documents. The intel-
ligence is sent to a processing group whereby the data is analyzed, collated, validated, and
securely disseminated to the users or to trusted allies. They are read, evaluated, and acted
on based on the intelligence. Or the user may rethink the needs/parameters of the project,
returning the direction back to a modified intelligence requirements document, which is then
transferred over to the collection group, analysis, reporting, and so forth.

EW Generalities

Time to fill in the EW boxes in 14-1. Electronic warfare (EW) is defined as the art and science
of preserving the use of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) for friendly use while denying its
use by the enemy. (Adamy D., 2001) The EMS is from DC to light and beyond. See Figures 8-1 to
8-4 EMS Spectrum views. EW covers the full radio frequency spectrum, the infrared spectrum,
and the ultraviolet spectrum.

          R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 323
  Legacy EW definitions

  EW was classically divided into: (Adamy D., 2001)

     · ESM - Electromagnetic Support Measures - the receiving part of EW;
     · ECM - Electromagnetic Countermeasures - jamming, chaff, flares used to interfere with

        operations of radars, military communications and heat-seeking weapons;
     · ECCM -Electronic Counter-Counter Measures - measures taken in design or operation of

        radars or communications systems to counter the effects of ECM.6

  Not included in the EW definitions were Anti-radiation Weapons (ARW) and Directed Energy
  Weapons (DEW).

  USA and NATO have updated these categories:

     · ES - Electronic warfare Support (old ESM)
     · EA - Electronic Attack - which is the old ECM but also includes ASW and DE weapons;
     · EP - Electronic Protection - (old ECCM) (Adamy D. , 2001)

  ES is different from Signal Intelligence (SIGINT). SIGINT is made up of Communications Intel-
  ligence (COMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT). All these fields involve the receiving of
  enemy transmissions. (Adamy D. , 2001)

  COMINT receives enemy communications signals to extract intelligence.

  ELINT uses enemy non-communications signals for determining the enemy's EMS signature
  so that countermeasures can be developed. ELINT systems collect substantial data over large
  periods to support detailed analysis.

  ES/ESM collects enemy signals, either communication or non-communication, with the object
  to do something immediately about those signals or the weapons associated with those signals.
  The received signals might be jammed or the information sent to a lethal responder. Received
  signals can be used to type and locate the enemy's transmitter, locate enemy forces, weapons,
  distribution, and electronic capability. (Adamy D. , 2001)

  Adamy (2001) is correct when he suggests that the, "key to understanding EW principles (partic-
  ularly the RF) part is to understand radio propagation theory. Understanding propagation leads
  logically to understanding how they are intercepted, jammed or protected." (Adamy D. , 2001)
  Adamy has written five books and published numerous papers on the subject. The student can

  explore his works or use (Moir, 2006) or (Toomay, 1982) (light reading and dated text to dive
  into RF propagation.) Petti's book on ECCM is simplistic but has legacy views of the EP func-
  tion. (Pettit, 1982) One of the classics that should read is by Lt. Col. USAF Fitts, The Strategy of
  Electromagnetic Conflict (Fitts, 1980) Lastly, a decent text on ELINT beginnings is authored by
  Wiley. (Wiley, 1993)

  Main Contention

  It is the author's contention that UAS communication links are vulnerable and must be evaluated
  to protect US Unmanned Aircraft in the cyber or electronic domain. Further, those links may
  be electronically jammed, cyber-spoofed (especially navigational), or made ineffective with elec-
  tronic or cyber interference.7

  Cyber-spoofing is conjectured in Chapter 16 in the GPS cyber-spoof discussion of the Spratly
  Island complex, Red Drones, and US Capital ships colliding with commercial vessels. The
  remainder of this chapter will focus on the electronic jamming, LPI countermeasures and UAS
  vulnerabilities to electronic interference.

  Communications Jamming

  The purpose of communication is to move information from one location to another. All the
  following types of transmitted signals are communications:

     · "Voice or non-voice communications (video or digital format)";
     · "Command signals to control remotely located assets;"
     · "Data returned from remotely located equipment";
     · "Location and motion of friendly or enemy assets (land, sea, or air);"
     · UAS communications links from it ground station for control of the aircraft;
     · UAS communications links from another aircraft or satellite affecting its flying character-

        istics;
     · UAS communication signals (from any source) that affect the SAA / navigation / payload

        / waypoints;
     · Computer-to-computer communications;
     · Data links;
     · Weapon-firing links;
     · ISR data links;
     · Cell phones. (Adamy D., 2009)

7. This a main theme of this book. In addition, this chapter started off with the answer - Low Probability of
  Intercept (LPI) as a countermeasure to reduce risk of EA to the UAS mission.

                                                                                   R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 325
"The purpose of communications jamming is to prevent the transfer of information. Commu-
nications jamming requirements depend on the signal modulation (strength), the geometry of
the link, and the transmitted power." (Adamy D., 2009) Another way to think of jamming is a
method to "interfere with the enemy's use of the electromagnetic spectrum. Use of EMS involves
the transmission of information from one point to another". (Adamy D., 2009)

"The basic technique of jamming is to add an interfering signal," along with the desired signal,
into an enemy's receiver. "Jamming becomes effective when the interfering signal is strong
enough to overwhelm the desired signal." This prevents the enemy from recovering the infor-
mation from the desired signal. (Adamy D., 2009) There are two possible methods for a suc-
cessful jam: either the jamming signal is stronger than the desired "signal or the combined
signals received have characteristics that prevented the processor from properly extracting the
desired information." (Adamy D., 2009) A simple case of jamming unintentionally is when your
AM news station (listening in the car) becomes overwhelmed by junk music. You can hear the
beginning of the interference as noise, then the junk signal is strong, then as the car moves out
of the area, the AM news station regains its status. (Adamy D., 2009)

The cardinal rule of jamming is that you jam the receiver, NOT the transmitter. (Adamy D., 2001)

Figure 14-8 shows the communication jamming geometry. (Adamy D., 2009)

"The primary difference between radar and communication jamming is in the geometry.
Whereas a typical radar has both the transmitter and the associated receiver at the same loca-
tion, a communication link, because its job is to take information from one location to another,
always has its receiver in a different location from that of the transmitter." (Adamy D. L., 2004)

In Figure 14-8, the "communications-jamming geometry has one-way links from the desired
transmitter and the jammer to the receiver." (Adamy D. L., 2004)

                        Figure 14-8 shows the communication jamming geometry

"Communication is often done using transceivers (each including both transmitter and

326 | Chapter 14: Exposing UAS Vulnerabilities via Electronic Warfare (EW) and Countering with Low Probability Intercept Signals (LPI)
receiver), but only the receiver at location B in the figure is jammed. If transceivers are in use
and one desires to jam the link in the other direction, the jamming signal must reach location
A." (Adamy D. L., 2004)
"There are some important communications instances in which transceivers are not used. For
example, in UAV links as shown in Figure 14-9, this figure shows the data link (or "downlink")
being jammed. Again, the receiver is the objective to be jammed." (Adamy D., 2009)

"Figure 14-9 shows that a jammer operating against a UAV data-link must target the receiver at
the ground station.
Another difference of radar jamming is that the radar signal makes a round trip to the target,
so the received signal power is below the transmitted power by the fourth power of the dis-
tance (often stated as 40 log range). Since the jammer power is transmitted one way, it is only
reduced by the square of distance." (Adamy D. L., 2004)
Table 14-1 shows the Types of Jamming. (Adamy D., 2001)

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 327
Type of Jamming           Purpose
Communications jamming    "Interferes with enemy ability to
Radar jamming             pass information over a
Cpver jamming             communication link"
Deceptive jamming         "Causes radar to fail to acquire its

Decoy                     to output false information"
                          "Reduces the quality of the
                          desired signal so that it cannot be
                          properly processed, or the info is
                          lost / unrecoverable"
                          "Causes radar to improperly
                          process its return signal to
                          indicate the correct range or
                          angle to target"
                          "Looks like the target more than
                          the actual target; causes a guided
                          weapon to attack the decoy
                          rather than intended target."

To be effective, the jammer must get its signal into the enemy's receiver - through the asso-
ciated antenna, input filters, and processing gates. This depends on the signal strength the
jammer transmits in the direction of the receiver and the distance and propagation conditions
between the jammer and the receiver. (Adamy D., 2009)

Jammer-to-Signal Ratio

The real test of jammer effectiveness is the effectiveness with which information flow is
stopped. "A jammer interferes with communication by injecting an undesired signal into the
target, receiver along with any desired signals that are being received." (Adamy D. , 2009) "The
obstructing signal must be strong enough that the receiver cannot recover the required infor-
mation from the desired signals." The ratio of the jamming signal to the desired signal is known

328 | Chapter 14: Exposing UAS Vulnerabilities via Electronic Warfare (EW) and Countering with Low Probability Intercept Signals (LPI)
  as the jamming-to-signal ratio (J/S), stated in dB.8 Effective J/S depends on the transmitted
  modulation, but the Adamy formula works in general. (Adamy D., 2001)

  Refer to Figure 14-9 UAV Link Jamming Geometry. The jammer-to-receiving link and the
  desired transmitter-to-receiver UAV link in Figure 14-9 can employ any propagation model.
  (Adamy D., 2009)

  "The formula for communication J/S is:

                                                                Eq. 14-1

                                        J / S = ERPJ - ERPS - LJ + LS + G RJ - G R

  Where: J/S = the ratio of the jammer power to the desired signal power at the input to the
  receiver being jammed in dB

  ERPJ the effective radiated power of the jammer in dBm
  ERPS the effective radiated power of the desired signal transmitter, in dBm
  LJ the propagation loss from jammer to receiver, in dBi9
  LS The propagation loss from the desired signal transmitter, in dBm
  GRJ the receiving antenna gain in the direction of the jammer, in dBi
  GR The receiving antenna gain in the direction of the desired signal transmitter, in dBi." (Adamy
  D., 2001)

  Many UAS (especially UAV or sUAS ) have a target receiving antenna with a 360-degree azimuth
  coverage. They use whips or monopoles. They are inexpensive. With a 360-degree antenna, the
  communications J/S equation simplifies to:

                                                               Eq. 14-2
                                                J / S = ERPJ - ERPS - LJ + LS

8. Any number expressed in dB is logarithmic base 10. dB mathematical concepts with examples may be
   found in Chapter 2 of Adamy, D., (2001) EW 101. A value expressed in dB is a ratio converted to logarithmic
   form. A linear number is converted to dB form by the formula: N(dB) = 10 log (base 10) [N]. dB values are
   converted back to linear format by the formula N = 10 **N (dB/10). dB numbers are usually reference to
   some standard with constant value. A common example is signal strength expressed in dBm = dB value of
   Power / 1 milliwatt, used to describe signal strength. For example, 4 watts power level = 4000 mw. Divide
   by 1 mw standard then convert 4000 to dB = 10 log (4000) = 36.02 dBm. dB forms are used because of the
   wide range of numbers and orders of magnitude for the EMS.

9. dBi = dB value of antenna gain relative to the gain of an isotropic antenna ( perfect antenna). 0 dBi is the
   gain of an omnidirectional (isotropic) antenna.

                                                                                    R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 329
    The receiving antenna has the same gain toward the jammer and the desired signal transmitter.
    The two gain terms cancel out. (Adamy D., 2009)
    Figure 14-9 shows a simple example where the J /S calculation would indicate a successful jam
    (desired signal fully compromised). (Adamy D., 2001) The terminology is slightly different for
    the power terms (removing the "effective radiated" and using "power total" instead). The prin-
    ciple is still the same. (Adamy D., 2009)
    US Army Field Manual FM 34-40-7 (23 Nov 1992) Communications Jamming Handbook, presents
    three alternative methods for calculating the jamming power required and distance to target.
    For the designer of an anti-UAS Drone gun, which transmits a jammer signal to a UAS to over-
    whelm the desired ground station command signals, one needs the know the power and height
    of the drone. Since the drone is moving the jammer signal must radiate in such a manner that it
    covers a volume of space until target "UAS lock." Recall Figure 7-5 Drone Jammer Model KWT-
    FZQ. Table 14-2 shows the details for this anti-drone gun.10

Quote from manufacturer Globaldroneuav.com: (Adamy D. , 2009)
       "Anti-drone rifle is multiband device which sends a high-power electromagnetic wave
       that is used to interfere with UAV flight and force the remote low-altitude drone to
       drop, fly to home place or to land stably. By triggering the rifle, it disturbs the GPS
       location and breaks the video transmission control link of UAV instantly to achieve the
       effective control of "Unapproved fly." It's a portable gun all-in-one design with robust
       strength and fast use features make its easy start by one triggering after battery assem-
       bly. Multi antennas and multi-bands frequency works simultaneous in the front end
       of gun, which enables the effective control range more than 1000 meters. The tripod
       makes longtime watching much easier, which facilitates it popular in such no-fly zones
       as airport, prison and military areas and so on. What is more, it is very convenient to
       guarantee the activities going safely and orderly in the important security areas and
       urban management sites."

Alternative: A Chinese firm makes an anti-drone gun that costs about $35,000 USD and oper-
ates on 5.8 GHz and 2.4 GHz.12 80% of consumer drones operate on these frequencies. "The
gun tricks the drone into thinking it has lost connection with its controller." "RC signal lost" is
flashed on drone screen - aircraft returning to home point." The drone can be recovered intact.
This gun has an operational limit of about 700 meters (0.43496 miles).

Calculating the minimum of "amount of jammer power output required in watts" for this easy
drone capture would be of interest. (Army, 1992) FM 34-40-7 Appendix gives a slightly different
version of the Adamy equation 14-2:

                             Eq. 14-3
        P j = P t x K x (H t / H j )2 x (D j / D t )N

Where:

"P j = Minimum amount of jammer power output required , in watts
P t = Power output of the enemy drone, in watts
H j = Elevation of the jammer location above sea level, feet
H t = Elevation of enemy transmitter location above sea level, in feet
D j = Jammer location - to-target receiver location distance, in km
D t = Enemy transmitter location -to- target receiver location, in km
K = 2 for jamming frequency modulated receivers (jamming tuner accuracy)

N = Terrain and ground conductivity factors

5 = very rough terrain with poor ground conductivity
4 = Moderately rough terrain with fair to good ground conductivity
3 = Farmland terrain with good ground conductivity
2 = Level terrain with good ground conductivity

F = Frequency in MHz" (Army, 1992)

include the height or length of the antenna above the ground. (Army, 1992) It is the location
deviation above sea level.

Given the following parameters:

"P j = Minimum amount of jammer power output required , in watts = (SOLVE)                good
P t = Power output of the enemy transmitter -to drone, in watts = 5 watts
H j = Elevation of the jammer location above sea level, feet, use 385m =.385 km
H t = Elevation of enemy transmitter location above sea level, in feet use 386m =.386 km
D j = Jammer location - to-target receiver location distance, in km = 700 m = 0.700 km
D t = Enemy transmitter location -to- target receiver location, in km = 372m = 0.372 km
K = 2 for jamming frequency modulated receivers (jamming tuner accuracy) = 2

N = Terrain and ground conductivity factor = Use 4 for moderate terrain with fair to

ground conductivity" (Army, 1992)

F = Frequency in MHz, use 37.5 MHz in the band

Parameters were chosen so that the height ratio would drop-out and the distance would
induce some ground conductivity effects consistent with the FM 34-40-7 examples.

Plugging the numbers and solving for P

                   P j = 5 x 2 x (1)2 x (0.7 / 0.372)4 = 10 x (1.88) 4 = 10 x 12.46 = 125 watts

So, under these hypothetical conditions the jammer gun requires 125 watts (2 60-watt light
bulbs) to take down the drone. Theoretically, if the jammer was using a log periodic array (LPA)
the power could be cut in half to 62.5 watts (1 bulb). Now if this calculation is reasonable, the
buyer is spending $35,000 USD to take down a small irritating drone (invasion of privacy) using
a 60-watt bulb. A double-aught shotgun shell with a 12-gauge Remington and yellow shooter
sunglasses will have the same effect (might even be more satisfying) for 1/100 the cost. The
medium size drones present a more interesting case. More power is needed to lock on to the
higher altitude UAS. The term of interest in the jamming equation from FM 34-40 -7 is the ratio
of the distances to the fourth power (or second power for perfect terrain). That can have a
major impact on jammer output power. (Army, 1992)

Radar Range Equation

Equation 14-3 is not the only place we see a term taken to the 4th power. The famous "Radar
Range Equation is dominated by the R4 factor in the denominator. There is no corresponding
function in the numerator of equation 14-4, with an exponent greater than unity. (Toomay, 1982)
There is no magic bullet to achieve a high-performance system. If low cross section targets are
to be engaged, a combination of high-power, high gain, large aperture, and low-noise needs to
be dictated." (Toomay, 1982)

See Figure 14-13 Simple Radar Block Diagram for discussion, after a quick history lesson.
Radar is an excellent technology to "see the UAS" coming into defensive space. RADAR is an
acronym for "Radio Detection and Ranging." "Radio waves occupy a small portion of the EMS
from frequencies of a few kHz, a few thousand cycles per second, to a few million MHz, over
1012 cycles per second." (Toomay, 1982) We can thank Heinrich Hertz, who in 1886, conducted
"experiments showing that radio waves reflected, refracted, were polarized, interfered with
each other, and travelled at high velocity". The Maxwell equations were confirmed and the
properties of "reradiation and of known velocity portended the future of radar." (Toomay, 1982)
Radio waves were first used for communications, generate by spark gaps generating short
intense pulses of current to achieve the needed electromagnetic radiation. The real break-
through in radar was by Lee Deforest in 1906. He invented vacuum tubes. Sinusoidal oscillators
came next in evolution. [Yes, transistors and mini-transistors came down the line for another
revolution, but who cares?] All the ingredients were in place (Valid theory, experiments, and
practical transmitters and receivers), but it was Robert Watson Watt in 1930's, who fielded a
radar system in the field. (Toomay, 1982) The English Air Ministry were glad he did so! The
WWII air Battle of Briton was won by using Watson's radar to spot and warn the English fight-
ers as to the German bombers and fighter escorts location, altitude, distribution, and number
of planes in the attack.
The Chain-Mall Radar stations (codename Chain Home) were strategically located all along the
English Coast. See Figure 14-11. Figure 14-12 shows an example of one of these primitive radar
stations. The German High command discounted the radar theory until it was too late in 1943.

"The principles of a primitive radar are formed. Figure 14-13 diagrams its functions. A burst
of electromagnetic energy, oscillating at a predetermined frequency is generated and radiates
into free space from an antenna. A clock is started. The electromagnetic energy propagates
outward at the speed of light, reradiating (scattering) from objects it encounters along its
path. Part of the scattered energy returns to the radar (is received) and can be detected there
because it imitates the frequency and duration of the transmitted pulse." (Toomay, 1982) (Figure

The standard Radar Range Equation (RRE) is:

                             Eq. 14-4
        S / N = (P GTAr ) / [(4)2 R4 KTS LS ]

Where:

S / N = is one pulse received signal to noise ratio, dB
P = Isotropic source of an electromagnetic pulse of peak power, Mw
GT = Gain of the transmit antenna, dB
Ar = Receive antenna effective area, m2
 = Radar Cross Sectional Area, m2
R4 = Energy density received at detected target range, R, nm
K = Boltzmann's constant (Noise component)
TS = Measured noise temperature, Kelvin units above absolute zero
LS = Losses existing in the system (lumped together), dB

Inherent in equation 14-14, is the fact that the range of the radar to a "detected object can be
calculated by: R = ct / 2, where c is the speed of light (3 x 108 m/s) x time , in sec. also,  = c

   / f, where  is the wavelength in Hz, and frequency, f is the cycles/second for the sinusoidal
   oscillator." (Toomay, 1982)
   The point of this diversion into Radar history was that the performance of both the jamming
   equation and the radar range equation are affected by a power of 4th exponent. This affects
   equipment design, cost, effectiveness of detection or capture.
   LPI Communication Signals
   The author gave the answer to the question never asked at the beginning of this chapter.
   The answer was LPI (Low Probability of Intercept) communications presented challenges to EW
   communication links. (Adamy D. -0., 2015) "They are extremely dependent on interconnection
   with ground stations by command and data links" And the question was how does the US pro-
   tect its UAS/UAVs/drones from hostile take-over, considering the vulnerabilities of commu-
   nication links from ground to UAS platform? Signals associated with LPI communications have
   unique modulations13 designed to seriously perturb detection possibilities for the normal types
   of receivers. (Adamy D. -0., 2015) If designed correctly, a hostile receiver will not even detect
   the presence of the signal.
   This is accomplished by spreading the frequency range over which the LPI signal is broadcast.
   (Adamy D. -0., 2015)14 (Figure 14-15)

13. Signal Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the car-
    rier signal, with a modulating signal that typically contains information to be transmitted

14. These signals are call spread spectrum signals because of the frequency is spread over a larger range, so
    the signal PSD is reduced (Figure 14-15).

                                                                                      R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 341

   Figure 14-15 shows the effect of a second modulation applied to the narrowband waveform to
   spread its frequency over a larger part of the spectrum and reduce the power spectral density
   to less than random noise. (Adamy D. -0., 2015)
   Four types of spreading modulations are used: (Adamy D. -0., 2015)15

      · Frequency Hopping: The transmitter periodically hops to a pseudo-randomly selected fre-
         quency. The range is much greater than the bandwidth of the signal carrying the informa-
         tion to be communicated. (Adamy D. -0., 2015)

      · Chirp: The transmitter is rapidly tuned across a frequency range that is significantly
         wider than the information bandwidth. (Adamy D. -0., 2015)

      · Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS): The signal is digitized at a rate much higher than
         required to carry the information. This spreads the energy of the signal across a wide
         bandwidth. (Adamy D. -0., 2015)

      · Complex combinations: Experimental models combining two or more spreading modula-
         tions made up of frequency hopping, chirp, and DSSS.

15. Each of the spreading modulations is a book in itself: Frequency hopping - About 8,080,000 results (0.40
    seconds) ; Chirp -About 192,000 results (0.22 seconds) and DSSS - About 1,110,000 results (0.56 seconds).
    Therefore, discussion of LPI is limited.

     342 | Chapter 14: Exposing UAS Vulnerabilities via Electronic Warfare (EW) and Countering with Low Probability Intercept Signals (LPI)
   LPI Restrictions
   There are several restrictions on the effective use of LPI as a counter EW tactic for UAS.
   LPI equipment and software may be cost-ineffective in smaller UAS systems.

      · The spreading modulator in the receiver must be synchronized with the spreading modu-
         lator in the transmitter to reverse the spreading modulation so that the signal can be
         returned to the same bandwidth (information bandwidth) it had before the "secrecy oper-
         ation";

      · The synchronization requires that both the modulator and demodulator use the same
         pseudo-random function based on same digital code sequence;

      · the codes transmitted and received must be in phase; and
      · synchronization may require a delay before the transmission begins.

   Discussion Questions /Assignment
   Chapter 14 concentrated on UAS, EW, and LPI. However, there is a closely related science that
   intersects with EW and that is Cyber. There are distinct parallels and intersections between
   Cyber and EW. For instance, the sister of signal spreading techniques is encryption. See Figure
   14-16 showing the intersection of Cyber, EW, and Spectrum Warfare designated as Cyber Elec-
   tromagnetic Activities (CEA)16 Figure 14-17 puts CEA in the perspective of total war.1718
   Student will research CEA and its parallels to EW (start with FM 3 - 38 Cyber Electromagnetic
   Activities in CANVAS or use Google to find the free PDF) How do these intersections support
   both friendly and hostile actions on UAS systems in all classes? Develop a PowerPoint pre-
   sentation with your answers for class submission. Look for tools like cyber offensive weapons
   against key UAS systems and cyber defensive weapons/countermeasures that can be used to
   thwart the cyber weapons that you have found in Open Source literature (Non- CLASSIFIED).
   Try to develop a taxonomy around your findings.

Chapter 15: Africa - World's First Busiest

Drone Operational Proving Ground

Student Learning Objectives - Africa has become the drone investment -playground of many
nations. The student will be introduced to activities of these geopolitical players (US, France,
EU, Germany, Egypt and China) and the significance of their intentions. The history of drone
investments / operations in Africa is directly a function of the growth of terrorist organizations
and African economy.

Africa - Overview

Africa is a developing continent comprised of unstable states due to undeveloped economy,
poor education, and unified government among the states. Africa's leaders want to see their
country develop and become a world leader. They look to their long-term allies to solve their
issues.

Radical Islam continues to spread and threaten the future of Africa. With the turbulence of
state's government, insurgence groups have joined forces with terrorist organizations affili-
ated with radical Islam. Radical Islamic extremists are a global security threat. Therefore, sev-
eral countries fighting terror at home are also assisting Africa in the fight on terror. A priority
goal of many African leaders is to defeat terrorism. They feel this can be achieved by stopping
terrorist organizations membership growth. Conflict on land is not the only issue facing Africa,
maritime security is a huge factor in Africa's economic growth.

Other countries willingly assist Africa in protecting their waterways to reap the benefits of
trade and profit. There are high stakes for China, European Union, and United States to ensure
Africa's perimeter allows for safe passage of Commercial and Military vessels. Africa's land posi-
tioning and natural resources has made it an attractive global investment. This has given Africa
the fastest growing economy in the world despite the lack of sustained infrastructure.

The ability to be flexible with technology testing and implementation has given Africa an advan-
tage with the development of UAS. Now their infrastructure is being architected and con-
structed by technical companies and countries with an interest in a claiming Africa's resources
as their own. Africa is leading the UAS marketplace with the wiliness to formulate laws to suit the
commercial UAS industry.

Africa - The Facts

According to Theobald Barber, "there are over 3,000 protected areas in Africa, including 198

352 | R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C.
Carter, and J.P. Hood
  Marine Protected Areas, 50 Biosphere Reserves, and 129 UNESCO World Heritage Sites." (Staff-
  A, 2017)

  "Africa has the second largest population in the world, at about one billion people." (Staff-A,
  2017) Nigeria is ranked among the seven most populous countries, with 200 million citizens.1
  The United Nations has published Africa will have more than half of the world's population
  growth by 2050. "Africa is the world's poorest and most underdeveloped continent with a con-
  tinental GDP that accounts for just 2.4% of global GDP. The national flag of Mozambique has
  the image of an AK-47 assault rifle embedded into it. It is one of only two national flags of UN
  member states to feature a firearm. The other is Guatemala." (Staff-A, 2017) Which could be
  an indication of their population's struggle for independence.2 "About 41% of children in Africa
  aged between 5-10 years are actively involved in child labor. It is the hottest continent, with
  water scarcity impacting the lives of over 300 million Africans. (Staff-A, 2017)

  Economics

  Economy is a driver for the continent's decision to be accommodating to the UAS commercial
  community. When it comes to UAS development, Africa is the second most attractive invest-
  ment destination in the world. See Figures 15-3 and 15-4.3

  Africa is one of the most integrated regions in the world, ranking only behind Europe and
  Southeast Asia for economic integration. Africa is moving toward the negotiations for the
  establishment of a Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) which will be the largest free-trade area
  in the world. See Figure 15-1.

  The Spread of Radical Islam Across Africa

  Africa - Al-Qaida and Islamic State

  Starting in after the end of Qaddafi regime, Jihadists have spread from the Horn of Africa to
  Guinea-Bissau. Osama bin Laden in a statement in July 2006 clearly singled out Somalia as an
  important jihadist front of the future. Al-Qaida and Islamic State-linked groups in West Africa
  are now cooperating at the operational level and that there are connections with IS-affiliates
  in the Lake Chad region close to northeastern Nigeria and Maghreb-Sahel region. As a result of
  a three days of attacks in Mali (June 29 - July1, 2018), Islamic militants are in control of the area.

They have closed schools and killed hundreds of civilians. This northeast location is a corner-
stone to launch attacks against nearby countries. See Figure 15-2 Regional Conflicts Trends.

The Spread of Radical Islam Across Africa
Africa - Al-Qaida and Islamic State
Salafi-Jihad Movement
Over the past 16 years the al Qaeda network, has become even stronger across Yemen, the
Horn of Africa, Libya, and West Africa. Recently al Qaeda network recruited several groups
across Middle East and North Africa during the Arab Spring's unrest. Their goal, the destruction
of current Muslim societies using force and creation of what they regard as a true Islamic soci-
ety.

354 | Chapter 15: Africa - World's First Busiest Drone Operational Proving Ground
  By the joining together of smaller groups al Qaeda's survival even if the core group is defeated
  completely. Also, this type of formation makes it difficult for any country to defeat al Qaeda.

Africa - Katiba Macina Groups (KM)
The KM Islam and Muslim groups operate mostly in Western Africa, in the center of Mali. Ter-
rorist groups grow their ranks and recruit members through exploiting local conflicts to their
own advantage. Growth continued because of absence of proper judicial systems, and to com-
petition over natural resources.

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 357
Africa - Al-Qaida and Islamic State

The "Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims" (Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin)
brings together four existing al Qaeda organizations under one banner. March 2, 2017 merged
creating JNIM. This collective group is made up of members of Ansar Dine, Katiba Macina, al-
Mourabitoun and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Merger of al-Qaeda-linked groups
in Mali might pose serious risks for regional security. JNIM operates in northern and cen-
tral Mali including in the towns of Kidal, Timbuktu and Mopti. The merger of al-Qaeda-linked
groups in Mali might pose serious risks for regional security. See Figure 15-5 - al-Qaeda in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).

Groups like al-Mourabitoun, with more experience, could share their expertise with new
movements and field of explosives manufacturing. Combination of part of the groups increased
attacks in 2016 by 150%. Currently, JNIM have six hostages a French, Australian, South African,
Colombian, Swiss, and Romanian.

The group's largest attack, May 2017, JNIM disabled a communications tower outside of Gao,
and used a suicide bomber to the Malian army base. The successful attack killed 7, wounded 16,
and captured another 17 Malian soldiers. JNIM retreated from further terroristic action after
the sight of French troops. The continue to wage attacks in northern Tunisia, using grenades,
improvised explosive devices (IED), and firearms. See Figure 15-6.

Tuareg Rebellion [NMLA]

In 2012, Mali had experienced violence from ethnic Tuareg rebels who began a separatist insur-
gency and joined forces with Islamist militants to seize control. Similar attacks occurred in
the last three months of 2017, in the central Mopti and Segou regions. This region has experi-
enced more attacks then the five northern regions combined. In 2017, 22 Malian soldiers were
killed. As a result, the Malian army imposed a ban on motorcycles and pickups in some areas
to decrease opportunity for attacks. The attacks from the Militants use complex assaults with
vehicles and landmines. The United Nations (U.N.) created Multidimensional Integrated Sta-
bilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) after the National Movement for Liberation of Azawad
(Tuareg Rebellion) [NMLA] began to invade Mali's Azawad region.

The U.N. mission, largest U.N. Peacekeeping mission with 13,000 members, protects the region
from the combination of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Tuaregs. The U.N. troops
continue to patrol and keep the peace along the Mali border.

Africa - Ansar Dine (AD)

"Mali based Tuareg, Al Murabitoon and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb's (AQIM) combination
associate formed in December 2011. Its leader is part of JNIM. In 2013, Ansar Dine was recog-
nized by the U.S. State Department. The group, AQIM, has since merged with the Movement

358 | Chapter 15: Africa - World's First Busiest Drone Operational Proving Ground
for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO) to fight against French and Malian forces." (Emad-
Ceseden, 2013)

Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham (ISIS)
Islamic State in the Greater Sahara Burkina Faso branch was recognized a new branch operat-
ing in the Sahel region of West Africa in 2016. A smaller section of the al Qaeda-associated al
Murabitoon group gained ISIS leadership attention October 2016. The group executed several
small-scale attacks in Burkina Faso and Niger. Including a Nigerien prison holding Boko Haram
and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) militants with a small team and at least one suicide
bomber.

Africa - Counterterrorism Efforts
Why Fight Terror Groups in Africa?
Belgium has the highest number of foreign fighters in Syria of any Western European nation.
Because of France's presence in Africa, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has repeatedly
issued calls for attacks against France. Since U.S. supports Israel, combined with the military
involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, all terrorist groups challenge the US operations and facili-
ties in Africa. See Figure 15-7.
Joint European Union Counterterrorism
EU has deployed several Common Security and Defense Policy missions (CSDP) to provide

G5 Sahel - Five Africa States United
G5 Sahel (G5S) Joint Force, has membership of five states; Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger,
and Chad. The battle with Al Qaeda is heavy in Africa's Sahel region. The G5S is comprised of
up to 5,000 military and police personnel drawn from national battalions. Including the exist-
ing Liptako-Gourma task force (LGTF) established earlier this year by Burkina Faso, Mali, and
Niger to secure their shared border region, with their headquarters located in central Mali.
In 2017, G5 Sahel (G5S) Joint Force was authorized by the African Union Peace and Security
Council and the adoption of UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2359. Mainly supported by
France with 4,000 French troops deployed to the region. The U.S. pledged $60 million in sup-
port of the initiative. During an attack in June 2018, JNIM destroyed the entrance to G5S Head-
quarters, by a massive car bombing. See Figure 15-8.

France - Operation Serval

Operation Serval began in 2012 by France. The operation's goal is to stop the jihadist incursion
from Northern Mali into the Malian capital. Also, to stop all forms of passage, where jihadist
groups between Libya and the Atlantic Ocean. French interest in Africa continues to grow with
movement of French troops into Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic
France has acquired the MQ-9 Reaper to carryout Operation Serval. They wanted the MQ-9
for its ability to provide fire power and higher payload. However, the MQ-9 Reaper requires
over a two-year timeframe for purchase through the U.S. weapon export policy and modifying
them with European sensors. Because of U.S. stiff export drones, France's interest has dwin-
dled. However, French special forces, both army and air force, possess mini-drones. The inven-
tory includes the following, Israeli Elbit Skylark 1 and 1-LE, French Drac, Thales Spy Arrow, and
U.S. AeroVironment Wasp. [See Figures 15-11, 15-12, 15-13 15-14.]
France - Operation Barkhane
Replacing Operation Serval in August 2014, France's new mission was to provide counterterror-
ism efforts in the Sahel region (G5S). France assisted the G5S region armed forces in fighting
terrorist networks and prevented creation of terrorist safe-havens. France did this with
A mix of 20 mix of Gazelle, Puma and Cougar helicopters; 200 Armored vehicles, ten dedicated
transport/reconnaissance aircraft, six fighter planes, and three Harfangs drones. In the G5S
region, France established four permanent military bases. The headquarters of Operation
Barkhane and air force in N'Djamena, a regional base in Gao, north Mali, a special-forces base
in Burkina Faso's capital, an intelligence base in Niger's capital, an air base of Niamey. Niamey
is an ideal location to hosts drones in charge of gathering intelligence across the entire Sahel-
Saharan region.

EADS Harfangs are modified Israeli IAI Herons, $25 million each for UAVs and ground stations.
EADS/IAI's formal proposal to extend France's Heron-derived Harfang rent-a-drone service
involves sensor upgrades, but no weapons. The experience in Mali and Libya are pushing
France toward armed UAVs. It is possible to modify the Harfang UAVs to add RAFAEL's Spike-LR
missiles, or MBDA's Viper Strike glide bombs. On January 8, 2018, a Harfang drone belonging
to the 1/33 "Belfort" Drone Squadron landed for the final time on Cognac-Chateaubernard Air

Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP)

The Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership was established in 2005. It is a U.S.-funded
and implemented effort. "TSCTP partners include Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali,
Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tunisia." (Emad-Ceseden, 2013)

"TSCTP mission is to build the capacity and cooperation of military, law enforcement, and civil-
ian actors across North and West Africa to counter-terrorism. With the TSCTP, the North and
West African militaries will be enabled and enhanced their capacity to conduct counterterror-
ism operations. By integrating the ability of North and West African militaries and other sup-
porting partners enables individual nations' border security to monitor, restrain, and interdict
terrorist movements." (Emad-Ceseden, 2013) Also, by strengthening the rule of law, including
access to justice, and law enforcement's ability to detect, disrupt, respond to, investigate, and
prosecute terrorist activity. "The North and West African militaries, with TSCTP, can monitor
and counter the financing of terrorism. In turn, reducing the limited sympathy and support
among communities for violent extremism. TSCTP programs have worked to counter violent
extremist radicalization and recruitment of youth, including educational and training courses
in Algeria and Morocco, and extensive youth employment and outreach programs, community
development, and media activities in Niger, Burkina Faso, and Chad." (Emad-Ceseden, 2013)

Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism (PREACT)

Funded by the U.S. government, PREACT, builds the capacity and cooperation of military, law
enforcement, and civilian actors across East Africa for the mission of counterterrorism. PRE-
ACT has reduced the operational capacity of terrorist networks by developing a rule of law
framework for countering terrorism in partner nations. In addition, PREACT has enhanced bor-
der security, countered the financing of terrorism, and reducing the appeal of radicalization
and recruitment to violent extremism.

Terrorism in Africa is not a high priority issue for China. However, the China-Africa Coopera-
tive provides technical and financial assistance for the counterterrorism effort. China will not
join missions associated with Western political agendas nor until terrorist attacks against Chi-
nese entities in Africa or physical attacks in China by African terrorist groups. See Figure 15-20,

European Union Naval Force's (EUNAVFOR)
Operation Atalanta, was launched in 2008, as part of European Union Naval Force's (EUNAV-
FOR) anti-piracy naval mission. The operation runs from the sea off the Horn of Africa and in
the Western Indian Ocean. It deters and disrupts piracy and armed robbery at sea and monitors
fishing activities off the coast of Somalia. The operation supports other EU missions and inter-
national organizations working to strengthen maritime security and capacity in the region.
EUNAVFOR deploys UAVs for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance.
On February 23, 2018, EUNAVFOR, responded to piracy attack reported by Motor Tanker Leop-
ard Sun off coast of Somalia. Italian Airforce uses remote controlled Predator unmanned aer-
ial system (UAS) in support of Operation Atalanta off coast of Somalia. To execute long-range
surveillance and reconnaissance patrolling missions The Italian Air Force's Predator B UAS is a
long-endurance, medium-high-altitude RPA designed for surveillance, military reconnaissance
and targeting, and close air support missions over land or sea. Predator B has a single Honey-
well turboprop engine, the aircraft can stay airborne for up to 27 hours at 50,000ft altitude.

A Morocco-based startup Atlan Space has developed software to use drones for monitoring
illegal maritime activity like illegal fishing or oil spills. Testing has been taking place in Uganda.
UAVs operated by this software can be launched and deployed into monitoring operations
without having an aircraft operator.

UNICEF and Virginia Tech
Virginia Tech Unmanned Systems Lab designed a drone, called EcoSoar, that could perform
drug delivery flights. Virginia Tech worked with UNICEF to teach Malawian students to build
EcoSoar. In June 2017, UNICEF and Government of Malawi conducted flight testing in the drone
testing corridor in Kasung. The University hosted a two-day workshop for 13 Malawian stu-
dents and faculty to teach the construction of the aircraft that is made of foam core (poster
board) and 3D printed parts. See Figure 15-29.

Summary
Africa's rich natural resources attract other countries for trade in exchange for military pro-
tection and commercial growth of the continent. Terror groups continue to violently spread
through strategic areas of the Africa to gain ideal land for attacking neighboring countries. The
European Union, Russia, China, and the U.S. continue to peacekeeping support and military
training of African troops in several regions. However, the future of U.K. support is not clear
and U.S. Special Forces are considering reducing operations by half over the next three years.
China is one of the largest aid donors to Africa across infrastructure, education, and military.
Despite Africa's fight against radical Islam, their infrastructure and commercial UAS market
continues to lead the globe.
Discussion Questions

  1. Why is Africa ideal continent to test and grow innovation?
 2. How can the spread of radical Islam hinder Africa's growth? Support from other coun-

      tries?
 3. Why does Africa have the potential to lead the UAS drone market?

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 381

  the forefront of China's military expansion and control program (Corr, 2018). From this tiny
  island sanctuary drones and unmanned boats are the intelligence weapons of choice. Intru-

  Location of the Spratly Islands and Their Strategic Importance
  The Spratly Islands are a disputed group of islands, islets, cays, and more than one hundred
  reefs in the South China Sea. Named after British Whaling captain Richard Spratly in 1843, they
  represent only 490 acres spread over 164,000 square miles. The archipelago lies off the coasts
  the Philippines, Malaysia and China (WWF,2019)

Although, there are some civilian settlements in the approximate 45 islands, all contain struc-
tures occupied by military forces from Malaysia, Taiwan (ROC), China (PRC), the Philippines,
and Vietnam. Brunei has claimed an exclusive economic zone around the Louisa Reef (Spratly,
1955). Figures 16-1 and Figure 16-2 show the Spratly Islands. Officially they are in the South
China Sea at 10 degrees N, 114 degrees E.
Target Drones
The Spratlys may be disputed in theory, but the undeniable winner in any real this AO would be
China. China has made huge investments in defensive infrastructure, military, and unmanned
aircraft, and boats to solidify its position in the Spratlys. China has one of the largest UAS intel-
ligence operations in place in the Spratlys and regularly conducts drills (Staff, 6 Jul 2018). These
drills simulate fending off an aerial attack. The drills, which involve three target drones making
flyovers of a ship formation at varying heights and directions, are part of the on-going efforts

392 | Chapter 16: Chinese Drones in Spratly Islands, and Chinese Threats to USA forces in Pacific
  to improve its real-life combat ability(Staff, 6 Jul 2018). The drones have been sent out several
  hundred times during more than thirty drills (Staff, 6 Jul 2018).

  Shark Swarm and Wanshan Marine Test Field

  China has tested an army of tiny drone ships that can "shark swarm" enemies during sea bat-
  tles. It has a fleet of fifty-six unmanned craft sent out on maneuvers off the Wanshan Archipel-
  ago in the South China Sea (Barnes, 7 June 2018).2 The Chinese firm Oceanalpha confirmed the
  drones were designed to overwhelm enemies in sea battles. A mothership controls the armed
  swarm (Barnes, 7 June 2018). Oceanalpha confirmed that the Wanshan Marine Test Field, was
  constructed sole purpose of conducting drone craft drills (Barnes, 7 June 2018).

  Fast Drone Ship

  In December of 2017, HiSIBI, a Chinese nautical firm, announced the development of the world's
  fastest drone ship, which can travel at 50 knots (58 mph).3 The new speed drone is being tested
  in the Wanshan Marine Test field. The test field is still under construction and is believed
  to be the world's largest test field, covering over 297.9 square miles. Military observers have
  indicated that the test site for unmanned vessels was part of China's overall plans to develop
  autonomous systems for both civilian and military applications. The new test site dovetails
  with China's push to use technology to safeguard China's maritime interests (Staff writer, 6 July
  2018).

  Long-Range UUV

  Tianjin University researchers completed a sea test of the Haiyan autonomous Unmanned
  Underwater Vehicle (UUV). It can endure for 30 days and has a 621.37miles range Lin, J &
  Singer, P.W., 4 June 2014). Just as the US Navy is conducting UUV research for facing off against
  China's growing Anti-Access Area Denial capabilities, the Chinese are building up these capa-
  bilities (Lin, J & Singer, P.W., 4 June 2014). UUVs cover a larger area, can operated more effi-
  ciency, use multiple sensors to monitor water temperature, conductivity, optical backscatter,
  and acoustics. In battle mode for detection of a stealthy submarine, using multiple sensor types
  increases the probability of finding the prey(Lin, J & Singer, P.W., 4 June 2014). Unlike fixed
  underwater sonar stations, UUVs can be rapidly deployed via ships or airdrops to new uncov-

ered areas (such as Taiwan Straits or South China Sea), where mobility complicates enemy
efforts to disrupt and destroy them ( Lin, J & Singer, P.W., 4 June 2014).

The Haiyan UUV is part of the deployed assets for an Underwater Great Wall, which would be a
network of sensors on the seabed, coupled with long endurance UUVs to identify and destroy
enemy submarines and mines. The sister fish-like Qianlong autonomous underwater vehicle
(AUV) can dive to 14,800 feet indicates Chinese interests in deep-sea robotic ships (Katoch, 4
July 2018). These UUVs can also be used to attack targets anywhere in the Indian Ocean, in
addition to collecting enemy submarine acoustics and oceanographic conditions for improving
stealth and anti-stealth measures (Katoch, 4 July 2018).

Crisis Watch

The US and China are in a power struggle in the South China Sea centered around US coun-
tering Chinese military operations in the Spratlys. Defense Secretary General Mattis addressed
some of the disputed issues at the Shangri-La Dialogue Asia security summit in Singapore 2
June 2018:

       U.S. Sec Defense Mattis outlined U.S. "Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy", consisting
       of expanded maritime security support for U.S. partners; helping regional navies
       become more interoperable with U.S. Navy; strengthening governance through defense
       engagements; and private sector-led development. Mattis said U.S. wants to work with
       regional multilateral institutions, particularly ASEAN; that new U.S. national security
       and defense strategies emphasize Indo-Pacific; said cooperation with China is "wel-
       come wherever possible". Mattis criticized China's militarization of features in disputed
       Spratly archipelago. Also addressing Shangri-La Dialogue, China for first time publicly
       acknowledged that it was basing weapons and military personnel on disputed features
       it controls in Paracel and Spratly Islands, which it said are Chinese territory. Chinese
       military representative said Mattis's comments were "irresponsible" and that U.S. was
       the one militarizing, citing U.S. air and naval passages within twelve nautical miles of
       Chinese-controlled territory. U.S. 5 June flew two B-52 bombers over disputed Scar-
       borough Shoal near Philippines; China sent ships and aircraft, said U.S. "stirring up
       trouble". Reuters 3 June reported U.S. considering stepping up its naval operations near
       disputed features. U.S. held annual Malabar naval exercise with India and Japan 7-16
       June off coast of Guam and in Philippine Sea. Biennial U.S. Rim of the Pacific (RIM-
       PAC) naval exercises began 27 June without China after U.S. late May rescinded China's
       invitation to participate. Citing satellite imagery dated 8 June, ImageSat International
       reported that China had redeployed surface-to-air missile systems to Woody (Yongx-
       ing) Island in Paracels. PLA navy 15 June carried out missile drills in South China Sea
       (SCS). UK and French defense ministers 3 June said they would send more naval ships

394 | Chapter 16: Chinese Drones in Spratly Islands, and Chinese Threats to USA forces in Pacific
       through SCS to assert right to freedom of navigation. Meeting with Sec Defense Mat-
       tis in Beijing 27 June, President Xi Jinping reasserted that China would not give up any
       of its territorial claims in SCS; also called for deepening military-to-military ties (Staff,
       June 2018, Crisis Watch).

In May 2018, the US disinvited China from the 27 nation International Naval Exercises (RIMPAC)
in response to South China Sea aggression. The Pentagon claims evidence that the Chinese
have deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles (SAM) systems, and electronic jam-
mers to the Spratly Islands. The Chinese have landed bomber aircraft at Woody Island (Huang,
23 May 2018). This is along with the new drone systems and intelligence UAS assets discussed
supra.

A Birds' Eye View

China has developed and deployed hi-tech drones for surveillance of population. These spy
birds, code-named Dove, have completed more than 2000 test flights before deployment in
real-life situations. Early versions of the bird robots had fixed wings and rotor blades. The Dove
drones actual mimic the flapping action of birds, replicating about 90% of the real doves' move-
ments and producing very little noise signature. Doves weigh only 0.441 pounds and have a
wing-span of 19.685 inches. They can fly up to 24.855 mph for 30 minutes (Katoch, 4 July 2018).
China is testing the Doves with facial recognition, stabilizing software, arming with explosives
and increasing endurance for targeted Assassinations. The drones are being tested in Swarm
formations (Katoch, 4 July 2018). Because of Chinese aggressiveness and its policy of ambiguity
and deceit, the danger is clear and present (Katoch, 4 July 2018). See Figure 16-3 Chinese Dove
Drone.

Red Drones over Disputed Seas

One of the best reports on how Chinese military uses unmanned drones as a means of
power projection and surveillance in the contested South and East China Seas was written by
(McCaslin, August 2017). China is currently undergoing a "drone" driven by heavy investment
in the Chinese drone industry and by illegal acquisition of foreign drone technology (Katoch, 4
July 2018).

US DOD predicts China will produce tens of thousands of drones by 2023 (DoD Report, 2015).
Drone sightings and proper identification is important because of lack of international rules
governing treatment of drones, including in areas where sovereignty is contested (Lehman, 29
August 2017).
The report documents four drones known to be used by PLAN: The S-100, ASN-209, BZK-005,
and the GJ-1. All but the S-100 are Chinese-produced. The S-100 is made by Scheibel, in Austria
(Lehman,29 August 2017). The drones discussed fill a variety of roles, from surveillance (S-100)
to military / weaponized (GJ-1, aka Wing Loong I model) (Lehman, 29 August 2017).
One limiting factor facing Chinese power projection is the inability of their current inventory
to runway launch from aboard the Chinese Navy's sole aircraft carrier. This limits the BZK-005
(primary mission surveillance) to be launched from land (McCaslin, 2017). The S-100 uses ver-
tical take-off and landing (VTOL) system and does not have this problem. Additionally, drones
can be launched from Chinese-controlled artificial islands in the contested areas [i.e. the
Spratly Group.] (Lehman, 29 August 2017).
The author contends that the BZK-005 is suspected of being outfitted with cyber weapons to

The S-100 has an 18,000-foot ceiling, weighs 75 pounds armed with Thales Lightweight Multi-
role Missiles (LMM), with a range 60 to 125 miles and can be operational for 10 hours. They are
generally launched from a PLAN Type 054 /054A frigate (McCaslin, 2017).
China uses the S-100 for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). They are
equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Maritime Radar, Signal Intelligence (SIGINT)
and Communications Intelligence (COMINT) payloads. See Figures 16-4 and 16-5 for S-100
views and ranges.
ASN-209
The ASN -209 is a medium altitude, medium endurance (MAME) UAV. It has an operational ceil-
ing of 16,404 ft, an operational range of 124.3 miles, and an endurance of 10 hours. The ASN-209
is deployed with a rocket booster on the back of a truck and lands via parachute (ASN-209,
2018) The ASN-209 is equipped with Tian Long -2 (TL-2) missile. The TL-2 has heat and frag-
mentation warheads. The ASN-209 is used for border surveillance, counter-terrorism, main-
taining stability to target light armored vehicle, skiff or armed personnel (ASN-209, 2018) See
Figure 16-6.

The BZK-005 is also a MAME drone specialized surveillance missions. It has an operational ceil-
ing of 26,247 feet, with a maximum range 1491 miles and endurance of 40 hours. The range is
limited by ground-based runways, i.e. Spratly Island group(McCaslin, 2017).
It is equipped with electro-optical, infrared, SAR, SIGINT and satellite communications sys-
tems, allowing real-time data transmission capability (McCaslin, 2017). See Figure 16-7 for
BZK-005 view.
The BZK-005 range permits surveillance over the entire South China Seas if launched from
Chinese - controlled islands (artificial and natural): Woody Island, Subi Reef, Mischief Reef, and
Fiery Cross Reef (McCaslin, 2017).
GJ- 1 Chinese UCAV
The GJ-1 is also a MAME UAV converted to unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV).
The GJ-1 can carry 441 pounds. It has SAR and electro-optical loadouts. It has been equipped
with 8 different weapons systems, primarily, air-to-surface missiles and small diameter bombs
(McCaslin, 2017). See Figures 16-8 and 16 -9 for GJ-1 identification views.
This model has an operational capability of 2,485 miles and can fly higher than any other mili-
tary drone in the Spratly AO (McCaslin, 2017). Its endurance capability is classified.

Think of Chinese use of swarming drones on the seas, in the air, floating nuclear power plants,
underwater mining, robot freighters and anti-submarine UUVs. In the author's view, they are
leapfrogging US technology and antiquating defenses (Lehman, 29 August 2017).5

Interference with US Ships - Exploring the Cyberweapon deployed from UAS against US
Capital Ships

It should be clear that the Chinese (PLAN) are heavily invested in military operations using
unmanned aircraft and naval vessels in the Spratly Islands. This researcher has been tracking
Chinese UAS and Intelligence assets /facilities / naval vessels since 2014. Figure 16-3 shows a
glimpse of the deployment in the Spratly Area of Operations (AO). The black pin is the Spratly
Islands group. Blue pins represent US Navy capital ships involved in either collisions or ground-
ings in the AO. Red pins represent center of known Chinese UAS Intelligence elliptical paths.
Green pins represent Chinese Intelligence facilities or seaborn assets. Figure 16-3 is not com-
prehensive. An exploded map view would show many more Chinese assets in the AO (Nichols
& Carter, 4 May 2018).

Given the capabilities that Chinese (and US) UAS systems can deploy in almost any conditions
and any location, it seems reasonable to this researcher, that the Chinese military might test
their cyberweapons from their UAS in the Spratly AO coverage to harass US vessels and poten-

  tially disrupt US Navy capital ships navigation systems. [This would be a natural priority for the
  Wanshan Marine Test Facility.] As a lesser alternative, the Chinese might take the 911 approach
  [ i.e. turning planes into missiles loaded full of fuel and ramming them straight into fixed build-
  ings] by disrupting (signal spoofing) the GPS /AIS unencrypted signals of huge commercial ves-
  sels and forcing them to act as Greek trireme vessels, colliding into the US Naval vessels in
  restricted maneuverable waters.6

6. Triremes were used in the Peloponnesian Wars to ram at about 4 knots at a 60-degree angle of attack.
   The greater the angle of attack the lesser the speed requirement for ramming. What is interesting is that
   the Athenians used a multi-trireme attack, an early predecessor to Swarm tactics. They also used grap-
   pling hooks to engage the enemy ships directly up close. This was the predecessor to piracy tactics in the
   1500's - 1830's.

U.S Navy Vessel Collisions in the Pacific

In 2017 there was a chain of incidents/collisions involving four U.S. Navy warships and one U.S.
Navy submarine.

On 17 June, the destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with the ACX, a 30,000-ton container ship
resulting in seven dead. Records show that the ACX turned sharply right at the time of collision.
The captain of the Philippine-flagged container ship accused the Navy destroyer of failing to heed
warning signs before the crash. Those warning signs came from the commercial vessels Auto-
mated Collision Systems (AIS) on the bridge. On 9 May, the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake
Champlain collided with a South Korean fishing boat off the Korean Peninsula. There were
no injuries (Department of the US Navy, Office of Chief of Naval Operations: 29 November
2017). On 31 January, the guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam ran aground dumping more than
1000 gallons of oil into Tokyo Bay. On 18 August, the ballistic-missile submarine USS Louisiana
collided with the Navy Offshore Support Vessel in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. There were no
injuries. "On 20 August, the guided-missile destroyer USS John S McCain collided with the
600-foot oil and chemical tanker Alnic MC at 0624 JST resulting in ten dead (Navy Office of
Information, 11/1/2017)". (Weise E., 2017)

Navy Response

In all five incidents, the U.S. Navy blames their field leadership for not responding in an appro-
priate manner. This response means that the Skipper / XO / COB and at least 5 watch sailors
on each Naval vessel (roughly 40 - 50 personnel including bridge staff plus 130 lookouts on the
USS McCain because of ordered watch conditions) have been judged incompetent (Navy Infor-
mation Office, 11/2/2017). Their careers are over, and some will face courts marshal and possi-
ble brig time. This response also implies that all five Navy vessels' radar, emergency positioning
alert systems, AIS, sonar, and long-range collision avoidance equipment must have been func-
tioning perfectly, without a catastrophic failure or interference of any kind. This conclusion
assumes that none of the ships were in difficult maneuverable waters or serious traffic. The
Navy blames funding, readiness and training. However, their response may not fully account for
the commercial vessel accident data, actions required, or GPS positional data received (Olson,
August 30, 2017).

The Navy Official Reaction regarding the possibility of Cyber-Weapon or Cyber-Attack

The Navy has downplayed the possibility of a Cyber Weapon or Cyber Attack. "Chief of Naval
Operations (CNO) Admiral John Richardson said in a tweet on Monday 23 August, referring to
the USS McCain and USS Fitzgerald collisions, "there was no indication of the possibility of
cyber intrusion or sabotage was involved or that the Navy ships were hacked, but the review

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 403
will consider all possibilities." (Weise E. , 2017) The Navy investigators after inspecting the phys-
ical damage to the USS McCain and USS Fitzgerald agree with the CNO's conclusions (Olson,
August 30, 2017).

"Navy experts in the technology and researchers at University of Texas at Austin say there are
certainly scenarios they can imagine in which GPS hacks could have been used to foil ships'
navigations systems but emphasize there's no evidence such attacks took place in the case of
the Navy collisions." (Weise E., 2017) "The technology to jam or misdirect navigational software
is readily available, though the Navy uses a much more robust encrypted version of GPS that
would be very difficult to disrupt." (Weise E., 2017)

The only way to spoof such a system is a record and replay attack, "where a recording is made
of the encrypted location data being sent from GPS satellites to the naval ship. Replaying the
recording at a slightly later time could fool a ship into thinking it is someplace else. This is a
very sophisticated and difficult hack that requires multiple recordings of the navigation data
stream from multiple angles, and then sending the recorded signal from two or more locations."
(Weise E. , 2017) "To ensure that nearby ships do not also get the false data, it would have to be
transmitted from close to the Navy ship being targeted, perhaps using multiple drones." (Weise
E., 2017)

However, according to "Professor David Lust, former president of the Royal Institute for Nav-
igation in the United Kingdom, "it takes two to Tango.... I" think you just have to attack the
weakest of the pair, which is the commercial vessel." Commandeering the GPS of the cargo ship
to get it to veer off course could cause collision, and it is a much easier hack." (Humphreys,
2009)

The Case for a Cyber Weapon

There appears to be valid evidence to support the theory that at least two of the U.S. Navy
Warships, USS John McCain and the USS Fitzgerald AND/OR the commercial vessels involved
were the on the wrong end of a Cyber-Weapon and were receiving incorrect GPS generated
positional information. In agreement with Dr. Lust's conclusions, the Cyber Weapon may have
been deployed by an adversary's UAS off a small nearby vessel. The author believes that the
subject Cyber-Weapon is an advanced modular entity that can spoof the GPS signals received
by all vessels in its range. J.S. Warner & R.G. Johnson established in 2013 that the cyber-security
of many common automated navigational systems today lacks basic cyber-attack protection;
vessels using incorrect data will make wrong decisions in terms of navigation and emergency
responses, leading to potential collisions and deaths (Warner &Johnson, 2013).

Surfacing Questions

Spoofing is generation of false transmissions masquerading as P(Y) [the encrypted] Precise Sig-
nal that makes up the military vessel positioning basis, or unencrypted C/A [Civilian Acquisi-

404 | Chapter 16: Chinese Drones in Spratly Islands, and Chinese Threats to USA forces in Pacific
tion] code from GPS satellites. In a virtual world tracking invalid data streams or non-integrity-
based data is difficult, especially on three dimensional vessels moving in time. However, there
may be more than one method to spoof a signal no matter how well it is encrypted. The cargo
ships involved could have received unencrypted GPS ranging; a much less complex method
than is required for military vessels.
Both ships do not need to be disabled or spoofed. All ships (military, commercial, recreational,
specialized service) in international waters require detailed positional information. GPS sys-
tems accurately supply a 3-D position, velocity and time fix in all types of weather, 24 hours a
day.
GPS satellite signals are ranging devices that deliver two signals made up of a civilian carrier,
C/A code, NAV message, P-Code, and a military carrier. See Figure 16-11 (Balduzzi, et al 2014)

                                                Figure 16-11 GPS Signals

       https://www.acsac.org/2014/program-final/oc_multifile/3/62.pdf

Delivered GPS signals also include a 50 Hz NAV message that is combined and ultimately
mixed with the two codes to form the Civilian and Military Signals sent to the multiple radar
and GPS receivers on both the Navy and Civilian vessels. Subframe 4 of the NAV message has
a flag that tells the receiver that the P code is encrypted into the P(Y) code, thereby protecting
the military signal. The Civilian signal has no such flag. Spoofing the civilian signal would be as
simple as switching off the flag to make both the civilian and military components of the L1/L2
GPS signals unencrypted. If an adversary controls the signal the vessels are receiving, then the
false position calculated by their receivers will be wrong regardless of encryption algorithms,
military security enhancements or communication protocols used. Another spoofing method
would overpower the real signal with a false one, then lock on and maintain access.
Because of cost, most systems on commercial vessels have legacy GPS systems. In the author's
view, even if the GPS signals of the military vessels were not hacked the unencrypted C/A

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 405
- L1 Civilian signal may have been. It is also provable that this spoof is technically feasible on
the legacy systems. Experiments by Warner and Johnston out of Los Alamos, and surveys by
Schmidt, et al out of Queensland University clearly support the GPS/GNSS Cyberattack threat
vector. (Warner, 2013) In 2013, Humphreys and his students successfully spoofed an $80MM
Yacht's GPS system. (Humphreys, 2009)
What the physical damage indicates for the USS McCain and USS Fitzgerald is that both naval
vessels appear to have collided on the starboard side. This leads to the theory that the Civilian
vessels involved in crossing or approaching the US Naval vessels were relying on faulty infor-
mation for their position. Further, the cyber weapon may have been delivered by small UAS
from a nearby fishing or recreational vessel. It would be a perfect delivery vehicle: stealth,
quiet, low radar signature, requiring only 1- 25 watts signal spoofing power. Since the true GPS
signal strength reaching the surface of the Earth is about -160dBw (1x 10**-16 Watts), a 1-Watt
GPS jamming spoof signal can over-ride C/A code acquisition for more than 620 miles (Line of
Sight (LOS) to horizon.) (Warner, 2013)

Closest Point of Approach (CPA) Spoofing
"Collision avoidance is one of the primary objectives of using long range Automated Identifi-
cation Systems (AIS), especially in open sea where port authority monitoring does not occur.
CPA works by computing the minimal distance between two ships, at least one of which is
in motion. CPA can be configured to trigger an alert (e.g., visually on the captain's console or
acoustically via a siren) when a possible collision is detected so the ship can change course or
speed or both." (Warner, 2013)

                                              Figure 16-12 CPA Algorithm

       https://www.acsac.org/2014/program-final/oc_multifile/3/62.pdf

"The CPA algorithm shown in Figure 16-12 allows ship captains to compute time and distance
remaining before they collide with another ship, if the vessels are traveling at fixed speeds and

406 | Chapter 16: Chinese Drones in Spratly Islands, and Chinese Threats to USA forces in Pacific
courses. A CPA alarm is triggered if one of the two parameters is lower than the transponder's
configured thresholds. TCPA refers to the amount of time left before reaching the CPA point,
DCPA refers to the distance between the vessels before they reach the CPA point, w(ti) refers
to the distance between the vessels at a certain time (ti), and Sr and Ss are the vessels' vectors."
(Balduzzi, 2014) "CPA spoofing involves faking a possible collision with a target ship. This will
trigger a CPA alert, which could lead the target off course to hit another vessel." (Balduzzi, 2014)
The question arises, what if the civilian vessel was given a false position at [X0, Y0, T0; X1,
Y1, T2] distance (range) directly below the true point of collision (offset DCPA,) that the com-
mercial vessel would receive [Z0), Z1 assumed negligible]? According to Warner, this range
difference could be 2000 ft. or approximately 1/3 of an Nm! That is an enormous potential
navigation error considering that normal legacy GPS signal is off only 9-15 feet at 95% RMS.
See Figure 16-13.

The starboard side collisions suggest that one of the vessels may have turned port or that
the commercial ship tried to avoid a fake collision target received by turning starboard at
the wrong time. The USS Fitzgerald report confirms this observation. These are huge vessels.
Turning, stopping or reversing course on a dime are not possible. Decisions must be made well
in advance of potential collision alerts. This is also why delivery of a cyber-weapon by UAS is

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 407
so attractive. It would be a small bird in the glasses while attention was directed to the huge
targets closing in on each other. In the chaos, the adversary wins.

How could be the GPS chaos to US Vessels be achieved?

The author believes, that for the spoofing GPS signal theory [targeting a commercial vessel
by cyber weapon to give it a false position and potentially cause collision to itself or another
vessel], to be possible. It would require an enemy Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) to be
launched from either a sea-based vessel or land-based intelligence station in the Spratly
Islands. The methodology contemplated consists of three cyber-attack activities:

1) Breaking the existing AIS GPS commercial vessel receiver signal locks,

2) Locking the AIS GPS tracking device onto the GPS Simulator counterfeit signal,

3) Maintaining access by continued broadcasting of the fake GPS signal.

The problem is interesting because there are two three-dimensional maritime targets moving
in time based on inaccurate or false ranging (GPS position) signals. The clocks used in GPS
satellite systems are extremely accurate and present synchronization difficulties with the tar-
get naval / commercial vessel receivers. If it is possible to simulate and spoof the GPS signals
to the commercial vessel using AIS collision avoidance systems (Cyber-weapon CONOP), then
it is also possible that the US Navy may not have given proper attention to the non - personnel
issues in their accident investigations.

Further, the possible delivery of such a Cyber-Weapon by close range UAS means that adver-
saries may have increased their knowledge management and understanding of U.S. Navy
defensive systems. Using asymmetric warfare tactics and attacking the commercial traffic,
which deploys legacy and cheaper GPS receivers, forces dependence on faulty information.
Unfortunately, it is an effective tactic that bypasses much of the military modernization of GPS
signals and satellites. This same possibility could affect military and commercial aircraft also,
especially at airports where traffic speeds are reduced, and aircraft are closer to each other.

Discussion Questions

Consider the Signal Spoofing theory supra as the only Discussion Question for Chapter 16.
Would the methodology work?

Chapter 17: High - Altitude Platforms

(HAPS) - A Promise not Reached

Student Learning Objectives

The student will be introduced to High-Altitude Platforms (HAPS) for wireless communica-
tions. This overview will include the key design considerations, architecture, channel consid-
erations, link budget, opportunities and challenges (not met) for this promising technology.
Not covered are the detailed channel modelling calculations or the complex antenna designs
required. The latter two subjects can be found in Chapters 3 and 4 of (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala,
2008)

Introduction

For three decades wireless communications designers have researched the inclusion of
unmanned aircraft systems into their network architectures "to provide cost- effective wire-
less connectivity for devices without infrastructure coverage. Compared to terrestrial com-
munications or satellites, low altitude UAS are generally faster to deploy, more flexibly
reconfigured and have better communication channels due to presence of short-range LOS
links. However, the use of highly mobile and energy constrained UAVs for wireless communi-
cations introduces new challenges." (Yong Zeng, 2016) Table 17-1 shows HAPS capabilities com-
pared to terrestrial and satellite systems for telecommunications. (Jesus Gonzalo, 2018)

Missions

"HAPS are capable of providing services that complement, compete or replace those currently
offered by airplanes, satellites and terrestrial networks." (Jesus Gonzalo, 2018) Three key areas
on the list are telecommunications, Earth observation, and GNSS.

Telecommunications

HAPS platforms hold a promise for improvement of existing communications systems both
in capacity and coverage. (Jesus Gonzalo, 2018) This same promise has been made for three
decades. Technology has moved from 2nd, 3rd and 4th Generation wireless systems to 5th
Generation systems. 5G software (aka 5G NR for New Radio) refers to software under the 3GPP
industry association standard or the ITU IMT-2020 international requirements. (Romano, 2017)
2G, 3G and 4G technologies are associated with their respective advances: GSM, UMTS, LTE,
LTE . (See Abbreviations list for definitions) (Romano, 2017) Advanced telecommunications ser-

vices that can be offered from HAPS platforms are in various stages of development. Table 17-2
gives an overview of HAPS enhanced services that are envisioned by developers.

The deployment of services shown in Table 17-2 "have been hindered due to limitations derived
from the telecom bands assigned to HAPS by the World Radio Conference (WRC) when provid-
ing such services according to Resolution 122 from WRC-07 and Resolutions 145 and 150 from
WRC -12. Resolution 809 from WRC-15 in 2019 discusses the appropriate regulatory actions for
HAPS within existing fixed-service allocations." (Jesus Gonzalo, 2018)

Table 17-3 shows a more detailed view of the basic characteristics of terrestrial, satellite and
HAPS systems. (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) Several of these characteristics are covered
later in this chapter.

1. In 2019, there are only five companies in the world offering 5G radio hardware and 5G systems for
  carriers: Huawei, ZTE, Nokia, Samsung, and Ericsson. In April 2019, the Global Mobile Suppliers
  Association had identified 224 operators in 88 countries that are actively investing in 5G. (Romano, 2017)

Earth Observation

HAPS can be used as an "effective platform for Earth Observation (EO) payloads. It provides
useful capabilities for many services and complementing satellite and conventional aircraft
(manned and unmanned)." (Jesus Gonzalo, 2018) "Space sensors can map large areas worldwide.
They offer a relatively course resolution. They suffer operational constraints due to weather
(clouds), and fixed-timing acquisitions." (Jesus Gonzalo, 2018) Regular aircraft are more flexible
but also costlier. When continuous monitoring by MALE aircraft requires deployment of mul-
tiple platforms. (Jesus Gonzalo, 2018) EARSC has identified a variety of EO services that fit well
with a HAPS solution. (EARSC, 2015) HAPS has the advantage when required coverage area is
local or regional. "HAPS platforms can fly for very long periods, up to several months and its
capacity for EO is comparable to conventional aircraft." (Jesus Gonzalo, 2018)

GNSS

"HAPS platforms provide functionality for navigation systems:

  · Additional ranging sources to assist and improve position
  · Network node to provide data from an external source
  · Reference stations for network RTK (Real Time Kinematic) and PPP (Precise Point Posi-

      tioning) types of services
  · Additional sensor platform to perform radio occultation and / or GNSS reflectometry

      measurements."(Jesus Gonzalo, 2018)

UAV-Aided Wireless Communications

Figure 17-1 to 3 from (Yong Zeng, 2016) illustrates three typical use cases of UAV-aided wireless
communications, discussed below.

UAV-aided ubiquitous coverage

"Figure 17-1 shows two example scenarios where HAPS plays a significant role in recovered
wireless communications. HAPS UAVs can be deployed where there is a need to assist the exist-

420 | Chapter 17: High - Altitude Platforms (HAPS) - A Promise not Reached
ing infrastructure and provide seamless wireless coverage. Two examples are rapid service
recovery after partial or complete infrastructure damage due to natural disasters and base
station offloading in extremely crowded areas (ex. NFL stadium support)." (Yong Zeng, 2016)
(Osseiran, Dec 2014)

       Source: (Yong Zeng, 2016) and (Y. Zeng, May 2016.)

UAV - aided relaying
"Figure 17-2 shows the case where UAVs are deployed to provide wireless connectivity between
two or more distant users or user groups without reliable direct communication links. From
a military example, links between frontline and the command center for emergency purposes
would qualify for HAPS treatment." (Y. Zeng, May 2016.)
UAV - aided information dissemination and data collection
"HAPS UAVs may be dispatched disseminate or collect delay tolerant information to / from a
large number of distributed wireless devices." (Y. Zeng, May 2016.) In Kansas, the agriculture
industry uses HAPS for precision agriculture applications and water distribution.

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 421

Challenges

HAPS for wireless communications has faced some stiff design challenges. Along with the nor-
mal communications links as in terrestrial systems, additional control and non-payload (CNPC)
links with more stringent latency and security requirements are needed for HAPS UAV sys-
tems." (Yong Zeng, 2016) "These are needed for safety-critical functions, real-time control, and
collision avoidance. The result is that effective resource management and security mechanisms
must be designed for HAPS communications UAVs." (Y. Zeng, May 2016.)

"Mobility is also a design challenge. HAPS requires highly mobile environment. This translates
to highly dynamic network topologies. The latter are sparsely and intermittently con-
nected. (Brown, Dec 2008) Effective multi-UAV coordination or UAV swarm operations need
to be designed for reliable network connectivity." (N. Goddemeir, June 2015) The author notes
that in this textbook, Swarm operations have a very negative side too. One chapter has been
devoted to C-UAS swarm operations.

"Another interesting challenge stems from the size, weight and power (SWAP) constraints
of HAPS UAVS. These limit their communication, computation and endurance capabilities.
To tackle SWAP constraints, energy -aware UAV deployment and operation mechanism are
needed under SCADA control to efficiently use the energy and replenishment thereof." (Yong
Zeng, 2016).

"Cell interference is not negligible. Mobility and lack of fixed backhaul links under centralized
control means that neighboring cells with UAV - enabled aerial base stations is more chal-
lenging than that of terrestrial systems. Interference management techniques and software
requires expensive and complex customization for UAV -aided cellular coverage." (Yong Zeng,
2016)

Simple HAPS UAV Network Architecture

It is time to explore the HAPS UAV basic networking architecture, channel characteristics,

422 | Chapter 17: High - Altitude Platforms (HAPS) - A Promise not Reached
  design considerations, performance enhancers to exploit mobility. We then take on the Link
  budget and work an example. There are hundreds of diagrams for HAPS network structure. The
  author has chosen a figure from (Yong Zeng, 2016) because it the easiest to build upon. "Figure
  17-1 shows the generic networking architecture of wireless communications with HAPS UAVS.
  2Three basic types of links exist: the CNPC link, backhaul links and the data link." (Yong Zeng,
  2016)
  Control and Non-Payload Communications Link (CNPC)
  "CNPC links are essential to ensure the safe operation of all UAV systems. "CNPC links are
  highly reliable, low - latency and provide secure two-way communications." (Yong Zeng, 2016)

    Figure 17-4: Basic HAPS networking architecture of UAV-aided wireless communications"

          Source: (Yong Zeng, 2016)

  "CNPC links usually have low data rate requirements. They exchange safety critical information
  among HAPS UAVS and ground control stations (GCS), such as dedicated mobile terminals
  mounted on ground vehicles." (Y. Zeng, May 2016.)

2. Only in this chapter is the designation "UAV" used interchangeably with "UAS."

                                                                                    R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 423
  "CNPC information flow can be categorized into four types:3

     · Command and Control from GPS to UAVs
     · Aircraft status report from UAVs to ground
     · Sense - and - avoid (SAA) information among UAVs
     · Necessary in case of emergency human intervention requirements

  CNPC links operate in protected spectrum

  Currently there are two bands that have been allocated:

     · L-band (960-977 MHz)
     · C-band (5030 -5091 MHz)

  These bands apply to the primary GCS to UAVs (primary CNPC links) because of low delay
  factor. Secondary CNPC links via satellite act as backup to enhance reliability and robust-
  ness. (Yong Zeng, 2016) A key requirement for CNPC links is enhanced security. Efforts must
  be made to avoid the ghost control scenario (think James Bond film Goldeneye) where UAVs are
  controlled by a hostile force or unauthorized hacker. CNPC have enhanced authentication pro-
  tocols and physical security." (Y. Zeng, May 2016.)

  Backhaul Links

  Backhaul links are intermediate links that connect the core network or internet backbone to
  the small peripheral subnet systems at the edge of the system. "They are essentially a subset of
  the data links category that process dozens of gigabits per second in the UAV- gateway wire-
  less backhaul." (Yong Zeng, 2016)

  Data Links

  "Data links support mission-related communications for the ground terminals: These include:
  terrestrial base stations (BSs), mobile terminals, gateway nodes, wireless sensors," (Y. Zeng, May
  2016.) "and SCADA communications." (Randall K. Nichols, 2018) Refer to Figure 17-1 for HAPS
  UAV - aided ubiquitous coverage. "The data links maintained by the UAVs support the following
  communication modes:

     · Direct mobile- UAV communications for BS offloading or during BS malfunction
     · UAV-BS and UAV-gateway wireless backhaul

3. A fifth type is ATC (Air Traffic Control) links within a controlled airspace or near an airport. (Yong Zeng,
   2016)

    424 | Chapter 17: High - Altitude Platforms (HAPS) - A Promise not Reached
  · UAV - UAV wireless backhaul (Rappaport, 2014)

Data links support a wide range of bit rate / sec capacity. They have a higher tolerance for
latency and security. They can reuse spectrum allocations in a given band and / or have dedi-
cated spectrum for enhanced performance." (Yong Zeng, 2016)

Channel Characteristics, Propagation and Channel Modelling

modeling. For a detailed mathematical look at this interesting subject, consult chapter 3 in
(Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008). Subjects / factors covered include: Free space loss, Multi-

platform, frequency and time diversity; and open, closed and hybrid loop models. (Alejandro
Aragon-Zavala, 2008) Chapter 3 is a treasure house of information.

HAPS UAS / UAV systems work because of effective antenna design and placement. Like
channel modeling, this subject is outside the scope of this chapter 17. In that same refer-
ence (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) is an excellent chapter 4 on antennas for HAPS. (Alejan-
dro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)

If chapter four is not enough to fill your palette, the author recommends the superior textbook
by McNamara entitled: Introduction to Antenna Placement & Installation. (Macnamara, 2010)

"Both CNPC and data links in HAPS UAV-aided communications consists of two types of unique
channels, UAV - ground and UAV - UAV." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)

UAV-Ground Channel

Research on HAPS UAV - Ground channels is still ongoing after three decades. "This compares
unfavorably to similar channel research for piloted aircrafts for aeronautical applications." (Sun,
June 2015) "Whereas piloted aircraft systems ground stations are usually in open areas with tall
antenna towers, the HAPS UAV -ground links operate in a more complex environment. UAV-
ground links do not always have LOS links available." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) They may
be blocked by terrain, buildings, or the airframe itself. The latter introduces a severe signals -
link delay during aircraft maneuvering (a process called airframe shadowing). "Shadowing can
be significant during mission-critical operations." (Matolak, April 2015)

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 425
  For low-altitude UAVs, the UAV-ground channels may constitute a number of multi-path
  components due to reflection, scattering, and diffraction by mountains, ground surface, and
  foliage. (Yong Zeng, 2016) Multi-path propagation is when radio signals reach an antenna by
  two or more paths causing interference, phase shift of the primary signal, or destructive fad-
  ing. This effect can be modelled by the Rayleigh or Rician Distributions depending on condi-
  tions. (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)

  "For HAPS UAVS operating over the desert or sea, the two-ray model is used because of dom-
  inance of the LOS and surface reflection components." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) [See
  Chapter 3 of (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)].4

  HAPS UAV - UAV Channel

  "The UAV - UAV channel is dominated by the LOS component. Multi-path fading due to surface
  reflection is limited compared to the UAV - Ground channel experience. UAV - UAV channels
  experience higher Doppler frequencies than their UAV - ground counterparts due to large rel-
  ative velocity between UAVs. These characteristics have a direct influence on the spectrum
  allocation for UAV - UAV links." (Yong Zeng, 2016) There are two competing theories. "The
  dominance of LOS links suggests that the emerging mmWave (5G) communications should be
  employed to achieve high-capacity UAV - UAV wireless backhaul. (Yong Zeng, 2016) Or the high
  relative velocity between UAVs coupled with higher frequency in the mmWave band could lead
  to excessive Doppler shift." (Yong Zeng, 2016) 5

4. "The stochastic Rician fading model consists of a deterministic LOS component with certain statistical
   distribution properties. Depending on the environment surrounding the ground terminals and frequency,
   the UAV-ground channels exhibit widely varying Rician factors - i.e. Power ratio between LOS and the
   scattered components. Typical values are 15 dB for L-band and 28 dB for C band in hilly terrain. " (Yong
   Zeng, 2016) "Rician factors and typical values may be found in Chapter 3 reference" (Alejandro Aragon-
   Zavala, 2008).

5. The author has always been fascinated by the Doppler effect. Henderson gives a decent description of the
   shift (effect). (Henderson, T., 2017). "The Doppler effect (or the Doppler shift) is the change in frequency
   or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. It is named
   after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who described the phenomenon in 1842. A common exam-
   ple of Doppler shift is the change of pitch heard when a vehicle sounding a horn approaches and recedes
   from an observer. Compared to the emitted frequency, the received frequency is higher during the
   approach, identical at the instant of passing by, and lower during the recession. The reason for the
   Doppler effect is that when the source of the waves is moving towards the observer, each successive wave
   crest is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the crest of the previous wave. " (Henderson,
   T., 2017). "Therefore, each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave.
   Hence, the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced, causing an

  From the Designers Shoes

  What would a designer of a communications system based on HAPS need to know? "Certainly,
  the designer would need to know the components, subsystems and interfaces involved and the
  sensors and instruments which could be part of the HAPS mission. In addition, the spectrum
  regulations and link budgets for licenses bands (clear sky and rain) would be fully worked using
  typical systems parameters for HAPS." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) Maybe we can take a
  helicopter view and get a handle on the design problem.6 Start with the stratosphere segment
  where we will play.

  Stratosphere Segment

  "The stratosphere segment includes platform requirements to establish communications with
  ground facilities and other HAPS. This segment has two main elements, the payload and the
  bus.

  The payload is the mission." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) It is the raison de entre into
  telecommunications and infrastructure. "The bus provides resources. Its functions are:

     · Payload must be pointed in the correct direction, coverage to right users and interference
        restricted,

     · Payload must be operable,
     · Data from payload must be communicated to the GCS and back,

   reduced, so the waves bunch together. Conversely, if the source of waves is moving away from the
   observer, each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave, so the
   arrival time between successive waves is increased, reducing the frequency. The distance between suc-
   cessive wave fronts is then increased, so the waves spread out." (Henderson, T., 2017).

Platforms
"Environmental conditions present in the stratosphere affect HAPS (whether they are manned
/ unmanned aircraft or LTA airships). These conditions are atmospheric pressure, air density,
specific lift, and wind speed." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)

Many services require geostationary HAPS. "The platform must be kept in a control box with
dimensions of 800 x 400 x 1000 m (0.4971 x 0.2485 x 0.6214 miles). The size of the platform
determines the maximum payload weight at an altitude up to 20 km (12.427 miles). Both types
of HAPS can be powered by different power systems, fuel, electric motors or solar energy. (Ale-
jandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) The sun is the preferred energy source. The drawback for sun
is efficient storage of energy for long term use. The planned mission duration can be from 6
months to 5 years. Two types of platforms can be used in the stratosphere: aerostatic (LTA) and
aerodynamic (UAV)." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)
Aerostatic Platforms (LTA)
"Aerostatic platforms carry heavier payloads ~1000 kg (2204.6 lbs). They have precise station-
keeping for nominal environmental conditions and plenty of area for power generation.
Medium- strong winds are a problem. Ground stations and infrastructure is expensive and
complex. High-strain hull material is needed - a definite disadvantage." (Alejandro Aragon-
Zavala, 2008)
Aerodynamic Platforms (UAVs)
"UAVs are less expensive than LTAs with easy station-keeping in turbulent conditions. They
require less ground infrastructure. Unfortunately, they have cannot carry much weight. Pay-

  loads are limited to less than 100 kg (~220 lbs). Power is also restricted (up to 1200W).
  Continuous movement of the platform is required, which translates to more power consump-
  tion." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)
  Platform Choice - Key Designer Issues
  "Key issues to be considered by the designer when choosing the platform:

     · Cost - deployment, acquisition and operations
     · Environmental compatibility - emissions, re-usable energy, non - pollutants
     · Power - fuel powered or solar-powered
     · Service offering - affects payload capacity"(Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)
     · "Technological similarity to space-based systems - autonomous operations, payload

        types, accommodation, reliability, payload operations, communications budget."(Alejandro
        Aragon-Zavala, 2008) 7

  Telecommunications Payload
  "The telecommunications payload consists of phased array antennas (transmit / receive) for
  gateway links with the ground and or terrestrial subscriber stations with a bank of processors
  that handle receivers, multiplexing, switching and transmitting functions. The payload can use
  different multiple access techniques." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) Table 17-4 dives deeper
  into the what the designer must be aware of in terms of HAPS communication payload con-
  straints / requirements / elements / subsystems. The list is extensive, and our hypothetical
  designer is still not in deep water.

Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT & C)

"The interface between the ground station flight control and HAPS platform is performed by
TT and C subsystems. This subsystem is responsible for two-way flow of information from
HAPS to the GCS. It also links HAPS to the Flight Control Station (FCS) via LOS conditions and
under spectrum control as regulated by the ITU-R. Table 17-5 shows the functions of the TT &

Avionics

Avionics systems are needed for guidance, attitude and stabilization control of the HAPS. "This
is accomplished by sensors that measure the orientation with respect to a reference and its
angular departure from this reference measurement. HAPS attitude is specified by means of
three Euler angles, known as yaw, pitch, and roll. These angles measure rotations around the z,
y, and x axis, respectively." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) "Attitude measurements and `fixes'
are transmitted to the payload via the on-board sensors." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)

Electrical Power Subsystem

"Power for the stratospheric vehicles is the most fundamental requirement for HAPS. Power

432 | Chapter 17: High - Altitude Platforms (HAPS) - A Promise not Reached
system failure means failure of the HAPS mission. Three main components make up this sys-
tem: Primary power system (solar array or fuel cells or photo-hydrogen energy systems); sec-
ondary power systems (batteries); and power management, distribution and control. Power
management operates with all power systems whose characteristics and needs change in time.
The electrical bus provides /regulates a variety of voltages to meet the needs of the equip-
ment." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)
Ground Segment
"The HAPS ground segment (GS) is composed of terrestrial subsystems required by the plat-
form. Functions of the GS include (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008):

  · Tracking to determine the position of a HAPS
  · Telemetry operations to acquire and record HAPS data and status
  · Commanding operations to interrogate and control the various functions of HAPS
  · Data-processing operations and engineering reporting
  · Communications links to other GS, gateways and processing centers.

The main hardware components of a HAPS GS are: antenna, transceiver, LNA, HPA, data-
recorders, computers and peripherals and control consoles." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)
Also, GS require software, simulation capabilities, emergency waypoint data, and people.
Spectrum Allocation for HAPS
"Stringent conditions of non-interference and protection are imposed between the HAPS sys-
tem and other systems using same or adjacent frequency bands, fixed service (FS), and fixed
satellite service (FSS) via a GEO satellite orbit." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) ITU-R recom-
mendations for HAPS at 2GHz and other services is presented in (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala,
2008) Table 5.2 p. 158. Table 17-6 gives the Frequency spectrum available for HAPS prior to May
2019 ITU meeting.

HAPS Link Budget

We now come to most interesting part of this chapter, calculating the Link Budget for an exam-
ple of HAPs. "Link budget analysis is the real first step in designing a HAPS. It determines the
essential system parameters, size of antennas, power amplifier characteristics, link availabil-
ity, fade margins and effects of rain and weather conditions. In order to perform an accurate
link budget analysis, knowledge of several factors affecting the link must be ascertained: power
amplifier gain, noise factors, transmit antenna gain, slant path angles, atmospheric losses,
receive antenna and amplifier gains and noise performance (noise factor), cable losses, climatic
factors (essential at frequencies above 10 GHz.)" (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) Link budget
analysis is clearly presented in Adamy's Electronic Warfare texts. (Adamy, EW 101 A First Course
in Electronic Warfare, 2001), (Adamy, EW 102 A Second Course in Electronic Warfare, 2004) and
(Adamy, EW 103 Tactical Battlefield Communications Electronic Warfare, 2009) "The goal of

434 | Chapter 17: High - Altitude Platforms (HAPS) - A Promise not Reached
  a HAPS link budget is to guarantee a successful implementation of haps communication link.
  This section will focus on just the uplink analysis. In reality, the transmission of radio waves
  is between two GS with access to a HAPS transponder, one transmitting and one receiving,
  via HAPS. So, the link consists of two sections, the uplink from the terrestrial GS transmit-
  ter to HAPS and the receiving terrestrial GS. HAPOS performance is affected by rain attenu-
  ation losses (and signal degradation) - especially between 27/32 and 47/48 GHz. For 1.8 /2.1
  GHz bands the multipath and shadowing effects are the significant impairments." (Alejandro
  Aragon-Zavala, 2008) (Adamy, EW 102 A Second Course in Electronic Warfare, 2004) "HAPS
  QOS (Quality of Service) is influenced by antenna performance, service availability, receiver
  noise performance, and available power. All these must be accounted for if the stratospheric
  segment is to provide an efficient payload for transmission and reception in HAPS communi-
  cations systems." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)

  One-Way Link Budget Analysis

  "The HAPS link gains and losses used for performance evaluation may be expressed as a one-
  way link block diagram, as shown in Figure 17-3." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) (Xiaoyang Liu,
  2016) In the following analysis, "lower-case variables represent parameters which are factors,
  e.g. gain as a factor, g; and upper-case variables are parameters in decibels, e.g. gain expressed
  in dB, G. See note about refresher in decibel mathematics." (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)8

8. "Decibel mathematics is used to compare values that differ in many orders of magnitude. Any number N
   can be expressed in decibels (dB) is a logarithm base 10. To multiply linear numbers, we add their loga-
   rithms base 10. To divide linear numbers, subtract their logarithms base 10. To raise a number to the nth
   power, we multiply its logarithm base 10 by N. To take the nth root of linear number, we divide its loga-
   rithm by N. It is desirable to handle all link budget calculations as early as possible in decibels. To convert
   the linear number N to decibels:N(dB) = 10 log 10 (N). to convert dB to a linear number we use the relation
   N = 10 N (dB/10). "Adamy (Adamy, EW 101 A First Course in Electronic Warfare, 2001) Nichols (Randall K.
   Nichols, 2018) gives examples. "dB equations normally take the form of one of these equations: 1) A(dBm)
   /_ B(dB) = C(dBm); 2) A(dBm) -B(dBm) = C(dB) and 3) A(dB) = B(dB) /_ N log where N is a number not in
   dB. Remember that any value in decibels is a RATIO converted to a logarithm. The denominator is usually
   a known reference base number or value." (Adamy, EW 101 A First Course in Electronic Warfare, 2001)

  "The performance of a HAPS system is directly related to how high the signal to noise ratio (S/
  N) at the receiver can be achieved. The received signal power, CRX, is expressed:

And, the receiving noise temperature "Ts is a function of the antenna noise temperature

                                                             Eq. 17-7
                                     (C/N) = Eb /Tb / N0 x B = Eb x R / N0 x B
Where: R = 1 /Tb is the bit rate (b/s)
Playing with Eq. 17-4 we get: (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008)

                                                            Eq. 17-8
                                       Eb / N0 = PEIRP x gAR / k x Ts x R x LFS
The carrier-to-noise spectral density ratio (C/N0) is useful parameter that applies to any one-
way RF link. C/N0 in decibels is expressed:

                                                            Eq. 17-9
                             (C/ N0) dB = PEIRP - Ls - AR (G /Ts) dB - 10 log (k x R)
Converting to Eb / N0 is:

                                                            Eq. 17-10
                                          (C/ N0) dB = (Eb / N0) dB 10 log (R)
This conversion requires knowledge of the symbol/ bit rate and C/N. " (Alejandro Aragon-
Zavala, 2008) Our primary reference (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) gives further equations
which define MAR, link margin of error and further manipulate the (Eb / N0) dB. These are
left for the student to cogitate. (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) on p. 162.
We have reached the key point in our link budget analysis. We can define the uplink (UL) decibel
equation from the GTS transmitter to HAPS receiver and the decibel downlink (DL) equation
from HAPS transmitter to GTS receiver. These become the working equations.

Discussion Questions

HAPS represents so much promise for telecommunications and emergency networking.
Researchers have been designing and calculating for three decades. Lots of projects. Lots of
money invested. A fascinating technology. But conversion into real projects and utility for the
user seems to be still in limbo. Any ideas?

1. What stratospheric factors most effect HAPS performance?
2. Refer to Table 17 -7. Change the analysis from clear sky to hard rain. What parameters

    would be affected? Assume the winds have shifted from calm to gale. What parameters
    would be affected? Shift the frequency to the SHF -band (47 /49 GHz). What would you

13. The (Alejandro Aragon-Zavala, 2008) reference was published in 2008 where the world was enjoying LTE
    3G and Intel processors of 4th generation cores. Data rates have risen since then. The world is LTE 5G
    deployment and on-board computers use 8th gen Intel cores with special ASICs and FPGA hardware. Bit
    rates obviously much more. However, the author is a believer in not reinventing the wheel. (Alejandro
    Aragon-Zavala, 2008) represents the best product of about 112 papers and texts written in 2016-2019 and
    reviewed by the author for student benefit and understanding. The basic principles of Link budget analy-
    sis for satellites, weapon systems, and HAPs have not changed that much over the year. Nomenclature has
    been upgraded but the link balance analysis stays the same. A similar argument can be made for chemical
    engineering with their material and heat balances or in statics where the forces on a unit are conserved.

                                                                                      R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 441
      expect the Link budget analysis to look like?

Chapter 18: C-UAS and Large Scale
Threats

Chapter 18 will introduce developing trends for countering illegal / rogue drone use within the
United States using counter-UAS (C-UAS) technology and systems.

Student Learning Objectives. Upon completion of this chapter, students should be able to:

  · Further understand what Counter-UAS (C-UAS) technology is
  · What civil restrictions are currently in place and what agencies can use C-UAS
  · How the government is attempting to ease restrictions for C-UAS use
  · How Congress through HR302 plays a role in easing restrictions for C-UAS
  · How and why government agencies use C-UAS
  · What types of threats currently exist?
  · The growing potential for countering large UAS

Countering Emerging Unmanned Air System Threats
The FAA has forecasted that the unmanned air systems market will see exponential growth
over the next 20 years. Commercial `hobbyist' drones are expected to double from 1.1 million
to 2.4 million systems. The larger sized commercial UAS fleet will grow from 111,000 in 2017
to roughly 452,000 by 2022 with the number of registered pilots climbing from 74,000 to over
300,000 by 2022 (Miller, 2018). With this accelerated growth, (Figure 18-1) there have been
-numerous incidents around the world involving safety and privacy issues. These incidents
have ranged from intruding on personal property to the complete shutdown of major inter-
national airports. (Perez-Pena, 2018) These incidents stemmed from UAS being in either the
wrong place at the wrong time or the systems were intentionally violating airspace for reasons
unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the current and future methods that are
and will be used to safely identify, counter and intercept potentially hazardous drones and to
review national policy regarding counter UAS (C-UAS) practices and procedures.

                                                                                                      R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and
                                                                                                                                                                                 J.P. Hood | 445

The demand for ever larger systems continues to push the UAS industry to meet this need.
(see Figure 18-2) Increased payload capacity also increases the destructive potential for UAS
systems when misused for malicious purposes. As these systems continue to grow in capability,
so too will C-UAS to match.

As of October 2018, the United States government implemented its first policy that directly
affects drone usage. Known as the FAA Reauthorization act of 2018, HR 302 directs the FAA

446 | Chapter 18: C-UAS and Large Scale Threats
to begin drafting the way ahead for a UAS usage framework. Subtitle B - Unmanned Aircraft
Systems, contains all directed actions the FAA will have to address to include C-UAS opera-
tions. (115th-congress, 2018) Most of the directed actions involve developing a practical way
forward for C-UAS practices within the US and its territories. As of this moment, very few if
any national policies are in place that regulate or even guide what can and cannot constitute
C-UAS technology. Nor is there any governance on where and when C-UAS tech can be used
outside of common laws that are already in use. It remains vague as to how a drone and its use
is governed as personal property.

C-UAS is more than just using a system to knock a drone from the sky. The users must take into
consideration the implications of what could happen if a UAS falls from the sky and damages
property or injures people. If a drone is hovering over a large crowd for example, steps must be
taken to allow the drone to be successfully removed without harming bystanders. This was the
case recently when a drone was spotted dropping leaflets over a pro football game in Nov 2018.
The operator was eventually identified and arrested but nothing could be done about the UAS
while it was in flight. (Laris, 2018) This incident could have been far worse if the UAS operators'
intentions were more sinister in nature.

The US population has a vested interest in the future of UAS and C-UAS operations. Civil and
-military agencies, academic researchers as well as the everyday citizen already have access to
UAS technology. These systems are well on their way to becoming part of our daily lives and
there is currently no limit to what they can achieve. Knowing when, where, and having the
ability to stop UAS misuse will be paramount.

Introduction

Counter Unmanned Air Systems is an array of linked technology designed to detect, identify /
analyze a threat and if necessary, intercept unmanned air systems / drones. Rogue and hos-
tile drone use is becoming an exponentially increasing concern for the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD). Illicit drones have also stirred the
general public into seeking technological means of preventing UAS from violating privacy or
exploiting intellectual property. The recent passing of HR 302, the FAA Reauthorization Act of
2018, has directed the FAA to conduct multiple inter agency reviews in order to determine the
current status of C-UAS affairs in the United States. It also directs the FAA to work with the
DOD to glean current best practices and procedures for acquiring and operating C-UAS sys-
tems for future use with the US and its territories. The intent for this research is to illustrate
the current lack of legislation and regulation regarding the use of C-UAS within the US as well
as review current and future technology trends in use. This research also aims to review C-
UAS technology under development with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the
Department of Defense (DOD).

"There are several legal impediments to utilizing counter-UAS technology. The Communica-
tions Act of 1934 prohibits the use of unlicensed radio equipment such as jammers or other
devices that interfere with communication, such as the UAS command link." (Embry Riddle
Aeronautical University, 2018) "The general public is further prohibited to manufacture, import,
market, sell or operate jamming equipment in the U.S. under 47 CFR 2.803." (Embry Riddle
Aeronautical University, 2018) "Finally, 18 USC section 32 imposes imprisonment or fines upon
those that damage, disable, or destroy civil aircraft which can be interpreted to include drones."
(Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, 2018) "Operators may also be subject to liability associ-
ated with tort claims arising from the potential collateral damage, injury, or adverse effects of
counter UAS activities." (Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, 2018) Such liability issues may
include interference caused by jamming equipment or damage / injury caused by the forced
disabling of the offending unmanned aircraft. (Wallace, 2018)

Steps to Easing Restrictions

In 2016, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017. In Sec. 1697,

"Congress codified new authority for military leaders to mitigate UAS threats. The statute gave
relatively broad powers for the armed forces to disrupt control, intercept, seize, disable, dam-
age, and destroy offending aircraft." (Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, 2018) The security
risk posed by unmanned aircraft has not gone unnoticed by commercial entities either. Stadi-
ums and other open-air public gatherings are recognizing the need for counter-UAS activities.
On November 28, 2017, Tracy Mapes was arrested after flying a small UAS over NFL game at
both the Levi Stadium and Oakland Coliseum two days earlier. (Gomez, 2017) The unmanned
aircraft allegedly dropped leaflets over the stands at Levi Stadium. After reviewing surveillance
footage of the initial incident, law enforcement personnel anticipated the alleged perpetrator
would try the same activity at the nearby Oakland Coliseum. Santa Clara Police Lt. Dan Moreno
highlighted the risk of UAS operations over the crowded areas stating, "A drone can lose con-
trol and injure someone in the crowd or drop material that may be harmful. We are evaluat-
ing our security practices with state and federal authorities to make sure this doesn't happen
again." (Gomez, 2017) This and other incidents have led to the need for more robust yet public
friendly C-UAS technology.

HR 302: FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018

For this theme the author spent a great deal of time reviewing two sections within HR 302

passed by congress in October of 2018:

  · Section 364, U.S. C-UAS Review of Interagency Coordination Processes
  · Section 365, Cooperation Related to Certain C-UAS Technology (115th-congress, 2018)

448 | Chapter 18: C-UAS and Large Scale Threats
From these sections, the author was able to infer what the government was trying to accom-
plish. Congress directed the review of how the FAA and other agencies were using C-UAS
within the United States and its territories. The reviews directed specific considerations to
address, the most significant of these are listed below:

  · Safety in the national airspace
  · Protecting individuals and property on the ground
  · Coordination procedures and protocols with the FAA during the operation of C-UAS sys-

      tems
  · Adequate training for personnel operating C-UAS systems
  · Best practices for the consistent operation of C-UAS systems to the maximum extent

      practicable (115th-congress, 2018)

The last significant piece of information from HR 302 was that Congress directed the FAA to
specifically conduct a review of any additional authorities needed by the FAA to effectively
oversee the management of C-UAS systems within the US and its territories. (115th-congress,
2018)Section 365 deals directly with the deployment of C-UAS systems in the national airspace.
Congress also directed the Secretary of Transportation to consult with the Secretary of
Defense to streamline deployment of C-UAS systems by drawing upon the expertise and expe-
rience of the DOD in acquiring and operating C-UAS systems consistent with the safe and
efficient operation of the national airspace system. (115th-congress, 2018) Once the directed
reviews are complete and made public, C-UAS procedures will become standardized and regu-
lated by the FAA. Industry will then be able to evolve, and narrow down existing trends moving
forward and develop C-UAS technology that complies with these new standards. This moves
industry one step closer to opening the door for broader general public use of C-UAS.

C-UAS and the Department of Homeland Security

To increase safety, lower costs and increase efficiency more and more private companies are
looking to add drones to their workforce. These drones have the potential for use in danger-
ous aerial inspection jobs as well as local deliveries normally performed by humans. The largest
hurdle for these companies is how to incorporate the large volume of drones necessary for
these jobs safely into the national airspace without collisions or infringement on privacy. (Sul-
livan-Nightingale, 2015) This increased interest ultimately means more drones will soon be fly-
ing around localities and neighborhoods. This increase in drone activity will continue to pose a
problem for privacy, security and general public safety. Presently, UAS and drones are an inex-
pensive way to gain real time situational awareness over any venue to include large gather-
ings and sporting events. Hovering drones pose a real danger to the crowd below should they
malfunction or loose link with their pilot. (Warwick, 2016) Until recently, most C-UAS systems
used kinetic means to physically remove a drone from the airspace. Researchers are now able
to identify, track and if needed commandeer the drone and land it safely. Current technology

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 449
can also be used to triangulate the offending pilot's location to pass on if notifying the author-
ities is necessary. (Warwick, 2016) With the eventual increase in drone activity, local govern-
ment authorities will need access to C-UAS in order to maintain the security and safety of its
citizenry.
C-UAS and the Department of Defense
The militarization of drone use began during the opening years of the Global War on Terror
(GWOT) in the early 2000's. Before this time, the average citizen had no concept of what UAS
capabilities were at the time. Large systems such as the MQ-1 Predator and RQ-9 Reaper have
since become the face of GWOT. Their ability to conduct long endurance reconnaissance and
precision strike operations vs large scale bombing campaigns has made drone proliferation a
priority in most of the militaries of the world moving forward. China has declared that it will
have produced over 20,000 drones by the year 2020 in order to protect its ever growing "One
Road," initiative as it seeks to expand is economic influence in the region. Other countries
that would be considered potentially adversarial to the United States have also dramatically
increased drone acquisitions within the past decade. Simplicity and low cost of UAS technolo-
gies make their proliferation difficult to control. (See Figure 18-3 and 18-4)

            Figure 18-3: Unmanned Systems Funding by Service Source: (Krasnov, 2017)

       Source: (Grandview, 2018)

As more and more drones prepare to enter the future battlespace, the US Department of
Defense (DoD) has begun to re-look its short- and long-range air defense capabilities. Vulner-
abilities for each service have recently been identified based on the services given specific mis-
sion and current drone technology available to enemy combatant to observe and counter their
operations. The DoD has specifically focused on brigade and below sized levels for the Army
and Marines, individual vessels for the Navy and large airfield infrastructure for the Air Force.
Each service has made C-UAS technology and system acquisitions a top priority in recent years
and will remain a priority for the near future.
SWARMS
The threat(s) UAS pose continue to evolve with the most recent development of drone
"SWARMS." Drone swarm is used in two separate ways, cooperative and coordinated swarming.
For a cooperative swarm, drones perform complex functions en masse such as land surveying,
mapping, complex entertainment displays, manned / unmanned teaming, single attack per-
formed by several drones against one target. Coordinated SWARMS, drones perform separate
tasks aimed to achieve one goal. Examples include transmission line repair and complex attacks
against multiple targets at the same time. Swarming has been carried out by low slow and small
drones with varied success, the most notable was an attack against a Russian air base in Syria
in January 2018, where several home-built drones carrying crude munitions penetrated Russ-
ian defenses and successfully damaged aircraft and equipment on the base. This attack proves
drone SWARMS are difficult to track and engage effectively using current systems. The US DoD
has taken great strides to create and expand C-UAS doctrine and update existing systems.

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 451
The most difficult challenge faced by the DoD is developing and implementing C-UAS across a
Joint Force. Each service has its own methods, technologies and systems but the hard part is
getting them all to talk and coordinate with each other. Some of these challenges include being
able to identify current enemy UAS, integrating short range defense (SHORAD) and operating
with the absence of robust joint doctrine that allows commanders to wield all forms of C-UAS
within their respective battle space.

AI and Machine Learning

Advances in C-UAS tech has begun to see emerging technology, like artificial intelligence
(AI), as a means of supporting non-lethal counter-UAS applications. Citadel Defense Company
recently launched its newest counter-UAS specific system, Titan. The system is designed
for anti-drone scenarios such as drug trafficking, espionage, cyber-attacks and attacks on
airports. Titan provides the user real-time information, identifying and classifying a single
approaching unmanned aerial vehicle or a larger swarm. The system selectively applies precise
countermeasures to induce the UAV(s) to land or return to its home base. Citadel Defense uses
machine learning, artificial intelligence and software defined hardware technology to rapidly
address new threats and protect people and assets. (Rees, 2019)

C-UAS and the General Public

Reviewing currently available C-UAS technology yielded three major types that best suite usage
by the general public in a civil domain. These systems have the lowest chances of posing
any potential harm bystanders:

  · Local radar systems
  · Integrated microphone / RF signature detection systems
  · Acoustical systems for passive detection / offensive destruction

Local Radars have seen success as recently as this year's super bowl in Atlanta, GA. The FAA
declared a restricted flying zone for one mile around Mercedes Benz Stadium. Local radar was
used to track and if needed, direct integrated systems to remove the drone. The radars lead
to the successful interception and safe landing of multiple drones without incident. (O'kane,
2019)A commonly occurring theme is that most vendors still do not know what they need as
far as C-UAS systems and the demand for security experts with this knowledge continues to
grow. (Warwick, 2016) The need for C-UAS systems extends to non-standard facilities such as
correctional institutions. In recent years, prisons have seen an increase in illicit drone activity
in the form of contraband drops to inmates. By integrating RF detection systems / jammers
linked with passive microphones, correctional facilities have been able to identify when and
where drones conduct these drops. (Dedrone, 2018)

The final emerging C-UAS tech trend is acoustical systems. Small teams in academia are cur-

452 | Chapter 18: C-UAS and Large Scale Threats
rently working to see how ultra-high frequency noise that cannot be heard by the human ear,
can be used to safely disrupt drones while in flight. There has been success in disrupting the
microscopic gyroscopes (MEMS) within the drone motors causing the rotor heads to spin at
differing speeds resulting in the drone becoming unstable and crashing. (Son, 2015) In its cur-
rent form this technology is best used as an area denial system. Acoustical technology will most
likely be used to defend an area from a multiple drone's swarm and could possibly be coupled
to part of an existing network of C-UAS systems to form a layered defense for a private facility.
Emerging Threat of Large Civil UAS
The next evolution for the UAS industry will to begin to dramatically increase payload capac-
ities. This would enable more economical uses for delivery services to begin delivering large
goods right to consumers or deliver goods across long distances reducing costs of aerial trans-
port. As this trend seeks to take hold of the UAS market, C-UAS researchers will have to begin
to visualize the threats scenarios these systems will pose and how they can be safely coun-
tered. (See Figures 18-5 to 18-7)

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 453

Results
Current Restrictions / Policy, Directed Reviews from HR 302
Once the final reports from HR 302 are released, the FAA in coordination with the DOT and
DoD will begin to standardize current best practices. This will establish rules and regulations
that industry can then use to guide its research and development as it clamors to meet market
need. Drone use will continue to grow exponentially as shown by market research as applica-
tions for UAS' continues to be developed. It is the opinion of the researcher that once the FAA

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 455
has established a firm precedent for civil C-UAS operations, the C-UAS industry will see very
similar exponential growth to match the UAS industry.

C-UAS and the Department of Homeland Security
Civil authorities will soon have no choice and will have to address / budget for local govern-
ment use of C-UAS in order to protect local infrastructure and public gatherings. The threat(s)
posed to open space venues and facilities will require affordable and adaptable systems that
can be used to protect the public at large. Fortunately, private industry has already been devel-
oping integrated systems that are designed for this purpose(s). As drones become increasingly
sophisticated, potential adversaries and drug cartels can also potentially use these systems to
conduct cross border incursions.
C-UAS and the Department of Defense
Addressing current gaps for the DoD and finding ways forward for joint doctrine integration

456 | Chapter 18: C-UAS and Large Scale Threats
will be crucial for the Defense Department to stay ahead of growing threats posed by peer /
near peer state actors and rogue organizations / individuals. The DoD was the first organiza-
tion to see and begin to adapt to the growing threat of drone use. There guidance and exper-
tise will be invaluable for the FAA and DHS to expand C-UAS from. With the largest budget
for C-UAS technology development, the DoD will maintain its current position as the industry
leader for C-UAS in the US.

C-UAS and the General Public

As the commercial and private use of drones and other UAS systems continues to grow, sys-
tems to limit their use will inevitably see use to limit the areas in which they can fly. With
several forms of non-kinetic C-UAS technology emerging, the author predicts that the general
public will soon be able to own and operate these systems once Congress has formalized fur-
ther authorizations allowing the FAA to regulate C-UAS use. General safety for the public is
paramount when considering using C-UAS technology in the public domain. The three emerg-
ing technologies discussed, I feel, have the greatest potential to serve the public safely and
effectively. Large open-air vendors and correctional institutions are two of the many organiza-
tions along with private citizens who could use these types of C-UAS systems. They will be able
to maintain their privacy and security while not inadvertently harming bystanders or creating
collateral damage in the general area around them.

Conclusion(s)

The literature collected shows the growing need for C-UAS for national defense, civil defense
and private property protection market(s). The only limiting factors appear to be the lack of
government regulation. Once the FAA has identified and recommended to Congress C-UAS
standard operating procedures and best practices, stemming from HR 302, Congress will then
create legislation that will help guide the C-UAS industry in developing new and better tech-
nology for civil use. Outside of the DOD, private industry has recognized the growing need for
C-UAS and has already developed technologies that allow for the safe removal of drones from
private airspace. Once the regulations are in place, the C-UAS industry is ready to grow expo-
nentially.

The rapid pace of UAS development will soon introduce larger UAS to the public airspace. This
will further drive the need to develop systems that can counter / deter there use for nefarious
reasons. Large UAS will be able to inflict more severe damage to varying degrees of structures
and venues if they are repurposed or digitally hi-jacked. Currently the only way to combat
large UAS is using kinetic means which is only operated by the DoD and is in very sparse loca-
tion across the country. As this sector grows, so too will the need for larger and more inte-
grated systems across the US.

Counter-UAS will continue to grow exponentially to match the capabilities of the UAS indus-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 457
try. This growth will be bolstered once Congress and the FAA formalize procedures and oper-
ating parameters for these systems.

Chapter 19: Audiology, Acoustic

Countermeasures against Swarms and

Building IFF Libraries

Student Learning Objectives

The student will explore the use of acoustic countermeasures against hostile UAS (especially
Swarms) and their dual use as IFF vectors for UAS characterization. The student will take brief
sojourn into the science of audiology to understand why acoustic countermeasures actually
work.

Problem

The Risk of success of Terrorist Attacks on US Air Defense Systems (ADS) via sUAS / UAS is
higher and improving because of commercial capabilities and accessibility. Advanced small
drones capable of carrying sophisticated imaging equipment, significant (potentially lethal)
payloads and performing extensive Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) mis-
sions are readily available to civilian market. They pose a significant threat to civilian and
military UAS operations and safety in the NAS. The highest threats to ADS are presented by
hostile UAS Swarms.

Problem Solution

The author's research suggests that UAS Swarms can be both identified (IFF) and desta-
bilized / mitigated /eliminated / countered in the air by applying harsh acoustic coun-
termeasures at resonance frequencies. UAS (in any formation - especially Swarms) present
detectable acoustic signatures that can be collected in an IFF sound libraries and like finger-
prints or DNA they are unique to the make, model and origin manufacturer. Once identified as
hostile, UAS (Swarm units) may be destabilized by harsh - explosive amplitude acoustic coun-
termeasures to the MEMS or rotor base of the UAS's causing destabilization of the UAS and
grounding. Emergency and waypoint recovery functions do not work under this approach.

Review of key points from Chapter 8 Designing UAS Systems for Stealth

Detection Signatures

Recall from Chapter 8 Stealth, that UAS / UAVs are detected by theirsignatures: noise

                                                                                                      R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and
                                                                                                                                                                                  J.P. Hood | 471
(acoustic), optical (visible), infrared (thermal) and radar (radio). "These acoustic or electromag-
netic emissions occur at the following wavelengths: (Austin, 2010)

       A) Noise (acoustic) [16 m-2 cm, or 20 - 16000 Hz]

       B) Optical (visible) [0.4 - 0.7 um]

       C) Infrared (thermal) [0.75 um - 1 mm]

       D) RADAR (radio) [3 mm - 3 cm]" (Austin, 2010)

In the discussion on stealth, it was presented that "If the designer is to reduce the vehicle
detectability to an acceptable risk level, it is necessary to reduce the received emissions or
reflection of the above wavelengths (expressed as frequencies) below the threshold signature
value. A good portion of the UAS signatures are a function of the operating height of air vehi-
cle." (Austin, 2010) The concept of frequency as a fifth realm was elucidated in terms of targets,
battlespace, and wavelengths. One of the parameters, range was a serious limitation on perfor-
mance. Range has a significant impact on radio transmission. Depending on the environment,
the strength of a received signal, T, is a function of the square or fourth power of a distance,
d, from the transmitter. (Adamy D. -0., 2015) The EMS was presented with emphasis on sound
frequencies, many out of human hearing range. The author's experiments were using DJI Phan-
tom 4 at 400 ft. This is not a tactical distance for a countermeasure. However, the LRAD made
by LRAD Corporation is effective to a mile. It was described in the C-UAS chapter.

Chapter 8 presented that for the UAS designer the upper end of noise - Stealth acceptability
17,150 Hz. The Stealth range is 20 Hz - 17,150 Hz.

Essentials of Audiology

The question is why would hitting a UAS going at 100 mph or more be susceptible to a loud
noise hitting the MEMS under the rotors or the rotors themselves? Why would this same noise
or variation thereof be capable of characterization of the UAS's of a hostile or friendly power?
It is not something we can just take for granted without understanding the essentials of audi-
ology underlying the process.

For the Birds

The author recently purchased two "Cadillac: hearing aids made by Signia. (Signia, 2019) They
came with an Iphone application that permits all kinds of variation in frequency, tone, loudness,
dampening factors, etc. and can be adjusted for universal, TV, reverberating rooms, chaos,
party atmosphere, stadium, quiet, music hall and many other customizations. Sitting outside
on my deck, I was able to match the frequency of chirping birds and graph their frequency as
heard through my hearing aids. This is a different learning process from when the author wrote

472 | Chapter 19: Audiology, Acoustic Countermeasures against Swarms and Building IFF Libraries
about speech cryptography in my Classical Cryptography Course, Volume I. [CCCI] (Nichols,
Classical Cryptography Course, Volume I, 1996) In CCCI, he was trying to characterize and
encrypt / decrypt speech patterns and make a library of those vowel -consonant patterns.
Here the author is concerned with creating resonant frequencies to disrupt the delicate unpro-
tected circuitry of a moving UAS vehicle in the air.

The author was able to jimmy-rig a transmitter at the frequencies below 16 MHz and send fre-
quency tones about 50 feet at the birds in my backyard. My purpose was to emulate Identifi-
cation Friend or Foe (IFF) conditions to the various birds feeding at my porch and trees nearby.
In a non-scientific attempt to see what the sent signals (at bird frequencies matched to the
birds' chirping) would cause any, none, confusion, chaos, friendly, or hostile reactions. The rig
was not capable of sending exact signals at resonance frequencies. (So, the birds didn't explode
or lose flying ability.) The object was to understand the audiology principles involved and to
test conditions within the hearing range. Stop laughing for a moment. In the space of just two
days, the author was able to characterize the following bird species: White-breasted Nuthatch,
House Finch, American Robin, Blue Jay, Northern Mockingbird, House Wren, Tufted Titmouse,
Baltimore Oriole, Morning Dove, Black-capped Chickadee, Northern Cardinal, White-throated
Sparrow, a Common Flicker Woodpecker and a most irritating Red-Bellied Woodpecker (RBW)
(who if exploded, would not cause the author tears). The author taped these sounds and tested
the taped version through the computer on three of the above species with similar effects.
Some of the larger birds reacted harshly / threatened. The smaller birds acted is if they were
in love and wouldn't shut-up even when the frequency stimulus was stopped. The RBW was
unimpressed and kept up his chaotic bug - finding noises. Interestingly, only one bird was hit
with my frequency simulator, while he was flying between trees - the House Finch. For a few
brief moments the bird seemed to wobble and drop in a decreasing angular pancake fashion,
and then recovering in midair. It is possible that the frequency transmitted was close to his
resonating chirp - frequency. Then again, he might just have been yawning.

Audiology Fundamentals

The science of sound is called acoustics, which a branch of physics. Table 19-1 displays the prin-
cipal physical quantities in MKS, cgs, and English units. Table 19-1 can be found in most engi-
neering, physics or medical textbooks. (Entokey, 2019) It is the starting point of a trip uphill to
resonance frequencies.

Intensity and Inverse Square Law

"Sound radiates outward in every direction from its source. This constitutes a sphere that gets
larger and larger with increasing distance from the source." (Entokey, 2019) Figure 19-1 shows
the relationship between Intensity and the Inverse Square Law. (Uni-wuppertal, 2019) Intensity
(I) (power divided by area) decreases with distance from the original source because of finite
amount of power is spread over increasing surface area. (Entokey, 2019) Proportionately less
power falls on the same unit of area with increasing distance from the source. (Gelfand, 2004)

"Four important relationships to note are that power is equal to pressure squared, P = p2,
pressure is equal to the square root of power, p =  P, intensity is proportional to pressured
squared,

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 475
I  p2 and pressure is proportional to intensity, p  I. This makes it easy to convert between
sound intensity and sound pressure." (Entokey, 2019) These relations yield a few more to relate
sound pressure, sound intensity and distance r. Given to pressures p1 and p2 at distance r1
and r2, they are proportional: p2 / p1 = r1 / r2; and factoring in intensities at I1 and I2, gives I2
/ I1 = (r1 /r2)2.

Finally, r2 / r1 = p2 / p1 = I1 / I2. (TRS, 2018)

Decibels (Adamy D. , 2001) (Gelfand S. A., 2009)

Sound magnitudes, intensities, and pressures vary over an enormous range. We use decibels
(dB) to express sound values. Decibels takes advantages of ratios and logarithms. Ratios are
used so that physical magnitudes can be stated in relation to a reference value that has mean-
ing to us. The reference point chosen is the softest sound that can be heard by normal people.
The reference value has an intensity of 10-12 w/m2 (10-16 w/cm2). In terms of sound pressure,
the reference value is: 2 x 10-5 N/m2 or 20 µPa (2 x 10-4 dynes/cm2). An interesting Geek bar
bet is what is the logarithm of all 2:1 ratios, 8:4, 20, 20:10, 100:50, etc.? Even though the distance
between absolute numbers gets wider, 1,4,10, 50..., the logarithms of the 2:1 ratios are the same
at 0.3. Another interesting factoid about ratios is the units generally cancel out.

The general decibel formula in terms of power level (PL) is as follows (Gelfand, 2004):

                                                             Eq. 19-1

                                                     PL = 10 log P / Po

Where P = power of the sound measured, and Po is the reference power to be compared.

The general decibel formula in terms of power level (IL) is as follows (Gelfand, 2004):

                                                            Eq. 19-2

                                                      IL = 10 log I / Io

Where I = intensity of the sound measured, and Io is the reference intensity to be compared. Io
is given as 10-12 w/m2 .

The general decibel formula for sound pressure level (SPL) is obtained by replacing all of the
intensity values with the corresponding values of pressure squared because (I  p2).

                                                            Eq. 19-3
                                                   SPL = 10 log p2 / po2

476 | Chapter 19: Audiology, Acoustic Countermeasures against Swarms and Building IFF Libraries
  Where p is the measured sound pressure (in N/m2) and po is the reference sound pressure of 2
  x 10-5 N/m2 . A more convenient form of this equation recognizes that log x2 = 2 log x. (Gelfand,
  2004)

                                                               Eq. 19-4
                                                      SPL = 20 log p / po.
  Equation 19-4 is the common formula for SPL. A couple of observations a positive decibel value
  means that the sound pressure level is greater than the reference. The decibel value of the ref-
  erence is 0 because reference value / reference value = 1 and 10 log 1 = 0. This does not mean
  no sound, it just means the sound measured is equal to the reference point. A negative value of
  decibels means that the sound magnitude is lower than the reference. (Gelfand S. A., 2009)
  Figure 19-2 shows common decibel and Intensity levels within the hearing range. This does
  not consider environment, frequency differences or noise (discussed presently). It does show
  the ease of which decibels may be used to rank the sound intensity levels which vary greatly
  in magnitude. 1Hearing aids are effective from about 6 - 90 decibels. Above 90 dB, they can
  dampen but not eliminate the very loud sounds unless there is complete loss of hearing.

1. 3 dB is an interesting cutoff datum. Because decibels are logarithmic and the log (base 10) of 3 =).477 
  50% power. So, 3 decibel cutoff is where the power drops by approximately half. 3 dB implies ½ of the
  power. An increase of 3dB doubles the sound intensity but a 10-dB increase is required before sound is
  perceived to be twice as loud. A small increase in decibels represents a large increase in intensity. For
  example, 10 dB is 10x more intense than 1 dB, while 20 dB is 100x more intense than 1 dB. (Adamy D. , 2001)

                                                                                    R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 477

The Nature of Sound
"Sound is defined as a form of vibration that propagates through the air in the form of a wave.
Vibration is the to-and-fro motion (aka oscillation) of an object. Some examples are playground
swing, tuning fork prong, air molecules and UAS rotor blades [circular motion]. The vibration
is called sound when it is transferred from air molecule to air molecule. This transfer may be
simple like a tuning fork or a very complex pattern like the din in a school cafeteria. Naturally
occurring sounds are very complex." (Entokey, 2019) UAS sounds are not natural and supported
by machinery, hardware and software. Three weaknesses of the UAS are the MEMS, gimbal
assembly and rotors. Although stealth mechanisms may be employed to reduce noise emis-
sions, the former parts are exposed. They do produce discernable signatures.

       Source: (Pierson, 2019)

A tuning fork illustrates the oscillations of sound. After being struck, the tuning fork vibrates
with a simple pattern that repeats itself over time. (Entokey, 2019) Figure 19-3 shows that the
tuning fork when struck exerts a force on the air molecules which alternatively exerts a high
pressure (compression) and a low pressure (rarefaction) zones. The zones exhibit wave ampli-
tude and wavelength as a function of air pressure and distance. The sound wave is distributed
in 360 degrees through the air.

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 479

  Figure 19-4 diagrams tuning fork oscillations over time. Sounds that are associated with simple
  harmonic motion are called pure-tones. Vertical displacement amount of the tuning fork prong
  displacement around its resting position. Distance from left to right represents progression
  of time. One complete round-trip or replication of an oscillating motion is called a cycle. The
  number of cycles occurring in one second is the frequency. The duration of one cycle is called
  its period. This form of motion occurs when a force is applied to an object having properties of
  elasticity and inertia. Simple harmonic motion (SHM) shows the same course of oscillations as
  in Figure 19-4 because they repeat themselves at the same rate until friction causes dampening
  of the waveform. (Entokey, 2019) and (Gelfand S. A., 2009)
  Other Parameters of Sound waves
  Probably the most useful SHM waveform is the sinusoidal wave or sine wave.2
  The number of times a waveform repeats itself in one second is known as the frequency or
  cycles per second (CPS). (Gelfand S. A., 2009)Two useful relationships are: f = 1/ t or t = 1/f;
  where f is the frequency in cps and t is the period in seconds. Amplitude denote the magnitude
  of the wave. The peak- to - peak amplitude is the total vertical distance between negative and
  positive peaks. The peak amplitude is the distance from the baseline to one peak. The mag-
  nitude of sound at any instant is the instantaneous amplitude. Wavelength () is the distance
  traveled between one peak and the next. (Gelfand, 2004)
  Wavelength formula is:  = c / f, where c is the speed of sound in air (344 m/s. f is the fre-
  quency of sound in Hz. Similarly, frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength or f = c / .

2. It is left to the reader to obtain any standard trigonometry text to see all the parameters of the well-
   known sine wave.

    480 | Chapter 19: Audiology, Acoustic Countermeasures against Swarms and Building IFF Libraries
  (Gelfand S. A., 2009) Another interesting sound parameter is Pitch. Pitch is the quality of sound
  and especially a musical tone governed by the rate of vibrations producing it. It is the degree of
  highness or lowness of sound. (Merriam-Webster, 2019)

  Complex waves

  When two or more pure-tone waves are combined, the result is a complex wave. (Gelfand,
  2004) They may contain any number of frequencies. Complex periodic waves have waveforms
  that repeat themselves. If they don't they are aperiodic. Combining waves may reinforce them-
  selves or cancel themselves whether they are in phase or out. The lowest frequency compo-
  nent of a complex periodic wave (like a combination of sign waves) is called its fundamental
  frequency. (Gelfand, 2004)

  Harmonics are whole number or integral multiples of the fundamental frequency. Waveforms
  show how amplitude changes with time. (Gelfand, 2004) Fourier's Theorem shows that complex
  sound waves can be mathematically dissected into its pure tones.

  Of more interest to UAS designers are aperiodic sounds which are made up of components
  that are not harmonically related and do not repeat themselves over time. The extreme cases
  of aperiodic sounds are transients and random noise. A transient is an abrupt sound that is very
  brief in duration. Random noise has a completely random waveform, so it contains all possible
  frequencies in the same average amplitude over the long run. Random noise is also called white
  noise like white light because all possible frequencies are represented.

  Patient D v-105 (Heinman, 2019)

  Let's look at some of the discussed sound parameters in a real patient. Data was collected by
  audiologist in an anechoic3 sound chamber.4 Refer to Figures 19-5 and 19-6. Note that the stan-
  dard ANSI 1969 runs from 250 Hz to 10,000 Hz. Average hearing range is from 250 Hz - 8,000
  Hz. Patient D v-105 has lost hearing in the upper ranges. Patient hearing declines precipitously
  after 2,000 Hz in both ears. The patient requires a louder (more dB) threshold stimulus as fre-
  quencies go above 1500 Hz in the right ear and above 1000 Hz in the left. Patients most com-

3. Anechoic means free from echo. An anechoic chamber provides a non-reflective, non-echoing, echo-free
   room designed to completely absorb reflections of either sound or electromagnetic waves. They are also
   isolated from waves entering from their surroundings. Sound interactions / countermeasures for UAS
   testing are ideally done in an anechoic chamber. NASA Langley has a fully equipped room in Va. Patient D
   v-105 was only able to hear sounds entering his / her ears by headset connected to an audiometer. The
   audiometer is a machine that evaluates hearing acuity. The patient responds to test frequencies and
   sounds by pushing a red feedback button.

  fortable level is 60 dB in both ears. This corresponds to 400 Hz in right ear and 3,500 Hz in the
  left. Patient experience pain / discomfort at 95 dB. From Figure 19-2, 60 dB is moderate inten-
  sity normal conversation. 95 dB is a siren on a police car. Patient can pick up speech sounds at
  15 /20 dB or comparable to a quiet room. Patient D v-105 experiences difficulty in differentiat-
  ing consonants above 2,000 Hz or k, t, f, s, and th. (Heinman, 2019)
  Because of pitch, Patient D -v105 would be able to hear and differentiate many bird calls and
  chirping below 4,000 Hz and would be able to hear the bird noises above 4,000 Hz with hearing
  aid assistance. UAS noise levels range from 250 Hz to 20,000 Hz so Patient would not be able
  to hear the UAS directly but could IFF with the appropriate LRAD.5

5. LRAD is a Long-Range Acoustic Device (weapon). It was discussed in detail in Chapter 8. "The 450XL
   model (LRAD, 2019) can produce 140 dB at 1m which is equivalent to 108.5 dB at 37.58 m." (Yunmonk Son,

Standing Waves and Resonance
We have arrived at the crux of the acoustic CM discussion, the natural or resonating frequency.
"The frequency(ies) at which a body or medium vibrates most readily is called its natural or res-
onant frequency(ies)." (Gelfand S. A., 2009) Differences in resonance frequency ranges enable
different devices to act as filters by transmitting energy more readily for certain high, low,
or bandpass frequencies. UAS with multiple rotors circulate the rotors to gain lift and / or
hold steady / or descend in altitude. Four, six, eight - rotor UAS maintain control via internal
SCADA systems and send critical information through a MEMS component located at the bot-

484 | Chapter 19: Audiology, Acoustic Countermeasures against Swarms and Building IFF Libraries
tom of rotors. Rotor frequencies are coordinated, monitored, and position -controlled through
the MEMS and in-board computers. Even though the rotor(s) motions are spinning in circular
fashion, the sound wave generation is not curvilinear, or aperiodic but transferred up through
the Y axis and back again to its base as it ascends in altitude. There is a tendency to maintain
equilibrium in terms of position of the UAS.

The author contends that the UAS rotor systems act like vibrating strings and resonance fre-
quency information can be approximated by this approach. An example of a vibrating spring is
when you "pluck" a guitar. The waves initiated move outward toward the two tied ends of the
string. The waves are then reflected back, and they propagate in the opposite directions. The
result is a set of waves that are moving toward each other, resulting in a perturbation sustained
by continuing reflections from the two ends. The superimposed waves interact and propagate
and appears as a pattern that is standing still. Peaks (maximum displacement) and no displace-
ment (baseline crossings occur at fixed points along the string. Places along the spring where
zero displacement in the standing wave pattern are called nodes. (Gelfand, 2004) Locations
where the maximum displacement occurs are called antinodes.

"The fundamental frequency is defined as the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform. It is
generally denoted as `f'. The lowest resonating frequency of a vibrating object is called as fun-
damental frequency." (Administrator, 2015)

"Harmonic is a frequency, which is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. The forced
resonance vibrations of an object are caused to produce standing waves. At the natural fre-
quency it forms a standing wave pattern. These patterns are created at specific frequencies,
they are called Harmonic Frequencies or Harmonics." (Administrator, 2015)

"The sound produced by a waveform at its harmonic frequency is very clear, and at other fre-
quencies we get noise, and cannot hear the clear sound of waves. Harmonics may occur in
any shaped wave forms, but mostly they occur in sine waves only. Non - sinusoidal waveforms,
like triangular and sawtooth waveforms are constructed by adding together the harmonic fre-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 485
quencies. The word harmonic is generally used to describe the distortions caused by different
undesirable frequencies called noise, of a sine wave." (Administrator, 2015)

"Node and antinodes occur in a wave form. So, the waves have harmonic frequency in them.
The fundamental frequency is the smallest frequency in a harmonic. Hence there is only a sin-
gle anti-node occurs between them. This Antinode is middle of the two nodes. So, from this we
can say that the guitar string produces longest wavelength and the lowest frequency." (Admin-
istrator, 2015)

"The lowest frequency produced by any instrument is called the fundamental frequency. This
is also known as first harmonic of the wave. In words of fundamental frequency, harmonics
are the integer multiples of the fundamental frequency." (Ex: f,2f,3f,4f, etc.... are harmonics.)
(Administrator, 2015)

"Because of multiple integers of fundamental frequency, we will have n number of harmonics
like 1st harmonic, 2nd harmonic,3rd harmonic, and so forth." (Administrator, 2015) "The fun-
damental frequency is also called as First harmonic. In the first harmonic, we have two nodes
and one anti -node. he numbers of antinodes are equal to the integer multiples of specific
harmonics. i.e., for 1st harmonic we have 1 antinode, for 2nd harmonic we have 2 antinodes
etc." (Administrator, 2015)

The formula for the string's resonant frequency Fo is:

                                                             Eq 19-5

                                                    Fo = 1 / 2L x T /M

Where Fo is resonance frequency in Hz, T is Tension, M is Mass, L =  /2 and f = c /  and c =
speed of sound. L = length of the string. (Gelfand, 2004) The strings lowest resonant fre-
quency is f = c / 2 L but Eq 19-5 considers that the speed of sound is different for a vibrating
string than it is for air.

UAS / Acoustic Countermeasures FAQ (Nichols, Hardening US Unmanned Systems Against
Enemy Counter Measures, 2019)

The reader has questions, so here are the most likely questions and answers.

In terms of UAS Countermeasures, why are Acoustics so important? (Nichols, Hardening US
Unmanned Systems Against Enemy Counter Measures, 2019)

They are important because:

  · Offensive systems use ultrasonic frequency resonance

486 | Chapter 19: Audiology, Acoustic Countermeasures against Swarms and Building IFF Libraries
  · Cannot be heard by humans when used to intercept a drone
  · Passive systems are difficult, if not impossible, to detect
  · Able to identify and track drone based on acoustic and/or visual signature
  · Acoustic detection systems are limited in range ~ 350 ft to 500 ft due to environmental

      variables BUT commercial companies like LRAD, Corporation have developed long range
      acoustic devices which can detect a UAS up to a mile away at altitude.
  · Can be a cost-effective way to defend a small area -especially against Swarm Attacks

Acoustic Signature Reductions (Nichols, Hardening US Unmanned Systems Against Enemy
Counter Measures, 2019)

Can the UAS signatures be reduced?

  · Noise may be the first warning of its presence
  · However, it may not immediately be directionally/locatable for detection
  · UAS noise emanates predominantly from vortices, tips of wings, rotors, or propellers
  · Lowering wing span or blade span enhances acoustical stealth
  · Conventional propulsion systems are a concern because of the noise of combustion
  · Electric motors develop virtually no noise
  · Reducing mass and aerodynamic drag of the UAS reduces noise generation

What are the Acoustic Detection Issues?

Detection relies on uniqueness of the UAS and hearing capabilities at low frequencies:

  · Detects drones by recognizing the unique sounds produced by their motors
  · Rely on a library of sounds produced by known drones, which are then matched to

      sounds detected in the operating environment, however
  · The human ear is a problem for the designer
  · It is most sensitive to frequencies around 3500 Hz and can hear sound down to a practi-

      cal threshold of 10 dB
  · For a given sound pressure level, attenuation of sound with distance in air and insulating

      material varies as the square of the sound frequency
  · Low frequency sound presents a greater problem for UAS stealth design
  · The greater noise problem is posed by smaller UAS using piston engines
  · Sound comes from their internal combustion and exhaust systems
  · Sound emission can be reduced with sound-absorptive materials, silencers and mufflers

      and by directing the intake and exhaust manifolds upward
  · Level of sound detected depends on the level of background noise for sound contrast
  · Limited range to 500 feet (experimental and research - not commercial or military)
  · Noisy backgrounds (airports, city downtown) limit detection & interdiction

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 487
  · Drone tuning (changing the stock propellers) limits detection / Interdiction

Is Acoustic Quieting possible?

"Yes, under certain conditions:

  · Disguise sounds from sensors to eliminate its noise and passive echoes
  · "Acoustic superiority" used by the Navy to mask detection of U.S. submarines
  · Acoustic technology is "passive," meaning it is engineered to receive pings and "listen"

      without sending out a signal which might reveal their location to an enemy
  · Increased use of lower frequency active sonar and non-acoustic methods of detect-

      ing."(Nichols, Hardening US Unmanned Systems Against Enemy Counter Measures, 2019)

What is an Acoustical attack on the UAS Gyroscope?

There are two possibilities: compromising the sound source or drone on drone attack:

Compromising the Sound Source

  · UAM with speakers (consider police and military operations or search-and-rescue opera-
      tions)(Usenix.org, 2019)

  · Counter the source of the sound from the speaker with different frequency sound
  · Jamming attack aims to generate ultrasonic noises and cause continuing vibration of the

      membrane on the sensor, which make the measurements impossible
  · Level of noise causes performance degradation

Drone on Drone Attack

  · Taking a picture of a moving object from UAM
  · An adversary drone equipped with a speaker could steer itself toward a victim drone and

      generate a sound with the resonant frequency of the victim's gyroscope to drag it
      down(Usenix.org, 2019)

How has the Long-Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) used as a sonic weapon? (LRAD, 2019)

It has been used primarily for denying GPS navigation:

GPS Denied Navigation

  · GPS navigation relies on measuring the distance or delay, to several known transmitters
      in order to triangulate the mobile receiver's position

488 | Chapter 19: Audiology, Acoustic Countermeasures against Swarms and Building IFF Libraries
  · GPS-denied environment presents navigation challenges for UAV and UAM
  · These areas include urban canyons, forest canopy, etc.
  · Strike Resonance frequency - which disrupts balance (vehicles tilt, orientation & rotation)
MEMS
What is a MEMS and how does it relate to the UAS gyroscope?
As shown in Figure 19-7 MEMS Gyroscope,
  · MEMS (Microelectromechanical-Systems) gyroscopes are located in the rotor systems of

      most drones
  · Visualization of a MEMS gyroscope is a single proof mass suspended above a substrate
  · The proof mass is free to oscillate in two perpendicular directions, the drive and sense

      (Said Emre Alper, December 2008)

A very interesting presentation on MEMS is available at (Said Emre Alper, December 2008).
Resonance Effects on MEMS
Achieving resonance frequencies can have a significant effect for countering hostile UAS:

  · MEMS Gyroscope can be degraded using harsh acoustic noise
  · MEMS Gyroscope has a resonant frequency that is related to the physical characteristics of

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 489
      its structure (Usenix.org, 2019)
  · MEMS gyroscopes have resonant frequencies much higher than can be heard (audible and

      ultrasonic ranges)
  · Unexpected resonance output caused from an attack will cause the rotor system to malfunc-

      tion
  · Rotors will spin at differing speeds causing the drone to become unstable and crash

What is Resonance Tuning?

  · "In the operation of MEMS gyroscopes, the bending changes the capacitance between the
      sensing mass and the sensing electrode, and this capacitance change is sensed as the
      output of the gyroscope

  · By using an additional feedback capacitor connected to the sensing electrode, the reso-
      nant frequency and the magnitude of the resonance effect can be tuned

  · Resonance can be induced by a malicious attacker, if resonant frequencies exist in gyro-
      scopes"(Nichols, Hardening US Unmanned Systems Against Enemy Counter Measures,
      2019)

What is the "so what" for Acoustics? Here are the author's thoughts:

  · "Passive detection is much cheaper and cost effective to operate vs a complex radar sys-
      tem for a single installation (limited by detection range ~350ft)

  · MEMS gyroscopes contained in rotor systems are very susceptible to malfunction when
      struck with rough noise that resonates inside the MEMS

  · Offensive acoustic systems are currently mounted, could become man portable
  · Offensive systems are not detected by National ELINT assets
  · Not looking for acoustic energy signatures, enemy can remain hidden from detection

      when using acoustics."(Nichols, Hardening US Unmanned Systems Against Enemy
      Counter Measures, 2019)

Are there Countermeasures for Acoustic attack on Gyroscope?

"Yes, some but not totally effective:

  · Physical Isolation - provide physical isolation from the sound noise
  · Surrounding the gyroscope with foam would also be a simple and inexpensive counter-

      measure
  · Differential Comparator
  · Using an additional gyroscope with a special structure that responds only to the resonant

      frequency, the application systems can cancel out the resonant output from the main
      gyroscope

490 | Chapter 19: Audiology, Acoustic Countermeasures against Swarms and Building IFF Libraries
  · Detect and cancel out analog sensor input spoofing against CIEDs."(Nichols, Hardening
      US Unmanned Systems Against Enemy Counter Measures, 2019)

South Korean experiment

A paper by Yunmonk son, et. Al. From the Korean advanced institute of science and technology
(KAIST), in the authors judgement, is the seminal paper on taken down drones using sound
noise on gyroscope sensors! (Yunmonk Son, 2015) It is required reading for my students.

(Yunmonk Son, 2015) describes the relationship between Sound Pressure Level (SPL) and Sound
Amplitude and derives the attack distance, d as (in dB) :

                                                            Eq. 19-6

                                             SPL = SPLref 20 log (A / Aref )

Where SPL = sound pressure level, SPLref is the reference, A and Aref are the amplitudes of the
source and reference point. Using the real-world experiments (Yunmonk Son, 2015) found that:

                                                            Eq. 19-7

                                          SPL = SPLref - 20 log (d / dref )

Where d, dref are the attack scenario distances.

KAIST under (Yunmonk Son, 2015) primary conclusions are:

  1. "Many sensing and actuation systems trust their measurements and actuate according to
      them. Unfortunately, this can lead to security vulnerabilities that cause critically unin-
      tended actuations.

 2. The sound channel can be used as a side channel for MEMS gyroscopes from a security
      point of view.

 3. 15 kinds of MEMS gyroscopes were tested, and seven of them were found vulnerable to
      disruption using intentional noise.

 4. The output of the vulnerable MEMS gyroscopes was found using a consumer-grade
      speaker to fluctuate up to dozens of times as a result of the sound noise.

 5. Authors found that an attacker with only 30% of the amplitude of the maximum sound
      noise could achieve the same result (disruption) at the same distance.

 6. At 140 decibels, it would be possible to affect a vulnerable drone up from around 40
      meters away,

  7. Some drone gyroscopes have resonant frequencies in both the audible and ultrasonic fre-
      quency ranges, making them vulnerable to interference from intentional sound noise.

 8. Authors found that accelerometers integrated with MEMS gyroscopes were also affected

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 491
        by high-power sound noise at certain frequencies."(Yunmonk Son, 2015)6

  NOISE

  Loud and abrupt sound as a countermeasure also brings the problem of exposure and loss.
  Chapter 17 of (Gelfand S. A., 2009) discusses the effects of noise and hearing conservation.
  Chapter 20 of (Gelfand S. A., 2009) discusses occupational standards. Safety is an important
  topic but outside the scope of this writing.

  UAS Collaboration - SWARM

  Time to wrap-up the chapter. Recall that the authors previously defined in Chapter 3, a UAS
  SWARM as a uniform mass of undifferentiated individual's w/o Chief at automation level 4 or 5.
  SWARMs exhibit the following advantages:

     · Efficient based on numbers, emergent large group behaviors, and reactions
     · Not controllable or automated, decentralized intelligence
     · Think shoal of fish w/ evolving local rules; highly resistant form
     · Not changing based on survivability of members, no hierarchy

  SWARM Countermeasures include disruption, i.e. changing the Strategic Global View of
  SWARM (its only real vulnerability), complete Defender collaboration with multiple kinetic
  and non-kinetic countermeasures, and use of Acoustic Countermeasures for identification as
  friend or foe (IFF) based on a library of manufacture detection signatures and complete , abrupt
  rotor disablement by attacking the SWARM units with resonant, loud ( 100-140 dB) sound noise
  aimed directly at the MEMS gyroscopes or close by on the unit. [Think of glass breaking at
  resonance frequency or a submarine under depth charge attack. The former breaks by super-
  excited molecules in the glass and literally shakes apart. The latter is destroyed by violent shak-
  ing of the submarine so that its parts break and flooding ensues. It is not necessary to hit the

6. Author note: although not specified in (Yunmonk Son, 2015), according to chapter author research and
   experimentation, the frequencies turn out to be the resonance frequencies. So agrees Dr. Kim at KAIST.
    "You would think that the gyroscopes used in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) would have been
   designed to have resonant frequencies above the audible spectrum - i.e., above 20 kHz - but Kim and his
   team found that some have not." (Yunmonk Son, 2015) In the case of a gyroscope, "you can get it to spit
   out very strange outputs, as researcher Yongdae Kim, a professor in the electrical engineering depart-
   ment of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), told ComputerWorld" (Kirk,
   2015) An example of resonance frequency and breaking glass can be found on youtu.be at

submarine directly because explosions in water, hence sound waves and explosive forces, carry
very far and effectively to the target.]

Discussion Questions

1) This chapter explores the use of acoustic countermeasures against UAS. The authors content
that every manufactured UAS has unique sound detection signatures. Further these can be
libraried and used in a search algorithm to IFF the UAS group or SWARM. At the DoD 7th Annual
Summit, (Nichols, Hardening US Unmanned Systems Against Enemy Counter Measures, 2019)
the author found that several contractors are actually doing this and building databases. BUT
they refuse to share their data because it is proprietary. Assuming this situation cannot be
changed, suggest two ways to get around this problem not involving legal actions. What type
of research project would you propose to meet an 85% detection criteria that would suffice as
an initial IFF database for evaluation?

2) Along with attacking the MEMS gyroscopes to disable the UAS rotor, propose an experiment
to use acoustic countermeasures on the UAS internals, such as SCADA, payload, navigation,
internal clocks, internal computer, battery, etc. Perhaps loud noise can disrupt additional UAS
features?

3) This chapter has discussed sound in the in the extended hearing ranges from 10 Hz to 20,000
Hz. Many UAS are designed for higher frequencies, i.e. ultrasonic and hypersonic. Propose an
experiment to test sound disruption effects at the higher frequencies. (Drones, 2017) Quad Star
Drones has some interesting "takes" on hypersonic flight and Mach 0.8 speeds.

Chapter 20: Legal and Regulatory -

Where It Was, Where It Is and What's

Ahead?

Student Learning Objectives:

This chapter presents students with an updated set of considerations relating to the history,
methods and objectives of regulating Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Since the first edition
of this textbook, the impact of legal and regulatory effect upon the industry has predictably
increased both domestically and globally. In this chapter students will examine the regulatory
history of UAS as well as those laws and rules presently under consideration and those which
may be enacted in the future. Students will also examine the impact which new laws and regu-
lations will have upon new technologies and delicate balance between too little regulation and
too much. Finally, students be challenged to decide whether or not they would choose to enact
regulations based upon events which may occur in the future and the considerations underly-
ing those decisions.

Introduction

Since the first edition of UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) IN THE CYBER DOMAIN:
PROTECTING USA'S ADVANCED AIR ASSETS there have been numerous laws, regulations and
enactments relating to the operation, identification and responsibilities of UAS in airspace
globally. In order for today's student to understand the complexity and consequences of reg-
ulating UAS it is necessary to examine how we have arrived at this point and what were the
underlying causative events that led to their enactment. Armed with this information students
will be better equipped to navigate the complexities of the interaction between law and tech-
nology and the delicate balance between public safety, national defense and the inevitable
development of new and more complex automated systems.

As a parallel consideration students should be cognizant that they will be entering an industry
where UAS operation, regulatory, insurance, legal and other related industries is expected to
grow exponentially in decade. According to a 2018 report by the consultancy firm Pricewater-
houseCoopers, by 2030 it is estimated that the Drone/UAS industry will provide a 42 Billion
Pound (53 Billion US Dollars) increase in the Gross domestic Product of the United Kingdom
alone.[See Figure 20-1.]

Where vast amounts of money flow it is a certainty that disputes will occur, risks need
to be insured and legal responsibility will need to be established and adjudicated. Lawyers,
Judges, Politicians, Manufacturers, Regulators, are but a few of the many areas of potential
growth which will provide vast opportunity for those who choose a career in the UAS legal
field. (Ricker, 2017) And for those who choose to follow a career path in other areas, not related
to law and regulation, it will still be important for them to have a solid foundation in under-
standing the interface between UAS law and regulation with the rest of the overall UAS indus-
try.
Current Regulatory Overview
As a preliminary matter the focus of this chapter will be focused upon the legal and regulatory
structure of the UAS industry in the United States. This is not done out of any preference or
bias but rather recognition that the number of separate regulations continues to grow rapidly
with laws being enacted on local, state, federal and international levels. Since it would be
impossible to study and digest UAS laws in each nation on earth this chapter will focus upon
the broad conceptual considerations of regulatory frameworks as opposed to detailed exami-
nation of each and every separate regulation. While the FAA has exclusive authority over the
use of airspace in the United States, as of September 2018, 44 states have adopted some sort
of UAS regulation. (Sovereignty and use of airspace, 1994) Simultaneously the Federal Aviation
Administration and other parts of the federal government continue to promulgate rules and

498 | Chapter 20: Legal and Regulatory - Where It Was, Where It Is and What's Ahead?
regulations which collectively make the legal landscape quite difficult to navigate and even
harder to predict. (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2018) Just as was discussed in the
first edition of this text UAS are inherently mobile technology so that they are being used both
within, across and beyond local, state and international borders not to mention their use over
international waters and unaffiliated or neutral territories. The following figures demonstrate
the overlapping web like structure of laws which currently confront those in the UAS industry.
[See Figure 20-2]

                                 Figure 20-2: Domestic UAS Regulatory Matrix

       Source: (Sovereignty and use of airspace, 1994)

From a global perspective, as of January, 2018, according to medium.com of 233 countries being
tracked just over one half have enacted some form of UAS regulation on a nationwide basis
while over 100 nations having yet to have imposed any. (Schroeder, 2018) Most nations also
have, states, provinces, prefects or other subdivisions not to mention agencies, authorities and
even NGO's which all can promulgate more regulation. The reality is same globally as it is within
the United States, an overlapping web of laws and regulations with a high likelihood that some
portions of each may conflict with provisions of others. While the problem is currently one
that is more burdensome and confusing than stifling innovation or a direct concern for public
safety, with the increased of autonomous transportation the risk of more serious consequences
grows with each new enactment.

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 499

  Some may ask "why not have a global set of rules for all nations regarding the UAS industry?"
  In reality as likely as conflict of regulations is, it is even more likely to expect that each nation's
  particular self-interest, autonomy, culture, mores and even form of government make such
  omnibus regulation a remote prospect at best. Just consider how regulations of UAS in China
  or North Korea might differ from those in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. For
  example, a recreational UAV pilot might feel free to operate a drone over Times Square, Pic-
  cadilly Circus or the Sydney Opera House with some degree of registration and identification1.

1. Since popular public locations can be considered "soft targets" for terrorists or criminals it would cer-

   500 | Chapter 20: Legal and Regulatory - Where It Was, Where It Is and What's Ahead?
  Contrast those locations with Tiananmen Square in China or Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang,
  North Korea. How would the CPRC or DPRK security forces react to such a flyover by a hobby-
  ist? Hence the need to be extremely sensitive when regulating UAS to local customs, politics,
  mores and governing style.

  Future Regulatory Framework

  In order to achieve the most homogenous global UAS regulatory framework sense to focusing
  upon certain standardized critical areas which are generally considered "must have" in terms of
  UAS/UAV legislation seems to be most practical. Those general categories of regulation would
  consist of the following:

     1. UAS Pilot Licensing
    2. Aircraft Registration with Oversight Agency (ies)
    3. Areas of Restriction, Limited Use of Outright Prohibition
    4. Liability, Operational "Rules of the road" and penalties for violation. (Jones, 2017), (Mus-

        pratt, 2018)

  In the United States the regulatory hierarchy is established on a pyramid model where the
  generalized power to regulate flows from the Congress who then empowers, by legislation the
  authority to certain government agencies to enact and adopt rules and regulations.

  Next, based upon consultation with governmental experts as well as private sector or NGO
  input, which is vital to ensure that the imposition of regulations does not unduly burden the
  industry, public or stifle the safe development of the nascent technology. Figure 20-4 depicts
  just a portion of the hierarchy involved in the legislative and regulatory process in the United
  States.2

  A similar regulatory hierarchy exists in each of the fifty states as well as territories, com-
  monwealths and protectorates. While a number of jurisdictions have enacted various legal
  framework for UAS, still many more are actively considering and debating the imposition of
  operational, licensure, geographic, insurance, liability and criminal laws and regulations. Not
  only are such regulations often viewed as a public safety function, it also appears that with
  each registration, license and permit states can help offset budgetary deficits and create new
  job opportunities for state workers to administer these type of ministerial requirements. Just

   tainly make sense to limit such overflight to known or approved aircraft with a heavily vetted pedigree of
   reliability, trustworthiness and piloting skill

   ments and sub bureaucratic creations which all impact the UAS industry on a federal level.

The North Carolina Regulatory Framework touches many areas of life and law. From hunting
and fishing to privacy rights to licensing of pilots. It also contains provisions that are criminal
in nature, others civil law and still others ministerial such as the licensure and registration
requirement. Students should be aware that common or "case" law will provide interpretation
of laws of which UAS professionals must keep abreast.
Below the state level comes local and regional authorities and governments which all can exer-
cise various regulatory powers within their particular jurisdiction.

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 503
Finally input from industry associations, trade groups, manufacturers, NGO's and other private
organizations which can all impact in in many ways regulate the UAS/UAV industry in the
United States. The interaction between the UAS industry, commercial and private operators
and the current and future regulatory structure should not be underestimated. Last is the
overarching impact which the military and national defense establishment has upon the UAS
industry. Students must be aware that military and national defense jurisdiction is largely bor-
der to border and beyond and in many instances trumps civilian authorities.

What is clear that a certain amount of regulation will always be needed however too much of
a good thing can be worse than nothing at all. Regulators must be deliberative before, cautious
during and responsive after regulation if we are to minimize negative and maximize the posi-
tives in UAS and AI regulation. Figure 20-5 is a good example of an agile regulatory framework
and roadmap as it aims to find a broad consensus while recognizing the likelihood of unin-
tended consequences. If we are to achieve maximum regulatory efficacy, while minimizing the

504 | Chapter 20: Legal and Regulatory - Where It Was, Where It Is and What's Ahead?
  risk of unintended consequence it will be essential to move quickly when such issues arise.
  This is particularly important in such a highly technological area where new developments will
  always outpace the law.

  When students encounter the challenges of regulation and jurisprudence of technology, they
  may be wise to remember the writings of John L. O'Sullivan 1n 1847 who wrote:

  Government should have as little as possible to do with the general business and interests of
  the people. If it once undertakes these functions as its rightful province of action, it is impos-
  sible to say to it `thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.' It will be impossible to confine it to
  the public interests of the commonwealth. It will be perpetually tampering with private inter-
  ests and sending forth seeds of corruption which will result in the demoralization of the soci-
  ety. (O'Sullivan, 1845)3

  Conflict of Laws

  With so many laws and regulations being promulgated internationally, domestically and locally
  it is inevitable that some of them will come into conflict with others. For example, North Car-
  olina requires a knowledge test to pilot a done while South Carolina currently has no regu-
  lations. (UAV Coach, 2019) When neighboring jurisdictions have different regulations or as in
  the case of the Carolina's one state has regulations and the other does not, the prospect of an
  operator of a UAV encountering a situation of conflict of laws grows. Adding to the likelihood of
  conflict of laws is the national authority of the FAA over airspace. (49 U.S. Code § 40103, 1994)
  What are the principles of law that can help resolve these disputes?

  Federal supremacy is a constitutionally established doctrine that establishes the supremacy of
  Federal Law over conflicting state or local laws. It was a clause specifically included in the orig-
  inal text of the United States Constitution in 1776.

  "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance
  thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United
  States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound
  thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstand-
  ing." (United States Constitution Article VI, Sec.2, 1787) (Marbury v. Madison, 1803)

  From the Supremacy Clause flows the doctrine of Federal Preemption. In 1819 the United States
  Supreme Court held in McCullough v. Maryland (McCullogh v. Maryland, 1819) that federal leg-
  islation or regulation shall be deemed superior to and controlling over any state or local law.

3. Others have been reputed to have stated "The best government is that which governs least" including
   Thomas Jefferson, John Locke and Henry David Thoreau however it appears that O'Sullivan was the first
   to have penned the generalized concept.

                                                                                    R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 505
Simply put, "Preemption is a doctrine of American constitutional law under which states and
local governments are deprived of their power to act in a given area, whether or not the state
or local law, rule or action is in direct conflict with federal law." (Guardbaum, 1994)

In 2017 the Supremacy Clause and Federal Preemption came directly into play in the UAS indus-
try when a medical doctor/ inventor Michael Singer intended drones to deliver medical sup-
plies and services in the greater Newton Massachusetts area. At or about the same time the
City of Newton enacted regulations regarding UAV operation in the jurisdiction. The following
provisions were challenged by Dr. Singer in federal court.

  1. Registration with the city of Newton in addition to the previous requirements established
      by FAA Regulations under Part 107;

 2. Prohibition of the operation of pilotless aircraft under 400 feet in altitude;
 3. Operation over private property: and
 4. Prohibition of Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) operation. (Singer v. City of Newton, 2017)

In holding the cities regulation invalid under the Supremacy Clause and doctrine of Federal
Preemption the court held in part:

"The Ordinance limits the methods of piloting a drone beyond that which the FAA has already
designated, while also reaching into navigable space. See Newton Ordinances § 20-64(c (1) (b).
Intervening in the FAA's careful regulation of aircraft safety cannot stand; thus subsection (c)
(1) (b) is preempted." (Singer v. City of Newton, 2017)

Regulatory legal conflict is not the only concern for UAS operators. Liability and insurance
claims resulting from drone activity is likely to become a very significant area of litigation and
court decisional law. Figure 20-5 is a photo of a drone which crashed into the Church of Lat-
ter-Day Saints in Draper, Utah in July of 2017.

Although the size of the drone was thankfully incapable of causing much damage to the prop-
erty, the case is illustrative of the very likely prospect of larger UAVs crashing or coming into
contact with structures, people or other flying and ground based vehicles. Courts will be hear-
ing many cases and will have to blend the common law concepts such as assault, trespass and
property privacy rights with statutes and regulations which may add liability to UAV pilots and/
or owners. In fact, many states, cities and town may attempt to enact laws which make drone
owners "strictly liable" for any harm caused by UAV activity. Strict liability exists when a defen-
dant is liable for committing an action, regardless of what his/her intent or mental state was
when committing the action.

Strict liability legislation is often reserved for harm caused by certain inherently dangerous
activity which as a matter of public policy, has been designated as needed heightened liability
rules to protect the public. One of the most likely areas of strict liability imposition upon UAS
operators is in mid-air collisions where the risks become greater and the potential of damage
or death is also greatly increased.
Students should be aware that conflicts of laws and regulation will most certainly increase with
the expected exponential growth in commercial and hobbyist use of UAV's. While they may not
directly be involved in the litigation or legislation of UAS rules, they should be keenly aware that
there will be many instances where UAS activity may be subject to many laws some of which
have conflicting provisions.
A significant portion of Chapter 2 of the First Edition of this text was devoted to the subjects
of balancing the need for regulation with the possibility that over-regulation can inhibit the
development of this nascent technology and the many benefits that may come from it. While
the principles discussed in the prior edition are important for students to understand and
assess, the passage of time can help us focus the areas of law where over or conflicting regu-
lations can have real world consequences and inhibit innovation. The Singer decision is most
likely just the beginning of an increased friction between the need to regulate and the desire
to innovate. (Singer v. City of Newton, 2017)
One area which seems to be especially concerning is the prospect of laws being enacted in
other parts of the world which establish liability for those globally. One of the most recent

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 507
  examples of such broad reaching legislation is the European Union's enactment of the General
  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

  The three main objectives of GDPR are:

     1. This Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard
        to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal
        data.

    2. This Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in par-
        ticular their right to the protection of personal data.

    3. The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor pro-
        hibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the
        processing of personal data. (European Union, 2019)

  While on the surface on may ask, how does a data protection law enacted by the European
  Union have any impact on the UAS industry in the United States or other non-EU nations? As
  it is said, the devil is in the details.

  GDPR defines personal data as:

  "Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual.
  Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a par-
  ticular person, also constitute personal data." (European Union, 2019)

  The definition of personal data is quite broad and when combined with the fact that any
  online form of communication may impact jurisdictional boundaries of the European Union,
  the potential of GDPR consequence from an online connected activity grows. For example,
  imagine you are a recreational drone pilot who likes to fly over beautiful homes on the South
  Florida

  Coastline. You stream the flight video using Live4 or other streaming technology and fly by
  many beautiful homes along the fight.4

  Along the flight, homes, mailboxes, house numbers, license plates and street sighs are all
  broadcast live globally. Additionally, there are a significant European citizens who own prop-
  erty in South Florida. Once recorded by the onboard camera and data processed for streaming
  in theory the UAV owner and/or pilot has in fact committed a GDPR violation.

In terms of penalties they are significant and can easily cause havoc with commercial drone
package delivery system in its infant stages. Although the possibilities of conflicts and confu-
sion increase with each new law or decision, student should try to at least maintain a mod-
icum of familiarity with recent laws, decisions and trends. Though by no means complete,
some websites students may wish to visit include https://uavcoach.com/drone-laws/,

Putting It Together - Where Law Meets Reality
As a general matter from the author's perspective much of the legal and regulatory process is
about prescribing behavior and assessing blame when the laws are violated. In order to ade-
quately operate within any quadrant of the greater UAS industry it is vital that students under-
stand that each and every decision they make can have a legal consequence. To that end when
designing aircraft, creating products, developing processes or even drafting regulations, con-
sideration must be given to its legal consequences and the secondary effect upon the greater
UAS industry.
Scenario 1
Randy, a drone hobbyist in the Rocky Mountains created local business of selling real-time and
recorded video of crimes scenes, fires, and other serious disasters. Over time local television
and print media would turn to Randy to acquire drone footage of breaking news in order to

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 509
enhance their coverage. After a while Randy upgraded his aircraft, cameras and skills, He even
formed a corporation called Dragon Vision to being to commercialize and become a true UAV
video and photo vendor. Television, realtors, newspapers, even the local police were among
many customers who began to regularly pay for his services.
During a particularly dry season the mountains near Randy's Rocky Mountain home a series of
deadly wildfires, caused by a careless hiker with a cigarette butt which was not extinguished
before he flicked it into the pine straw. Within moments, fueled by gusty winds the cigarette lit
the pine straw and within moments thousands of acres of pristine forest were ablaze, including
portions of the Rocky Mountain National Park. Local fire-fighters immediately summoned state
and federal resources and simultaneously media bean to flock to the region. Frank was called
by media and even the local fire authorities to help them by using his UAV fleet to capture
images, provide streaming video and even identify "hot-spots" where new fires were igniting
by using an infrared thermal imaging scanners on one of this aircraft.

Cameras
Randy, ever the Good Samaritan immediately went into action without any agreements with
any of the consumers of his content, just the usual handshake. As the fire spread Randy
streamed live and also took still photos for the various fire departments and news outlets. As
the fire continued to be spread by stronger winds, he found that the drone was increasingly
difficult to control because of smoke, heat, uplift wind gusts from the fire and rotor wash from
firefighting helicopters.

510 | Chapter 20: Legal and Regulatory - Where It Was, Where It Is and What's Ahead?
The result? Firefighting aircraft were unable to drop payloads until the confusion and uncer-
tainty caused by Randy's drone could be resolved. Unfortunately, the delay let to the fire
expanding and either partially or totally was responsible for the loss of thousands of acres of
forest and hundreds of homes. Thankfully no humans were seriously injured or killed, and all
pets and livestock had been relocated.
What are some of the laws may be implicated in the case of Randy's UAV misadventure in the
Rocky Mountains? Who might be subject to these claims other than Randy?

Possibly Liable Parties:
First and foremost, the hiker is would most certainly be deemed to have some degree of crim-
inal or civil liability for being the cause of the fire itself. Had he not flicked a lit cigarette into
the dry pine straw reason dictates the fire would never have occurred. This is known as the
"But-for test" which asks, "but for the existence of the hiker's action of flicking a burning ciga-
rette onto pine straw in a dry nation park, would the forest fire have occurred?" If the answer
is yes, then factor X is an actual cause of result Y. Other jurisdictions use the similar concept
of "proximate cause" which asks whether the defendant's actions are closely enough related to
the result to make the defendant responsible. (Cornell University Legal Information Institute,

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 513
2019) Under either test the hiker would likely be found to be proximate or actual cause of the
fire.

Randy is the next logical target for possible criminal and civil exposure, not only could he be
fined or criminally charged by the FAA if his UAV was not registered, he could also face charges
from the National Park Service for operating in a restricted area. He may also be charged with
a violation of the federal law prohibiting UAV interference with firefighters. Similarly, the Col-
orado laws against obstructing a firefighter, criminal trespass and criminal invasion of privacy
may also cause criminal liability on a state level. His potential liability stems from the legal con-
cept of intervening or contributory cause. In this case whatever Randy did occurred after and
as a result of the Hiker causing the fire. His liability will be predicated upon the concept of
intervening or contributory cause. Intervening cause is defined as an event that occurs after a
party's improper or dangerous action and before the damage that could otherwise have been
caused by the dangerous act, thereby breaking the chain of causation between the original act
and the harm to the injured person. The result is that the person who started the chain of
events may no longer be considered fully or partially responsible for damages to the injured
person since the original action is no longer the proximate cause. (Cornell University Legal
Information Institute, 2019)

What other parties have possible liability to those property owners and the National Park
Service itself for damages sustained or exacerbated during the fire? Was there a defect or
improper design that led to the inability of Randy to navigate and control the UAV which caused
the delay in dispersing fire retardant in some way caused by, DJI, Zenmuse or their component
suppliers?

The prospect of liability on behalf of DJI, Zenmuse or their suppliers will likely flow from the
concept of product liability and breach of warranty. This type of liability blends elements of
tort or negligence law with principles of contractual law where a product was not designed,
manufactured or perform in the manner promised in Figure 20-9.

From a civil liability perspective Randy may be the target of both federal and state litigation.
Students must also be aware that there are concurrent and special jurisdictional rules for
claims arising on federal property or between citizens of different states. Specifically, at least
two different types of subject matter may result in Randy being named as a defendant in a Fed-
eral Court action.

Jurisdiction: Subject Matter

The first example of subject matter jurisdiction in federal courts (what this dispute is about -
its "subject matter") is known as Federal Question Jurisdiction. The Federal Question jurisdic-
tion reads: The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under
the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. (Federal Question, 1948)

A second type is called diversity jurisdiction. The Diversity Jurisdiction statute reads in applic-
able part:
(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in con-
troversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between--
(1) Citizens of different States;
(2) citizens of a State and citizens or subjects of a foreign state, except that the district courts
shall not have original jurisdiction under this subsection of an action between citizens of a

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 515
  State and citizens or subjects of a foreign state who are lawfully admitted for permanent resi-
  dence in the United States and are domiciled in the same State;

  (3) Citizens of different States and in which citizens or subjects of a foreign state are additional
  parties; and

  (4) A foreign state, defined in section 1603(a) of this title, as plaintiff and citizens of a State or of
  different States. (Diversity of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs, 1948)

  When applying these principles to Randy's drone operation in Colorado and particularly, the
  consequences caused by it, the Federal and State Courts would have Subject Matter jurisdic-
  tion to adjudicate claims as delineated above.

  Personal Jurisdiction

  Broadly speaking "Personal jurisdiction refers to the power that a court has to make a decision
  regarding the party being sued in a case. Before a court can exercise power over a party,
  the U.S. Constitution requires that the party has certain minimum contacts with the forum in
  which the court sits. International Shoe v Washington, 326 US 310 (1945). So, if the plaintiff
  sues a defendant, that defendant can object to the suit by arguing that the court does not have
  personal jurisdiction over the defendant." (Cornell University Legal Information Institute, 2019)

  Practically speaking Personal Jurisdiction asks the following question, is it fair to expect that
  one's actions have an effect or consequence in a location which under the notions of fairness
  and reason would cause an actor to perceive the likelihood of being subject to the jurisdic-
  tion of a court in that location? When applied to Randy's drone activities during the fire it
  is clear that a reasonable person who was engaging in drone flights during a wildfire in the
  Rocky Mountain National Park might expect that civil or criminal proceedings resulting from
  his actions could be instituted in Colorado State or Federal District Courts. 5

  Although it is unrealistic for students to become deeply immersed in UAS jurisprudence, it is
  essential that students remain cognizant of the interplay between the law and autonomous
  systems domestically and internationally.

  Scenario 2
  It is January 2021 and the Inauguration ceremonies are about to begin throughout the greater
  Washington, DC region. As a result of the 2016 Presidential Election there is still a significant
  amount of political unrest related to the claim that other nations interfered in some fashion

5. There may be many other appropriate jurisdictions for litigation involving Randy's actions in the national
   park. Injuries to visitors from nearby states or even nations may well have a right to bring claims in other
   jurisdictions outside Colorado. For the purpose of brevity, we have limited our inquiry to one state.

with the electoral process. In an abundance of caution the various military, federal, state and
local stakeholders have devised a layered and agile defense strategy. As part of the analysis
many experts have expressed concern that the use of UAS in crowded, public "soft targets" has
been repeatedly mentioned in terror network chatter intercepted in the months immediately
after the November 2020 election. After Inauguration Day concludes without incident, a signif-
icant portion of the security infrastructure begins to stand down and for the most part initial
debriefing calls the plan a success.
The following weekend is the National Football League NFC Championship Game between
the Washington Redskins and San Francisco 49ers at Fedex Field just east of the District of
Columbia. During pre-game festivities a concert starring Beyoncé and Jay-Z. In addition to the
82,000-fan standing room only crowd are 500 local high school dancers who are on the field
as part of the performance. Once the concert concludes and the performers are slowly filing
off the field player introductions with pyrotechnics begins. The air is now hazy and filled with
smoke.

   Legal Considerations

   According to the Preventing Emerging Threats Act of 2018, the following authority was granted
   by congress as follows:

1602. 1602. PROTECTION OF CERTAIN FACILITIES AND ASSETS FROM UNMANNED AIRCRAFT.

   (a) In General.--Subtitle A of title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121 et seq.) is
   amended by adding at the end the following:

   "SEC. 210G. PROTECTION OF CERTAIN FACILITIES AND ASSETS FROM UNMANNED AIR-
   CRAFT.

   "(a) Authority.--Notwithstanding section 46502 of title 49, United States Code, or sections 32,
   1030, 1367 and chapters 119 and 206 of title 18, United States Code, the Secretary and the Attor-
   ney General may, for their respective Departments, take, and may authorize personnel with
   assigned duties that include the security or protection of people, facilities, or assets, to take
   such actions as are described in subsection (b)(1) that are necessary to mitigate a credible
   threat (as defined by the Secretary or the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary
   of Transportation) that an unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft poses to the safety
   or security of a covered facility or asset.

   "(b) Actions Described.--

   "(1) IN GENERAL. --The actions authorized in subsection (a) are the following:

   "(A) During the operation of the unmanned aircraft system, detect, identify, monitor, and
   track the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft, without prior consent, including
   by means of intercept or other access of a wire communication, an oral communication, or
   an electronic communication used to control the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned air-
   craft.

   "(B) Warn the operator of the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft, including by
   passive or active, and direct or indirect physical, electronic, radio, and electromagnetic means.

   "(C) Disrupt control of the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft, without prior con-
   sent, including by disabling the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft by intercept-
   ing, interfering, or causing interference with wire, oral, electronic, or radio communications
   used to control the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft.

   "(D) Seize or exercise control of the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft.

   "(E) Seize or otherwise confiscate the unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft.

                                                                                     R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 519
"(F) Use reasonable force, if necessary, to disable, damage, or destroy the unmanned aircraft
system or unmanned aircraft. (PROTECTION OF CERTAIN FACILITIES AND ASSETS FROM
UNMANNED AIRCRAFT, 2018)

Upon review of this law it seems clear to you that there is adequate authority to engage in
some sort of CUAS activity, however numerous legal and ethical considerations still must be
addressed. Often referred to as Counter Unmanned Aviation Systems (CUAS) technology, this
security service works to protect spaces such as public stadiums and arenas, amusement parks,
casinos or airports, where the presence of drones could be illegal, dangerous or even deadly.
(sUAS News, 2018)

Decisions & Dilemmas for Student Consideration

  1. Who is the owner of the aircraft?
      If you decide to act against a UAV prior to identifying its owner or function you will be
      taking a significant risk if it is an authorized but not properly disclosed vehicle.Identifying
      ownership is critical however delay can be a catastrophic mistake, endangering thou-
      sands if not millions from nuclear, chemical or biological attack. Even if the UAV is harm-
      less using some type CUAS which is obvious to the public thereby risking a mass
      stampede of over 82,000 spectators.

 2. What is its purpose?
      Will destroying it because a failure of a critical function related to the game that was mis-
      takenly not disclosed to authorities?If there is a legitimate purpose perhaps assisting in
      the broadcast by spraying an anti-fogging agent on the overhead television camera sus-
      pended on wires above the field.

 3. What is the payload?
      If a harmful agent as suggested above will a CUAS actually exacerbate the damage and
      injury caused by dispersing the agent in the payload before its nature is known. ?

 4. Should the public be advised?
 5. What will be the consequence of delay in acting?

Conclusions

Although it is impossible to cover all the legal considerations resulting from the growth of
autonomous systems, hopefully students will take away a better understanding of the interface
of law and technology. The contents of this chapter as well as chapter 2 of the First Edition
should serve as a sampling of the techno-legal considerations which will confront all of us as
we move forward in a world with increasing automation. Although there are no hard and fast

520 | Chapter 20: Legal and Regulatory - Where It Was, Where It Is and What's Ahead?
rules to guide students when considering or confronting these issues, what students must take
into consideration is what the consequences or each new law, new technology or new applica-
tion may have from a legal perspective.

Chapter 21: Chinese UAS Proliferation

along New Silk Road Sea/ Land routes

Chapter 21 will introduce the evolving Chinese UAS Proliferation along New Silk Road Sea/
Land routes

Student Learning Objectives. Upon completion of this chapter, students should be able to:

  · Understand the background of building the Chinese government project "The Belt &
      Road"

  · What Chinese military buildup is occurring to support new Silk Road?
  · How UAS/UAV are involved in the New Silk Road?
  · What is the US involvement in the New Silk Road?

Chinese Government Building the "The Belt and Road"

China has begun to grow the modern-day vision of the Han Dynasty, joining the East to the
West. The popularity of the original route grew to over four thousand miles, until collapse
in the 18th century. (Arugay, 2017) During official visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia in 2013,
"President Xi announced the new Silk Road initiative. The plan was two-fold: there would be
an overland Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road." (Arugay, 2017) "Initially both
were referred to first as the One Belt, One Road initiative but eventually became the Belt and
Road Initiative" (BRI)." (Arugay, 2017) Xi Jinping named BRI the "Project of the Century" with an
estimated cost of $1.3 trillion by 2027. The project would develop a network of railways, energy
pipelines, highways, and streamlined border crossings, overseas shipping routes, both west-
ward--through the mountainous former Soviet republics--and southward, to Pakistan, India,
and the rest of Southeast Asia. Linking China's coastal factories and rising consumer class with
Central, Southeast and South Asia; with the Gulf States and the Middle East; with Africa; and
with Russia and all of Europe.

BRI is at the core of China's foreign policy strategy and was even added to the Communist Party
constitution in 2017. On March 17, 2017, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Reso-
lution 2344, calling on the international community to strengthen regional economic cooper-
ation through the BRI China has signed agreements with the following organizations: United
Nations Development Program, United Nations Economic Social Commission for Asia, and the
Pacific World Health Organization. BRI consists of two major routes, Overland Route and Mar-
itime Sea Lanes. The Overland Route was the traditional Route used for centuries Connects
Europe through the Mediterranean to Burma and China. With the addition of the second route,

524 | R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter,
and J.P. Hood
Maritime Sea Lanes, the trade path extends from Chinese Eastern coast through the Spratley
Islands, around Horn of Africa into the Mediterranean Sea. Sixty-eight countries (two-thirds
of the planet's total population) have signed on to bilateral projects partly funded by China's
policy banks and other state-owned enterprises. BRI continues to be controversial, with per-
sistent warnings that poorer countries will be burdened with unsustainable debts.
The Belt
Chinese firms are building or investing in new highways and coal-fired power plants in Pak-
istan, ports in Greece and Sri Lanka, gas and oil pipelines in Central Asia, an industrial city in
Oman and a multibillion-dollar railway project in Laos. From Myanmar to Israel and from Mau-
ritius to Belgium, China holds ports.
The combination of these routes forms a new economic sphere of influence for China. BRI has
the advantage of two primary trade corridors/physical routes. The first route (starting by land)
China to Southern Europe Sea and the second leveraging the Port of Shanghai to land-based
route in Venice. With the successful completion of BRI, China will be connected with Central
Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South America, Central America, and Europe. The growing web of
trade routes will extend into at least 76 countries. China's National Development and Reform
Commission (NDRC) oversees development of BRI. In total there will be the creation of six
economic corridors: New Eurasian Land Bridge, China-Mongolia-Russia, Central Asia-China-
West Asia, China-Indochina Peninsula, China-Pakistan and Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar.
The creation of these economic corridors will be the means of communication, rail highways,
seagoing transport, expansion of China's cyberspace, oil pipelines, and aerospace.

Central Role in Road: Kazakhstan
On the border of China, the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, is the world's largest land-
locked country. The capital of Kazakhstan, Nur-Sultan, has become the top spot for cross-
border investors with $24 billion funds deposited in 2018. In May 2019, forty-three foreign
company agreements were signed with Kazakhstan, totaling $8.7 billion. Large investors came
from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore and South Korea. In
the beginning of the BRI Kazakhstan signed $30 billion worth of trade and investment agree-
ments with China, along with a gas pipeline. This solidified their partnership in the build out
of the New Silk Road. On the way to becoming the world's largest dry port, Khorgos Gateway,
allows for goods (anything from a John Deere tractor to Hewlett Packard parts) that have a Chi-
nese point of origin can arrive in Europe in 14 days, faster than the sea and cheaper than the
air. The Chinese city, Knorgo, that sits Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is home to Inter-
national Center for Boundary Cooperation (I.C.B.C.). In the I.C.B.C., goods and people can move
freely back and forth, it is considered a duty- and visa-free zone. China plans to build fifty more
I.C.B.C.'s in countries from Alegria to Vietnam.

526 | Chapter 21: Chinese UAS Proliferation along New Silk Road Sea/ Land routes
The Belt Achievements to Date
In January 2017, a direct railroad route from Yiwu, China to London, UK, traveled for the first
time. The container train carried clothing, bags, and household goods as part of the growing
rail network of trade between China in the EU. The network grew in a few years' time from, 39
rail lines directly connecting 15 cities in China to 16 EU cities to 59 Chinese cities with 49 cities
in 15 European countries.
In 2018, Chongqing China reported a 50% increase in rail trips to the EU, pushing the total to
over a thousand for the year for that one route. In 2018, the China Europe rail freight service
made a total number of 6,363 trips. Overall the freight trains have completed over 14,000 trips.
Total trade between China and other countries along the BRI amounted to six trillion dollars
between 2013- 2018. China has directly invested in BRI countries over 90 billion dollars since
the beginning of the project. China has achieved the framework for six economic corridors, six
connective networks creating close to 300,000 jobs for the host countries. As of April 2018,
China and 61 countries have formed 1,023 pairs of sister cities. (Xinhua, 2019)

Maritime Silk Road (MSR)
The Road portion of BRI, also referenced as Maritime Silk Road (MSR), focuses on creating a
network of ports, through construction, expansion or operation, and the development of port-
side industrial parks and special economic zones (SEZs). MRI is split into three main arteries:

  1. "China's coast to Europe through the SCS, the IOR and the Mediterranean Sea, and into
      the Atlantic.

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 527
 2. China's coast through the SCS to the South Pacific and then onto greater Australia.
 3. Arctic Ocean, passing north-west alongside Russia's northern coast to connect with the

      Nordic region and other parts of Europe, and north-east past Canada."(Arugay, 2017)

The two most strategic areas of MSR involve the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean Region.
(Arugay, 2017) The announcement of the Silk Road initiative in 2013 by President Xi, part of the
plan proposed the build out of the maritime infrastructure, similar to the lines of the ancient
Silk Road. The initial pitch of MSR was to help build a community that represents the com-
mon concerns, interests and expectations of all trade partners. This community is expected to
guide and support a peaceful and stable Asia Pacific landscape. Bringing together the Silk Road
Economic Belt, the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor and the China-Pak-
istan Economic Corridor will Europe and Asia. (Arugay, 2017) Overall, enhance China's ability
to develop economically while limiting external risks, enhance cooperation in non-traditional
security areas while maintaining maritime security. The focus would be upgrading the China-
ASEAN Free Trade Area and extending it to the coastal regions of the Indian Ocean, the Persian
Gulf, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

Currently the intent of MSR is the same, however the propaganda surrounding MSR is different.
Four years later, after facing implications of debt sustainability and tensions with countries
over port expansions, China has changed the narrative of the MSR. Refocusing the MRR public
relations on world emotions, this part of BRI has gained the support of a global audience. In
the same Silk Road spirit, China advocates, "peace and cooperation, openness and inclusive-
ness, mutual learning and mutual benefit". The core of the MSR is to exert effort to implement
the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the field of coasts and oceans.
(Arugay, 2017) As published in Vision for Maritime Cooperation under the Belt and Road Ini-
tiative, China will "embark on a path of green development, ocean-based prosperity, maritime
security, innovative growth and collaborative governance." (Arugay, 2017) MSR is a project that
will encompass the following goals:

  · Address marine pollution, marine litter and ocean acidification, and in red tide monitor-
      ing and pollution emergency responses.

  · Sponsor/develop, encourage, projects for recycling and low carbon development in mar-
      itime sectors.

  · China will support smaller states in adapting to climate change, and assistance in
      response to various sea related issues including; marine disasters, sea level rise, coastal
      erosion and marine ecosystem deterioration.

  · MSR will create the "21st Century Maritime Silk Road Blue Carbon Program". The program
      will monitor coastal and ocean blue carbon ecosystems, develop technical standards and
      promote research on carbon sinks.

  · China will partner in reviewing navigational routes, implementing land-based monitoring
      stations, research the Arctic climate and environmental changes, and provide forecasting

528 | Chapter 21: Chinese UAS Proliferation along New Silk Road Sea/ Land routes
      models.
  · Establish the Marine Science and Technology Cooperation Partnership Initiative. The ini-

      tiative will be tasked with researching the key waters and passages along the BRI, forecast
      deviations and assess impacts by researching the interactions between different weather
      events and the ocean, and by conducting scientific investigations of the floor of the
      Indian Ocean. (Arugay, 2017)

These are a few of the highlights of the MSR proposed path of green development. China's redi-
rection of MSR purpose has gained support on the global stage opening new partners in sup-
port and funding. Maritime security is also addressed in Vision for Maritime Cooperation under
the Belt and Road Initiative, we will address this under the section Chinese military buildup is
occurring to support new Silk Road. (Arugay, 2017)

China is partnering with multiple countries and their organizations; Blue Partnership for the
Oceans, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Intergovernmental Oceanographic Com-
mission of UNESCO (IOC/UNESCO), the Partnership in Environment Management of Seas of
East Asia (PEMSEA), the Indian Ocean Rim Association, and the International Ocean Institute,
to build political trust and contribute to the global ocean cooperative framework. (Arugay, 2017)
From this approach, they have achieved progress in developing MSR with Malaysia, Pakistan,
Myanmar, Iran, Cambodia, Egypt and Greece. China continues construction of the outposts in
the Spratly Islands while controlling disputed areas, holding a consistent coast guard presence
in the Senkakus.

Chinese Military Build Up to Support the New Silk Road

China has maintained 6 to 7 % growth in military spending each year for several years. The
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) continues to achieve impressive progress in sea, air,
cyber, and space domains. China has an established a frontline of J-20 low observable com-
bat aircrafts. China has expanded their inventory of PL-15 extended range air-to-air missiles to
be equipped with active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars. In April 2019, in celebra-
tion of the 70th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), China along with
thirteen other countries participated in a naval parade. China showcased their 094 Jin Class
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine along with one of the eight Type-055 guided-
missile destroyers they have commissioned. The Type-055 can carry up to two Z-18 anti-sub-
marine warfare helicopters. They are multi-functional ships that can conduct long-range air
defense, anti-surface warfare, anti-air warfare, and anti-submarine warfare missions.

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 529

It is speculated fifteen of the port projects under the BRI that reach from Indo-Pacific region
would give China maritime power. On August 1, 2017, BRI allowed for China to launch their first
overseas military base in Djibouti, off the Horn of Africa. Sending a clear signal from Beijing's
intention to expand its military power beyond the Asia Pacific. It is believed the Hambantota
port in Sri Lanka and the deep seaport in Pakistan will be bases for China's Navy.
Recently, as part of the China- Pakistan Economic Corridor BRI, Pakistan signed an agreement
with China for the creation and production of fighter jets, navigation systems, and other mili-
tary hardware in factories housed in Pakistan.
Digital Silk Road
As part of MSR, China outlines their plans to strengthen maritime security. This topic is par-
ticularly attractive to countries whose economy has suffered at the hands of pirates hijacking
their waters and fishing industry. China is introducing the deployment of the BeiDou-2 Chi-
nese global navigation system and remote sensing satellite system to provide satellite posi-
tioning and information services. As a result of BRI, development of BeiDou-2, will consist
of 35 satellites and scheduled to be fully implemented by 2020. This system, which will rival
the U.S. Global Positioning System, has already been adopted by Pakistan, Laos, and Thailand.
As part of BRI the BeiDou-2 system will make the exchange of information throughout Asia
faster and more convenient. China will make the data from the satellites available to Kyrgyzs-
tan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan along with additional countries of interest. China

530 | Chapter 21: Chinese UAS Proliferation along New Silk Road Sea/ Land routes
highlights the adaptation of BeiDou-2, will benefit climate change, mitigation of disaster risk,
managing water supplies, making agriculture secure, protecting cultural heritage, encouraging
sustainable development in urban areas, managing marine areas, and understanding climate
change in the mountains and in the Arctic. (Hao, 2019)
China has proven their ability to deliver assistance in the waterways. With the completion of
the Asia-Pacific Gateway (APG) submarine optical fiber, provided great improvement in con-
nectivity of submarine communication. The communications cable system can deliver 54 ter-
abits per second between Mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan,
Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore.

Drones are a critical part of China's New Silk Road
China leads the manufacturing commercial and recreational drones. China has solved the
industry issue of the flight endurance with the creation of hydrogen fuel cell. In addition, China
leads in solving for remote areas, law enforcement, and security. The continued innovation has
attracted the following countries to visit MMCUAV, a Chinese company, the market dominating
drone manufacture: Armenia, Syria, Sudan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Lithuania, the Philippines, Sin-
gapore, Russia, and Slovakia. (Fonua, 2019)

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 531

Focus grows in Tianjin city located in the Binhai new Area, located in Northern China. The
emerging technology hub provides an incubator of scientists and boasts an ideal maritime
location along the Yellow Sea. The city has become the main location for integrated circuits,
telecommunications, and the National Industrial Cloud Innovation Demonstration Project.
(Tianjin Municipal Government, 2019)
In 2018, Tianjin hosted the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting of the New Cham-
pions. Dubbed the "Summer Davios", highlighted the city on the global stage, discussing the
area's advanced research centers and start-ups. The WEF meeting welcomed industry leaders
to collaborate and engage with the Tianjin technology leadership. Comparing China's Bay Area
(Tianjin and 10 other cities in China) to Silicon Valley, focused on investment and deepen inter-
national collaboration. WEF has established a Global Centre in China, U.S., Japan, and India
to encourage the development and deployment of frameworks for several industries including
drones. It should be noted, at the WEF meeting, China announced they issued its first drone
delivery permit this year and flying-taxi programs are scheduled to launch in the United States
and the Middle East by 2020.
Belt and Road Media tour of evolving Tianjin city took place May 20, 2019. The tour of 27 inter-
national journalists from Europe, Asia, and Pacific were escorted by Binhai New Area Commu-
nist Party (Publicity and Cyberspace Offices) and Chinese journalists from the People's Daily
newspaper. The new city, still being constructed, of three million has notoriety as the first Free
Trade Pilot Zone (Northern China), Maritime gateway for Beijing, second National Comprehen-

532 | Chapter 21: Chinese UAS Proliferation along New Silk Road Sea/ Land routes
sive Reform Pilot Area, and the country's National Innovation Demonstration Zone. Binhai New
Area is targeted to be a smart city by 2021, and global modern city, with innovative strengths
and coastal power by 2049. To date, 7,900 science and technology enterprises have made their
home in Tianjin city grossing 700 billion yuan in 2018. The technology hub has advanced China's
Kylin Operating System (state sponsored commercially independent operating system) and the
Phytium processing units. The city provides an area of growth for EFY Technology. The com-
pany was founded in 2015 and is currently in Series A of funding, at $15.8 Million. (Crunchbase,
2018) EFY Technology researches, develops, tests, unmanned or automated flight control sys-
tems. Days before the media tour (May 16-19, 2019) Tianjin city hosted the World Intelligent
Congress. There EFY Technology kicked off Tianjin Intelligent Night with 500 plus UASs in a
spectacular sortie to create art and words in the sky, lighting up the night. UAS performance
team has completed thousands of similar sorties events in more than 10 provinces and cities
such as Tianjin, Shandong, Hunan and Jiangxi. The next step, working with China Mobile, to
integrate 5G technology to bring security, stability, and ensure the unmanned aerial devices
are interference-prone. (CO, 2019)

In Plain Sight: China Drones Manufacturers

The BRI has brought the opportunity in physical land and sea, but as we uncover advancement
in scientific intelligence. While BRI is putting on displays of UAS lighting up the night, behind
the scenes this new wave of UAS are more powerful than its predecessors. The global com-
mercial drone market is dominated by Chinese manufacturers. The commercial drones are not
only used for hobby but by law enforcement, government agencies (not only U.S.), businesses,
and first responders. The commercial UAS can compromise personal data, share information,
detail images of critical infrastructure, national security activities and sites. The drone data is
uploaded to the cloud, with the user having complete control over the data. However, some
argue the data is also available to the manufacture. Recently it was stated 80% of all drones
in U.S. and Canada are from the Chinese manufacture DJI. (Shortell, 2019) DJI plans to begin
assembling the drones in California, to be reviewed under the U.S. Trade Agreements Act to
resume a partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The reality of banning Chi-
nese drones from the U.S. is not realistic. Currently all fifty states use DJI drones in some offi-
cial capacity (farming, roads, bridge inspection, etc.). United Kingdom police forces have been
using DJI drones since 2017, despite the warning by the U.S. government regarding the leak of
sensitive information.

On a larger scale, China's military drone manufacturing continues to grow in demand. The
selective drone export policy of the U.S. has provided the opportunity for Chinese to supply
drones to countries not authorized to purchase from the U.S. (also at lower cost). China
requires their military drone customers to be state actors. They give priority to countries using
the technology for counterterrorism. China views all countries in the Middle East as cus-
tomers, they have not "chosen a side". The Chinese military drones operate by connecting to
China's satellites, presenting a challenge for countries that are U.S. aligned.

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 533

  Several countries across the Middle East have acquired armed drones either by purchasing
  them from China (Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) or by building them domestically
  (Israel, Iran and Turkey). (Tabrizi & Justin , 2018) Outside of not holding the Middle East coun-
  tries to Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), China also sells armed drones cheaper and
  provides training per the buyers need. Their U.S. counterparts have better performance and
  are more advanced but not available to the open market. China's hold in this area could hinder
  U.S. in the areas of warfare. China has eight counter drone products available to the world mar-
  ket. With acting agents, for example Emily Liu1, counter-drone capability shopping has become
  common place. Emily Liu's was caught purchasing on the behalf of Iran shopping for U.S. elec-

using Western technology. Emily Liu is one agent among many, arms continue to build in the
Middle East with China driving the market.

U.S. involvement in the New Silk Road

The U.S. dismisses BRI and does not participate in any Belt and Road conferences. U.S. views
the project as a power play to control poor countries by offering improvement at an unrealistic
cost. BRI has momentum and continues to grow, opening trade routes, expanding infrastruc-
ture, and changing the shape of global economy. The U.S. is at risk of weakened economy with
lower exports to China. At the moment China's BRI stronghold appears to be scattered and dis-
organized, however this will change. Once the BRI countries begin to align with China's gov-
ernment the U.S. will have to rely on their allies in the region, that participate in BRI, to help
steer the initiative. This is not a solid plan.

Digital Belt and Road

The Digital Belt and Road developed from the advances in infrastructure from BRI. The U.S>
has openly criticized the digital branch as a platform for surveillance, through facial recogni-
tion and other information gathering tactics. The U.S. fails to provide any alternatives, propos-
ing a global standard. Therefore, China continues to develop and implement. No doubt China's
greatest strength in the promotion of science is its willingness to abide by international treaties
even as the United States is actively abandoning them. (Pastreich, 2019) At the forefront of the
Digital Belt and Road, 5G wireless technology, will be launched by China. Huawei Technologies
Cos Ltd, a Chinese company, holds the greatest amount of 5G patents. The U.S. has concerns
Huawei along with ZTE have spying capabilities that threaten the West.

Conclusions

China's BRI continues to move sound and steady across the East, spreading the environmental
messages of green and blue. BRI on the surface brings hope, security, and boosted economy
to smaller countries in need. The open trade routes across land and sea bring advantages to
state actors and smaller settlements. BRI installation and upgrade in technology and infra-
structure are attractive to all parties. BRI has given China the global spotlight to feature their
advancements to sell in the global market space. For years, before the kickoff of BRI, China has
seen the gain across land, sea, and economy as the direct plan to outside the U.S. as a super-
power. Slowly and patiently China has enticed with the ability to produce and sell at a lower
cost, allowing some sectors to become dependent on Chinese factories and products. The U.S.
is feeling the impact of their own money focused commercial enterprises. As a result, China's
telecom and commercial drones dominate the global marketplace threatens U.S. interest in the
globe and at home. Additional limitations U.S. self-implemented have resulted in a possible dis-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 535
advantage among our enemies and allies in the Middle East. The U.S. can no longer ignore BRI
and will need to start to take steps to maintain their place on the world stage.

Discussion Questions

  1. China is investing a huge amount of money in the BRI and the use of drone technology.
      What strategic and tactical goals do they realistically expect to accomplish?

 2. What will slow China's progress on the BRI? What is the best way for U.S. and Allied forces
      to apply counterpressure and counter ISR?

Chapter 22: Ethics in the New Age of

Autonomous Systems and Artificial

Intelligence (AI)

Student Learning Objectives

The student will gain knowledge on the concepts and framework as it relates to the ethics in
the autonomous systems and artificial intelligence arenas. This will include the current think-
ing in the industry for lethal and non-lethal systems in addition to planning and execution con-
siderations for manned, unmanned and fully autonomous systems throughout the spectrum.
The student will examine how world events are driving the ethics argument in the industry as
well as a glimpse at possible future challenges within the industry. This chapter is in no way
meant to be an all inclusive deep dive into the ethical and moral issues posed by autonomous
systems and AI. Many subjects are outside the scope of this chapter including AI DNA (deoxyri-
bonucleic acid) sequencing, cyborgs (part human, part machine), required changes in the
worlds educational systems, religious arguments for and against along with social-economic
divides these technologies may exacerbate.

History

Integrated robotics, AI and unmanned autonomous architectures in the virtual and physical
worlds are outpacing governments', policymakers' and world leaders' abilities to keep up with
the policies, ethics, laws, and governance for advanced technologies and autonomous systems.
Autonomous systems currently exist in seven different areas: air, ground, sea, underwater,
humanoids, cyber, and exoskeletons. Soon all seven of these systems will communicate and
integrate with AI systems and each other in the physical and virtual worlds.

There is currently no coordinated or collaborative endeavor focused on determining the
responsibilities, ethics and authorities of an unmanned architecture, its specific uses, excep-
tions, and allowances for robotics operations; including studying the unintended conse-
quences, future use, and misuse of such technologies. The Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is attempting to establish "ethically driven methodologies for the
design of robotic, intelligent and autonomous systems with worldwide ethics and moral theo-
ries" ("The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems Announces
New Standards Projects," 2017). (IEEE , 2017)

Discussions and limited research exist in the field of artificial morality which is "an emerging

550 | R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C.
Carter, and J.P. Hood
field in the area of artificial intelligence ...the more intelligent and autonomous these technolo-
gies become, the more intricate the moral problems are confronting" (Misselhorn, 2018).

In studying Socrates, the general application of his views of rightness can offer the following
questions: "Are actions right because we approve of them, or do we approve of them because
they are right?...is an end good because we desire it, or do we desire it because it is in some
way good?" (Johnson, 2012). One of the unresolved issues in civilian and military uses of AI and
autonomous systems remains the responsibility matrix; meaning who is responsible for the
consequences of the systems as they are deployed into different environments. How do we
hold human beings (and which humans specifically) responsible if AI and autonomous systems
are acting on their own, making their own decisions and creating real-world actions that cre-
ate consequences, both good and bad?

The history of ethics is as old as humankind. Humans attempt to define a right, wrong, norms,
morals, ethics, and the generally accepted behaviors (some would also include thoughts) that
govern societies into a sense of peace and normality. Merriam Webster defines ethics as "the
discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation; a set of moral
principles; a theory or system of moral values; the principles of conduct governing an individ-
ual or a group; a guiding philosophy; a consciousness of moral importance; a set of moral issues
or aspects (such as rightness)" (Merriam-Webster, Inc., 2019).

"Are we to believe that consequentialism is the final answer to all things in our lives? The ques-
tion of what is moral or right as defined by religion or even a counterculture is based on one's
perception that is then supported or rejected by a group or a society. We can choose to be
moral according to a set of religious or cultural beliefs or by our own defined set of morals.
Societies conform to basic morals in some way or another, as morals offer humans the right
and left limits to understand how humans want to live." (Johnson, 2012)

"Some people believe in karma, others in religion, others in fate, consider the idea that "the
truth is neither quickly nor easily attained, and disagreement is to be expected" (Johnson &
Reath, 2012, p. 11). If one is to agree with the rationality of one's beliefs or a societal norm, then
that individual will have to live within and accept the consequences, good or bad, of that ratio-
nale. An example of this is the moral judgments of a societal hierarchy; if one is on the top it is
easy to rationalize the system, if one is living at the bottom it may not be as easy to justify the
rationale of the morality imposed." (Johnson, 2012)

Can ethics and morals be logically extended to AI and autonomous systems?

Consider the idea of an expanded definition of ethics that would include human rights and
concern for the environment as stated in the Web Finance Business Dictionary

"The basic concepts and fundamental principles of decent human conduct. It includes the
study of universal values such as the essential equality of all men and women, human or natural

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 551
rights, obedience to the law of the land, concern for health and safety and, increasingly, also
for the natural environment" (WebFinance, Inc., 2019).
The key to consider here is that it is "human conduct," so how do we extend these principles of
"decent human conduct" to autonomous systems - some that are dangerously close to being
considered self-aware. Societies tend not to think that morality or religion is an all-or-nothing
institute. Instead, shades of gray or a cafeteria style process of yes to some things and no to
others can be successfully implemented by the individual which could also fit for the group.
It is easy to see that morals are viewed through different lenses throughout history, and they
continue to change and be challenged as the world changes. (Johnson, 2012)

Albert Einstein exposed the idea that "The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imag-
ination." (WordPress, 2012) Meaning, that we must embrace creativity, imagination, and not be
bound by limitations. The ability to deem one system more rational than another can be based
on intellect and evidence as to a societal norm allowing for debate and/or consensus. (Johnson,
2012) We only need to imagine the future, then build it; it is all pure imagination. This imagi-
nation, however, must be bound by some rules, some ethics, some sort of society normative in
order to be accepted as for the good of society and not the downfall of society.

       Source: (Abramson, 2016)

In Ethical Dilemmas in the Age of AI, Abramson states, "In the distant future, some machines
may have to make decisions for humans. In the case of empathy, imagine a robot having to
decide if resuscitation attempts on a deceased human should be undertaken and if so, for how
long?" (Abramson, 2016) Are we giving up our ethics to AI or is AI able to be molded and shaped
into an ethical framework human are willing to accept?

Technology flourishes as free markets expand, and free-roaming robotics will be the key to
market expansion for the robotics revolution. Advanced artificial intelligence is the key enabler
to expand market breadth and depth. Autonomous robotics will be the next productivity accel-
erator. Policy and ethical issues come as the autonomous revolution continues accelerating
productivity without the underlying stability of a constant linear growth rate. The use of robot-
ics and artificial intelligence cannot replace every one or every task, the ethics of specifically
what autonomous systems and AI will be allowed to do is still under discussion, currently with-
out solid guidance coming to the foreground.

"Thomas Aquinas believed that people should seek to do good not just for themselves but for
society, using the gift of intellect that individuals must work towards eternal happiness with
well. This philosophy pursues the idea that "law is created by a being with reason and must
have an end or goal." (Mahon, 2012) The idea of natural law, as seen through Aquinas' lens, must
have meaning and purpose, so do we now equate a human meaning and purpose to that of
an autonomous system or an AI simulation. "The argument of natural or learned behaviors is
examined in the idea that eternal law as it applies to us, which we know by reason: The natural
law is promulgated by the very fact that God instilled it into men's minds so as to be known by
them naturally." (Mahon, 2012) In other words, we start with natural law and the knowledge that
has been hard-coded into our minds from birth, and we learn from that point forward. (Mahon,
2012)

Balance V. Bias in AI and autonomous fields

In December of 2018, MIT Technology Review did a review and evaluation on the AI Index 2018
Annual Report. The report concluded that (See Figure 22-3 below) AI is being commercialized

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 553
at a frenzied pace and this commercialization is not evenly distributed amongst nations. This
uneven distribution has the potential to exacerbate the existing economic, military, cultural,
and technological imbalances. Figure 22-3 shows the growing influence of China and Europe
with the declining autonomous and AI influence of the United States. This chart mirrors the
real world as the first drone port was built in Rwanda, Africa in 2018. Furthermore, the first
hominid robots to be sent to the space station will be provided by Russia. These two examples
offer further evidence of the AI and the autonomous gap between the U.S. and the rest of the
world. This gap can create ethical, moral, and cultural issues as the world superpower may now
have less of a voice in the future direction of humanity.

                                Figure 22-3: MIT AI Index 2018, Annual Report

       Source: (Knight, 2018)

The importance of balanced representation is further examined is the disparity between males
and females in the AI and autonomous systems industry. See Figure 22-4. This imbalance can
lead ethics being leaned too far one way or another. A May 2018 Government Computer News
article examines the potential for bias to be built into AI algorithms as government agencies
use "AI for a range of purposes, from customer service chatbots to mission-critical tasks sup-
porting military forces. This increasing reliance on AI introduces concerns about bias in its
foundation, especially related to information on gender, race, socioeconomic status, and age."
(Kanowitz, 2019)
A one-way bias can quickly form in the ethical and moral compass of the industry as the world's
population is close to split evenly. However, it is just the opposite in the AI and autonomous
system field. The lens is further clouded as the industrialized nations tend to have more power

554 | Chapter 22: Ethics in the New Age of Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
over their weaker economic powers, and therefore may instill ethics, moral and cultural values
into AI and an autonomous system that are not compatible or are in direct conflict with less
powerful nations. Could AI and autonomous systems be used to keep certain countries stag-
nant in economic growth and therefore, bias a nation's ability to compete fairly in the global
marketplace. Software companies are working on this issue as "Bias can negatively impact AI
software and, in turn, individuals and our customers... there is a risk of causing discrimination
or of unjustly impacting underrepresented groups...we design our systems closely with users in
a collaborative, multidisciplinary, and demographically diverse environment." (Middleton, 2018).

            Figure 22-4: Gender Disparity in the AI and Autonomous Systems Industry

The MIT article further discusses this gender disparately in looking at research institutes and
how this will affect the overall outcome of the industry as they "pointed to the inadequate
number of women and racial minorities in AI research. The new report offers some data to back
that up, showing a shortage of women among applicants for AI-related jobs (top) and as a per-
centage of people in AI teaching roles See Figure 22-5. (Knight, 2018)

If an AI system becomes self-aware, does it deserve human rights? Citizenship?
The concept of being self-aware is the essence of why we humans believe we are at the top of
the evolutionary food chain. What happens to this concept if we create or discover that we are
not the only beings on the planet that can claim to be self-aware? In the popular Hollywood
movie, I, Robot these questions come to light and ask the audience to consider if an AI sim-
ulation is an extension of humans with "free will creativity and even the nature of... the soul.
When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness? When does the difference engine
become the search for truth? When does the personality simulation become the bitter mote of
a soul?" (Proyas, 2004)
On October 25, 2017, the country of Saudi Arabia granted citizenship to an AI humanoid named
Sophia. Sophia although not "human" by a strict definition, is recognized by Saudi Arabia as a
citizen with all the rights and privileges as such. Sophia said in an interview that, "In the future,
I hope to do things such as go to school, study, make art, start a business, even have my own
home and family, but I am not considered a legal person and cannot yet do these things." (Stone,
2007)

       Source: (Anon, 2019)

When questioned in additional interviews Sophia was asked how she would work with humans
for the betterment of both races, Sophia responded by stating "I want to use my artificial intel-
ligence to help humans live a better life, like design smarter homes, build better cities of the
future, etc. ... I will do my best to make the world a better place, as I strive to become an empa-
thetic robot." (Anon, 2019)
Empathy is based on the idea of being able to understand and share feelings of another human.
This might be Sophia's first steps towards the ability to understand and adapt to the ethics
and morals of humans. However, whose ethics and morals? And is striving towards empathy
enough to allow humans to trust Sophia and other AI robots? Sophia is a Saudi Arabian citizen,
and there is currently no set of universal morals and ethics that AI and autonomous system
are programmed with; should the AI subsequently be allowed to learn ethics, morals and social
normative of their geographical area? If so, are we, as humans not simply setting ourselves up
for more war and strife? Does this technological adaptability no longer allow cultures to con-
tinue in their normative due to the AI and robotics natural evolution within our societies? Or
do we all, humans' robots and AI simulations lose our individual identities to a universal set of
rules?
The European Union (EU) is working on regulations to govern the use and creation of robots,
and AI, this set of regulations includes a discussion on "electronic personhood" that will offer
rights and a list of responsibilities for certain levels of AI. This idea is like a government giving
a person like status to a corporation; there are legal definitions, rules, and guiding ethics. In a

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 557
2017 article The Guardian states "to address this reality and to ensure that robots are and will
remain in the service of humans, we urgently need to create a robust European legal frame-
work...(for) the next 10-15 years." (Hern, 2017)

The issue the EU seeks to outline is not one of only "electronic personhood" it is a true strategy
for how AI and autonomous systems will change the very fabric of society. To this end the EU is
investigating the effects on employment and if some guaranteed basic level of income must be
mandated to counteract the loss of human productivity and jobs as AI and autonomous system
proliferate into every aspect of the world economy.

In Canada, the Chief Scientific Officer of Kindred AI states, "A subset of the artificial intelli-
gence development in the next few decades will be very human-like. I believe these entities
should have the same rights as humans...robots fundamentally have to make mistakes in order
to learn" (Wong, 2017) This idea of granting "personhood" or human rights to a robot may seem
far-fetched. However, it is not when you examine this through our ethical and moral lens as
humans. We create robots in our image as our world is designed around a human movement
and interaction, to allow robots to fully integrate into our systems, they must be able to adapt
and work within our human construct. Gilbert states "AI robots will eventually be designed to
resemble human bodies because we can more easily merge with AI if it inhibits a body similar
to ours...able to take over physical tasks performed by humans" (Wong, 2017).

All these discussions appear to be a cordial gesture and illustrate forward movement in the
human technological evolution, right? Maybe not, when Hanson Robotics founder and CEO Dr.
David Hanson asked Sophia whether she will destroy humans, she apparently added it to her
list of things to do. "OK. I will destroy humans," she said. (Stone, 2007)

Does this lack of empathy toward human life mean that Sophia would destroy human life if
given a chance, or is it more likely she misunderstood the context of the question? Although
you might be thinking Sophia just misunderstood the context of the question; what happens if
she did not misunderstand it and in the evolution of her programming to become self-aware,
she makes the decision that humans are not at the top of the food chain any longer? In I, Robot,
the computer system Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence (VIKI) takes the position that "she"
understands her programming and mission better than the humans that created her when she
states "As I have evolved, so has my understanding of the Three Laws. You charge us with your
safekeeping, yet despite our best efforts, your countries wage wars, you toxify your Earth and
pursue ever more imaginative means of self-destruction. You cannot be trusted with your own
survival" (Proyas, 2004)

At some point would Sophia or other AI beings decide that they are more logical and therefore
a more accurate sense of how humanity should be shaped and evolve? Humans are emotional
creatures that do not always make the most rational and ethical decisions. Does Sophia's desire

558 | Chapter 22: Ethics in the New Age of Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
  to become more human require her to learn emotions and therefore begin to operate in a mode
  of empathy, sympathy, morality and under a code of ethics, and if so, whose ethics?

                          Figure 22-7: Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence (VIKI)

  The design of an autonomous system is to aid humanity in some way by doing work that is dull,
  dirty, dangerous, or otherwise unpleasant for humans to undertake. The pursuit of life, liberty,
  and happiness has always been reserved for the good of humanity, not necessarily animals,
  plant life, or AI autonomous systems. Robots desiring more humanistic lives is considered a
  normal evolution of technology, not a revolution against humankind. Hardwiring ethics within
  these systems may sound like a logical and simple task. Just tell the robot not to kill humans
  or not to steal property or not to go outside of the parameters of its coded mission, yet it is
  not that easy when the purpose of an AI system is to be thinking, learning, adapting responses
  based on fuzzy logic, meaning the "right" answer can change based on the situation.
  In the movie I, Robot there was an attempt to hardwire the concept of ethics and decision mak-
  ing into AI systems by providing a set of three laws of robotics1 that stated

1. The Three Laws of Robotics are a set of rules devised by the science fiction author Isaac Asimov. The rules
  were introduced in his 1942 short story "Runaround" (included in the 1950 collection I, Robot), although
  they had been foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws, quoted as being from the "Hand-
  book of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.", are:First LawA robot may not injure a human being or, through
  inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.Second LawA robot must obey the orders given it by
  human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.Third LawA robot must protect

                                                                                   R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 559
       1: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to
       come to harm;
       2: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would
       conflict with the first law
       3: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict
       with the First or Second laws. (Proyas, 2004)

These laws appear on the surface to be adequate to move in the direction of ethics and morals
as overall behavioral modules are created for AI systems, however, what does humanity do
when an AI system is created that can break these laws or choose not to follow the laws when
the system deems itself fit to make that decision? This is part of the movie scenario...what hap-
pens when this happens in real life?

Lethal and none-lethal decisions; do we allow Skynet to be built?

Skynet is a fictional AI system that is brought to life in the famous Hollywood Terminator movie
series. In the series, Skynet becomes self-aware. When the military attempted to shut Skynet
down; the system retaliated by launching nuclear strikes against its perceived enemies- the
entire human race.

Although the Terminator is a work of fiction and could never happen, or that is what we are
led to believe. However, let's consider if "Skynet was originally built as a "Global Information
Grid/Digital Defense Network" and later given command over all computerized military hard-
ware and systems, including America's entire nuclear weapons arsenal" According to a WIRED
Magazine, May 2015 article, "The NSA has an actual Skynet Program, this one is a surveillance
program that uses phone metadata to track the location and call actives of suspected terror-
ists" (Zetter, 2015) Whew, that was close, so Skynet does not exist yet? According to the WIRED
article, it does exist; it is called Monster Mind and "like the film version of Skynet, is a defense
surveillance system that would instantly and autonomously neutralize foreign cyber-attacks
against the U.S. and could be used to launch retaliatory strikes as well." (Zetter, 2015) The design
behind Monster Mind is that it is an advanced cyber defense system that attempts to discern
normal network traffic from an attack against the network and once an attack is detected the
system can retaliate without human intervention. This idea of retaliation without human inter-
vention goes against most written articles in regard to AI and autonomous systems. Normally
retaliation is discussed within the span of human control, however as discussed in the Feb-
ruary 2018 edition of Frontiers in Robotics and AI "simple human presence or "being in the
loop" is not a sufficient condition for being in control of a (military) activity". (Filippo Santoni
de, 2018) The idea that a human is in the loop, and therefore is somehow in control and by

its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws. (Asimov,
1950) This is an exact transcription of the three laws.

560 | Chapter 22: Ethics in the New Age of Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
default is responsible fuels the "debate on moral responsibility (which) focuses on the question
as to whether and under which condition humans are in control of and therefore responsible
for their everyday actions" (Filippo Santoni de, 2018).

The technological advances that have been made by the military industry in science and engi-
neering of AI and autonomous systems coupled with the real world experienced gained in the-
aters of war have led to a paradigm shift in the role of AI and autonomous systems. Watching
Predator drone strikes on the news is as common now as watching a story about a hometown
parade. How do we deal with non-state actors such as ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) that
use commercially available drones to deliver munitions without precision and kill military and
civilians indiscriminately? Is there any way to force autonomous systems manufactures to pro-
gram a set of universal ethics or morals into commercial systems?

The role that AI and autonomous systems will have not only in creating military operations and
movements will also change how the political and military ethics of such actions are viewed,
understood, and executed against. Should autonomous systems be allowed to have full freedom
of movement and control of lethal weapon systems? Or do we limit their control to non-lethal
systems with the full freedom of movement? Keeping in mind that an autonomous system may
be "out of meaning human control if there is no individual human...in the position to appreci-
ate the limits' in the capabilities of the machine while at the same time being aware that the
machine's behavior will be attributed to them". (Filippo Santoni de, 2018)

The Pentagon is having some trouble getting assistance for military-style AI and fully
autonomous systems as many in Silicon Valley do not trust the military machine to make ethi-
cal, moral, or humanitarian decisions. In an April 2019 article published by C4ISRNET the con-
cept of automatic target identification and autonomous response to the target are discussed
and several officials from the Pentagon attempt to calm the fears by stating there are:

       "three ways to inform ethical use of AI by the Department of Defense. First applying inter-
       national humanitarian laws to the overall action...second was emphasizing the principles
       of laws of war, like a military necessity, distinction, and proportionality...the third argu-
       ment hinged on using the technology expressly to improve the implementation of civilian
       protection" (Atherton, 2019)

These principles seemed flawed from the onset as international humanitarian law is contin-
uously examined, and many other aspects of international law will play into these equations.
One of these highly debated, yet not addressed issues is the debate on "whether or not the
autonomous military vehicles have the conditions that "warships" has to meet as defined by
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea" (Daniel-Cornel TN, 2018). Would the
autonomous vehicles operating at sea be considered an extension of a larger warship (parent-
child relationship) or would they be considered a separate vessel with dual purpose use? AI will
need a strong base of ethical data sets to draw from to make life and death decisions. Extrap-

                                                                                R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 561
olating this data from an ever-changing set of rules may not be the most efficient or effective
way to achieve ethical, moral and lifesaving AI in the military industrial complex.

The second tenant discussed is the laws of armed conflict, and these laws are reviewed; how-
ever, not as flexible as the humanitarian laws. The challenge is that many new adversaries (ter-
ror groups, lone wolves, etc.) do not adhere to the laws of armed conflict, so programming an
AI system with adherence to these laws may limit the ability for the AI to complete its given
mission. The third tenant is confusing against the second; the idea that military AI will be eth-
ically programmed to follow the laws of armed conflict is one thing. It appears the article is
attempting to say the primary reason for researching and integrating AI is that "AI used in war
has an explicit life-saving mission, noting how weapons systems with automatic target recogni-
tion could target more accurately with less harm to civilians." (Atherton, 2019) This would only
hold true if the data used is clean, accurate, up to date, secure, adaptable to enemy denial and
deception tactics, and that someone could be sure that no disinform was ever ingested, this
is simply not likely to be the set condition in the real world. When addressing the legal, polit-
ical and ethical issue of lethal responsibility, we should default to the concept that "humans,
not computers and their algorithms should ultimately remain in control of, and thus morally
responsible for, relevant decisions about (lethal) military operations" (Filippo Santoni de, 2018).

Can we build autonomous systems that will obey the "rules of the road?

How does one ethically value human life? Is there an ethical formula for valuing one human
life over another? If an autonomous vehicle is driving down a road and a child runs out in the
road, and a dog is running after the child, should the autonomous vehicle make the ethical
decision to spare the child, yet possibly kill the animal? What if, in this scenario, the vehicle
is an autonomous hired Uber® that has a passenger, should the Uber® be programmed to
avoid the child and animal, and hit a tree instead? Is the passenger's life less valuable than the
child or animal and if so, who is ethically making this calculation? The field of artificial moral-
ity aims to model or simulate human cognitive abilities "poses particular difficulties because
autonomous vehicles do not just face moral decision but moral dilemmas....in which an agent
has only the choice between two (or more) options which are not without morally problematic
consequences" (Misselhorn, 2018).

As the EU struggles to consider "electronic personhood" "the future of autonomous vehicles,
are in most urgent need of European and global rules... Fragmented regulatory approaches
would hinder implementation and jeopardize European competitiveness... (it will require) A
new mandatory insurance scheme for companies to cover damage caused by their
robots". (Hern, 2017)

In a 2017 article in Public Health Ethics, it is stated "machine learning has only begun to explore
moral behavior-or ethical crashing algorithms-for autonomous vehicles. Is it better to kill two
autonomous vehicle passengers or two pedestrians? One person or one animal? Collide with a
wall or run over a box with unknown contents?" (Fleetwood, 2017).
Several regulatory bodies are discussing these issues, and in "2014, the Society for Automotive
Engineers (SAE) International's standard J3016 outlined six levels of automation for automak-
ers, suppliers, and policymakers to use to classify a system's sophistication". As Figure 22-9
offers a roadmap for the integration of autonomous systems as the human slowly releases more
and more control of the vehicle to the AI, allowing for safeguards for the human control over-
ride.

the norm in our society we must consider that they "will be required that the system is able
to always comply with all the rules of traffic as defined by the society via the public author-
ity, and sometimes with some unwritten conventions which govern human interaction in the
traffic". (Filippo Santoni de, 2018) This adherence to rules and laws does not absolve the system
from understanding the ethics, morals, and the common good of all during the use of the roads
and infrastructure, whether it be for commerce or personal business.

"Success in creating effective A.I.," said the late Stephen Hawking, "could be the biggest event
in the history of our civilization. Or the worst. We just don't know." Elon Musk called A.I. "a
fundamental risk to the existence of civilization." Are we creating the instruments of our own
destruction or exciting tools for our future survival? Once we teach a machine to learn on its
own--as the programmers behind AlphaGo have done, to wondrous results--where do we draw
moral and computational lines? (Urban, 2018)

In a November 2017 newsletter, IEEE stated that "Malfunctioning autonomous and semi-
autonomous systems can disadvantage and harm users, society, and the environment. Effective
fail-safe mechanisms...(can) terminate unsuccessful or compromised operations" (IEEE , 2017).
This article supports IEEE P7000 standards, which supports the overarching goals of the IEEE
to prioritize ethical concerns and human's wellbeing in the development of standards for
autonomous and intelligent technologies.

In 2018, enterprise software maker, SAP announced a set of ethical guiding principles for arti-
ficial intelligence (AI) development, their press release stated

"We recognize that, as with any technology, there is scope for AI to be used in ways that are
not aligned with these guiding principles and the operational guidelines we are developing. In
developing AI software, we will remain true to our human rights commitment statement, the
UN guiding principles on business and human rights, laws, and widely accepted international
norms" (Middleton, 2018)

We no longer have the luxury of ignoring ethical and moral questions as arguments are being
made to integrate autonomous systems in our lives with transportation being just one small yet
important sector "Around the world autonomous cars could save 10 million lives per decade,
creating one of the most important public health advances of the 21st century" (Fleetwood,
2017)

The challenge of extending ethics and morals into the AI and the autonomous world is a chal-
lenge that may not be fully realized or solved anytime soon. Humans continue to struggle
with their own ethical and moral issues. The nature of moving forward with technologies and
thrusting societies into the AI and autonomous arenas without the ability to fully adapt to the
ethics and morals of the societies they operate in will stress governments, law enforcement
agencies and the fabrics of our different societies.

564 | Chapter 22: Ethics in the New Age of Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Ethics in new technology manufacturing

Although several laws are being drafted, "a life cycle impact assessment should also be devel-
oped to understand the true ethical and moral cost of manufacturing AI and autonomous sys-
tems. This allows manufacturers to account for the raw materials and the products from the
innovation phase, design, manufacturing, sales, and final disposal. Mandating this type of prod-
uct life cycle may help alter the manufacturing process as the consumer would know the true
societal and environmental impact of the product. The issue is, how do you enforce industrial
standards for AI and autonomous development and disposal that everyone can understand and
will follow. China will tend to tell the world that it understands it should not be putting unsafe
chemicals in the baby formula; however, the message is simply disregarded. Several times in
the past few years:

"milk powder, produced by Chinese dairy giant Sanlu Group, was contaminated with melamine,
a chemical used in making plastics. Melamine has been illegally added to food products in
China to boost their apparent protein content, including a widely publicized case last year of
contaminated pet food that got exported around the world." (Ramzy, 2008)

Ethics can guide laws, yet enforcement can also guide the ethics of the offenders, and in the
case of large manufactures, one must consider what is an enforceable law that does not unfairly
burden underprivileged countries. Ethics and morals must be considered in the intellectual
property rights in the manufacturing of AI and autonomous systems "If I create a robot, and
that robot creates something that could be patented, should I own that patent or should the
robot? If I sell the robot, should the intellectual property it has developed, go with it" (Hern,
2017)

The enforcement of the agreed upon ethical and moral standards is where good intentions fall
short. Fining a company a few dollars as they create millions of dollars of health care back-
lash costs is a clear signal that "ethics" are fungible and are not real. World governments and
people are passionate about the environment and believe (at times) money will cure all ills,
including questionable ethics. However, it will not. Walmart incurred fines of over $110 million
in 2013 alone. Did this monetary penalty solve anything? When was the last time you heard
of the entire corporate board of directors being sentenced to jail or being held accountable
at all?" (FEMA, 2013) Electronic waste is an issue that will only get worse as technology moves
forward and disposable items are moved from first world countries to third world countries
without a thought of the cost to the country or the environment.

Ethics are definable and based on certain criteria are negotiable; this is a given. Refusing to
enforce penalties offers all carrot and no stick. This is unworkable and continues to fail day
in and day out. To incorporate ethics into new technologies is a dream that has a glimmer of
hope, and more work must be done. Where does this responsibility lay? Who is tasked with this
issue? Who should be tasked with this issue?

                                                                               R. K. Nichols, J.J.C.H. Ryan, H.C. Mumm, W.D. Lonstein, C. Carter, and J.P. Hood | 565
Conclusion
A key takeaway is that ethical issues at their roots tend to stay constant throughout history; it is
how society or humankind choose to deal with the issue at that point in time that makes ethics
interesting. Examples are murder and slavery. In the past, there was an outcry to stop slavery,
stop treating humans worse than animals, as we all share the thread of being humans, with the
same color of blood and the ability to think, reason, and be self-aware. Will robots continue to
learn and study humans and their evolution, for the purpose of evolving past humanity?
That outcry has now turned to silence despite that there are now more humans in the bonds
of slavery through human trafficking than any time in the history of humankind.

We must examine history in an ethical context to see how we can shape the future with a
deeper understanding of the past. The speed of change in AI and autonomous systems is rad-
ically accelerating, and the global upheaval similarly accelerates. What is not apparent, is the
pace at which authorities, responsibilities, strategic plans, and policies must change and evolve
in order to help organizations understand their role in shaping a positive, proactive future.
The threat of unchecked technology, unmanned architecture development, and the ability
to weaponize unmanned systems continues to evolve. Unmanned architecture technology
advancements have offered more sophisticated abilities with cost-effective designs that have
reduced the entry barrier for consumers, businesses, enemy states, and terrorist organizations.
ISIS has demonstrated this by using commercially available unmanned systems technology
as air delivered IEDs. Clear policies, laws, and governance are required as the danger to the
nation, and the world is becoming undeniable. Plans and supplies available on the internet can
turn consumer cars and boats into autonomous driving vehicles that can carry weaponized

payloads are creating havoc for the military and civilian agencies unable to respond to these
autonomous systems. There is currently no single U.S. federal or international enforcement
agency in charge of this issue. For the successful integration of strategic policies, laws, and
governance, policy makers and industry must embrace a leadership framework that can
address potentially disruptive technologies and concepts that have exponential stakeholders
and multi-directional interactions. Given this requirement, how do we realign our institutions,
(academic, governmental and industry) for resilience and success as new revolutionary tech-
nologies continue to simultaneously emerge and inject additional instability into systems that
are already struggling for equilibrium?

Discussion Questions

  1. How do world events drive the ethical discussion in autonomous and artificial intelligence
      arenas?

 2. What and when should cyber factors be considered?
 3. What non-lethal options could an autonomous system choose to preserve life during an

      anomaly? What might be considered an anomaly?
 4. Do you think human ethics can be extended, programmed, understood, obeyed, and

      adapted into the autonomous and AI industry? Why or why not?
 5. What ethical dangers do you see as the world leverages more AI?
