Overview

Historically, women, people of color, and others experiencing systemic oppression have played very
active, even leading roles in hands-on work, including essential creative endeavors. And yet, a vast
majority of these remain hidden or lost from our memories, and in key ways this is an intentional
work of oppression. These are endeavors of home, craft, and trade workers, and also of information,
engineering, and design professionals. Meanwhile, research reveals ways in which the K-12 and
higher education systems create hurdles to participation in emerging digital technology spaces for
women and people of color. We'll explore these points periodically throughout the book. This book
seeks to advance a person-centered orientation to technologies in ways that enrich each of our func-
tional diversities and capability sets, and this often starts with recognizing that we can do far more
than we're led to believe. Technology has absolutely no ability to help us. None. Let me repeat that:
Technology has no capability whatsoever to do anything for us. It's not a person. It's a thing. Things
aren't alive; they don't breathe; they don't think. But they can, sometimes, be a useful tool in the
hands of people. And the usefulness of that tool is determined directly and indirectly through the
shaping of that tool by other people. People are creative, living, thinking beings. They fail. They
screw up. They hurt themselves and others. But they also fail forward, learning to do better and bet-
ter through application of a growth mindset. At least, people do if they are invited into communities
of practice that incorporate diverse cultural wealth and knowledge through collective leadership,

                                                                                  xi
xii Introduction to the Book

community inquiry, and critical pedagogy action-research cycles. Too often people are taught to be
submissive, to consume things created by others, to be saved by the thing itself. And this is especially
so for those not white and for those not male.

      Most girls are taught to avoid failure and risk. To smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys,
      on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey
      bars and then jump off head first. By the time they're adults and whether they're negotiat-
      ing a raise or even asking someone out on a date, men are habituated to take risk after risk.
      They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley that no one even takes you seriously
      unless you've had two failed startups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect
      and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry about our federal deficit. But
      I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society, we're losing out because we're
      not raising our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is the reason why women are under-
      represented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere
      you look. Reshma Saujani, "Teach Girls Bravery, Not Perfection"

This book seeks to advance the fail-forward and growth mindsets of all, especially those who have
been oppressed through works advancing the power of others over them. We will work together to
discover ways to advance power, both power within and power with others. We will work to advance
our technical skills, but also and even more, our progressive community engagement skills, our critical
social + technical skills, and our cognitive, information, and social emotional skills. To do this, we will
also work to advance our collective leadership through storytelling, and especially counterstorytelling,
within a framing of reciprocity.

Overall Objectives

The general learning outcome objectives of this book are to help readers:
         · Develop a clear hands-on working understanding of the hardware and software layers of
            computers and networks. As learners journey through the units of this book, they will
            hopefully develop a growing comfort and competency: working with the basic nuts and
            bolts of computers and networks; appropriately integrating components to serve as tools
            for computational and information processing; and performing basic troubleshooting.
         · Evolve a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the sociotechnical artifacts we use
            as a daily part of our professional lives. The hardware, software, human, and social whole
            that is a digital artifact is greater than the sum of the parts. Beyond developing technical
            competencies, we need to develop an awareness of, and skillsets to influence, the emergent
            properties that come from specific combinations of the different social and technical build-
            ing blocks of information systems.
         · Develop a critical approach to sociotechnical artifacts. Social systems are constructs of
            economy, politics, matters of race, class, and gender, social institutions, and other cultural
                                                                                                                                  Introduction to the Book xiii

            dynamics. Design, diffusion, and implementation of technical innovations both reflect and
            shape these social systems. Critically examining social + technical information systems
            from multiple individual and societal perspectives opens up consideration of idealized
            expectations vs. actual positive and negative impacts within specific user communities.
         · Advance community agency in appropriating technology to achieve our individual and
            community development goals through a reconsidered digital literacy learning and practice.
            Far from being just passive adopters of different digital technology artifacts used to find,
            evaluate, create, and communicate information, as Information Science professionals we
            have opportunities to initiate and lead communities of practice, leveraging the plurality of
            our community's social and technical insights.

Humans are analog. We hear, see, and feel in a rich range of frequencies, hues, and senses. We actively
create and use these analog circuits to network with others around us. We actively live as highly func-
tioning analog networked information systems. And we do this quite well!

On the other hand, programming code and the computers used to run that code are primarily digital
and binary--zeros and ones. Digital, too, is the Internet, cell networks, Bluetooth devices, and other
inter-networking systems we generally think of when we speak of networked information systems.

Makerspaces and other Maker-type environments are places to encourage people to gather together
to create, invent, and learn. They are analog networked information systems first and foremost. Such
spaces often serve as a counter to consumption and individualism. By their very nature, Makerspaces
also embrace change. While you may certainly go to a Makerspace to attend workshops on traditional
crafts, you may also find side-by-side ways to create using new digital technologies. But always the
focus remains on personalization rather than assembly-line production.

As such, cognitive, socio-emotional, information, and progressive community engagement skills are
as much or more important than specific technical skills within Maker-type environments. Cognitive
skills include the ability to logically analyze and organize problems in ways that allow use of digital
and analog tools to help solve them, and to generalize new processes to other problems. Socio-emo-
tional skills include the ability to communicate and collaborate with others, along with personal
confidence, persistence, and tolerance, in order to tackle complex, ambiguous, open-ended problems.
Information skills include the ability to seek, evaluate, interpret, and apply relevant and trustworthy
information across multiple media. Progressive community engagement skills advance our ability
to work together in communities of practice advancing and making continued use of collective lead-
ership and individuals' unique cultural wealth and capability sets to help each member better achieve
their valued beings and doings. Technical skills, then, become a response to needs identified using
cognitive, socio-emotional, and information skills. They are just-in-time in-fill learning.

Combined, the intent of this book is not to exclusively provide technical skills as specific learning out-
comes. Rather, the primary goal is to use exercises to teach the technical logic of electronics, coding,
xiv Introduction to the Book

and networking in a way that can be generalized to various problems at hand and the unique tech-
nical skills needed within that context. At the same time, it is to expand our understanding of the
social systems that have applied this technical logic to various design problems in ways that have pos-
itively addressed some issues while potentially negatively addressing others. The intent is to also help
build up confidence and persistence to tackle ever-more-complex technology problems, while discov-
ering that we are shaped by people, including the creators of this book, who worked to create these
sociotechnical artifacts. And those who created the artifacts were shaped by other people who cre-
ated earlier works. And you will begin shaping others as you innovate-in-use the artifacts associated
with the book in a way it wasn't necessarily meant to be used in order to do something you value.

Ultimately, the aim of the book is to prime the readers for a lifetime of co-exploring within Maker-
type environments as information professionals. It is to recognize that at their best, these studios bring
together diverse populations of people as a collective to address a key issue of shared interest in ways
that maximize individual and social benefits and minimize individual and social harms. It is to iden-
tify what participation and inclusion mean within the contexts that are unique to each community of
practice and each issue of shared interest. It is to begin to identify the everyday technologies that may
be unseen and displaced because of an overly narrow definition of what should be considered appro-
priate, and the local innovators whose technologies might be championed if only they were made vis-
ible. And it is to clarify ways each person might serve in the moment as an innovator-in-use of the
technologies to make it practical and appropriate for their functional diversities, that is, their ways of
better achieving that which they most value being and doing within a given context.

Some Useful Working Standards and Frameworks

The best works in a Maker-type environment are works of community, in community, and for commu-
nity. They combine active hands-on innovation with individual and corporate reflection -- collective
leadership with Paulo Freire's action-reflection cycles and the community inquiry model developed
initially by John Dewey and Jane Addams and further advanced especially through the works of
Bertram "Chip" Bruce and Ann Peterson-Kemp. Combined, the outcome is development of a criti-
cal conceptual understanding of innovation-in-use from a person-centered perspective. This is a book
meant to be done as part of a community of practice.

To facilitate these works of collective leadership, action and reflection, and community inquiry, those
working through this book are encouraged to test out a range of community of practice standards and
frameworks that might apply within our professional practice moving forward. What follows is a short
introduction to each. We'll revisit and expand upon these frameworks as we go through the book.
                                                                                                                                      Introduction to the Book xv

  Community Inquiry in Practice is a virtuous cycle that includes asking initial questions, joining in active co-learning,
  reading the words and worlds of knowledges shared in a range of ways, internal reflection, group discussion, critical
  questions, and journaling.

 Community of Practice

  A core idea within the social constructivism of John Dewey and others as incorporated throughout this
  book is that learning is constructed by social interaction between an individual and the social environ-
  ment. It cannot happen by an individual doing independent work. Sometimes this learning community
  comprises a range of people within a local community. At other times, it is a community of prac-
  tice formed by a group of people engaging in a process of collective learning. While in both of these
  learning community examples the objective is knowing and learning so as to achieve a specific human
  endeavor, the means by which this objective can best be achieved varies considerably. As this book is
  written first and foremost as a textbook for use in classrooms, after-school sessions, workshops, and
  other Maker-type studio environments, the structure of, and activities within, the book are designed
  to especially facilitate communities of practice.
  In "Communities of practice: a brief introduction," Etienne Wenger provides this nutshell description
  of the term:

        Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for some-
        thing they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.1

   xvi Introduction to the Book

  Members of a community of practice are people with a shared domain of interest that distinguishes
  them from other people as it applies within this context. This may be a multigenerational gathering
  of people all living within a specific local neighborhood, a gathering of people living within different
  neighborhoods of a diverse city who all are part of a local club, a gathering of professionals from
  across the nation or world meeting using online technology, and so many other communities of prac-
  tice. They are people who engage in joint activities and discussions to share information and help each
  other, whether in a specific physical location at which they meet on a daily basis, or via an online
  forum in which they meet synchronously periodically with other asynchronous meetings as infill. In
  so doing, they commit time and effort to work as formal or informal practitioners so as to develop
  a shared body of resources. Your past and future interests may vary greatly, but for a time and for a
  specific purpose as related the contents of this book, you may find it of great value to become a com-
  munity of practice within this context.

 Collective Leadership

  When people gather to mobilize human, cultural, and technological resources in ways that address
  opportunities and challenges of common interest and for the common good, then bidirectional learn-
  ing, joint action, shared responsibility, and mutual accountability have an opportunity to blossom.
  This shift away from prioritizing individual change agents to instead emphasize collective leadership
  serves to facilitate the crossing of boundaries of all types, including age, race, gender, income, culture,
  and religion. Through a cycle of preparation through trust building, of co-constructing a purpose and
  strategic plan, of implementation through allyship and collective action, and of sustaining of the work
  as part of the community fabric, robust strategies and partnerships come together to advance long-
  term impact.

  As your community of practice work together through the units, you'll find various "Do Something
  New!" innovation-in-use/remix prompts encouraging you to make use of collective leadership to mobi-
  lize the sessions of a unit in ways that may address opportunities and challenges of common interest,
  even if just as a small prototype of a larger collective leadership cycle down the road as you enter into
  other communities of practice. There's an International Leadership Association interview of leader-
  ship educator and practitioner Kirstin Phelps and textbook author Martin Wolske further highlighting

Community Inquiry

Inquiry-based learning is open-ended, democratic, participatory engagement connected to people's
values, history, and lived experiences. It builds from John Dewey's framing of logic as the theory of
inquiry. Community inquiry as framed in this post by Bertram "Chip" Bruce further emphasizes collab-
orative activity and knowledge creation conducted of, for, and by communities as living social organ-
isms. This book and the readings and videos linked within transmit information to others. The various
prompts and comprehension checks add a starting level of interactive communication that hopefully
grows with in-person question-and-answer opportunities and workshop/course feedback for improve-
ment. But as Bruce notes in his newest book, Beyond the Classroom Walls, what is conveyed through
the transmission and interaction modes of communication is a partial message. The expertise and lived
experiences of the sender may assure that this is solid data and information based on reliable research
and practice. But it is essential that we continue to bring together the work of the mind and of the
body, of the classroom and the lab of that which comes from lived real-world experiences.

In contrast with the transmission and interaction models, the transaction model does not
assume that we even have a message to communicate, or that one party could hold such a
message. Utterances are not just shared, but co-constructed, and out of that, meaning is con-
structed. [...] It is the norm for human conversation that an utterance initiated by one person
can be completed by another. Speaking overlaps so that it is unclear even what each indi-
vidual has heard. The initial speaker may alter meaning by stopping mid-sentence, shifting
their gaze, or changing intonations. Other participants show their assent, interest, or dis-
agreement only partly through words, using also facial expressions, gestures, or eye glances.
The content, such as it is, emerges only as the talk proceeds; it does not exist a priori. (Bruce,
"Models of Communication", pg. 13.3)

The classroom and formal learning remain important, but must be complimented by the informal
learning of life in practice. Readers of this book hopefully have the opportunity to come together
with other readers taking on transactional communication co-constructing information and knowl-
edge--information that has become actionable--through community inquiry. And as you collectively
work through the social and technical aspects of each session, you inquire together about--that is,
ask probing questions with regard to--your opportunities and challenges in bringing this learning to
action in your lives. As you enter into collaborative investigation and creation, you also will need to
regularly set aside time for individual and collective reflection and discussion, leading to a new cycle
of asking, investigating, creating, reflecting, and discussing. These cycles don't always happen in a set
order. But the best community inquiries strategically incorporate each of these into their works, even
when they sometimes seem out of place or of lesser value at a given moment. This community-driven
inquiry can also lead to inquiry about the nature and meaning of the community itself, and the webs

  of privilege and oppression that shape and are shaped by the community and those impacting that
  community.4

  The Community of Practice framework above is presented as a likely starting understanding of the
  type of learning community many users of this textbook may be joining into as they travel through the
  book. The Collective Leadership framework then highlights the importance of crossing boundaries of
  all types to better achieve collective action in a way that advances the community fabric. Community
  Inquiry is a framework that further emphasizes the social organism that is community. While this book
  is an outcome of two decades of work bringing digital technologies and literacies into diverse com-
  munities, especially focusing on those historically marginalized, key to each has been the community
  inquiry practitioner dialogue in community, with community, and for community. This book, then,
  is intended to help advance an understanding of the nuts and bolts of analog and digital hardware,
  software, and networks, while also questioning the underlying assumptions of specific sociotechnical
  artifacts so as to facilitate the deepening of the community fabric. In exploring the book using the
  frameworks of Community of Practice, Collective Leadership, and Community Inquiry, the intent is to
  help the learning community consider the ways in which the social and technical chapters within each
  session of the three units of this book may serve as effective infill to advance the additional, commu-
  nity-specific learning outcome objectives.

 Action-Reflection

  Paulo Freire was an adult educator and philosopher from Brazil, who in the 1960s worked to develop
  educational projects and went on to significantly inform and advocate critical pedagogy. He not only
  taught reading and writing to illiterate adults, but at the same time worked to help raise awareness of
  the agency people had to bring a new reality into existence. He used techniques that would be familiar
  to us today: show a picture, show a word, help people to pronounce the word and associate it with
  the picture, connect the syllables of the word with specific sounds, generalize to other words. But as
  Freire went through these steps, he also encouraged learners to combine syllables in unique ways to
  create new words. And he encouraged them to see how the old word was often associated with objects
  that served to oppress the learner (for instance, moving from learning the word brick to considering
  that the learner manufactured for elites who paid them a sub-living wage and then used the brick to
  build walled fortresses that kept wealth in and others out). At the same time they made connections of
  syllable sounds with new words, they also made connections between creating their own new words
  with creating new, more just realities.

  While Freire developed his approach to link together small group reflection with positive action for
  change and development within an adult literacy context, he and many others after him have taken
  this action-reflection critical thinking approach into many different arenas, including the sociotech-

  nical realm. We first must move away from a "banking" model of education in which expert teachers
  deposit their knowledge into passive students. Instead we must enter into a problem-posing educa-
  tional process that launches a dialectic approach to knowledge combined with abductive logic to facil-
  itate a work of conscientization, that of perceiving in new ways the social, political, and economic
  contradictions within existing social reality and then taking action against the oppressive elements to
  bring about a new reality.5

  Core to each unit of the book are cycles of critical reflection and hands-on action. During the reflective
  inquiry phase of the cycle, we first learn the words and concepts underlying technologies, and the
  social contexts that have shaped and are shaped by these technologies. Individual notetaking is an
  essential aspect of this inquiry--jot down several key points from the readings and videos, a couple
  insights that emerged from these, and a question or two still lingering in your mind. Individual inquiry
  provides a critical contribution as a session moves to a second level of reflection using community
  inquiry in which diverse perspectives bring forward a more holistic investigation of text within con-
  text--words within worlds. Each session incorporates hands-on activities within learning communities
  to help each person identify with key technical aspects of these sociotechnical artifacts. In so doing,
  we more fully sense the nuances of the situations being covered in the unit by sharpening existing, and
  introducing new, understanding of the specific sociotechnical artifact and the broader sociotechnical
  systems around us. In this way, the initial codification of the words and concepts under exploration
  that have now been contextually decodified are recoded. Our increasingly nuanced understanding
  these structures comprised of interdependent social and technical elements reveal relations and prop-
  erties which uniquely emerge by their function as a whole. Only in such critical action and reflection
  as part of community inquiry using collective leadership can we advance a more liberated community
  fabric. Capturing these through journal reflections to conclude the inquiry cycle for a session provides
  a snapshot that can be taken into subsequent action and reflection inquiry cycles throughout the book
  and into our broader work as information professionals.

 Pair/Triplet Programming

  Pair programming is increasingly common in software development. Two programmers collaborate
  on design, coding, and testing, with qualitative evidence suggesting the subsequent design is better,
  resulting in simpler code that is easier to extend. Further, whether the pair programming occurs
  between two novice programmers, between a novice programmer and a more experienced program-
  mer, or between two experienced programmers, people learn significantly more about the system and
  about software development as both participants bring in unique insights, as long as what is being
  done is not a repetitive task. Conversation between the programming pair can occur at many levels as
  the driver working at the keyboard takes charge of all changes made in the program and the navigator
  observes all the code that is entered, considers coding options, works to spot and address problems,

   xx Introduction to the Book

  considers and recommends simplifications, helps with programming style, and designs and verifies
  testing.6

  Extensive testing of the hands-on activities throughout this book have indicated the substantial value
  of collaborative programming in small groups of two or three people. Further, while pair program-
  ming is specifically associated with computer programming environments, small group collaborations
  in which one drives the specific hands-on work and the other(s) navigates has also proved very useful
  in doing the electronics and networking exercises as well. Throughout, it is essential that participants
  switch roles regularly from driver to navigator and back. This technique is not about the expert doing
  while the novice observes. It is about collaboration that recognizes the unique expertise each brings to
  bear, including bringing in new sites when this is a person's first time doing something.

 The Toolkit

  In working through specific hands-on activities in this book, we'll make use of a range of items, from
  individual components like light-emitting diodes and switches, to complex circuit boards like the Cir-
  cuit Playground Express microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi microcomputer. There are many vari-
  ations of these components and the supporting electrical conductors and tools that may shape how
  you can or should work with various parts to achieve hands-on activities. As a carpenter, general con-
  tractor, and overall tinkerer, I make regular use of both general- and special-purpose tools. However,
  the focus of this book is to foster development of a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the
  hardware, software, human, and social whole of our sociotechnical devices, an understanding that is
  greater than the sum of the social and technical parts. The tools we'll use for the exercises in this
  book, then, are general-purpose ones specifically chosen in support of a range of different activities
  that have proven solid in promoting this holistic and nuanced educational work advancing a broader
  sociotechnical mindset. These tools have also proven adaptable by a range of audiences as they work
  to strengthen those aspects of their technical, cognitive, socio-emotional, informational, and progres-
  sive community engagement skills which need honing to implement this mindset as part of collective
  action and reflection cycles for social good.

  As selected portions of this book are used in my various other courses and workshops and have proved
  useful as standalone sources for use around the globe, the tools have been selected as ones that can
  also be available in a drawer or cabinet for use when a specialized need requires. Many of the exer-
  cises in the Rainbow Unit, for instance, could be done on any GNU/Linux computer, and potentially
  also on Mac OSX and Windows computers. Multiple parallel input and output data pins are likely not

  prove of value, as they have for my own community workshops and progressive community engage-
  ment classes, which have used computers available within the spaces. But even here, I sometimes bring
  along some Raspberry Pi's, as they've proven of value given the Raspberry Pi Foundation's education-
  ally-motivated design of the computer and its huge catalog of projects whose origins also come from
  an educational person-centered focus.

  The steps and diagrams of activities in this book are based on components purchased through Adafruit
  industries, a one hundred percent woman-owned manufacturing company. Founded in 2005 by Limor

 Blue Unit Items

  The following are used throughout the Blue Unit of the textbook. They are also used for exercises in
  session one of the Rainbow Unit.

           · The Circuit Playground Express
           · A micro-USB to USB cable to connect the Circuit Playground Express to a personal com-

              puter or to a Raspberry Pi
                        In some cases, a micro-USB to USB-C cable may be needed instead, as many per-
                          sonal computers as well as the Raspberry Pi 4 and 400 now provide USB-C ports

           · Six small alligator clip to male jumper wires

 The Raspberry Pi Kit

  The following Raspberry Pi kit is used in the fourth sessions of both the Orange and Blue Units, and
  as the base of the Rainbow Unit. To keep overall costs down, one kit can serve multiple participants.

           · Raspberry Pi 3, 4, or 400 microcomputer
                        If using a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, an Adafruit Pi Protector case with GPIO labeling is
                          recommended

           · Wall outlet to 5V power supply with appropriate microUSB (Raspberry Pi 3) or USB-C
              (Raspberry Pi 4 and 400) adapter

           · Adafruit PiOLED 128×32 display
           · A keyboard, mouse, and monitor will briefly be needed, but can be shared amongst multiple

              Raspberry Pi's.9
           · A 40-pin GPIO extension cable has proven helpful to provide a safe connection point when

              multiple different breadboard prototypes are tested using one shared Raspberry Pi. Attach-
              ing the ribbon cable from a cobbler or T-cobbler to this extension cable helps prevent wear
              and tear on the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi itself.

9. The Raspberry Pi operating system includes an installation of the Real VNC server which can be enabled through the
  Raspberry Pi Configuration software. However, initial setup and configuration of the operating system is generally best
  done using a standard keyboard, mouse, and monitor attached to a Raspberry Pi. Once complete, the Adafruit PiOLED can
  be used to provide the IP Address currently assigned to the Raspberry Pi, allowing a Real VNC viewer installed on a par-
  ticipant's computer or mobile phone to connect to the Raspberry Pi running "headless", that is without a keyboard,
  mouse, and monitor attached.

Toolkits and Their Contexts

I grew up, literally, in the family sawmill. I don't remember far enough back to remember being carried
into the mill by my mother, or my first ramblings through it as a toddler. But I remember that at age
five, I was paid fifty cents an hour by my parents to sweep up. And I remember that as an apprentice,
wanting to do so much more but being instructed to just sweep and listen, I started discovering the
music of the sawmill. The most alarming of sounds didn't cause a flinch in my parents, but a quiet
change in pitch would send them around, rapidly turning everything off.

And I slowly learned the trade in ways that I can't, even now, tell you I know. Some are pretty straight-
forward, such as how to build a basic toolbox. But some, like how to fix an electronic circuit to keep a
light or a power tool up and running, have just become second nature--hidden knowledge that's hard
to share with others.

What might be some of your hidden knowledge? How can you each provide support to the
others to help rediscover that hidden knowledge, as so many have done in support of my
rediscoveries? How, as a community of practice, can we work to bring these gems of knowl-
edge into a transactional communication to co-create new understandings?

When I was thirteen, the logger who brought us the logs we used in the sawmill to build pallets for
local businesses was severely injured. He ended up healing almost completely, but at the time he didn't
think he would. As a result, he sold his logging equipment to us at a bargain. And my dad bought it
because he figured I was now thirteen, and advanced enough as an apprentice to partner with him in
cutting down and preparing trees for use in the sawmill. So I became a lumberjack as well. Many of
the tools of the sawmilling trade matched those of the logging trade. But others were unique given
the changing contexts of working with felled versus standing timber, of working indoors versus out,
of working to do more precision cutting versus approximate ones. I began to learn the importance of
general purpose versus dedicated purpose tools. Still today, whether in doing carpentry, general con-
tracting, or broader tinkering on projects, I've learned the importance of choosing the right tool for
the right job at the right time, given the evolving context.

Take a minute to bring to your mind a project you've done recently. Any kind of project--big
or small, personal or professional--will do, just so long as it's something you took a leader-
ship role in doing. What tools did you use? Why those tools? What other tools might have
been a better fit for the job at that time within that context?

As you go through this book, keep reflecting back on your own projects as a starting context
for considering the toolkit being used for the projects of this book, within the time and con-
texts within which you are doing them. Why these tools? What other tools might have been
a better fit for the job, in this moment and within this context?
    xxiv Introduction to the Book

   I was in junior high when we started the logging portion of the family business and I was also just
   learning how to write computer programs--it was the mid-seventies after all. For a class presentation,
   I tried adding in digital tools to measure the board feet of the logs. It proved an early discovery of how
   the old standby analog tools can be so much better in the field than digital tools at times. The formal
   learning in the classroom showed me the possibilities, while the learning in the field provided essen-
   tial informal learning regarding the importance of focusing on people first. I was fortunate to have a
   diverse group of teachers, mentors, community, and culture in which to experience this model of inter-
   actional communication, in which the two are unified through collective leadership and community
   inquiry.

         As you gather within a community of inquiry, be sure to regularly pause to identify those
         who identify as "students" who are actually the right "teachers" at this time, in this place,
         and within this context. Work to lift them up as you each work to advance the collective
         leadership of all. Especially work to cross boundaries of race, class, gender, and other iden-
         tifiers that so often leave us othering those different from us. If we are to truly advance a
         more holistic and nuanced person-centered understanding of networked information sys-
         tems, diversity isn't a nicety but a necessity.

   Learning not only included formal learning in the classroom and informal learning within the work
   of the trade, either. Changing communities, cultures, and contexts further enrich our learning in the
   wild. Our family was invited to log amongst farms seeking to preserve the woods because my dad
   strove to carefully and selectively fell trees in support of the ecosystem for both environmental and
   economic goals. And we started saving more and more of the premium lumber for use on projects
   around the house as gifts of the trees. The trees were more than just things to be bought and sold.
   They were "more-than-human people," as Robin Wall Kimmerer shares in her book Braiding Sweet-
   grass. Even after death, trees gift us so much if we take the time to discover it. And, as Kimmerer notes,
   I began to understand that we need to learn to "remember to remember ... to pick up what was left for
   us: the stories, the teachings, the songs, each other, our more-than-human relatives that were scattered
   along that path."10

   Sometime in my late teens or early twenties, through many physical experiences and through spoken
   and written words, I increasingly discovered how the tulip poplar, or whitewood, has been a central
   resource for the creation of North America. Even before the landing of the first white Europeans, resi-
   dents of this land used whitewood in support of their valued beings and doings. And this fastest grow-
   ing and easiest working of the hardwoods gives itself willingly if we wisely choose which trees to
   cut down, and to cut it carefully and with respect. And as I learned more, I also discovered it was a
   "more-than-human" tree. To this day, when I'm feeling low for some reason, I might discover that on a
   dime I begin feeling better. And if I look around, I'll often discover close at hand a tulip poplar, silently

   singing its song of support to me. While this is my personal story, over the years I've come to find
   similar stories told by people from different histories and cultures as well.

   In 1997 I began teaching the Library and Information Science course Introduction to Networked Infor-
   mation Systems. In 2000, a service-learning component was added in answer to a call by residents of
   East St. Louis, Illinois, to provide infill assistance building and upgrading computer labs in support of
   the community work addressing the digital divide in local neighborhoods. Throughout, at the start of
   each semester, the following quote by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is referenced:

         We must rapidly begin the shift from a `thing-oriented' society to a `person-oriented' society.
         When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more
         important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable
         of being conquered.

         Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.11

   I've continuously searched for ways to put into practice these words from Dr. King as part of all my
   teaching, research, and broader community engagement works. Over and over, I've joined into com-
   munities of practice going out to address the digital divide and to advance digital inclusion and equity,
   only to find that I have remained too thing-oriented. And so this book is being created as part of an
   ongoing search for better ways to become increasingly person-centered.

   For that reason, I've built a toolbox using tulip poplar, in which I put the tools used for activities in
   this book as a reminder that all we have has been gifted to us by nature. While for most, you'll use
   containers on hand to store your toolkits, I encourage you to bring your creative side--or that of a
   willing friend's--to bear in personalizing the container, to keep this connection to people and to nature
   front and center in your minds as you work through the book. Whether in practice or in spirit, I hope
   that such a visualization serves you, as it has me, as inspiration for this person-centered mindset, by
   sharing counterstories of wisdom and knowledge the Tulip Poplar brings as one of the most noble of
   trees.

  Layout of the Book

   To help us advance our full range of skills--social and technical--needed to achieve our works as crafts-
   people each session in this book includes two thematically linked chapters, one more social-oriented
   and one more technical-oriented, devoted to a particular set of activities and associated learning out-
   comes.

            · The social chapter includes a lesson plan with essential works to be reviewed, along with

xxvi Introduction to the Book

         · The technical chapter includes a number of hands-on exercises and short quiz.

         · A third element is highly recommended through your creation of Reading Notes, helping
            you to bring your own lived experiences and knowledge into conversation with the chap-
            ters, associated readings, and videos. As you proceed through each, jot down several impor-
            tant points that especially stood out to you from that text or video, a couple of insights that
            emerged from these points, and the major questions that still remain.

Each of these thematically linked chapters, along with the various activities, group discussions, and
your Reading Notes and Professional Journal Reflections, form one session. Sessions are brought
together into several larger units:

         · Orange Unit: This includes social chapters introducing the book, the underlying perspec-
            tives and mindsets, and broader skill sets underlying the framing of a person-centered
            guide to demystifying technology. The technical chapters introduce the electronics, circuits,
            and prototyping tools we'll use through the remainder of the book and beyond.

         · Blue Unit: The Blue Unit is comprised of four social and technical sessions. This includes
            social chapters exploring the histories of race, gender, and technology, and the mutual
            shaping of sociotechnical information systems by innovators, innovators-in-use, and those
            in between, including Adafruit Industries and the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The technical
            chapters move from individual electronic components to complex circuit boards such as the
            Raspberry Pi microcomputer and the Circuit Playground Express microcontroller, and
            explore how these can be used to bring together electronics and programming code so that
            individuals and communities of practice can shape digital tools in ways that better serve
            those things they value being and doing.

         · Rainbow Unit: The four sociotechnical sessions within the Rainbow Unit seek to tighten
            our growing holistic and nuanced understanding of the tools and technologies we use as a
            daily part of our professional, community, and personal lives, which has been building
            within the Orange and Blue Units. This includes social chapters exploring the broader his-
            tory and design of the Internet, the guiding forces and principles that have shaped and
            reshaped it, and the new movements and design principles leading to counterstories and
            person-centered products. The technical chapters explore and prototype ways to network
            together a range of circuit boards and operating systems, to create a more just networked
            information system as we use collective leadership community inquiry, transactional com-
            munications, and action-reflection praxis across diverse stakeholder groups to identify digi-
            tal inequalities.

The grouping of thematically linked chapters within specific units builds from two decades of par-
ticipatory design in and with community, and from the teaching of these concepts and practices in
courses and workshops. However, the use of colors rather than numbers for the units, and the lack of
chapter labels for each web page, is in recognition of the value of flexibility in how these materials are
covered in a specific context and moment in time.
                                                                                                                          Introduction to the Book xxvii

Lesson Plan

As you travel through the lesson plans for each session within the three units, think of these as
pre-season training activities within a sports metaphor. Each is meant to strengthen a different
aspect of ourselves and ourselves in relation to others. As with pre-season training, by the end
of the Rainbow Unit we will have not reached the finish line, but rather the end of pre-season
training. It will then be time to enter into the start of a new season of our information science
lives with a clearer and stronger person-centered community inquiry mindset and muscle mem-
ory facilitating new levels of action-reflection collective leadership as professional taking on the
sociotechnical challenges of the day.

         Orange Unit Review

Orange Unit Overview

      We must rapidly begin the shift from a `thing-oriented' society to a `person-oriented' society.
      When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more
      important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable
      of being conquered.

      Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.12

Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his "Beyond Vietnam" speech at the Riverside Church in
New York City in April of 1967. It was given against the advice of many of King's closest advisors.
They were concerned, with merit, that bringing together the civil rights, poverty, and peace move-
ments would lose the support of some major donors, influential liberals, and many white supporters.
King would not be dissuaded, as he saw all things interconnected. The structures in place were already
appropriating the civil rights gains. The above quote ends a paragraph that began with Dr. King refer-
encing a statement made by the late John F. Kennedy:

      Five years ago he said, `Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent
      revolution inevitable.' Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has
      taken, the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the
      privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investments.

3 Orange Unit: A Person-Centered Launch

Throughout this speech, Dr. King repeatedly emphasized our important need for "a radical revolution
of values."

The primary objective of this textbook is to provide a deep, hands-on sociotechnical dive into tech-
nology including electronics, software, and networks, culminating in a holistic understanding of net-
worked information systems. The textbook also explores the methodological landscape of networked
information systems, exploring the theoretical assumptions, historical contexts, social structures, and
research methods and techniques used by those known and unknown who influenced the design, mak-
ing, gifting and/or marketing of technologies. Throughout, co-explorers will be introduced to, and
make active use of skill sets, frameworks, and standards employed by a wide range of information
professionals in selecting, co-designing, appropriating, and innovating-in-use networked information
systems.

But might we be at risk of approaching digital technology, literacy training, and programming through
dominant paradigms that keep invisible the various ways our digital technology and media are con-
trolled and mediated so as to privilege a few over the many?

Is it possible, in our very efforts to "bridge the digital divide" and build "21st century digital literacy
skills," that we are actually deconstructing civil society and civic engagement, and instead furthering
magical thinking about technology, a belief in the supremacy of the technocrat, and the centrality of
market forces?

While these are questions we'll only introduce over the course of the book, the Orange Unit is our
starting point for considering how our everyday works with technologies can serve as a means to
rapidly shift from a `thing-oriented' society to a `person-centered' society, as so importantly intro-
duced by Dr. King in 1967.

 What is an Information System?

        Information System: An integrated set of components for collecting, storing, and processing
        data and for providing information, knowledge, and digital products.
        Encyclopaedia Britannica
  As we work through the Orange Unit, we'll explore the basic parts of our everyday information sys-
  tems. Over the millennia of human existence, sociotechnical devices have been created for collecting,
  processing, storing, disseminating and using data, the symbols used to represent real-world entities.
  Sociotechnical strategies have also emerged to advance understanding of data in the form of informa-
  tion and to make this information actionable in the form of knowledge. The accumulation of knowl-
  edge and a refined understanding of this accumulated knowledge advances what some refer to as
  wisdom. The data, information, knowledge, and wisdom pyramid has proved very useful in the infor-
  mation sciences as a means of investigating how different aspects of this pyramid have influenced the
  shaping of individuals, communities, societies, organizations, and governing bodies. 1
  For much of our history, humans have worked with mechanical devices to create information systems.
  Consider for instance Johannes Gutenberg's printing press or Herman Hollerith's census calculator as
  but two examples of Euro-American inventions. But you can go back much further, to devices like the

  abacus, and even earlier still -- to find innovations of mechanical technologies from around the world
  that have facilitated progress along the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom pyramid. Carolyn
  de la Peña provides a very useful lens in her article "Slow and Low Progress":

        Defined here as the material or systemic result of human attempts to extend the limits of
        power over the body and its surroundings, technology has been an essential tool in our abil-
        ity to feed, clothe, house, and protect our bodies. It has unified individuals across expanses
        of time and space in a manner that has extended pleasure and prevented pain.2

  Rapid growth of the human population in the 20th century, combined with growing organizational and
  governance structures shaped via the industrial revolution and the impact of two major world wars,
  led to the rapid advancement of electronic computing systems. Key electronic systems were devel-
  oped during World War II. After the war, new searches began for innovative uses of these systems and
  the components from which they were created. Business, academic, governmental, and other research
  institutions began a dedicated effort to consider what to do with the machineries of war, things like
  large tractors and poisonous gases. During World War I, there were posters proclaiming that Uncle
  Sam wants you to have two chickens per person. In World War II, Victory Gardens were seen as a
  civic duty to support the war effort. Entering the 1950s, the call was made by president after president,
  asking that we do our duty and buy from grocery stores in support of the modern farm that made use
  of those former war machineries to create innovative new agricultural systems.

  Take a moment to consider again what comes to mind when someone brings up the term "information
  system" in conversation -- in particular, in relation to these key transitions in information systems
  described above. What are the most beneficial outcomes that come to mind with the inventions of
  these information systems? What are the most problematic outcomes? Why do these come to mind?
  How do these come to mind?

  Mechanical and electronic information systems are tightly interrelated social and technical systems.
  The mutual shaping of social and technical components is highly complex and has seen, unseen, and
  unforeseen positive and negative impacts on individuals and the things that they value being and
  doing. We shape them and we are shaped by them. Others shape them and are shaped by them. And
  yet, too often we miss seeing inside the black box that we are an active part of, even if we don't know
  we are.

  And so we launch the Orange Unit by discovering the building blocks that make up basic electronic
  circuits. It's time to meet that often deeply hidden essential component of electronic systems face-to-
  face. We will use some instrumental approaches to apply deductive reasoning to discover relationships
  between individual components within an electronic circuit. We will begin to learn the key terms, con-

  cepts, and practices underlying the creation and use of these components to build electronic tools and
  larger systems.

  But at the same time, we start Session 1 also beginning to test out some practical approaches to knowl-
  edge by exploring the context and experiences of others' lifeworlds through inquiry using inductive
  reasoning. And, on occasion we will also find ourselves using abductive reasoning, seeking creative
  leaps to reveal hidden forces and structures underlying the mutual shaping of the information systems
  around us.

Technical Introduction

We do more work with electronics in our daily lives than we might ever imagine. Many of our core
tools for daily activities make use of electricity. The remote we use to change channels on the televi-
sion uses diodes, transistors, capacitors, resistors, and other electronics. We replace batteries to
keep these working, or we plug them in to recharge them. Or we choose alternative options, includ-
ing software applications, commonly called apps, that we install on our mobile phones, thereby using
shared electronic components on a single device, instead of the ones found over and over on each dif-
ferent handheld device. With the growth of DIY -- Do it Yourself -- we can follow relatively straight-
forward instructions to build our own replacement electronics, ofttimes expanding our own craft
making ethos to this expanded toolmaker realm. This book kicks off with some basic activities in
electronics. There are many good resources to get a detailed understanding of how electricity and
electronics work. But for what we're doing, only the most basic descriptions of the core components
used will be needed for you to jump right in. You don't even really need to remember specific names
and descriptions. You can always come back here to glance at names and descriptions later. But as
should always be the case, feel encouraged to read strategically, not linearly. Do a general mining of
this text to help you get started in the upcoming activities, then come back as needed to dig in a little
deeper on this or that. As Miriam Sweeney suggests, "instead of cruising along the narrative, you
need to dive in, find the information you need, and move along." With that stated, let's move forward
with definitions of key electronics used throughout the rest of this book.

                                                                                  11

Example: A Single LED Circuit

                                            An electrical circuit is a path in which electrons flow from source
                                            to ground. The source is usually measured in voltage (the force,
                                            expressed in volts) or current (the flow, expressed in amps). A
                                            resistor (expressed in ohms) controls the flow of this source.

                                            pressure than one that is almost empty. That full barrel is the
                                            equivalent of a higher voltage power source, for instance, one
                                            that is 240 volts. A barrel two-thirds of the way full may be more
                                            like a 120 volt power source, while a nearly empty rain barrel may
                                            be closer to a 5 volt power source.

                                            If I have a spray nozzle hooked up to my rain barrel, I can often
                                            use a lever to increase or decrease the water's flow. This is equiva-
                                            lent to the current of the power source. Some of my water hoses
                                            are 1/2 thick, while some are 3/4 thick. This is equivalent to big-
ger or smaller ohms of a resistor, respectively, since a thinner hose increases the resistance of the flow
of water compared to the thicker hose.

As a side note, in electrical engineering, Ohm's Law provides a basic equation I=V/R. This states that
current (I) is equal to voltage (V) divided by resistance (R). And as all Trekkies know from their days
with Jean-Luc Picard, resistance is not futile, it's essential! Beyond this, don't worry if you are ready
to put aside these particular details.

Schematics are commonly used to draw out the path used by the electronic components to complete
a circuit.

As an example, the Fritzing image above is a schematic with three electronic components:
         · a battery
         · a resistor
         · a light emitting diode (LED)

The lines between are not electronic components, but rather are some form of conductive material like
a metal wire that is used to carry the current from component to component. In the schematic, a pos-
itive current leaves the 9 volt battery and passes through a 560 ohm resistor before connecting to the
positive charge of a 10mm white LED. From there, it passes through the negatively charged leg of the
LED to the ground connection of the 9 volt battery, completing the circuit. Only when this circuit is
fully and properly completed and the battery has sufficient charge to dispatch a current will the LED

  turn on. (Schematics and breadboard diagrams in this book were primarily created using the open
  source program Fritzing.)1

  Schematics don't tell us anything about how the circuit is actually built, and indeed the visuals for the
  different components needed are confusing artwork until their interpretation is provided. But with a
  little bit of practice, schematics become a unique conceptual information source. We can use design
  thinking and rapid prototyping to physically make the circuit using specific parts on hand or acquired
  to achieve something we value, even if it's just good enough to help more than bother us.

                                                            Often times, when you look for a plan or pattern to use
                                                            electronics to perform a certain task, instead of a
                                                            schematic, you'll find a physical diagram of the parts as
                                                            demonstrated in the Fritzing image shown above. This
                                                            diagram is based on someone's layout choices using
                                                            available components to actually implement the circuit
                                                            drawn in the Fritzing schematic at the start of this
                                                            example. In the physical diagram, we see electrical
                                                            components connected using a solderless breadboard,
                                                            a plastic board with conductive clips under groupings
                                                            of plastic holes, thereby allowing the passage of current
                                                            between components.

                                                            At the left of this particular diagram, a red wire brings
  the positive current of the battery to the lower red rail of the breadboard. Another red wire moves it
  from this rail to row J, column 59. Row H, column 59 then connects the current to one leg of a 470 ohm
  resistor, which carries that current, now under resistance, to row H, column 55. This brings the current
  to the positive charge of a 10mm white LED. Row E, column 55 is connected to the negatively charged
  leg of the LED, which then passes to row A, column 55 where it is connected to a black wire that car-
  ries the current to the upper blue rail on the breadboard. A black wire then brings the current to the
  ground connection of the 9 volt battery, completing the circuit.

  As you move forward, you may find yourself exploring and evaluating a variety of online guides,
  resources, and examples and comparing them to what is shown in the book. (Indeed, take a deep dive
  through the many examples found at Adafruit Learning System, from which we draw many for this
  book, for an extraordinarily wide range of electronic systems, along with supporting code.) Sometimes
  you may find schematics. But more often you'll find diagrams illustrating how someone or a group
  have put the circuit into practice. Know that diagrams may be rigid as they tend to focus on a spe-
  cific task in a specific configuration in a specific environment that suits a specific cohort, community,
  or culture. Schematics, on the other hand, are found in more professional settings and as such can be

  applied to a greater range of applications. These schematics, after doing research to define the compo-
  nents illustrated using specific visualizations, will also prove very helpful for problem solving or rapid
  prototyping for all innovators, regardless of experience.
  It may be helpful to think of schematics as standards used for many different applications, projects, and
  occupations. Schematic drawings are relevant for many users from electrical engineers to K-12 stu-
  dents. For example, circuits and schematics are part of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
  Energy Unit for elementary school students in grade 4.2

 Underneath the Hood of the Breadboard

  A solderless breadboard is a plastic board used to create models or prototypes of an electric circuit.
  They're solderless because you can easily push wires into the provided holes and later pull them out
  to move them into new configurations. They come in different shapes and sizes. The most commonly
  used "full sized" breadboard is 6 1/2 long and 2 1/8 wide.
  Below, you'll note several different images of a full sized breadboard. In the first image, you see the
  typical working view of the breadboard.

  In the next image, we see the bottom side of a breadboard. The left half of the center image has the
  sticky covering revealed, while the right half has the protective covering installed. If the breadboard is
  moved around a table or desk, a protective covering remains on the underside of the breadboard (seen
  in the right half of the center breadboard). You can remove that covering to enable the breadboard to
  stick to a surface (seen in the left half of the center breadboard).

2. See Next Generation Science Standards' 4-PS3 Energy for more examples.
15 1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits

In the breadboard image below, we see the underside of a breadboard, but this time with the sticky
tape fully removed. Breadboards typically come with rails along the edges, with conductive metal clips
(two of which are shown at the very bottom of the image) installed so as to carry the flow of current
along the extent of each rail.

If you compare this image of the breadboard metal clips to the image of the top side of a breadboard,
you'll note there's a red colored rail and a blue colored rail on the upper part, and another red rail and
blue rail on the lower part of the breadboard. The red rail is typically used to carry a positive source
to a circuit or series of circuits, while the blue rail is typically used to carry the circuit or series of cir-
                                                                                                                  1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits 16

cuits to ground. The main part of the breadboard connects together groupings of five holes using 126
conductive metal clips.

Thus, column 1, row A is connected to rows B, C, D, and E of column 1 with one metal clip. Column
1, rows F, G, H, I, and J are interconnected with a second metal clip. Column 1, rows A, B, C, D, and E
do NOT connect with column 1, rows F, G, H, I, and J by default. They will only interconnect if a wire
or electronic component is plugged into one of the left holes of column 1 and also to one of the right
holes of column 1, and is set to pass a current from one connection to the other.

Exercise: Building and Testing an Electronics Prototyping Platform

In the previous example, a circuit was created using a 9V battery, as shown in both a schematic and a
diagram. Throughout the rest of this book, we will typically not use a battery to power our electron-
ics. We'll start by using the USB to TTL cable that comes with the toolkit, allowing us to connect the
USB side to a 5-volt power source. The 5-volt power source itself is likely connected to either a 120- or
240-volt power alternating current (AC) source, which it inverts to 5-volt direct current (DC) power.
The TTL side of the cable will only be used for now to provide power through the red cable and ground
through the black cable. Later in the book, we'll also use the white transmit cable and green receive
cable to facilitate data communications between devices.

The image above provides a diagram of the basic configuration of our prototyping breadboard, in
which power is provided using a USB to TTL cable from the toolkit. The basic circuit located on the
breadboard illustrates how 5 volts of current pass through conductive material from the USB to TTL
cable, conductive material within the breadboard, and jumper wires to an electronic component called
an LED, before returning through additional resistors to ground, thereby completing the circuit.

In the above diagram, it is important to note that the only electronic components are the 470  (ohm)
resistors and the Red/Green/Blue (RGB tricolor) LED. The breadboard, jumper wires, and USB to TTL
cable are not electronic components, but rather are forms of conductive material used to carry the cur-
rent from component to component.
17 1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits

Another way to illustrate a circuit is with the schematic below, helping to visualize the single physical
LED as three separate functional LED chips incorporated into a single package. Each of the three
LED chips are themselves small semiconductive materials in which a Light Emitting Diode electronic
component can be embedded.

                                                           In the schematic, there are several standard symbols
                                                           used:
                                                        · The United States standard symbol for a resistor;
                                                        · The symbol for a light emitting diode;
                                                        · The symbol for a connecting lead;
                                                        · The symbol for a junction of conductors; and
                                                        · The symbol for an integrated circuit.
For some, such as an integrated circuit (IC) schematic, IC subcategories are further developed for
the specific specialty component being used, as is the case for the USB-TTL Cable from Adafruit.com.
Inside the blue USB plug case is a USBSerial conversion chip that can work with drivers to provide
Universal Asynchronous Transmit Receive (UART) communications which we'll start using in
this exercise.
Together, these standard symbols are a helpful way to view both diagrams and schematics when start-
ing a new electronics project.

In the above figure, you'll see a range of symbols commonly found within schematics and diagrams.
Note that in this chart, the resistor schematic is a bit different from the one found within the Fritzing
schematic for this exercise, as the Lumen Learning modules use the European standard. The Fritzing

  diagram uses the symbols common within the United States. While most are the same, a few, like resis-
  tors, do differ3.
  For the breadboard exercises in the book, we will be using a RGB (red/green/blue) LED. This three-in-
  one LED makes use of one leg that can either be the common anode with a shared power source for
  the RGB legs, or the common cathode leg with a shared ground source for the three LEDs.
  For exercises throughout this book, we are using the diffused RGB (tri-color) 10mm LED with common
  anode from Adafruit. The anode (longest) leg can accept up to a 5-volt power source. The anode leg
  then connects to each of the red, green, and blue LED "chips" ("chip" is another term for an integrated
  circuit). Each chip connects to its own metal wire, which serves as the cathode leg for that LED. For
  exercises within this book, we then individually return each chip to ground in parallel through three
  resistors.

  In the image above, you will find the shorter red cathode metal leg at the top, then the long anode
  metal leg, the middle-length green cathode metal leg, and finally the short blue cathode metal leg at
  the bottom of the image.

 Steps

                      1. Take the needed parts out of the toolkit:
                                    Full-size breadboard (illustrations will use either a half- or a full-size
                                      breadboard for better visualization of a given step)
                                    USB to TTL cable
                                    RGB LED

                                    materials have one of two different end connector types:
                                              Male-type ends have an exposed conductive metal extending
                                                beyond the protective case.
                                              Female-type ends have a conductive metal hole within a plas-
                                                tic or other non-conductive case into which a male end is
                                                inserted.

                    2. Connect the TTL to USB cable on the far right of the breadboard to provide 5-volt
                        (5v) and ground (GND) sources to the board. In the illustration below, you'll
                        notice the Fritzing software tool used throughout this book for electronics design
                        projects provides a green highlighting of all female holes, which are also now
                        accessible to the male end which was inserted into one of the holes in the conduc-
                        tive series.

                                  Position the breadboard with column 1 towards your left.
                                  Use a male/male jumper cable to connect the female 5-volt (red) TTL

                                    connector of the USB to TTL cable to the lower red rail of the bread-
                                    board. The above illustration highlights that all holes along this red rail
                                    can now be used to connect to this 5-volt power source.
                                  Use a male/male jumper cable to connect the female ground (black) TTL
                                    connector of the USB to TTL cable to the upper blue rail of the bread-
                                    board. The above illustration highlights that all holes along this blue rail
                                    can now be used to connect to this ground source.

                                              NOTE: The color-coding of jumper wire insulation does not
                                                impact the conductive capability of the copper wire within the
                                                insulation. However, it is often used strategically and some-
                                                times through coding standards to indicate a purpose.

                                              In the context of the breadboard and USB to TTL cable, red is
                                                commonly used to indicate a power source within a direct
                                                current (DC) circuit, while black or blue are used to indicate
                                                ground.

                                              In the context of the book, it is also used to indicate the red,
                                                green, and blue legs of the RGB LED.

                                              In practice, packages of jumper wires may be all of the same
                                                color or only a few different colors, and can be used as avail-

                            ability dictates.
                          Depending on the type and level of color blindness, some indi-

                            viduals may need a mix of diverse individual and collaborative
                            approaches to fail forward. This may include strategic color-
                            coding selection, process of elimination, and labeling.
3. Install three 470  resistors on the breadboard.

              Tightly bend down 90 degrees the two legs of each 470  resistor.
                          These are resistors with yellow (associated with the number 4
                            in the 10s column), then violet (associated with the number 7
                            in the 1s column), then brown (associated with times-10 mul-
                            tiply column) bands and are followed by a gold tolerance
                            band.
                          You can also use 560  resistors with green (number 5 in the
                            10s column), then blue (number 6 in the 1s column), then
                            brown bands. The 560  resistors come with some Raspberry
                            Pi Starter Packs and are very similar in resistance capacity to
                            the 470  resistor used in this book.

                            Resistors come with standard 4- or 5-band color coding. This

                                  Attach one leg of the resistor to row E, and the other to row G or there-
                                    abouts. One resistor will be in column 19, one in column 21, one in col-
                                    umn 23.
                                              Each resistor will provide a small amount of resistance to the
                                                current, leaving the red, green, or blue legs of the RGB LED
                                                on its way to ground and completion of the circuit.
                                              As a reminder, rows A, B, C, D, and E have a metal conductor
                                                connecting each together within a given column. Likewise, F,
                                                G, H, I, and J have a separate metal conductor connecting each
                                                together within a given column. A-E is NOT connected to F-J
                                                within a given column by default.
                                              We will use three 470 or 560  resistors to connect the lower
                                                A-E part of the column, to which an anode leg of the RGB
                                                LED is connected, to the upper F-J part of the same column.

4. Install the RGB LED on the breadboard
              Pick up the RGB LED and hold it in your hand matching the order seen in the
                image below, such that the short red cathode leg is at the top, the long anode leg
                next, followed by the mid-length green cathode leg, and finally the blue cathode
                leg at the bottom.

              Bend the mid-length red cathode leg up slightly, and then return it to the right.

              Bend the long anode leg away and then return it to the right.
              Keep the mid-length green cathode leg as is, facing straight to the right.
              Bend the short blue cathode leg down and then return it to the right.
              Turn the RGB LED so that the red cathode leg faces left and the common anode

                leg faces up from the breadboard. Insert the four legs of the RGB LED into the
                breadboard such that the red cathode leg is in column 19, row D, the anode leg is
                in column 20, row C, the green cathode leg is in column 21, row D, and the blue
                anode leg is in column 23, row D.
5. Connect the USB side of the USB to TTL cable to a 5-volt USB power source, such as your
    laptop, or a 120/240-volt power source with power adaptor for a USB connector.
23 1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits

        6. Provide 5-volt current to the shared anode leg of the RGB LED.

                      Connect one leg of a male/male jumper wire to the bottom red rail, and the other
                        leg of the jumper wire to column 20 (the same column as the anode leg), row A.
                                  NOTE: The circuit is not yet complete, as the 5-volt power now flowing
                                    from the USB to TTL into the red rail of the breadboard and then to the
                                    anode leg of the RGB and out through the cathode legs and through the
                                    three resistors does NOT reach the blue ground rail of the breadboard,
                                    and thereby does not return back to a ground source.

        7. Complete the circuit by returning current from each cathode leg of the RGB LED to ground.

                      Connect three male/male jumper wires from the blue ground rail at the top to
                        row J of columns 19 (red cathode leg), 21 (green cathode leg), and 23 (blue cathode
                        leg).
                                  What happens when only one jumper wire is connected between the
                                    resistor and ground at a time?
                                  What happens when two jumper wires are connected at a time? All
                                    three?
                                  How many different LED colors can be achieved with these three base
                                    LED colors?
                                  Does the brightness of the LED change depending on how many cir-
                                    cuits are plugged into a USB hub? Into a USB 1, USB 2, or a USB 3 port
                                    on a laptop? Into another USB 5-volt power source?

Key Takeaways

In this exercise, we've entered into a first apprenticeship crafting a rapid prototyping platforming,
using a USB to TTL cable as a source for power and ground, and using a breadboard as the physical
prototyping base tool. To do this, we brought together several conductor wires, like the male-to-male
jumper wires made of individual wires. To test this platform, we brought together two electronic
components, a resistor and a RGB LED, to provide some literal light on the platform.

In addition to these technical skills, we sought to bring in the development of several socio-emotional
skills, including the ability to communicate and collaborate with others using a "see once, do once,
teach once" strategy using pair/triplet programming, and potentially began exploring how failure
serves as an essential step in project development--that is, a fail-forward mindset.

It's also helpful to think about our daily use technologies as sociotechnical devices that use a specific
form of thinking called deductive reasoning. The bigger picture is broken down into the smallest pos-
sible parts needed to best succeed with the least amount of work. At the initial design phase, the ques-
tions focus on doing the most with the least number of components. On the other side of the coin, the
instructions for others to carry out their own building of the electronic device need to also be written
using deductive reasoning. Personally, I've often found I don't read the instructions if I can just look at
some pictures or watch a video and then work through things myself. But in the electronics realm, this
can bring us to "catastrophic" failures in which the components are no longer usable and new ones
need to be purchased. Sometimes packages include extra parts in expectation of this happening. But
other times, such failure can have unacceptable threats. Consider pilots who have flown thousands of
flights, but still go through the reading of a checklist from beginning to end.

While failure is common and serves as an essential step in project development, when might it be
helpful to add "read once" as a precursor to "see once, do once, teach once"?

There are many ways to design and build electronic artifacts. This can be done as individuals working
to serve personal interests. This can be done as individuals working as experts to serve others broadly
considered. This can be done as individuals working as experts to serve others more strategically. It
can be done in groups randomly or strategically partnered to serve inwards or to serve outwards. It
can be done as a community of practice in ways that include the contributions of a range of stakehold-
ers. And it can be done in so many other ways as well.

Troubleshooting Essentials

Collective leadership and community inquiry using groups of two or three people to collaboratively
test out hands-on work brings together the expertise of multiple individuals.. Failure is common, and
generally remains the norm, from iteration to iteration for an extended period.

To positively fail forward, our iterations are an opportunity for us to discover how our inspirations
and ideations aren't aligning with our past and current iteration prototype. Reflecting on our actions
individually and as part of community inquiry is central to that work of discovery. Said another way,
iterations help us see how one part, much, or all of our working idea is falling short of good enough.
This helps inspire better ideations and sometimes even new inspirations, ultimately leading to better
iterations -- at least for us within the given testing context.

Let me say this again: Trying and failing is not optional. It is the norm. The general alternative to fail-
ing forward is failing to improve.

Accepting failure as a normal, active, ongoing part of what we do leads us to failing forward in ways
that facilitate growth and betterment of ourselves, and when done across functional diversities and
community cultural wealth, the betterment of others as well. In so doing, we foster a high performing
community of practice.

So let's assume the LED did not light up in the last exercise, or that it burned up in the last exercise, or
that it won't light up in the next exercise. Why not? What happened?
                                                                                                                  1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits 26

Humans and other more-than-human persons around us have a rich range of analog senses, such as
sight, hearing, feeling, and smelling. These are a wonderful resource in the troubleshooting process.
These analog senses provide a continuously variable physical quantity, such as the visible wavelengths
of light. This stands in contrast to the digits 0 and 1 that typically represent the values of a physical
quality provided by digital measurements.

Bringing our observations through those analog, continuously variable, senses into a process of critical
thinking helps us create a plan for testing out a range of possibilities. Enacting that plan one step at a
time helps us to continue the cycle of observation, thinking, planning, and acting. This is the heart and
soul of inquiry-based learning as we collaborate in pairs and small groups through dialogue.

Throughout the remainder of the exercises in this book, and as you work through your own design
activities putting your learning into practice, be sure to make extensive, preferably documented, use of
these troubleshooting basics. It's tempting to try it a few times and move on because troubleshooting
the current exercises begins to become second nature. These experiences serve as a learning opportu-
nity, but at the risk of having the learning become hidden knowledge that fails to fully help you as you
encounter future problems.

Indeed, this is a reason why this book has been written using the Creative Commons Attribution-
ShareAlike license. We hope you will add in annotations, page notes, and remixes for yourself and
others to use as sources for their own design thinking projects. We hope the resulting inspirations,
ideations, iterations, and failures support an advancing betterment of ourselves, those in our commu-
nity of practice, and those we are serving through our creative works.

Exercise: Adding a Two-position Switch to Our Circuit

In this activity, we will add a slide switch into our circuit. It is called a "switch" because it changes
the flow of current depending on the state of the switch. This switch creates a change in state when
a physical action happens--in this case, when a slider is moved to the left or to the right. This type of
single pole, double throw (SPDT) switch is a great electronic component to turn something on and off,
or to select between this or that. The center pin provides the rest of the circuit with the results of the
user's choice. The left and right throw pins provide the user with one of two options. We'll be using
this switch in a variety of ways moving forward. For now, we'll connect the single center pole to the
RGB LED, and the right pole to the lower red rail providing a 5-volt power source. The left pole will be
left open. The user then chooses between providing the RGB LED with 5 volts of power (on state) or
no power (off state). When the slide is to the left, we have a closed circuit because the switch creates
a state in which power completes circle over to ground is complete. When the slide is to the right, we
have an open circuit because there is no starting power needed to begin the flow of current required
for a completed circuit.
27 1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits

Steps

        1. Attach a slide switch to columns 28, 29, and 30 of row B.
        2. Connect one end of a male/male jumper wire to column 20, row A, and the other end to

            column 29, row D. This is the common leg of the slide switch.
        3. Connect a second male/male jumper wire to the lower red rail. The other end of this jumper

            wire gets connected to column 30, row D. This is the right selection leg of the slide switch.
        4. Finally, make sure the TTL to USB is plugged into a power source, and then slide the switch

            left and right to turn the RGB LEDs on and off.

Key Takeaways

Designing and building electronic devices needs to include consideration of the mundane--for
instance, turning something on or off. In this second exercise, we've further explored how conductive
materials like a breadboard and jumper wires can be combined with electronic components like a slide
switch to provide the users of an electronic device with such on/off choice. But while mundane, there
are still key aspects shaping the layout.

         · Why might it be that I put the switch where I did?
         · Does the placement work well for you when you work to move the slide left or right?
         · Is there someplace else on the breadboard where you might have placed the slide switch?
If possible, jot down your answers to these reflective question prompts so that you can revisit the ques-
tions and your answers later. Doing so is an essential part of action-reflection cycles that help bring a
new lens of understanding on sociotechnical artifacts such as the electronic circuits we'll be building
throughout the book.
In writing the exercises of this book, I shaped the design of the device for a range of functional, socio-
emotional, and cognitive reasons. As you build it, you have the agency to further shape the design as
you read through and implement the steps of the current activity. Taking time to reflect on actions
and to make a recording of those reflections helps to keep an ongoing account of your socio-techni-
cal praxis as you exercise that agency to innovate-in-use, or stick with the instructions as written, or
                                                                                                                  1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits 28

discover a mistake in the instructions, or make a mistake following those instructions. Reflections like
this go on to provide opportunities not only for you, but for others in a community of inquiry to go
beyond finding and using information. It is in action-reflection that we move collectively from holding
information to advancing a better understanding of the information and of the people and contexts
shaping that information.

Voltage, Resistance, and LED Brightness

Earlier in this chapter, we covered a bit on Ohm's law, which provides a basic equation I=V/R stating
that current (I) is equal to voltage (V) divided by resistance (R). Voltage is like the pressure of water
in a hose. Current, measured in amperage, or amps for short, is like the flow of water through a hose.
The thickness of the hose impacts the resistance of the flow of water through it, which is like the ohms
of resistance in a circuit.

Let's take the water analogy one step further. Imagine the water is now used to turn a wheel, which
is used to power a small mill making gristmill, which is used to turn cereal grain into flour. You can
increase the power generated by the water wheel by either increasing the pressure (voltage) of the
water or increasing the flow (amps) of the water. In electrical terms, this power (P) is called wattage,
or watts.

       The formula for this is Volts x Amps = Watts.

Some may be familiar with, and perhaps make regular use of, lighting in which you can control the
brightness of the light. Perhaps you have a lamp with a three-way light bulb providing three different
watts of power, depending on the position of a rotary switch. Each turn of the light switch steps you
up to the next wattage before returning to off. The lightbulb may state that it is a 60/120/180-watt bulb.
If you are in the United States, you likely plug this lamp into a 120-volt outlet. We now are using one
of three amps of current

         · 60 watts / 120 volts = 0.5 amps
         · 120 watts / 120 volts = 1.0 amps
         · 180 watts / 120 volts = 1.5 amps

If our 120-volt outlet is listed as being a 15-amp circuit, we should keep in mind that if all these lamps
were running at full wattage, we should have a maximum of 15 amps / 1.5 amps = 10 lights at 180
watts.

Let's look back at our RGB LED. It is rated for a maximum of 5 volts. Adafruit has a USB 2.0 Powered
Hub with 7 ports, each with 5 volts at 2 amps. If we were using this for our RGB LED, the common
anode would be receiving

       5 volts x 2 amps = 10 watts of power
29 1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits

But given we have a 470  resistor wired to each cathode leg to assure it doesn't get so much current
that it burns out, each of the parallel circuits is reduced a bit, as we see in Ohm's law (I=V/R):

       5 volts / 470 ohms = .01 amps
       5 volts x .01 amps = .05 watts

To demonstrate, four parallel LED circuits have been created, each receiving different amps of power,
thereby providing different watts of light. The breadboard circuits use the following components:

         · A USB to TTL connected to a USB 2 powered hub providing 5 volts at 2 amps. This is
            attached to a full-sized breadboard as before.

         · A voltage regulator, an electronic component that brings the voltage of a power supply
            down to a level compatible with the other electronic components. Here a voltage regulator
            is being used that can work with 4-20 volts of DC power as the source (in our case, 5 volts
            at 2 amps), which it then regulates down to a stable 3.3 volts DC power.

         · Two 470  and two 10,000  resistors
         · Four 10mm bright white LEDs
                                                                                                                  1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits 30

From left to right, the watts of power of each LED in the image above are as follows:

3.3 volts / 470 ohms = 0.0070 amps = 7.0 mA     3.3 volts x 0.0070 amps = 0.0231 watts = 23.1 mW
3.3 volts / 10,000 ohms = 0.0003 amps = 0.3 mA  3.3 volts x 0.0003 amps = 0.0011 watts = 1.1 mW
5 volts / 470 ohms = 0.0106 amps = 10.6 mA      5 volts x 0.0106 amps = 0.0532 watts = 53.2 mW
5 volts / 10,000 ohms = 0.0005 amps = 0.5 mA    5 volts x 0.0005 amps = 0.0025 watts = 2.5 mW

These are clearly not nearly as bright as a 60-watt light bulb in a house! But as the plastic cases of each
of these bright white LEDs are not diffused like the diffused RGB LEDs we've been using, we can see
how much more they brighten the view of the breadboard, especially the 1/20th of a watt from the 5V
+ 470  LED circuit.

Do Something New!

For some, this is your first journey into electronic circuits. You're Doing Something New
through troubleshooting electronic circuits and failing forward! You are at a "yet-enough"
point to head on down to the Wrap Up and Comprehension Check at the bottom of this
chapter.

For others, you may already have a lived experience with electronic circuits. This is not
something new to you. But if you're at all like me, some of this work has become rote, and
the underlying terms, concepts, and principles hidden knowledge. For you, Doing Something
New may be a work of re-remembering the codes to the electronic wheelhouse. And moving
beyond, maybe it's discovering some of the social influences that have shaped the non-neu-
tral aspects of the otherwise strict laws of physics within.

For all, it's likely that at least some aspects of Collective Leadership, Community Inquiry,
Action-Reflection, the Information Search Process, and Pair/Triplet Programming are new
to you. Do Something New! by incorporating one or two of these into your work, this and
every session, individually and as part of your Community of Practice work.

Below are two Do Something New! exercises putting the above brightness display into prac-
tice using your own starting breadboard circuit prototype, this time using the RGB LED.
How much do they change the brightness of red, green, and blue diffused LEDs? For those
not yet ready to take on the exercises but still wanting to dig a bit more into what's behind
the hood, you can also skim one or both activities themselves and then delve more into the
Key Takeaways of each to advance from understanding less to understanding more.

Exercise: Using a Switch to Compare Differences in Resistance of Current
Flow

In setting up our parallel red, green, and blue RGB LED circuits, each cathode leg is passed through a
470-ohm resistor on the way to ground. The change in amps remains the same whether the resistor is
placed before or after LED within a circuit, in this case 5V/470  = 0.01064 amps (10.64 milliAmps or
mA). The switch is currently used to select between "on," in which case 10.64 mA sent to the common
anode leg of the RGB LED, or "off," in which case no current is sent to the RGB LED.

In this Do Something New! activity, we'll add a new 470  resistor to the left throw pin of the slide
switch. This resistance will be added to each of the three cathode legs so that all three LEDs now pass
through 940 ohms of resistance. Using Ohm's law, 5V/940  = 5.32 mA, or half the 10.64 mA sent to
the common anode leg when the slide switch is to the right.

Steps

        1. Tightly bend down 90 degrees the two legs of a fourth 470  resistor.
        2. Insert one leg of the resistor in column 30, row H, and the other in column 26, row H.
        3. Connect one end of a male/male jumper wire to column 30, row E, and the other end to col-

            umn 30, row F. Now current from the red power rail is passed to rows A-E of column 30,
            the jumper wire attached in step 1, and to rows F-J using a second jumper wire we just
            installed as part of step 2.
        4. Connect one end of another male/male jumper wire to column 26, row F, and the other end
            to column 28, row E. This is the left selection leg of the slide switch.
        5. Finally, make sure the TTL to USB is plugged into a power source. Then slide the switch left
            to examine the brightness of the RGB LEDs when the current passes through an additional
            470 ohms of resistance before entering the shared anode leg of the RGB LED. Compare this
            to the brightness of the RGB LEDs when current enters directly to the shared anode leg of
            the RGB LED.

                      This change will impact the red, green, and blue LEDs differently, as each of these
                        light-emitting diodes work within different ranges. Plus, red alone is different
                        than red plus green, which is different from red plus green plus blue. Try different
                        combinations of red, green, and blue circuits connected to ground to fully test the
                        differences.

                      If you can, take pictures of the RGB LED circuit with the switch to the left and to
                        the right so that you can more readily compare the differences between them.

Below, you can see the schematic of our new circuit, which you can compare to the Fritzing diagram
above. Looking at the standard switch symbol used in the schematic drawing, we see that what passes
from leg 2 over to the common anode leg of the RGB LED is determined by the line that rocks between
legs 1 and 3 of the switch. In designing this circuit, I chose to connect the 5-volt current directly to leg
1, and to run the 5-volt current through a 470  resistor before connecting to leg 3.

Let's further compare our switched resistance schematic above with the schematic from the first exer-
cise, in which the 5-volt current was connected directly to the common anode leg of the RGB LED.
Note that while initially 5 volts flowed directly from the USB to TTL cable to the common anode leg
of the RGB LED, it now first flows through a slide switch, in which it either passes directly to the com-
mon anode leg or passes first through an additional 470  resistor before reaching the common anode
leg.

Key Takeaways

Resistance is a common way to control the brightness of lights. In our breadboard prototype, resistance
changes the flow of current from source into the common anode leg of the RGB LED, and out to ground
by way of the red, green, and blue cathode legs. We have already included 470-ohm resistors in our
red, green, and blue circuits, to assure that the flow of current when connected to a 9-volt battery does
not exceed the amount of current listed within the current rating of the RGB LED we're using. (This
is a general introduction--for more on current ratings of LEDs and how to use this to select power
sources and a resistor for a circuit, I highly recommend "All About LEDs" by Tyler Cooper.) While it
is essential that you include at least the minimum required resistors within your circuit, resistors are
often used to intentionally restrict the flow of current further than required, as a way to control the
brightness of light provided.
The flow of current can be controlled using many different types of switches. You might have lights
at home that can be dimmed. Your mobile phone might let you use a slide to control its brightness.
Or you might be able to enable or disable "nighttime mode" for your clock. When a circuit is designed
to provide a steady gradation in resistance, the type of electronic switch commonly used is called a
variable resistance potentiometer. Potentiometers slowly change the level of resistance provided from
a defined minimum (e.g., 470 ohm) to a defined maximum (e.g., 10K ohm). Below are Fritzing images
of a 10K potentiometer that could be used for our testing.

For this exercise, we used an electronic single pole double throw (SPDT) slide switch. The single com-
mon pole in our exercise is used to connect to the common anode leg of the RGB LED. The two throw
legs are then connected directly to a 5-volt power source and to a 5-volt current that is first passed
through a 470-ohm resistor. Selecting one of the two throw legs of the switch chooses whether to pro-
vide current directly from the rail or via a resistor. The slide switch was selected as a simple means
for comparing two different conditions--this one or that one. In the above, we used it first to choose
between off and on. Then we chose between a direct 5-volt connection and a 5-volt connection with
470-ohm resistance. And next we'll use it to choose between different voltages.

         · How does the brightness of the light from the RGB LED--either together or in different
            combinations or red, green, and blue--change when the slide switch is moved left or right?
            Why, and how much?

         · What are some reasons you can think of that I decided to design the selection and use of
            the LEDs, resistors, switches, and wires in the way that I did to set up your execution of
            this activity?

            better way for you to complete this activity?

Exercise: Using a Switch to Compare Differences in Voltage

For this second Do Something New! activity, let's use the two-way switch to select between a 5-volt and
a 3.3-volt current, to consider how a difference in the voltage of current compares to a difference in the
resistance--that is, the flow of current. Today's USB standard works with 5-volt direct current (DC).
Most homes and offices have wall outlets that use 120V or 240V alternating current (AC). A power
converter is used to switch from alternating to direct current. 5-volt DC has proved a solid choice for
many electronic circuits, but others, like fans and motors, often make use of the widely used 12-volt
direct current. And some electronics have worked to reduce power usage by going the other direction,
decreasing current to 3.3 volts. Unlike the AC voltage standards used within different countries, the
3.3V, 5V, and 12V DC are not standards, just widely used voltages. When selecting electronic compo-
nents, it's important to identify the range of voltages which can be used for that component and to
plan accordingly.

The RGB LED we're using has a maximum forward current rating of 20 milliamps (mA). Looking back
at the start of this chapter, we saw a demonstration of a circuit built using a 9-volt battery and a 470
ohm resistor. Together, 9 volts at 470 ohm is 19 mA, just under the 20-mA maximum current rating of
many of the LEDs we use today. Using a 5-volt power source, we could have safely gone down to a 100
ohm resistor, but stayed with the 470 ohm resistor in case a 9-volt battery was used instead of a 5-volt
USB power source. Together, 5 volts at 470 ohm is 10.6 mA. If we go the other direction, down to 3.3
volts at 470 ohm, we are now at 7 mA, or 1/3rd of the amperage used with 9-volt power and 2/3rd the
amperage used with the 5-volt power.

Keeping resistance constant, how does decreasing current usage by decreasing power impact the
brightness of an LED? Let's find out by using a voltage regulator. A voltage regulator is useful when
you have a possible range of voltages for a power source, but are needing a stable voltage for your
electronics. Look at your laptop power adaptor, and it will likely say it can work within the range of
110V to 240V AC input. It will also list a stable DC output voltage or voltages to be provided regardless
of the input voltage.

In our case, we'll use a voltage regulator that can work with 4-20 volts of DC power as the source,
which it then regulates down to a stable 3.3 volts of DC power. To keep this simple, we'll replace the
10k ohm resistor with the voltage regulator. But this could be connected to its own switch that then
feeds into the slide switch used for the resistor to do a 2×2 comparison of resistance and voltage on
LED brightness. And as an important side note, the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi we'll be using in ses-
sion four of the Orange Unit provide both pins with 5-volt power, which they receive from the micro-
USB or USB-C plugin and pins with voltage regulated 3.3-volt power, allowing us to bring both to the
breadboard for ongoing use. This Do Something New! provides a first glimpse at some possibilities for
                                                                                                                  1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits 36

if we were connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO instead of the USB to TTL cable for breadboard power
and ground.

Steps

        1. Return to the on/off switch circuit for the RGB LED
                      Remove the 470  resistor and associated jumper wires.

        2. Connect an LD33V voltage regulator such that the LD33V label is facing the switch.
        3. Use jumper wires to provide the ground and 5V power sources to the regulator, and con-

            nect the regulator output to the left throw leg of the switch.
        4. Finally, make sure the TTL to USB is plugged into a power source. Then slide the switch left

            to examine the brightness of the RGB LEDs when 3.3 volts of power are provided, com-
            pared to when the switch is to the right and 5 volts of power are provided.

                      If you can, take pictures of the RGB LED circuit with the switch to the left and to
                        the right so that you can more readily compare the differences between these.

Key Takeaways

This layout of the breadboard now provides an opportunity to compare brightness depending on volt-
age. For this exercise, we incorporated another commonly used electronic component, known as a
voltage regulator, to take the 5 volts of power provided through the USB to TTL cable and regulate it
down to a stable 3.3 volts of DC power. As we've now seen in these two Do Something New! activities,
there are two ways to adjust the brightness of an LED: by changing resistance and by changing volt-
age.

        1. Of these different layouts, how does voltage change brightness when all else is equal? How
            does this compare to the brightness when the 5-volt power remains consistent and resis-
            tance is changed, as was done in the second exercise?

        2. What are some key takeaways regarding the brightness of LEDs, given the combined fac-
37 1B: Introduction to Electronic Circuits

            tors of different power sources and resistance levels?

Wrap Up

This is just a first glimpse at electronic circuits and some ways we can work hands-on in design
and prototyping of new circuits. We've learned a few basics of creating a completed circuit and how
to troubleshoot when the circuit doesn't seem be working. We've learned out to use components to
switch the circuit from complete (on) to incomplete (off), and how to switch between levels of resis-
tance and voltage to change the brightness of an LED. Along the way, we've started discovering there
are many choices to be made. For instance, both resistance and voltage can be used to control the
brightness of a light. But while batteries and AC outlets generate power for use by electronics, resis-
tors and LEDs make use as Tyler Cooper notes near the end of "All About LEDs." Use the lowest volt-
age possible to get a sufficiently bright LED. But beyond that, switching between voltages can become
laborious if you need to regularly change brightness. That's when resistors especially come into play.
On the other hand, too often we continue make use of resistors and voltage regulators to stay with
the same large power generators we've always used when more environmentally friendly low power
sources could be used if this is kept in mind during design.

And so there have also been some question prompts urging you to question the reasoning behind the
design of the circuits themselves. Accomplishing an electronics goal can be achieved using many dif-
ferent components and circuit designs. Helping others to build, make use of, and further innovate elec-
tronics is yet another place allowing for extensive variations. It's important we keep front and center
these extended question prompts if we are to rapidly shift from a thing- to a person-orientation as we
work to demystify technology.

There's much more to come as we proceed through the Orange Unit and beyond. For now, take a few
minutes to do a quick comprehension check on some of the key circuit terms and concepts we've used
so far.

Comprehension Check

[The following is an interactive element from the online edition that has been remediated into a dif-
ferent form for the PDF. For an interactive version with answers, see the online version.]

            electric current can flow? Choose all that apply.

    that the associated white LED in these circuits had a different level of brightness. Sort the

 Digital Technology = Social + Technical

  There's a growing realization that our digital technologies are actually a seamless, indivisible combi-
  nation of artifacts, people, organizations, policies, economics, histories, cultures, and knowledge - that
  they are sociotechnical products. And over the last several decades, this has gone further to acknowl-
  edge a mutual shaping of gender and technology.1 As a result, the reliable, anticipatable relation-
  ship between user input and system output is complicated by the continuous evolution of experience,
  knowledge, history, culture, economics, and policies of users and society. The social characteristics
  cannot be readily planned for or controlled, especially as sociotechnical products are continuously co-
  created by everyday users to fit the ever-changing contexts and knowledge of users and their commu-
  nities.2 As such, a reductionist and positivist approach and associated deductive reasoning common in
  much of basic research must be complemented by, and live in continuous tension with, an interpretive
  approach and associated inductive reasoning of the social scientists, and even more importantly, with
  the community cultural wealth, expertise, and knowledges of community members.

Innovations-in-Use

[A]n innovation is not an object that can be packed inside a box, but rather a set of practices
that emerges from the social setting of its use. Thus, in a sense, the user does not accept or
reject an innovation but instead creates it through action in the world.

Bertram Bruce, Andee Rubin, and Junghyun An, "Situated Evaluation of Socio-Technical
Systems"

In his thought-provoking 2015 book, Geek Heresy, Kentaro Toyama notes that technology does not
itself have agency to transform us and the world around us. Rather, humans use technology to amplify
our individual and group forces to transform our world. This is primarily framed from the perspective
of the everyday user. However, if we bring criticality together with an interpretive sociotechnical per-
spective, we also need to reflect on the human forces amplified at each level of a product's life cycle.34
We need to ask: How are the forces of engineers, computer scientists, and garage inventors; of the
president, CEO, board, and shareholders of corporations; of the marketers and salespeople; of govern-
ment legislators and administrators; of educators and social service agencies; of individuals and groups
as co-creators; and of the many others in the product life cycle, amplified in ways that are consistent
with and counter to the values and goals of those using the sociotechnical product at each stage of the
artifact's life cycle?

  Each stakeholder, from the everyday user/co-creator to the government and corporate official, brings
  their unique history, intersectionality, expertise, etc., to bear, amplifying the influencing social and
  technical structures of the digital technologies around us. The personal and social aspects thereby
  shape the code, software, and information -- as well as the physical electronics on which the code, soft-

ware, and information reside. At the same time, the code, software, information, and physical structure
shape the individuals and social structures making use of those technologies. Given this amplification
and mutual shaping of the sociotechnical artifacts and the overarching systems, what literacies are
required for us to move from passive consumers to active innovators-in-use of digital technologies?

Community Inquiry as the Basis for Digital Literacy Radically Reconsidered

         · Application skills: The ability to integrate the above skills into our everyday experiences
            in order to advance our professional, personal, and civic interests and responsibilities.

If we are to assure active participation in civic society and meaningful, diverse and inclusive contri-
butions to vibrant, informed, and engaged community, it is essential to add the social justice-oriented
progressive community [inter]action and critical social + technical skills to these other five points.

         · The critical social + technical skills are brought forward as part of person- and commu-
            nity-centered deliberative dialogue processes using critical research paradigms, pedagogies,
            and abductive reasoning in combination with each of the five commonly considered digital
            literacy skills listed above.

         · Progressive community [inter]action skills are simultaneously used in combination
            with the starting five digital literacy skills by advancing our ability to work together in
            communities of inquiry that make continued use of collective leadership, functional diver-
            sity, members' capability sets and freedom of choice to better achieve valued beings and
            doings, community cultural wealth, and care work and ethics.

Whether as part of preprofessional and professional development of library and information manage-
ment workers, or as part of programming offered by these professionals, a radical reconsideration of
digital literacy is essential if we are to effectively use sociotechnical products to amplify human forces
which advance human and community development. This social-forward approach to digital literacy
training doesn't negate learning about the nuts and bolts of the hardware and software. It instead
works to advance our critical social + technical skills so as to situate such learning within the individ-
ual and group goals and values.

A Person-Centered Approach to Digital Literacy

Strategies

         · Meet with stakeholders to understand what creative works participants would like to do
            and what digital technologies might be needed to do them.

         · Incorporate digital literacy training as infill into projects as needed.
         · Include exercises exploring all dimensions of socio-technical artifacts.
         · Intersperse discussion and critical reflection with hands-on activities to bring to the fore

            participants' human and social expertise to complement hardware and software skills
            development.

Goals

         · Achieve the creative works as determined by participants during stakeholder meetings.
         · Advance participants' capability set (the increased existence, sense, exercise, and achieve-

            ment of choice).
         · Increase participant's ability to select and appropriate strategies/technologies that align

            with their values and goals.
         · Counter the dehumanizing impacts of digital technologies.
         · Work towards the essential outcome of more resilient, inclusive, and just communities.
43 2A: Critical Social + Technical Perspective

Values

Technology is shaped by and shapes society. From this starting point, we posit that:
         · The social, cultural, historical, economic, and political values and practices of stakeholders
            at each point in an artifact's life cycle tend to become embedded within that artifact.
         · There are exclusionary social structures, some of which we actively -- even if unintention-
            ally -- reinforce through our choices and actions regarding technology creation and use.
         · Digital literacy without a critical and sociotechnical perspective is at risk of fostering magi-
            cal thinking and technological utopianism.
         · A liberative approach to technology requires lived and academic expertise within multiple
            domains, including hardware, software, human, community, social, cultural, historical,
            political, and economic.

Key Takeaways

         · Those of us with technical expertise may enter into an engagement as digital literacy
            instructors, but we also need to be willing learners if we are to understand the exclusionary
            social structures embedded within sociotechnical artifacts and thereby champion justice.

         · The digitally excluded and participants from the margins of society may enter into digital
            literacy training as learners, but also bring essential sociotechnical expertise and teaching
            to communities of inquiry.

         · Difference is not just a nicety, but an essential resource in building more resilient, inclusive,
            and just communities.

Advancing digital inclusion, equity, and literacy often presents unique information needs and poten-
tially burdensome financial, human, and infrastructure challenges. Partnerships among stakeholders,
including those from the information sciences and information management, often serve at the front
lines to mitigate these challenges. But how do we best help organizations build the capacity to meet
the information needs of communities? In what ways can we develop 21st century skills to foster indi-
vidual, social, and economic development? How can we integrate standards and frameworks such as
collective leadership, community inquiry, action-reflection cycles, information seeking, studio-based
learning and design thinking, collaborative programming and computational thinking, and creativity,
play, and tinkering into the partnership process?

Lesson Plan

While the focus of the technical chapter, "Electronic Components in Series," is on how we can reuse
the LEDs and resistors in combination with momentary switch push buttons, it is important for us to
also continually reflect on the social aspects of these sociotechnical artifacts. Our educational and pro-
                                                                                                                 2A: Critical Social + Technical Perspective 44

  fessional systems are built so as to often separate these two aspects. How can we work together in this
  session and in each of the following sessions to identify ways in which mutual shaping and amplifica-
  tion of sociotechnical artifacts has happened or is happening with this moment? How are we working
  to further the gendering of the artifacts? How are we working to problematize these artifacts so as to
  advance a more person-centered approach?

  Our RGB LED is part of a larger electric circuit providing power to the wall outlets, and from there to
  the breadboards, and finally to the anode leg of the RGB LED. Wall outlet electric circuits generally
  work in series with the wall outlet connected to one of the many branch circuit breakers within the
  building's main service panel. The wall outlet then connects to the next wall outlet, which connects
  to the next, which then connects to the next, creating a series of wall outlets on this branch circuit.1
  When different electronic devices are plugged into different wall outlets, each electronic device is
  working parallel to the other electronic devices.

           · Unplugging one circuit from the breadboard--for instance, by disconnecting the voltage
              regulator used to switch 5-volt power to 3.3-volt power used by two for four bright white
              LEDs used in session one of the orange unit--does not disrupt the other parallel circuits on
              the breadboard.

           · Unplugging something connected to a wall outlet will disrupt the flow of current to itself
              and everything else connected to it in series, as would be the case if we unplugged the USB

1. This is a simple example for descriptive purposes. In practice, one outlet might be the only one on a branch circuit, as is
  done for high-demand devices like an electrical stove and rangetop cooking combination or a large refrigerator. Or the
  wall outlet might branch to two other wall outlets creating two branch series circuits.
                                                                                     46

              to TTL cable from a wall outlet, which then removes the flow of current to all circuits on
              the breadboard.
           · Unplugging something connected to one receptacle of a two-receptacle wall outlet does not
              disrupt the electrical device plugged into the other, as they are running in parallel to each
              other, as would be the case if two different USB to TTL cables were plugged in two different
              receptacles on one wall outlet.
           · Unplugging something from this one wall outlet does not disrupt the flow of current pass-
              ing along the electrical wiring connecting the other wall outlets in series with this branch
              circuit.
           · Plugging something into one wall outlet that requires more amps than provided by this one
              branch circuit, or plugging in multiple electronic devices that together require more amps
              than provided by this one branch circuit, will likely trigger the breaker for this branch cir-
              cuit, stopping the flow of current to everything on this series.2
           · Disconnecting the electrical wires between one wall outlet and the next further down in the
              series does not disrupt the functioning of electrical devices running on this wall outlet, or
              the functioning of those before this one in the series.
           · Turning off the branch circuit breaker in the main service panel turns off all wall outlets
              running in series from this branch circuit, along with all electrical devices plugged into
              these wall outlets.
           · Turning off the main breaker in the main service panel turns off this and all other branch
              circuit breakers, which turns off all wall outlets, lights, and other electronic components
              running in series from each of the branch circuit breakers.

  Looking specifically at our current breadboard configuration, the on/off slide switch is in series, with
  the USB to TTL cable on the upstream side and the anode leg of the RGB LED on the other. Unplugging
  the USB to TTL cable breaks the flow of current for all devices on the breadboard. Sliding the switch
  from on to off breaks the flow of current to the anode leg of the RGB LED. But beyond the anode leg,
  the three LED chips of the RGB LED work in parallel. Failure of one LED chip does not necessarily
  mean the other two LED chips will fail, depending on cause of failure. As we discovered in the first
  activity of Orange Unit 1B, we could plug only one of the three chips into the blue ground rail, and
  it would work even as the other two did not because of their lack of a ground connection completing
  that circuit. If the resistor for one failed, the other two parallel circuits would continue to work.

  Consider strings of holiday lights, along with other lights plugged into the wall outlets of a circuit.
  Modern holiday lights will continue to work even if one light within the string fails--each light is its
  own parallel circuit on the string. But in some cases, there may be two separate series of lights, so
  that if one series reaches an open state, only half the lights stop working. The second, parallel series of
  lights remain in a closed state. Also consider that the lights plugged into one wall outlet do not impact

2. Within the United States context, general-purpose wall outlets typically provide 120 volts at 15- or 20-amps.
                                                                                                                        2B: Electronic Components in Series 48

  the lights plugged into other outlets, unless together the number of lights all plugged in require more
  amps than can be provided by this branch circuit of wall outlets running in series. The different lights
  are working in parallel to each other.

 Exercise: Momentary Switch RGB LEDs in Series

  In this activity, we will add three momentary switch push button electronic components. As with the
  slide switch we added in the first unit, the push button is called a "switch" because it changes the flow
  of current depending on the state of the switch. These push buttons are called "momentary" switches
  because this change in state only occurs while a physical action is happening--in this case, the pressing
  of the button. Each switch is connected in series with one of the RGB LED cathode legs that them-
  selves are running in parallel to each other.

  In the Fritzing3 schematic above, the momentary switch push button symbols for the green and blue
  cathode legs of the RGB LED are in their default state, and so they are not connected to ground and
  are open circuits. As the circuits are incomplete, the green and blue cathode legs are "off," just as they
  are when the slide switch slides to the left, or off, pin, and do not receive current at the beginning
  of the circuit cycle. The momentary switch push button symbol for the red cathode leg, on the other
  hand, is in the momentary pressed position. As a result, there is a line connecting the cathode leg and
  470 ohm resistor to the rest of the cycle moving to ground. In this schematic, the slide switch symbol
  also indicates it is in the "on" position to provide 5V power to the common anode leg, so the red LED
  circuit is temporarily a closed circuit, and the red LED is lit!
  This is represented in the diagram below, with two brown momentary switch push buttons for the
  green and blue cathode legs of the RGB LED, and a black momentary switch push button for the red
  cathode leg of the RGB LED.

49 2B: Electronic Components in Series

Each of the momentary switch push buttons has four legs, paired such that two on each side bend
slightly out and then back in. Each pair is designed to sit above or below the center line, delineating
A-E from F-J of a column. Each pair consists of a side 1 and a side 2 of the switch as labeled within the
schematic, in which the sides are by default disconnected and are only momentarily connected when
the button is pushed down. In so doing, the flow of current is passed through the switch.

Steps

        1. Disconnect the male/male jumper wires connecting the red, green, and blue cathode legs
            of the RGB LED to the upper blue rail of the breadboard.

        2. Straighten the four legs of the momentary switch.
                      The design of the legs for the switches is primarily for a permaproto board, a
                        breadboard that requires connections be joined together by putting a melted filler
                        metal into the joints.
                      That said, the legs of the switch can also work in our breadboards where there the
                        conductive ends of wires and electronic components are slid into the metal filler.
                      To improve these, use a flathead screwdriver or some pliers to straighten each of
                        the four legs on each of the switches.

        3. Connect one switch to columns 1 and 3. Connect a second switch to columns 7 and 9. Con-
            nect a third switch to columns 12 and 15.
                                                                                                          2B: Electronic Components in Series 50

4. Using three male/male jumper wires, connect row J of columns 3, 7, and 11 to the upper
    blue rail of the breadboard as shown in the diagram.

5. Using three more male/male jumper wires, connect row J of columns 5, 9, and 13 to row J of
    columns 26, 28, and 30. In so doing, you now have set up three switched circuits for the red,
    green, and blue cathode legs of the RGB LED!

6. This may prove a "not yet" moment for one or more of these circuits.

    Bring together pair programming and our troubleshooting strategies to fail forward for any
    breadboards that are not yet working on your pod. Be sure not to have those who have
    reached a state of "yet" fix the problem for others, but rather provide extra eyes on the
    instructions and troubleshooting strategies list to work collaboratively on the problem. In
    so doing, all have the potential for social and technical learning beyond what either partner
    might do individually.

Key Takeaways

The flow of an electric current through a circuit occurs in a predictable and controllable fashion, and
deductive reasoning serves exceptionally well in the exploration of that which is predictable and con-
trollable. As we saw in this exercise, no matter the physical change we make with the momentary
switch push button, current always passes through the resistor and through one leg of the momentary
switch. The momentary switch plays a make-or-break role. For our momentary switch, while the
button is unpressed, it is in a break state, and the circuit does not reach ground to complete the circuit.
It is an open circuit. We also saw that when the push button is sufficiently pressed to reach a make
state, current flows to the other leg of the switch. Only in returning the current to ground does it move
from an open to a closed state. It is a now a closed circuit. In the above Fritzing image, the black dot
in the center of the red momentary switch is used to indicate a pressed button, while the brown dots
of the green and blue momentary switches are used to indicate buttons that are not pressed.
We've now seen several of the many forms in which switches come. In this exercise, the slide switch
and momentary switch push buttons are mechanically moved between the make state and the break
state. In this aspect, they are like the mechanical breaker switch of a building's main electrical panel
and the multiple branch circuit breakers within the main panel which was explored to introduce this
chapter. As with the slide switch, breakers can be physically moved from the make, or ON, side, to the
break, or OFF, side. For building electrical, though, these breaker switches also have additional compo-
nents to electrically trigger mechanical movement of these under certain circumstances, such as when
electronic devices are pulling more amperage than is allowed by the breakers.
This exercise also compared the view of a circuit using schematics and diagrams which could be
viewed simultaneously with the physical, constructed breadboard prototype. As we seek to demystify
technology, we'll continue to see how multiple points of view help to fill in gaps in our understanding
of what is actually happening "beneath the hood," and how we might implement it in our own works
to shape its impact in our daily lives.

Exercise: Adding LED Sequins in Series and in Parallel

In the first session of the Orange Unit, we discovered that if you increase the size of the resistor from
470  to 10,000 , the brightness of an LED is reduced considerably. Indeed, the increased resistance
dims the LED more than a reduction in the voltage of our electrical source from 5 volts to 3.3 volts.

When working with electrical conductors, there is a proportional relationship between three measure-
ments influencing the passage of an electrical charge:

         · Electromotive force, listed in volts (e.g., 5V, 3.3V)
         · Electrical resistance, listed in ohms (e.g., 560 ohms, 10K ohms)
         · Electrical current, listed as amperes, or amps

The influence of different voltages and different ohms on the brightness of an LED was tested in several
ways to demonstrate that as we increase voltage, we also increase brightness. On the other hand, as
we increase the ohms of resistance, we decrease brightness. This is because voltage increases current,
while resistance decreases current.

And it is current that is used by an LED to make light. More current, more light.

A fourth measurement, watts, is a comprehensive measurement of power as influenced by the
above three measurements. You may recognize the term "watts" in relation to lighting, as in a 60-watt
incandescent light bulb. An equivalent-brightness LED light bulb would use about 8.5 watts of power.
Our 10-millimeter diffused RGB LED is rated at 150 milliwatts (mW) of power at maximum.

Like lights everywhere, they dissipate power in a predictable physical manner, such that at a certain
point, increasing the number of LEDs within a defined circuit decreases the brightness of those LEDs.

In this exercise, we will temporarily add two LED Sequins into the mix. Each Sequin is an integrated
circuit comprised of a resistor and an LED. These are incorporated onto a printed circuit board along
with conducting material, such that when voltage and ground sources are applied to the + and - strips,
the LED is lit. If you pick one of these up, you'll notice they look and feel like some sort of flat plastic
or other material. That's the feel of a typical printed circuit board (PCB) used as the base for each of
the microcontrollers and microcomputers we make use of daily.

For this activity, we'll add one LED Sequin integrated circuit in series with the red cathode leg of the
RGB LED. Breaking the slide switch, LED, or momentary switch connections in any way breaks the
circuit for all items working in the series. We'll add a second LED Sequin integrated circuit that will
work in parallel to the other LED Sequin. As it is connected directly to its own 5-volt and ground rails,
it will remain a closed circuit as long as power is provided to the breadboard. Together, these will allow
us to further test the relationship of electronic components within a series and in relation to those of
other electronic components in other, parallel circuits.
53 2B: Electronic Components in Series

Note within the schematic that we have four parallel LED circuits:
         · A red parallel LED circuit in series with an LED Sequin, a resistor, and a momentary switch,
            all with a single lead to ground.
         · A blue parallel LED circuit in series with its own resistor and momentary switch with a
            separate lead to ground.
         · A green parallel LED circuit in series with its own resistor and momentary switch with a
            third separate lead to ground.
         · A second parallel LED circuit with its own resistor and a fourth separate lead to ground.

Steps

        1. Attach a male/alligator clip jumper wire from row A of column 3 to the + side of the sequin.
        2. Attach a male/alligator clip jumper wire from row A of column 1 to the - side of the sequin.
                                                                                                                    2B: Electronic Components in Series 54

        3. Press the "red" momentary switch to confirm that both the Red RGB LED and Sequin LED
            series now light up when pressed.

        4. Attach a 470  resistor in column 25 to bring together rows A-E and F-J.
        5. Connect a male/male jumper wire from the red 5V rail at the bottom to any available hole

            in rows A-E of column 25.
        6. Connect a male/alligator clip jumper wire in any available hole in rows F-J of column 25

            and to the + side of the sequin.
        7. Connect a male/alligator clip jumper wire to the top blue ground rail and to the - side of

            the sequin. This sequin should remain on, independent of the condition of any of the other
            LED circuits.
There are now four parallel LED circuits with different light colors, brightnesses, and conditions in
which they move from off to on and back.

Key Takeaways

There is a key distinction between circuits that are running in parallel versus those running in
series. If there are LEDs in parallel, there are multiple paths current can flow from source to ground.
If the LEDs are in series, there is only one path from source, through the LEDs, and back to ground.
Look again at the schematic for this exercise:

Trace the route from 5V to GND for the Sequin in parallel. The current flows from a 5V power source
through a resistor and into the plus (+) side of the Sequin. It then leaves the negative (-) side of the
Sequin before passing to GND. At the same time, the schematic makes note that as ground is reached
55 2B: Electronic Components in Series

through the blue rail of the breadboard, it completes the flow of the circuit down the same path as
the other circuits. But this Sequin is doing it in parallel to the circuits of the other LEDs.

Now trace the path of the Sequin in series. The current leaves the 5V and passes through the slide
switch, which if "on" sends the flow of current to the common anode leg of the RGB LED. Here it takes
the path leading it to the red cathode leg of the LED and passes through the resistor before entering
one leg of the momentary switch. If this switch is pushed down, both the Sequin and the "red" RGB
LED pass through an opposite leg of the momentary switch and return to ground. These LEDs are run-
ning in series to each other. There is only one path for both to progress from 5V to GND.

Circuits in parallel and series each have their pluses and minuses. The Sequin in parallel is not con-
trolled by the slide switch and so has a constant brightness compared to the Sequin that passes through
the slide switch and can be switched on or off. This is an advantage if you want an LED with constant
brightness to give you an indication of something being plugged into a wall outlet or being active. It
is a negative if you want to be able to turn off a light even though it still has 5-volt power available.

Of importance, note that we also find the amount of electricity used in the parallel LED circuit is dou-
ble that used for the LEDs in series. There is a higher power consumption that would drain a battery
faster or would require more power sent to the building from the electrical grid. While minute in over-
all terms, this is an important consideration when working to reduce overall power consumption.

When LEDs run in parallel, they each get one hundred percent of the current passing through the cir-
cuit. When LEDs run in series, they share a percentage of the current--in this example, fifty percent
each. Since brightness depends on the amount of current passing through, the parallel Sequin will be
brighter than the series Sequin. You'll also note the brightness of the red RGB LED dims as well. Each
of the three cathode legs of the RGB LED are running in parallel as they each follow a unique path
back to ground. If each of these also had their own Sequin running in series, the cost in brightness
might be offset by only using the 5V power option, by decreasing the resistor from 470 ohms, or a
combination of the two.

As we see with hanging lights, those connected in series mean that a break at one point breaks every-
thing within that series as the flow of current is switched from closed to open. Lights in parallel allow
for one LED to break while others continue to work.

As we see from this example, there is often no clear and consistent answer as to which is the better cir-
cuit. And it's here that strategic design joined with rapid prototyping and testing across diverse com-
munities of users can help arrive at a better answer. Best does not exist, as we can never fully know
the contexts for each user. Nor can we fully anticipate (or sometimes even make a rough guess regard-
ing) the changes in context for a given user. As we move forward in this book, the takeaways here
will hopefully help as we delve ever deeper into the sociotechnical devices and systems from which
we select, and which we use and help others to use as part of our daily lives.

Do Something New!

We'll come back to the RGB LED circuitry on the breadboard in session 4 of the Orange Unit,
where we'll use the right half of the breadboard to make connections with the Raspberry Pi
general purpose input and output pins. This way, we can use Python programming code to
read momentary switch inputs and open and close the RGB LED circuits. Then, at the start of
the Rainbow Unit, we'll bring together the programmable RGB LED circuitry of the Orange
Unit with the programmable Toolbox Trumpet microcontroller we'll use in the Blue Unit to
create a demonstration model that could potentially be used to make your own Internet of
Things device.

As we've worked through the exercises in sessions one and two of the Orange Unit, one key
takeaway has been to encourage consideration of how demystifying technology requires
risk-taking that brings us to moments of failure. As we observe these "not-yet" occurrences,
think through possible social as well as technical factors shaping these occurrences, develop
a plan for testing, and then act one step at a time upon this plan, we see in new ways what
is underneath the hood of electronics. We begin unpacking how it is shaped by others. We
start seeing how failure is sometimes as much a mismatch between the shaper and the user
of the device as it is our failing. And we start thinking more deeply about how we can work
to either align ourselves with the shapers of the technology or find ways to further shape
the technology ourselves to better align with our ways of using it. To do this, we also are
unpacking the importance of reflecting on our various creative actions and making written
or spoken recordings of those actions and reflections. Failing forward can be a mix of chang-
ing our way of doing something and of changing how that something gets done.

In reflecting back on your actions and reflections of sessions one and two, have there been
some moments when you found a mismatch between my shaping of the circuit's design and
your use of that circuit? Have you had a flash of inspiration regarding a better way to do the
layout of the circuit to perhaps make it more usable for you?

Here's an opportunity to Try Something New! using the breadboard, wires, and electronics
as the rapid prototyping tool they're intended to be. Consider testing out your idea(s) by
rebuilding the switched power for the common anode of the RGB LED; the red, green, and
blue momentary switched circuits; and/or the sequin LED circuits using columns 1-30 of the
breadboard. Perfection is not on the table; bravery is!

Wrap Up

This exploration of electronics lays the foundation for what we may want to design and create as part
of our ongoing person-centered valued designs and builds. You can likely find many other electronics
57 2B: Electronic Components in Series

in tinker- and makerspaces around you, which you could use to further dig into the many compo-
nents used in the electronics of which you make daily use. Demystifying technology in this way can
sometimes be an essential act helping you to see some of the situations limiting you or others from
being and doing what you most value. This requires us to move beyond technical skills development,
though, to include additional skills that help us to continually probe the mutual shaping and amplifi-
cation of sociotechnical devices that has happened and is happening within this moment. As we work
to problematize these sociotechnical artifacts, we also have the potential for advancing a more person-
centered approach within our personal and professional lives.

 Background Knowledge Probe

          1. Draw a picture of an innovation in the process of being innovated.
          2. Looking at your completed drawing, consider the following:

                        Describe the innovation in your drawing. What might be its uses? What might be
                          its impact once it is released to the target population?

                        Who is doing the innovation? Why? For what goal(s)?

 Who Shapes Technology?

  "A Critical Social + Technical Perspective" and associated essential resources highlighted ways tech-
  nologies are a seamless, indivisible combination of social and technical components that are co-created
  by everyday users. But as Wajcman notes, those things white, male, and middle- and upper-class inno-
  vators primarily focus on creating are specific "male machines" rather than broader, everyday life
  technologies.1 When workshop and class participants are asked to draw a picture of "an innovator
  innovating," many draw individual white men innovating the modern digital technology machine. This
  tendency towards drawing innovations and their innovators in this way is a representation of the cur-
  rent dominant narrative in much of U.S. culture.
  We also considered how once developed and made available for broader use by people, technologies
  do not remain static, but rather are adapted and co-created to fit within ever-changing contexts.2 The
  co-creation happens when uses of technology are done in ways that amplify our individual and group
  actions in the world.3 While this mutual shaping of technologies is ongoing, we often think of the dig-

  ital technology product itself in the more static conceptualization. As such, often in these drawings
  of an innovator innovating, it's a certain subgroup of initial innovators, and does not include in the
  drawing the intermediary and everyday co-creators of a digital technology. Nor do we include in the
  drawing those who are shaping the innovation and design as part of the engineering, coding, market-
  ing and distribution, and other stages of the product's life cycle.

  Take a moment to review your picture of an innovation in the process of being innovated, and reflect
  on your considerations of the questions above. In what ways might your readings and works so far in
  the book have influenced your response to the Background Knowledge Probe?

 Broadening our Understanding of Creating

  Today's Maker movements often emphasize a broader set of activities in the process of making some-
  thing. While some of these spaces emphasize specific digital technologies, many others view this more
  broadly as craft-making. As Bruce Sinclair notes:

        Since the nineteenth century, engineering in this country has depended on a published liter-
        ature and on advanced formal instruction that has included physics and mathematics. Craft
        skill depends on a different kind of knowledge, most of it unwritten and learned on the job.
        Apprenticeship--whether institutionalized or not--rests on emulation and repetitive prac-
        tice in the interest of acquiring manual skills, and it is married to experience with the ways
        in which materials behave in different circumstances. Not only is this kind of knowledge
        complex and difficult to transfer; it gains importance when considered in the context of the
        history of American slavery, the formal acquisition of knowledge by slaves having been for-
        bidden by law.

        Bruce Sinclair. "Integrating the Histories of Race and Technology."4

  Throughout U.S. history and continuing today, people of color and women have often been kept from
  educational opportunities, particularly in areas such as engineering, and more recently, computer sci-
  ence. And yet, hidden are the myriad ways elite occupations have been successfully done via these
  very same people while mainly white males are given the credit for the accomplishments made by the
  broader group of innovators, designers, and creators.

  Carolyn de la Peña has highlighted how finding these hidden stories regarding the design and inno-
  vation of technologies by white women have required challenging but essential meta-historical nar-
  ratives through personal papers and the records of their and their husbands' activities. Finding the
  records of people of color are even more challenging. To proceed, de la Peña notes:

   61 3A: The Unknown Tech Innovators

        Rather than imagining "race" as a term that describes particular individuals marked as non-
        white, I want to suggest we think of race as an epistemology at play in all technological
        production and consumption. This concept makes it possible to see the significance of the
        obvious: that white people have race. And they make it, sustain it, and protect it in part
        through technology. More importantly, this approach suggests that it is not only the prob-
        lem of source that keeps us from integrating race fully into our analyses. Instead, the real
        difficulty occurs in tandem: difficult-to-locate sources combine with our own tendencies to
        fail to see all that can be found in what is available, and to creatively engage and interpret in
        order to draw race out of the archive.

        Carolyn de la Peña, "The History of Technology, the Resistance of Archives, and the White-
        ness of Race"5

  As a white, cisgender, heterosexual male scholar working at a higher education institution in the
  United States, it is essential that I recognize the ethical dilemmas involved in writing this book intro-
  ducing networked information systems within the information sciences. In doing so, I continue to
  work to identify ways in which I am building from, and integrating into this work imperialist, patri-
  archal, and racist ideologies which are embedded within general Western and specific United States
  culture and practices.

  In order to broaden my understanding of digital technology design and innovation, I have drawn heav-
  ily from Community Informatics (CI) practice, a field that seeks to make "effective use" of technol-
  ogy through a practice of community inquiry, participatory design, popular education, and asset-based
  development to enhance quality of life.6 This led me to co-develop a list of critical questions for Com-
  munity Informatics in practice.7 As related specifically to the philosophy of technology, rather than
  bringing forward the digital technologies we think are essential for information seeking and sharing,
  we need to instead consider:

        What everyday technologies might be unseen and displaced because of an overly narrow
        definition of what should be considered an appropriate technology? Who are the local inno-
        vators whose technologies might be championed as part of a CI project?... How might the
        voices of technology skeptics and traditionalists inform adoption, or non-adoption, of a CI
        project? What important insights regarding culture, values, and history are these perspec-
        tives bringing to the engagement?

Background Knowledge Probe

In chapter one, "Introduction to Electronic Circuits," the background knowledge probe had you create
a list of the electronics you make use of on a regular basis. As you did so, you considered who designed
it, what parts might have been used inside and out to build and use it, and what you did with any items
that started to work less than optimally.

         · Now create a new list, this time documenting your daily-use computing devices such as
            laptops, tablet devices, and smartphones.
                      What external and internal electronic components, such as resistors, capacitors,
                        diodes, transistors, switches, sensors, LEDs, copper wires, pins and clips, inte-

                      What design choices and design objectives might have inspired the layout of the

Technical Introduction

In the technical chapter of session 1, we began deconstructing the components that make up our
daily electronics, something we dug further into during chapter 2, "Electronic Components in Series."
We've also been expanding our fail-forward troubleshooting and innovation-in-use remixing as we
further open up the hood of electronic systems and the social influences shaping, and being shaped
by, these. Before launching the Raspberry Pi microcomputer, let's spend a little time exploring how
electronics, and often times code, are combined in a range of ways to create computers. In this chap-
ter, we'll:

        1. Explore the hardware building blocks that make up all computers.
        2. Examine the operating system building blocks that provide the major software package that

            supports the basic functions of a computer and other computing devices.

Computer Hardware Building Blocks

Electronic components like resistors, switches, LEDs, variable resistors, capacitors, other diodes, pho-
tocells, transistors, and integrated circuits combine to create many of the everyday devices around us.
These can be prototyped using breadboards and Perma-Proto breadboards, ultimately leading to
the creation of printed circuit boards. All computers are initially made using these prototyping tools
as they evolve from innovation and design, to testing, to production and marketing, and distribution.

Inside the case of every computer, we will find one or more printed circuit boards. The system board
or motherboard is the main board connecting computer parts. It brings together the many differ-
ent electronic components we have studied, as well as the connectors, sockets, and ports that provide
internal and external connections to other electronics.

All computers are made up of the same basic building blocks. In addition to the motherboard, there are
several key parts of a computer's hardware:

         · The central processing unit, or CPU, the core integrated circuit controlling and execut-
            ing operations.

         · Memory, the integrated circuits that temporarily hold data until needed by the CPU or
            other processors.

         · Data storage, which includes devices like hard drives, optical media such as DVDs, solid
            state drives, and flash drives even when power is turned off, but that cannot share data fast
            enough to work directly with processors.

         · Controllers, the crossing guards that control the flow of data from inputs to processors,
            and from processors to outputs.

         · I/O or Input/Output Devices that you connect to the computer using Universal Serial
            Bus, or USB port, HDMI port, Ethernet jack, audio jack, and others, such as the Raspberry
            Pi GPIO port.

     Integrated Circuits

      Processors: Do the thinking work
               · CPU: The main thinker and boss for the computer

      Memory: Hold data until needed by processors; faster than storage but more expensive
               · RAM: The main system memory; it forgets when power is off
                                                                                                                            3B: Computer Building Blocks 66

               · Flash: Changes circuits in a way that remembers even without power (USB stick,
                  solid state drive)

      Controllers: Move data from inputs to processors and from processors to outputs

     Storage

      Mechanical changes to media to store data even when power is turned off
               · Magnetic media: Uses positive and negative charges (e.g., hard drive)
               · Optical media: Uses lasers to detect presence or absence of reflected light (e.g., CD
                  and DVD)

     Printed Circuit Boards

      System or Motherboard: Main highway connecting components; edge connectors and sock-
      ets provide for expansion

               · Memory module: Board with group of memory integrated circuits (e.g., DIMM)
               · Expansion cards: Board with controller and integrated circuits to add capability to

                  computer (e.g., video card, network card)

     Case

               · Protects the building blocks from damage
               · Holds the power supply used to turn wall power into the power used by compo-

                  nents (desktop)
               · Provides space for air to flow around and to cool components
               · Provides a surface to disperse heat away from components (laptop)

     Input/Output Devices

               · Input devices let users control the computer (e.g., keyboard and mouse, touch-sen-
                  sitive devices)

               · Output devices inform user what is happening (e.g., monitor, printer)

Computer Operating System Building Blocks

Operating systems are the software managing the various components of a computer's basic functions,
from coordination between the many applications that allow us to do our daily computer-based activi-
67 3B: Computer Building Blocks

ties, to the kernel used to span the boundary between programming code and the physical electronics.
The building blocks of an operating system can be seen below:

     Themes and Skins

               · Pre-set package containing graphical appearance details. Supported in some ver-
                  sions of Windows and Linux. Available as third-party applications in other cases.

               · Supported for many applications like web browsers.
               · Changes the look and feel of many features at once (e.g., background colors, text

                  font and size, icons, mouse cursor, etc.).

     Desktop Environment

               · The desktop environment is a collection of software that provides a predictable
                  look and feel.

               · Includes a Window Manager that controls the placement and appearance of win-
                  dows, support icons, menus, etc.

               · For some operating systems, such as Windows and macOS, the desktop environ-
                  ment is the branded look of the operating system and cannot be changed.

     Window System

               · This is the part of the graphical user interface that communicates with the kernel.
               · Many operating systems allow remote interfacing with the window system, either

                  directly or through third-party applications.

     Bundled Software

               · Applications like file managers, user managers, software managers.
               · Applications like web browsers, text editors, photo and movie editors.
               · Device and print drivers determine which hardware is "plug and play" ready.

     Kernel

               · As the heart of the operating system, it is the go-between from applications to
                  input/output controllers, memory, the CPU, and storage devices.

When working with a computer, names bring things together, hiding from view many of the hardware
and operating system building blocks. I'm working right now on a MacBook Air. This laptop has all
of the key hardware building blocks pulled together into a single system board within a laptop case.
It is installed with the macOS operating system. On my desk is a Motorola moto e5 play smartphone.
This also has all the key hardware building blocks pulled together into a single system board, this time
within a smartphone case. It is installed with the Android mobile operating system based on a modi-
fied version of the Linux operating system kernel and other open source software. My spouse uses a
Lenovo laptop much like the MacBook Air but with a few more I/O ports and a larger laptop screen. It
is installed with the Microsoft operating system.

We typically merge the hardware and software together as one device with a means for bringing in
human input, using software to collect and respond to that input, and to provide output back to the
human.

                                                              All modern operating systems include both a

                                                              graphical user interface (GUI) and a text-based

                                                              shell known as a command-line interface (CLI)

                                                              or terminal window. For the most part, we spend

                                                              our computer time using a keyboard, monitor,

                                                              and mouse/touchpad to work within these GUIs

                                                              without even knowing we're in an operating

                                                              system that controls each and every action we

                                                              take on that computer. It's just the computer and

We primarily interface with an operating system via the       we're just trying to do our work with a range of

installed applications as well as with the computer
hardware and other computer programs.                         Sometimes, though, we need access from a dis-

                                                              tance, and so we use remote desktop software. In

some cases, remote desktop software is operating system independent, as is the case with the Virtual

Network Computing (VNC) server installed on the Raspberry Pi Operating System by default, and that

can be installed on almost all different personal computers and smartphones. In other cases, it is

designed for a specific operating system, as is the case for Apple Remote Desktop (Apple) and Remote

Desktop Protocol (Microsoft).

For many server computers, including devices like routers and a range of open-source content man-
agement systems (CMS), these are designed to serve as a simple, responsive web interface to a com-
puter that otherwise runs headless. Headless means the computer is run without a monitor, keyboard,
and/or mouse connected to it. The content management system provides us with a remote interface
device to access and use certain tasks that would otherwise be accessed using a GUI through a key-
board, mouse, and monitor or through a remote desktop application.
69 3B: Computer Building Blocks

Another common way to work with headless devices is through a Universal Asynchronous Receive
and Transmit (UART) serial connection or an Internet-based secure shell (SSH) connection. These
serve to provide a simple, text-based shell, also sometimes called a console or terminal window. Indeed,
the Raspberry Pi starter kit provides a default backup to connect a personal computer to a server or
microcomputer using a USB (Universal Serial Bus) to TTL (Transistor Transistor Logic) cable to facili-
tate UART communications as a way to assure troubleshooting when all other means for user interface
with a device has failed. This is how we'll start our work with the Raspberry Pi.

Where Does the OS Live?

The operating system is installed and maintained using a storage device like a hard drive or MicroSD
card. But storage devices are like our old paperwork that we store up in an attic. We can't do
anything with it beyond just storing it there. When a computer is turned on, those instruction sets
in the operating system which are immediately needed are moved out of storage and into random
access memory (RAM). We sometimes call this booting a computer, also called boot up or start up. This
startup sequence first does a safety check of the system, then looks to one or more possible locations
for the master boot record or boot manager, which then takes over control to bring forward the next
modules of operating system code needed.

The reason we need to boot up is because RAM can only store information as long as it has power and
ground to complete the circuits used to input, store, and output the memory. This is compared to the
older long term storage devices like hard drives, and to newer storage devices like secure digital (SD)
cards and other flash memory, all of which have means for permanently writing memory to spaces
on them while also allowing reading, deleting, and rewriting to those spaces as needed, albeit more
slowly. RAM is like paper files within an arm's reach of a computer we're working on at the
moment.

But as is the case with many of the papers we may have sitting in close reach of the computer on our
desk, they still can't be actually read and processed. To do this, a computer next moves sequences of
code from dynamic RAM (DRAM), which can store larger amounts of data at a more affordable rate
but that still works a bit too slowly for static RAM (SRAM), which doesn't need to be refreshed and
that is faster than DRAM. SRAM serves as a system cache that works closely with the Central Pro-
cessing Unit, or CPU. Consider SRAM as those files immediately at hand, and the CPU as your
brain, now processing the information you just read from the file in front of you.

At any given moment, where a segment of the operating system is "living" depends on what modules,
functions, variables, iterations, and sequences of code are needed. It is moving from attic to desk to
hand to brain to hand to brain to desk to hand to brain to desk to attic over and over billions of times
per second.

More on Boot Loaders

The computer boot loaders have gone through many stages of development. Today, the Basic Input
Output System (BIOS) and the newer Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) are used on per-
sonal computers, with BIOS slowly being phased out. Some still use the term BIOS, even when UEFI
is now being used. Either way, the instruction sets to do self-diagnostics and to locate an operating
system to which BIOS or UEFI can hand over the further booting of a computer is generally installed
as an Electrically Erasable, Programmable, Read Only Memory (EEPROM) chip, sometimes also called
firmware, on the main printed circuit board of the computer hardware.

Some microcomputer developers focused on mobile computing and the Internet of Things create their
own unique instruction sets, which they can include on their system-on-a-chip (SoC) integrated cir-
cuit and which then look for UEFI BIOS. Others, like the Raspberry Pi SoC through version 3, do not
use a conventional BIOS at all. The Raspberry Pi uses a configuration file, instead of the BIOS you
would expect to find on a conventional PC. The system configuration parameters, which would tradi-
tionally be edited and stored using a BIOS, are stored instead in an optional text file named config.txt.
This is read by the graphical processing unit (GPU) before the ARM CPU and Linux are initialized. It
must therefore be located on the first (boot) partition of your SD card. While the Raspberry Pi 4 now
includes EEPROM on the printed circuit board with UEFI BIOS to load Linux from a microSD card or
a networked storage device, it also still makes use of the config.txt file to do low-level system configu-
rations, in advance of using the CPU to load and run Linux.

The config.txt file is read by the early-stage boot firmware on the Raspberry Pi, so it has a very
simple file format. The format is a single property=value statement on each line, where value is
either an integer or a string. Comments may be added, or existing config values may be commented
out and disabled, by starting a line with the # character. Raspberry Pi documentation is available on
the config.txt file, where you can find an extended list of configurations settings.

The Embedded Linux Wiki, which works to "preserve and present information about the development
and use of Linux in embedded systems," provides a page with instructions for editing the config.txt
boot configuration file from OS X, the Raspberry Pi, and a Windows PC. After Linux has booted, you
can view the current active settings using the following commands in a terminal window:

         · vcgencmd get_config <config>: this displays a specific config value, e.g.,
            vcgencmd get_config arm_freq.

         · vcgencmd get_config int: this lists all the integer config options that are set (non-
            zero).

         · vcgencmd get_config str: this lists all the string config options that are set (non-
            null).

building blocks, but the "Bootloading Basics" guide isn't written exclusively for personal computer
bootloaders, but for the general category that serves processors used on microcontrollers and micro-
computers of all types. This includes the UF2 Bootloader used with the Circuit Playground Express
we'll be working with in the Blue Unit.

The Kernel: The Heart of the Operating System

The operating system is the underlying program that we generally don't even know really exists. We
hear about it, for instance when we buy a computer running Microsoft Windows 10, or an Apple Mac-
Book running macOS Sierra. And once in a great while we're encouraged or required to install a new
version of the operating system.

But generally we just see lots of text and graphics on a monitor, and we type on our keyboard, move
around a pointer from one place to another using a mouse or touchpad or even sometimes the monitor
itself. That's the user interface side. But the heart of the operating system lives in the kernel.

         · The kernel controls how applications get time on the CPU(s) of the computer. There was a
            day when the OS only allowed one application at a time to physically run on the computer.
            Imagine having to save your work in your text editor, exit, then open the spreadsheet to see
            your data, then exit, then reopen your text editor. Today operating systems are multi-task-
            ing, allowing multiple applications to all "run" simultaneously. They do this using a very
            fast time sharing strategy, in which each application is allowed to submit threads, or small
            segments of programming code, to the operating system, requesting execution of that
            thread.

         · The kernel controls memory access at several levels:
                      Physical memory vs. virtual memory: Applications can easily eat up all available
                        memory. To that extent, the OS must carefully control just how much memory is
                        being used by a specific application. Further, when a user wants to do more than
                        can be done with available memory, the operating system controls the movement
                        of bits from physical memory to virtual memory or swap space, a special location
                        on the hard drive configured to mimic, albeit very slowly, physical memory.
                        Applications cannot directly access virtual memory, so when memory runs short,
                        the OS spends a lot of time swapping bits between physical and virtual memory.

                      Shared vs. private address space: Some operating systems conserve physical
                        memory allocation by only loading shared segments of code (for instance from a
                        library file) once, then pointing all applications to this shared address space. The
                        problem is that sometimes a badly behaving application can overwrite a critical
                        shared code with corrupted data. In the worst cases, this can lead to a general
                        protection fault (a type of system error). Many modern operating systems there-
                        fore decide to make greater use of private address space, always loading segments
                                                                                                                            3B: Computer Building Blocks 72

                        of code again even if they already exist in memory.
         · The kernel controls interactions with device controllers. Because there are many controllers

            manufactured for each type of input/output function (for instance, video controllers), an
            operating system cannot be expected to know how to interface with every one of them out
            of the box. Instead, each controller must come with its own device driver that can translate
            between the specific controller and the specific operating system. All hardware incompati-
            bilities boil down to unavailable device drivers for the specific operating system.
         · The kernel of the operating system determines which types of file systems are supported.

In all cases, it is the kernel of the operating system that does the core work of communication between
electronics and programming code.

A Brief History of Operating Systems

In Microsoft and Apple operating systems, they've put together a tightly intertwined, large set of
applications to cover all main aspects of the operating system, from user interface; to bundled applica-
tions to configure the computer, store, delete, and access files; to installing and updating applications;
to the setup of screensavers, accounts, and passwords; to disk and monitor management, and so much
more. And the operating system has the essential instruction sets needed to interact with the electron-
ics of the computer within the kernel, the most basic level of the operating system.

Before there was Microsoft or Apple, there was Unix, a family of multitasking, multiuser computer
operating systems. Unix was first developed by AT&T at Bell Labs research center in the 1970s, but
then was split into a few different Unix systems. All are commercial, at least at some level, although
some have been made more widely available than others. For the most part, Unix provides a distinc-
tion between the kernel of the operating system, primary bundled applications, the user interface, and
any networked information systems used to pass data back and forth with devices beyond the kernel.

Very early in its development, Unix developers created the X-Window system to provide the ability to
create graphical user interfaces. The developers also set up Unix to work on the Internet. In this way,
even back in the 1970s and 1980s, Unix was able to have a graphical user interface to a headless com-
puter using simple (actually called "dumb" at the time) computers, which served primarily as a text
and sometimes graphical human interface device to the Unix core computer.

One company that entered into a licensing contract to use and build their own iteration of Unix was
Apple, leading to the macOS.

Microsoft wrote their own text-based operating system, called MS-DOS, or Microsoft Disk Operating
System. It was meant to support a personal computer (that is, only one user working only with directly
attached devices), and included the kernel, basic bundled applications, and a text interface. They then
added their own Windows graphical user interface extension to MS-DOS. Later still, they created a
73 3B: Computer Building Blocks

new version of the operating system called Windows NT (New Technology), which integrated the ker-
nel, bundled applications, and graphical user interface into one, while also staying compatible with
earlier versions of Windows. Ultimately, they made the break to create newer versions of the Windows
operating system, and eventually also adding back a new and improved text-based terminal window.
But throughout, their choices on select keyboard options, labels, and other essential communications
have contrasted with those of Unix, and thereby with those of Apple as well.

Moving into the early 1990s, Unix computers were relatively expensive, and therefore were purchased
by, and used in, research labs. Then, in 1991, University of Helsinki student Linus Torvalds purchased
an Intel 80386-based clone of the IBM PC mini-Unix called MINIX. Later that year, he made public his
first prototype of a Unix-like kernel operating system he called Linux. On March 14, 1994, he released
version 1.0. From the start, he released Linux using Richard Stallman's General Public License. Stall-
man, a free software advocate, created the GNU Project, a software development initiative. By combin-
ing the GNU Project essential bundled applications with the Linux core, Torvalds built and released a
fully functioning operating system.

Over the years, different groups have worked to create distributions of specific GNU applications,
other applications, and a Linux core. The oldest surviving distribution of Linux is called Slackware,
created by Patrick Volkerding in 1992. Slackware 1.0 came on twenty-four floppy disks and was built
on top of Linux kernel version 0.99. I started working in the Neuronal Pattern Analysis Group of the
Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1993, and soon after began using
Slackware and Linux, along with the newly developing X-Mosaic graphical web browser. I used these
as part of a team seeking to use the Internet to make publicly available raw electrophysiology data,
which was collected as part of various research projects.

Two common distributions of Linux are used as the starting point for a rich variety of child distrib-
utions. One is called Fedora, and originated in 1995, under the name Red Hat Linux. In 2003, the Red
Hat trademark was used to create two branches: Red Hat Enterprise, with a combination of free and
open-source applications and commercial applications, and Fedora, a community-oriented distribution
designed for "hobbyists." Commonly used distributions with Fedora at their core include CentOS and
Scientific Linux.

Debian GNU/Linux was first announced in 1993 by its founder, Ian Murdock. It has been developed
to every extent possible as a completely noncommercial project, through collaboration with over
one thousand volunteer developers. Widely used Debian-based alternatives include the overall most
widely used distribution, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi OS, the default Debian-based alternative for the
Raspberry Pi microcomputer.

There are two widely used commercial operating systems based on the Linux kernel today as well. In
September 2008, Google launched its Android operating system using a modified version of the Linux
kernel and various open-source software designed for touchscreen mobile devices, and subsequently
                                                                                                                            3B: Computer Building Blocks 74

developed for Android TV, Android Auto, and Wear OS. The Android Open Source Project is used for
development of its core source code, and apps for Android can therefore be developed by anyone, for
virtually any purpose, and installed and run on Android devices. In May 2011, Google released the first
Chromebook, running the Chrome OS. It is only available preinstalled on hardware from Google man-
ufacturing partners. Its open-source equivalent, Chromium OS, can be freely installed.

Specific to Raspberry Pi OS, each major new release of Debian results in a major new release of Rasp-
berry Pi OS. The code name used for each major release of Debian is taken from Toy Story characters.
In 2013, this was Wheezy, the penguin character by that name. In 2015, this was Jessie, the cowgirl
character. As of June 2017, this was Stretch, the rubber octopus from Toy Story 3. Edition two of the
textbook was written using the April 2022 release of Raspberry Pi OS, which uses Debian 11 Bullseye,
the horse character from Toy Story. As noted in these code name release dates, Debian works to be sta-
ble through a conservative update process. The stable release is held for about two years, although test
releases become available via the new code name during the interim, for those wanting early access
for use and testing of new designs.

Take a few minutes to explore a bit further the core philosophy and principles behind Debian. How
might they compare with those of the operating system used for your own computer? Why might the
Raspberry Pi Foundation have chosen Debian GNU/Linux instead of other versions of Linux as the
starting platform for their own distribution of GNU/Linux?

Exercise: Reviewing Your Computer

Take some time to dig into the hardware, operating system, and major installed software applications
of your primary computer. While it's often more difficult, if even possible, to open up your computer
to look at the system or motherboard of the computer than it used to be, if you can safely do that, do
so. You may have received some default documentation with your computer, either in print or digital.
There may be "About this Computer" links available on the computer or on a vendor's website. Some
resources are best accessed through applications that came with your computer and that provide cur-
rent notes which can account for potential updates that have since replaced the defaults that came
with the computer.

Using these resources, create your own list of the physical components and operating system of your
computer:

         · Input/output devices, such as types of USB ports, Thunderbolt ports, audio, camera, Ether-
75 3B: Computer Building Blocks

            net, Bluetooth, card readers, etc.
         · Type and amount of random access memory (RAM)
         · Storage devices
         · Central processing unit (CPU) and, if included, graphic processing unit (GPU)
         · Power source
         · Operating system (OS) type and version.subversion/edition
         · Windowing system, desktop environment, and themes/skins. For many computers today,

            these are highly integrated, so you may only see this as a singular graphical user interface
            system.

Take time to compare and contrast this with some of the other desktop and laptop computers that you
or others around you use on a fairly regular basis.

Wrap Up

Computers, microcomputers, and microcontrollers are an everyday part of life. The core components
of these devices have remained the same, even as the specifications, standards, and physical and soft-
ware implementations have been shaped and reshaped repeatedly over the last fifty-plus years. Know-
ing at least a bit about the items within all devices is essential as we serve professional and personal
roles in the selection, implementation, innovation-in-use, and support of these devices in our varying
contexts. Crash Course Computer Science is a highly recommended resource that further introduces
the basic hardware and logic building blocks of computing in its first ten episodes. We'll also bring a
few of these, plus some of the later Crash Course episodes specifically, into sections of the Blue and
Rainbow Units.

Before we move on to examining the Raspberry Pi microcomputer, take a few moments to watch this
"teardown" video from electronics repair company iFixit. A product teardown is a common method for
identifying the component parts of an electronic device, in order to better refurbish or repair devices
of that same model. However, take caution and browse the resources available from iFixit before tear-
ing down your own device, as the manufacturer may claim that such actions void your warranty.
Moreover, for many newer devices, components are glued--not screwed--together, requiring special-
ized equipment to get inside the device.

In this teardown video, a 2018 MacBook Air is disassembled and evaluated. As you watch, make note
of any parts you recognize. For even more detail, read the full teardown guide.

 Storytelling's Long History in the Information Sciences

  Many of us may have the childhood experience of sleeping while a family member tells us a bedtime
  story. But if we look more closely, we'll find that storytelling is a ubiquitous practice in our daily lives.
  The goal of storytelling is "to be able to create a story, to make it live during the moment of telling, to
  arouse emotions--wonder, laughter, joy, amazement"1.
  Storytelling has a rich history in the library and information sciences (LIS), dating back to the 1890s
  when it was established as a practice in youth services librarianship2. For example, the Urbana Free
  Library, a public library east of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus, hosts regular
  storytelling sessions for children, attracting many local families. The Urbana Free Library also collabo-
  rates with the East Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies at the University to host East Asian story
  time, providing a valuable resource for young people interested in East Asian culture.
  In her paper "Storytelling wisdom: story, information, and DIKW," Kate McDowell notes that "LIS sto-
  rytelling emphasizes a triangular relationship between teller, audience, and story, a dynamic process
  that co-creates a particular telling of a story." At its best, it is a mutual creation as the three relation-
  ships inform each other. The dynamic relationship has three main elements: "For storytelling to occur,
  there must first be a basic relationship of trust between the teller and the audience. [...] Second, the teller
  has a relationship to the story, whether as creator or reteller. [...] Third, the audience has an interpretive
  relationship to the story" (p. 1224, emphasis by author)."

  Chapter author Yingying Han's representation of the dynamic of storytelling described by McDowell.

  As we explored in the Orange Unit 3A: The Unknown Tech Innovators, there are a range of unknown
  innovators of our everyday technologies. In some cases, this may be by choice of the innovator to not
  tell their story, as such effort isn't part of their community cultural wealth, or maybe because such
  effort would compete with their time dedicated to other purposes. But as Bruce Sinclair notes, the sto-
  ries regarding innovators and innovations often prioritize the work of engineering over that of craft-
  ing3. Carolyn de la Peña further highlights how the papers and records of such innovation stories are
  often restricted to those of white men4. As we look across the dynamic triangle and consider its three
  main elements, it is essential for us to add this further lens that inevitably shapes the story, storyteller,
  and audience in a variety of ways.
  Stories transform in many different ways depending on when and where they are told, whether at a
  fireplace or in cyberspace, to a young person or to a senior. Storytelling serves an essential role in its
  relationship to story and to audience. Strategically reaching target audiences in ways that encourage
  them to move from the role of receiver to that of collaborator within a collective meaning-making
  process is then a way to counter the dominant narrative that Sinclair and de la Peña describe.

        Storytelling polishes stories like editing polishes essays, with the audience serving as editor.
        Changes add collective understandings to the story by emphasizing particular words, char-
        acters, actions, and more. Audiences interpret stories as groups, socially constructing mean-
        ings. Retellings demonstrate how a story can be told so that others also recall and retell,
        and the story keeps traveling. "Stories live everywhere, but they rarely stay in one place"

        (Hearne, 1997).5 Storytelling entails dynamic collective interpretation, both synchronous and
        across long spans of time. So what is a story?

        Story is here defined in two ways: structurally as narratively patterned information, and
        functionally as the content shared through the narrative experience of storytelling.

        McDowell, p. 12256.

 The Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom Pyramid

  At the start of the Orange Unit 1A: Information Systems, a connection was made between data, infor-
  mation, knowledge, and wisdom, the pyramid of which "has proved very useful in the information
  sciences as a means of investigating how different aspects of this pyramid have influenced the shaping
  of individuals, communities, societies, organizations, and governing bodies." This can also be incorpo-
  rated specifically into storytelling concepts, which we'll explore in a minute.

  But first, let's pause to further clarify the definitions of Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom
  (DIKW) within the pyramid.

  According to Merriam-Webster, data is information in digital form that can be transmitted or
  processed. For example, if I ask you what the following list of numbers means--01001001 01010011
  00100000 00110100 00110000 00110001 00100000 01010010 01101111 01100011 01101011 01110011
  00100001--you probably will be confused for a while. What if you were given more context, being
  told this is a binary number that can be translated into English texts and Roman numerals through an
  ASCII table? You can use either an ASCII table or use a Binary-Text translator (for example, Convert
  Binary) to find that the 13 sets of 8-bit data are translated into the text "IS 401 Rocks!", where 01001001
  = the capital I, 01010011 = the capital S, 00100000 = a space character, etc.

  In her article "The wisdom hierarchy: representations of the DIKW hierarchy," Rowley refers to infor-
  mation as "organized or structured data which has been processed in such a way that the information
  now has relevance for a specific purpose of context and is therefore meaningful, valuable, useful and
  relevant."7" People may extract different meanings from the information "IS 401 Rocks!" depending on
  the context.

                                                                                                                4A: Storytelling in the Information Sciences 80

   Starting with the first two text elements, look up IS in Merriam-Webster, and you'll find these two let-
   ters in capitals means "Information System." But this is not necessarily what the creator of the binary
   numbers meant. For one major target audience of this textbook, however--students at the School of
   Information Sciences, the iSchool at Illinois--"IS 401" is the course number for the course Introduc-
   tion to Network Information Systems. Until knowing this context, it might be hard to truly move the
   binary data to text and then on to information.

   Turning to the third element within the text, many English speakers within the United States would
   hopefully recognize "Rocks" in this context not as a statement regarding the relationship between this
   course and a solid mineral matter, but rather as a proposed statement of excitement regarding the
   course IS 401. For people for whom English is not their primary language, or who understand the
   language within different social and cultural contexts, "IS 401 Rocks!" is not meaningful information
   because they will not be able to interpret it.

   Take a moment to consider how two different students, one a third-generation U.S. citizen and one
   from Asia for whom English is their second language, would interpret the answer "IS 401 Rocks!" to
   their question, "How was IS 401 when you took it?" If understood to be a course that is exciting to
   take, the information becomes "actionable information," that is, knowledge, that the course should be
   something to consider registering to take. But for others the response may be confusing or mislead-
   ing, and may result in knowledge regarding a low-quality course for which it would be wrong to take.
   Here we can see that travel along the DIKW pyramid can take different paths. As McDowell argues, in
   "uncertain, conflictual, or paradoxical situations, knowledge of how to accomplish tasks is not enough.
   We need wisdom."8

   Defining wisdom is hard. According to Rowley9, wisdom is accumulated knowledge that allows you
   to understand how to apply concepts from one domain to new situations or programs. For McDow-
   ell, wisdom may be similar to being a storyteller whose action occurs in context. "[W]isdom may be
   socially constructed and enacted situationally. If wisdom is enacted, then it can be the province of
   groups as well as individuals."10 LIS scholars have long been interested in studying the wisdom of col-
   lective information sharing, for example when using Information Communication Technologies (ICTs)
   to share collective information during a crisis.

   So, where does the story fit in this pyramid? Below is the Story-DIKW framework proposed by Kate
   McDowell:

                  · S-Data: Ability to identify and interpret data from which information emerges that
                     can be communicated in story.

                  · S-Information: Ability to inform audiences by communicating data with context

                     as story, in both form and narrative experience.
                  · S-Knowledge: Ability to convey knowledge as complex actionable information

                     through the construction and telling of a story, incorporating cultural and con-
                     textual cues. S-knowledge is shared frequently in innovative or experimental con-
                     texts.
                  · S-Wisdom: Ability to know which story to tell--including when, how, and to
                     whom--in order to convey wisdom.

   Take a few minutes to reflect back on your journey through the Orange Unit of this textbook. In what
   ways, if any, might it fit within the dynamic triangle of story, teller, and audience? In what ways, if
   any, might various aspects fit within the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom pyramid of the
   S-DIKW framework?

  Social Justice Storytelling: Why It Matters

   Memory institutions such as libraries and archives in the United States have a long history of exclud-
   ing and erasing cultures of people who are marginalized.1112 For example, Sutherland13 argues that by
   failing to create an official record of human rights abuses in the United States, American archivists
   have continued to perpetrate violence against Black Americans by failing to tell Black Americans' sto-
   ries. This century-long refusal to engage justice for Black Americans endures in present-day through
   archival professions in the United States.

   Digital storytelling is a technique that allows the story to be retold even while the storyteller is
   sleeping. This technique also allows the storyteller to use additional media to better bring home the
   moment. It is an innovative, community-based, participatory research technique bringing together
   community members and health workers to approach, research, and collaboratively address local
   health issues.14 It has been incorporated into traditional quilting, along with capacitive touch sensors,
   to create living archives of voices in the sex work industry.15 It has played a role in co-design initiatives

   encouraging broader local participation and engagement in community-based co-design projects.16

   Social justice storytelling is an essential approach emerging within the Information Sciences as the
   profession works to give voice to people who are marginalized. Communicating in culturally com-
   petent ways about social justice as information professionals requires that training in this area be
   brought into the classroom as well17. Counterstorytelling is one of the primary tenets of critical race
   theory181920 and involves telling stories that "buck the status quo and challenge the long held collective
   stories of a hegemonic society, which tacitly maintain the narratives and normative behavior of domi-
   nant groups."21 Counterstorytelling is thus proposed as a key approach to social justice storytelling in
   the information sciences generally,22 and in our work through this textbook as a community of prac-
   tice seeking to bring a more holistic and nuanced understanding of sociotechnical artifacts we use as
   a daily part of our professional lives specifically.

   For the first edition of A Person-Centered Guide to Demystifying Technology, Cooke's chapter "Becom-
   ing New Storytellers: Counterstorytelling in LIS"23 was foundational in guiding this final session of the
   Orange Unit. McDowell's writing on storytelling and DIKW, including her article co-authored with
   Cooke on social justice storytelling, were published between editions of this textbook and strongly
   build off of Cooke's previous foundational work. For Cooke, becoming a "new storyteller" is a call
   for us to take on an active information professional leadership role, facilitating discussions on issues
   of race, privilege, social justice, and other necessary and difficult issues. Becoming new storytellers
   has provided further clarity and a more solid foundation for the many different participatory action
   research and course offerings that have now come together to create A Person-Centered Guide to
   Demystifying Technology. The previous sessions of the Orange Unit are thus not separate from this
   social chapter of session four, but serve as precursors to this chapter. And this final session of the
   Orange Unit itself serves as not only a conclusion of this first unit, but also as the base for the Blue and

   Rainbow Units, as each seeks to facilitate a collective journey to becoming new storytellers within the
   Information Sciences.

   Digital technologies old and new are not objects that can be packed inside a box. They are a seamless,
   indivisible combination of people, organizations, policies, economies, histories, cultures, knowledge,
   and material things that are continuously shaped and reshaped. Every one of us innovates-in-use our
   everyday technologies; we just do not always know it. Not only are we shaped by the networked infor-
   mation tools in our midst; we also shape them and thereby shape others. For us to advance the individ-
   ual agency of all drawing upon diverse community knowledge and cultural wealth within the fabric of
   communities, we need to nurture our cognitive, socio-emotional, information, and progressive com-
   munity engagement skills, along with, and sometimes in advance of, our technical skills, which then
   serve as just-in-time in-fill learning. This is the call placed by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.--to
   rapidly shift from a "thing-oriented" society to a "person-oriented" society.24

   One step in this, then, is to become new storytellers regarding sociotechnical artifacts and systems,
   including within a broadened conceptualization of networked information systems. Stock stories
   abound, bringing us into dominant narratives around the importance of technologies in changing soci-
   ety. It removes from the story the centrality of people, race, privilege, and power, which are used to
   shape the technology and its narrative. In this removal, many lose individual sociotechnical-related
   agency, and in addition often lose aspects of their human rights. How we buck the status quo through
   counterstories varies as we work to assure the right story, at the right time, in the right way, using a
   dynamic storytelling triangle. Forms of counterstory include: a concealed story that serves as a direct
   response to stock stories, a resistance story that not only bucks against stock stories but also high-
   lights injustices, or an emerging/transforming story that (re)constructs knowledge built on con-
   cealed and resistance stories.25

  Lesson Plan

   We will continue to develop the full range of our technical, information, cognitive, socio-emotional,
   and application skills moving forward. But as has been noted throughout, to advance a person-cen-
   tered and social-justice-oriented approach to demystifying technology, we also need to actively bring
   in progressive community [inter]action and critical social and technical skills to these other five
   points. Storytelling for social justice is meant to serve as an active way to bring each of these together,
   starting with this session. At the same time, we will continue to advance various others of our skillsets

more holistic and nuanced understanding of the sociotechnical artifacts we use as a daily part of our
professional lives.

Storytelling for Social Justice as Part of Demystifying Technology

(The following is a modification of the assignment as described in Kate McDowell and Nicole A. Cooke
(2021). Social Justice Storytelling: A Pedagogical Imperative. The Library Quarterly: Information, Com-
munity, Policy, volume 92, number 4, October 2022.)

There are many news stories on social justice topics regarding the relationships of women, people of
color, or other minorities have to and with technology. These involve the relative access to resources,
opportunities, and privileges of individuals or groups within a society. This story should be designed
to persuade your audience of the importance of a social justice issue, based on your knowledge of the
issue (acquired through research), which can be easily recognized and referenced by your audiences,
along with a healthy dose of emotional appeal.

Pick a current or historical social justice topic, from any part of the world, for which you can find some
histories of people and technology. These may be stories about the hidden innovators; the ways peo-
ple have used technology as means of marginalizing others; the ways people have used technology to
provide agency for liberation and transformation; etc. Your story should connect with the narratives
of individuals or groups whose lives have been impacted by injustice or whose work addressing an
injustice has been untold or hidden.

Prepare for your storytelling by finding stories, learning the events in them so that you can tell them
spontaneously, and making them your own by adapting the story you've found to your own voice
and telling style. The previous units of the Orange Unit have already worked to bring aspects forward
and will have been captured in part through your Reading Notes and Professional Journal Reflections.
Hopefully these have also been points of discussion within our community of practice, as you work
to address questions that have arisen. These issues will continue to be considered within the sessions
of the Blue and Rainbow Units and should continue to be an active component of your community
of inquiry as you collaboratively work through them. Consider practicing spontaneous storytelling
through activities within your community of practice moving forward, to move from an early draft to
later drafts and the final polishing of your stories.

The recordings of your main story (1-2 minutes), an introduction of the storyteller and the story (15
seconds), and a "for more on the story" component (around 30 seconds) will be used in the conclud-
ing exercise of Blue Unit Session 4B: Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library, where we'll bring
together the Raspberry Pi microcomputer and Circuit Playground Express microcontroller. Optional
but not required, you can also include a fourth "behind the scenes" story. Make sure you have open
85 4A: Storytelling in the Information Sciences

access to your three recordings so that you can transfer them to the Raspberry Pi and run them using
software that comes with the Raspberry Pi OS.

Before recording, you can also work with rehearsal groups within your community of practice to
exchange, critique, and improve each other's stories in advance of implementation on the Raspberry
Pi. To create a compelling story, use the following guidelines. Your group should use these guidelines
to ask questions when you exchange feedback:
· Have a clear beginning, middle, and ending narrative structure.
· Focus on conveying a meaningful adaptation and interpretation of the social justice issue.
· Create a narrative that demonstrates the importance of a social justice issue.

Technical Introduction

So far, each of our electronic circuits has been physically constructed using electronic components
and electrical conductors, along with ground and 3.3 and 5 volt power sources. Many of our everyday
technologies are built in just this way. Think of the essential lights, fans, and clocks around us. Even
those with controllers to dim the lights, change the speed of a fan, or selectively tick-tock once a sec-
ond are often made exclusively with electronic components and conductors and no more. But others
also include programming code to add in features. Consider, for instance, a light connected to a remote
timer allowing you to turn it on or off from your phone or laptop. In this chapter, we're going to per-
form an upgrade to our Raspberry Pi. So far, it has performed as a helpful intermediate source for volt-
age and ground to our breadboard. Now, we'll use it as a microcomputer. Microcomputers are simply
small computers that contain a microprocessor as its central processor. We'll then install and run an
application written using the Python programming language, designed to work with the GPIO to
turn LEDs on and off based on the current status of different momentary switches. As noted in the
following video from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, "back in the 80s, kids had to learn how to code
computers to use them. And as a result, these kids grew up with an inbuilt understanding of how com-

                                                                                  87

  puters worked."1 The Raspberry Pi microcomputer has been built from the ground up to "reignite this
  spark." Not only is it being used specifically for information and communications technologies (ICT), it
  is serving a wide range of cross-curricular applications. And as illustrated, we'll use it to push a button
  to turn on a light as the final exercise in this chapter!
  [Watch the "What is a Raspberry Pi?" video online.]
  As an aside, I was one of the fortunate kids who, back in the mid-70s, began learning how to code
  computers to use them to do things I valued. In the following video, I highlight some of this history,
  recounting my work with a teletype machine and acoustical modem to connect to a server, a punch
  card interface with that server, and programming with a Commodore 64 desktop computer. Watch the

 The Components of the Raspberry Pi

  The Raspberry Pi computer used throughout this book is built using a reduced instruction set comput-
  ing (RISC) architecture known as ARM. This and similar architectures have slowly taken over the com-
  puter world, allowing us to do more for less. This is because RISC-based architectures require fewer
  transistors than complex instruction set computing (CISC) architectures, such as those used in most
  desktop and laptop computers.
  As a result, this has also opened up new computing opportunities, such as systems-on-chips (SoC) that
  bring together memory, input/output controllers, processors, radios, etc., into a single integrated cir-
  cuit. The outcome is typically the lowering of costs, power consumption, heat dissipation, and poten-
  tially environmental impacts.

The Raspberry Pi OS

The Raspberry Pi Project has developed its own distribution of Debian's GNU/Linux OS which it calls
the Raspberry Pi OS. Debian strives to be a universal, completely free operating system, where free is
not used as a monetary term but rather one of freedom. The Debian community has a written consti-
tution that includes a social contract, diversity statement, and code of conduct, all of which are avail-
able from within the page introducing their philosophy. As a distribution based on Debian, the social
philosophy of the community and technical changes to the software both eventually trickle over to
the Raspberry Pi OS. Take some time to first review various social and technical aspects of Debian's
community and operating system from their homepage, then make your way over to the Raspberry Pi
Foundation and the Raspberry Pi Project sites to learn more about the Raspberry Pi community and
operating system.

         · In what ways might the vision, goals, and overarching philosophy of the Debian and Rasp-
            berry Pi communities have some parallels? What might be some ways that these could
            come into conflict?
                                                                                                                             4B: Meet the Microcomputer 92

         · In what ways does the Raspberry Pi OS take advantage of the technical aspects of the
            Debian OS? What are some things the Raspberry Pi add within its own distribution to espe-
            cially serve its target audience(s)?

Exercise: Reviewing the Raspberry Pi Computer

Using these resources, create your own list of the physical components and operating system of the
Raspberry Pi:

         · Input/output devices, such as types of USB ports, Thunderbolt ports, audio, camera, Ether-
            net, Bluetooth, card readers, etc.

         · Type and amount of random-access memory (RAM)
         · Storage devices
         · Central processing unit (CPU) and, if included, graphic processing unit (GPU)
         · Power source
         · Operating system (OS) type and version/subversion edition
         · Windowing system, desktop environment, and themes/skins. For many computers today,

            these are highly integrated, so you may only see this as a singular graphical user interface
            system.

If you can, boot up a working Raspberry Pi computer and have it running side-by-side with your own
personal computer. Take a few moments to compare and contrast some of the installed applications on
the Raspberry Pi (e.g., web browser, word processor, games) with similar ones on your laptop. As you
do this, consider:

        1. In what ways is a given software on my laptop a better application based on specific design
            specifications?

        2. In what ways is a given software on my laptop a better application because of the hardware
            of my laptop?

        3. In what ways is a given software on my laptop a better application because of my familiar-
            ity with its design?

        4. In what ways might my answers to the above questions be shaped by the underlying vision,
            goals, and philosophy of the designers and distributors of a given software and of the
            underlying operating system on which it runs?

Repeat these three questions, this time considering in what ways the application might be better on
the Raspberry Pi than on your laptop.

Wrap Up

The next task is to configure your own Raspberry Pi in preparation for the technical exercises to come.
Depending on the tools at your disposal, there are numerous ways to accomplish this.

  Setting up a Raspberry Pi 3, 4, or 400 for the first time depends considerably on what came with the
  purchase of that Raspberry Pi, what you have on hand, and the ways you plan to use your Raspberry
  Pi. It also depends on your skill level coming in and your interest, and availability for taking on the
  learning of new skills just to get things running. To facilitate demystifying technology for all, the fol-
  lowing is based on a classroom context in which exercises are done using the Raspberry Pi operating
  system setup with a graphical user interface (GUI), given that it is the most widely used general pur-
  pose computer interface. First, set up a new Raspberry OS which will use a Raspberry Pi with direct
  connection to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. At the same time, a given classroom cannot always
  provide a separate keyboard, mouse, and monitor for regular use with the Raspberry Pi. And as we
  move on in the book, we'll be exploring ways a general-purpose computer can run software services,
  such as a web server used to collect, manage, and share data. These often run using a "headless" con-
  figuration in which regular work on the general-purpose computer only requires a source of power
  as primary management is done with either a remote command-line (CLI) or GUI interface. In intro-
  ducing hardware and software server environments beyond personal computer models, ongoing use
  of the configured Raspberry Pi OS will allow for headless server operation and only require provision
  of power to the Raspberry Pi computer, and Internet connectivity of the Raspberry Pi. For most, it is
  also necessary to have a personal computers on the same Local Area Network as the Raspberry Pi,
  either physically or using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) system, such as the Cisco AnyConnect
  provided for the University network in which this textbook is being written. Finally, documentation
  of the IP address assigned to the Raspberry Pi computer will be needed, as we will not register the
  Raspberry Pi so that it is assigned a publicly accessible IP name. To connect to the Raspberry Pi OS in
  order to complete tasks, you will be able to choose between using a virtual network computer (VNC)
  graphical desktop system or a secure shell (SSH) command-line protocol connection. The Raspberry
  Pi project provides well documented instructions for getting started with a new Raspberry Pi com-
  puter and new Raspberry Pi OS.1 This chapter and various other instructions throughout the book

Choosing Your Path Forward

As noted above, the first setup of a Raspberry Pi can vary depending on what you have on hand. Here's
the list of physical materials used to write the following instructions in spring 2023:

         · Raspberry Pi 3 - Model B+ - 1.4GHz Cortex-A53 with 1GB RAM (also tested on a Rasp-
            berry Pi 400 Desktop available as Computer Only or as a Full Computer Kit, both of which
            do not need a Pi Protector and which need a USB-C power supply)

         · Adafruit Pi Protector for Raspberry Pi 3
         · 5V 2.5A Switching Power Supply with 20AWG MicroUSB Cable
         · 16GB or larger Class A1 microSD card (optionally purchase a 16GB Card with NOOBS 3.1

            for Raspberry Pi Computers including 4)
         · HDMI monitor
         · U.S. standard keyboard and mouse
         · Internet connectivity (tested using wired and wireless Ethernet, and mobile phone hotspot)

Beyond the hardware, all exercises in this book have been tested using the Raspberry Pi OS port of
Debian 11 Bullseye released by the Raspberry Pi project April 4, 2022. The focus of this release of
the Raspberry Pi OS was on improved security, including a new, non-optional "Welcome to the Rasp-
berry Pi Desktop" wizard that comes up on first boot of a new OS install. This requires the setup of
                                                                                                              4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi 96

a username and password prior, which is required upon login to the Raspberry Pi OS Desktop. There
is a slight security risk of continuing to use the username "pi." However, there are some applications,
including those written for this book, that still make use of the /home/pi directory. To balance this, it is
highly recommended you use a secure password. The April 2022 release also addressed a long-stand-
ing issue in which you needed a USB mouse and/or keyboard to initially pair Bluetooth peripherals
such as a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. The wizard now provides a prompt that can be used to pair
with a Bluetooth device which has been put into pairing mode. In the Raspberry Pi Imager, this release
provides a new set of steps within advanced options to allow "headless" use--no keyboard, mouse, or
monitor needed, with all work being done through a remote connection--of the Raspberry Pi from the
start. However, this pathway for setting up headless use of the Raspberry Pi does not work with the
Virtual Network Computing (VNC) package we'll be using, so this new feature will not be used.

The remainder of this chapter is broken down into three main processes:

        1. Exercise: Installing a Protective Case
                      Done once with a new Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 computer
                      Not needed for Raspberry Pi 400 computer

        2. Exercise: Installing the Raspberry Pi OS
                      Done for each new Raspberry Pi OS installation
                      Not needed if your microSD card came preinstalled with the Raspberry Pi OS
                      This can be done: on a new blank microSD card; to reinstall the same operating
                        system for Raspberry Pi use; or to install a different operating system available
                        for the Raspberry Pi

        3. Exercise: Setting Up a New Raspberry Pi OS
                      General configuration of the OS with things such as a username and password,
                        Internet access, and updates
                      Raspberry Pi configurations for more specific use such as display and interface
                        systems

        4. Exercise: Adding an Adafruit PiOLED Text Display
                      Done following each new Raspberry Pi OS configuration
                      If IP address assigned to the Raspberry Pi remains constant, the PiOLED may not
                        be needed

Exercise: Installing a Protective Case

Look at your laptops, phones, TV's, routers, and most other computer systems, and you won't actually
see the computer, but rather a protective case in which the computer is located. This is also the case
97 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi

for the new Raspberry Pi 400 Desktop. For those using a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, a minimal protective
acrylic case gives us the opportunity to see the Raspberry Pi computer directly and get the labeling of
the General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins while also keeping the Pi secure.

Looking at the image at right, unseen is an
acrylic pad on which the Raspberry Pi sits. It is
held in place by two short and two long black
screws that come with the package. On top of
the Raspberry Pi, you'll see a slightly shorter
acrylic pad with GPIO labels facing the associ-
ated GPIO pins. It is held in place with the two
taller black screws and provides protection to
the top of the printed circuit board, integrated
circuits, and connector slots.

Steps

You are ready to attach the Raspberry Pi to its new case.

        1. The bottom of the case has a dip on one of the shorter sides to provide room to insert a
            microSD card into the Raspberry Pi moving forward. Holding this at the top, insert the two
            longer black screws into the left holes, and the two shorter black screws into the right
            holes.

        2. Attach these screws to the acrylic using four black nuts. These only need to be hand tight-
            ened.

        3. Insert the four screws into these pins so that the microSD slot aligns with the dip in the
            acrylic.

        4. Attach nuts to the two shorter black screws above and below the GPIO pins.
        5. Place a white plastic tube to each of the two longer black screws.
        6. Lower the top acrylic cover to the tall back screws so that it sits on top of the white plastic

            tubes.
        7. Attach nuts to the two taller back screws to hold down the top of the acrylic case. These

            only need to be hand-tightened.

Key Takeaways

A case is used to protect electronics from wear and tear. They come in many shapes and forms. The
design of the case impacts effective use in significant ways. To demystify technology, I've chosen to
use an acrylic case with label identifying the GPIO pins as commonly used. But my choice of this par-
                                                                                                                 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi 98

  ticular Adafruit Pi Protector for Raspberry Pi was inspired through Limor Fried, whose goal in start-
  ing Adafruit in 2005 "was to create the best place online for learning electronics and making the best
  designed products for makers of all ages and skill levels."2 And it is further aligned with the Raspberry
  Pi project's motivation of "Democratising technology--providing access to tools"--which in working
  to lower the barriers to entry by providing both a lower cost computer and extensive educational mate-
  rials, is finding "Raspberry Pi computers being used everywhere from interactive museum exhibits and
  schools to national postal sorting offices and government call centres. Kitchen table businesses all over
  the world have been able to scale and find success in a way that just wasn't possible in a world where
  integrating technology meant spending large sums on laptops and PCs,"3

  A case is a social as much and more as a technical tool. It is a sociotechnical artifact that can provide
  you with insights into the designers, producers, and distributors of that product. Take a minute to look
  at the many sociotechnical cases you use in your daily life. What might be some of the motivations for
  each of their designs? What in these designs would you have done differently to help them work better
  for you? What in these designs has helped you work better than those of other devices you considered
  purchasing?

 Exercise: Raspberry Pi OS Installation on a microSD Card

  Sometimes you can find microSD cards with the Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop already installed, in
  which case you can jump straight to Exercise: First Boot of the Raspberry Pi OS.

  But for most, an affordable option has been to purchase a fresh 16 GB or larger microSD. It's recom-
  mended you select a microSD card whose speed categorization is the new A (for "application") class.
  You'll see an A1 logo next to the overall speed class, a number found within the C symbol. While
  the overall speed found with the C symbol determines the minimum write speed of the microSD, the
  application class goes on to determine how many read and write operations need to be completed
  within one second. For example, an A1 category, class 10 speed microSD card, will have a minimum
  write speed of 10MB/s (the class 10 speed requirement) that will also support at least 1500 read oper-
  ations and 500 write operations per second (the class A1 speed requirement). All official Raspberry Pi
  microSD cards meet this specification.

  The Raspberry Pi Foundation has developed a graphical SD card writing tool called Raspberry Pi
  Imager, which they suggest as the easiest option for most users, since it will download the image auto-
  matically and install it to the SD card a computer with an SD card reader. It works on Mac OS, Win-
  dows, and Ubuntu 18.04 and above. There are many USB-based SD card readers available, which you
  can then use if your computer does not come with its own SD card reader.

  To set up and use Raspberry Pi Imager on your personal computer:

2. https://www.adafruit.com/about
3. https://www.raspberrypi.com/about/
   99 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi

          1. Download the latest version of Raspberry Pi Imager, and install it to your personal com-
              puter.

          2. Insert a microSD card to your computer in the microSD slot, or connect a USB-based SD
              card reader with the microSD card attached into an available USB port.

          3. Open Raspberry Pi Imager.
                        For "Choose Operating System," select the Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) from the list
                          presented, as this is the recommended operating system for most users.
                        For "Choose Storage," select the USB mass-storage device you just added.
                                    Make sure it matches the size of storage you expected. In my case, it
                                      lists 15.5 GB for my 16-gigabyte microSD card.
                                    In case you're not certain, you can remove the microSD card you plan
                                      to use, and it should disappear from the display.

          4. Review your selections and click on the Write button to begin writing data to the SD Card.
              NOTE: If using Raspberry Pi Imager on Windows 10 with controlled folder access enabled,
              you will need to explicitly allow Raspberry Pi Imager permission to write the SD card. If
              this is not done, the imaging process will fail with a "failed to write" error.

          5. After the Raspberry Pi completes the writing of the image to the microSD, it will do a veri-
              fication that everything was written successfully before providing a "Write Successful"
              popup. Click "Continue," and then, if it wasn't done automatically by the Imager, eject the
              new "USB Drive"4 before removing the microSD.

4. In the file viewer for your operating system, click on the eject icon, or right-click on the filename of the microSD and
  select eject.

Exercise: First Boot of the Raspberry Pi OS

Once you have a microSD card with the Raspberry Pi OS installed, the next step is to do an initial con-
figuration of the operating system. The following instructions were tested using Raspbian GNU/Linux
11 (bullseye).

        1. Connect your Raspberry Pi to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Check on the specifications
            of your Raspberry Pi hardware model, as port types and included components vary.

        2. Install the microSD card into the microSD port on the Raspberry Pi.
        3. Insert power to the Raspberry Pi.

                      For every newly installed Raspberry Pi OS, the first boot will go through a couple
                        of passes to do some initial configurations:
                                  By default, the first boot will be used to resize the microSD to make use
                                    of all available space.
                                  A reboot will then take a few moments to do some further initial auto-
                                    mated configurations before arriving at a "Welcome to the Raspberry Pi
                                    Desktop" message.Insert power to the Raspberry Pi.

        4. First set up:
                      Set Country--The instructions in this book were primarily tested within the
                        United States using American English, but two-thirds of the readers of the first
                        edition have come from the Asian and African continents. Ideally you can config-
                        ure the Set Country components to match yours.
                      Create User--While it is extremely important to carefully create a highly secure
101 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi

                        password for your personal and professional devices, when working in a collabo-
                        rative environment using a prototyping and educational system such as the Rasp-
                        berry Pi, you may find it helpful to have a shared password in this specific
                        context. But if this is done, be very careful to never put any data or information on
                        the Raspberry Pi that you aren't willing to have go public across the Internet!

                      Set Up Screen--Enable and again disable the "Reduce the size of the desktop on
                        this screen" option to see if parts of the image are being missed because they
                        don't match the monitor display you are using.

                      Select WiFi Network--We plan to make ongoing use of a remote computing appli-
                        cation like Virtual Network Computing (VNC) or secure shell (SSH). In almost all
                        cases, for security by default this requires that the Raspberry Pi be on the same
                        local area network (LAN) as the remote computer. If possible, select the WiFi net-
                        work from the list that matches that being used by your personal computer.
                                  NOTE: In some educational and work contexts, security may prevent an
                                    unrecognized computer from connecting to that network. Consult with
                                    your support team at your location on pathways forward if you find
                                    this to be the case.

                                  As an example, at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, there is
                                    an option to register devices other than personal laptops and mobile
                                    phones using a Wireless Guest and Device Management Portal.
                                    Whether a smart TV, video game console, or a Raspberry Pi, a student
                                    can register their personal devices using this Portal by identifying the
                                    media access control (MAC) address associated with the wireless Ether-
                                    net network interface card (NIC). Additionally, departmental accounts
                                    can register Raspberry Pi's, Arduino's, and Internet of Things devices
                                    being used for their studio courses. Either way, a personal computer on
                                    the IllinoisNet Wi-Fi network is able to remotely access these other
                                    devices on the IllinoisNet_Guest Wi-Fi network.

                      Update Software--If you can connect the Raspberry Pi to a WiFi network, it will
                        now do any needed updates in the operating system and installed applications. If
                        possible, click Next to do this now, as this will be needed for future exercises.
                                  Selecting Skip may be necessary for those with limited time or Internet
                                    access now, in which case updates will need to be done later.

                                  If you get a popup stating the process reached a timeout, this also indi-
                                    cates an Internet access problem, in which case updates will need to be
                                    done later.

                      With setup complete, you'll be prompted to press Restart.
                                  After restarting, you may see an update prompt to the left of the Blue-
                                    tooth and Wi-Fi icons. Make sure you're connected to Wi-Fi, and then
                                                                                                 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi 102

                            click on the icon and select to either start the install or to first view the
                            available updates before starting the install.

5. Raspberry Pi Configuration--While the Raspberry Pi OS took you through some general
    configurations upon first boot of a newly installed microSD, there are a range of other con-
    figurations that will be needed at some point. Let's do some of these next:
              Click on the Raspberry icon in the upper left, and then, in the drop-down menu,
                go to Preferences and select Raspberry P Configuration.

              The Raspberry Pi Configuration has several tabs in which you can configure dif-
                ferent core parts of the operating system. At a minimum, make the following con-
                figuration changes:
103 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi

                                  System
                                              Password--If you didn't set one previously, now's the time to
                                                do that.

                                              Disable the Splash Screen. Moving forward during the boot
                                                process, you'll see a line-by-line list of actions being taken,
                                                along with indications of success or failure. A Splash Screen is
                                                now widely used by different operating systems to hide many
                                                of these to facilitate a more inviting initial experience upon
                                                starting a computer.

                                  Display
                                              Headless Resolution: I recommend setting this to 1280×720 to
                                                assure a reasonably usable display of the Raspberry Pi desk-
                                                top, but one that is still smaller than that of the computer you
                                                will be using to remotely access your Raspberry Pi moving
                                                forward.

                                  Interfaces. Make sure each of the following are enabled:
                                              SSH--the secure shell server for remote command line access
                                                to your Raspberry Pi. Enabling SSH means that the server is
                                                restarted each time you boot the Raspberry Pi.

                                              VNC--the Real VNC server for remote Virtual Network Com-
                                                puting access. Enabling VNC means that the server is
                                                restarted each time you boot the Raspberry Pi.

                                              SPI--the Serial Peripheral Interface on the GPIO header.
                                                Enabling here also automatically loads the SPI kernel module
                                                needed for various products using this serial interface.

                                              I2C--the Inter-Integrated-Circuit bus on the GPIO header.
                                                Enabling here also automatically loads the I2C kernel module.

                            above, or if you need to make changes at any point.
              Once you've completed configuration setup, click OK. You'll be prompted to
                reboot for the changes to take effect. You may see a few reboots occur for every-
                thing to fully take effect.
6. Once complete, you'll return to the Raspberry Pi OS desktop, where you'll now see an addi-
    tional Real VNC server icon at the top:

              Click on the VNC tab to identify the IP address(es) assigned to your Raspberry Pi
                under "Connectivity." You'll use this IP address to access your Raspberry Pi
                remotely using a VNC client on your personal computer.
105 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi

                      On your computer, open a new tab in your web browser. In the address bar, type
                        in https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer. Download and install
                        RealVNC Viewer on your computer.

                      Open RealVNC Viewer on your computer. As with a web browser, you'll find an
                        address bar where it says, "Enter a VNC Server address." Type in the IP address of
                        the Raspberry Pi you just identified.
                                  If prompted regarding VNC Server Identity Check Failed, click "Con-
                                    tinue" as you can confirm you are connecting to the expected Raspberry
                                    Pi VNC Server.
                                  When prompted, use the username and password you just configured
                                    for your Raspberry Pi OS. You can save this in VNC Viewer for auto-
                                    matic logins in the future.

                      The VNC icon in the Raspberry Pi OS menu will change from blue on white to
                        blue on black, as viewed from both the Raspberry Pi monitor and your VNC
                        Viewer remote display of the Raspberry Pi OS desktop.

                                  Moving the Raspberry Pi mouse will be seen in the VNC viewer display,
                                    and clicking on the VNC Viewer display and then moving your com-
                                    puter mouse will be seen on the Raspberry Pi monitor!

                                  As with past exercises, this may prove to "not-yet" be working, requir-
                                    ing strategic "fail-forward" troubleshooting.

                      From here, as long as you know the IP address of a Raspberry Pi, you will no
                        longer need a keyboard, mouse, and monitor for your Raspberry Pi, and will be
                        able to instead manage things remotely from your computer. The Raspberry Pi
                                                                                                            4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi 106

                        can now be run "headless."
                        When you connect to a new Raspberry Pi, you may need a mouse, keyboard, and
                        monitor to identify the IP address of the new Raspberry Pi before returning to
                        headless operation. If your Raspberry Pi is provided a dynamic IP address, the
                        address assigned may change at any moment, in which case you may need the
                        keyboard, mouse, and monitor temporarily. Therefore, in the next exercise, we'll
                        setup an organic LED (OLED), on which the IP address can be listed for continu-
                        ous headless operation.
                        NOTE: You may be able to connect from a desktop or laptop web browser to the
                        gateway router for your local area network (look around the case of the router to
                        find its default IP address, and enter that into the URL address bar of the browser).
                        In the router's website, there is often a listing of connected devices and the IP
                        addresses they have been assigned.
                        NOTE: On occasion, I have found that the Headless Resolution setup above will
                        somehow conflict with the RealVNC Viewer program on your personal computer.
                        It has not occurred frequently enough for me to fully diagnose a cause. And in
                        most cases, rebooting the Raspberry Pi has been sufficient to overcome this prob-
                        lem. Only once did I need to reconnect the Raspberry Pi to a keyboard, mouse,
                        and monitor to again run Raspberry Pi Configuration to adjust the Headless Reso-
                        lution under Display.

     Try Something New!

      Instead of working remotely using the VNC GUI, it's possible to open a terminal window on
      your laptop to use Secure Shell to login remotely. On your computer's terminal, type:

             ssh pi@x.x.x.x

      where x.x.x.x is the IP Address of your Raspberry Pi.

      After logging in using SSH, you can run any terminal-based applications. Many that have a
      GUI version, such as Raspberry Pi Configuration, also have a CLI version. For configuration,
      you would instead type the following in the SSH terminal window:

             sudo raspi-config

Key Takeaways

In this exercise, we launched the Raspberry Pi microcomputer with the Raspberry Pi OS for the first
time. For anyone who has used a brand-new computing device (e.g., computer, tablet, mobile phone)
for the first time, you'll have likely found a range of similarities and differences. These similarities and
107 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi

differences, though, aren't just between the Raspberry Pi and that of all the other computers you've
ever used. Rather, brands and generations of computers each have been shaped by a wide range of
social, cultural, and economic factors that have influenced the look, feel, and functionality of a given
device within a given context. To this extent, Raspberry Pi is just like other computers in use today.

         · Compare and contrast your experiences with the different computers you have used. There
            are three primary types of operating systems used today:
                      Microsoft Windows-based operating systems developed by Microsoft in the early
                        1980s.
                      Apple Mac-based operating systems, a Unix-based system released at the end of
                        the century to replace the "classic" Mac OS introduced in 1984.
                      Linux-based operating systems, including:
                                  Android, a mobile operating system developed by Google, first commer-
                                    cially used in 2007.
                                  Chrome OS, an operating system that uses the Google Chrome web
                                    browser as its principal user interface, first used commercially in 2011.
                                  Ubuntu (first released in 2004) and other popular Linux distributions
                                    used on laptop, desktop, and server computers around the world.
                                  Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop, which we just set up for the first time.
                      If possible, compare and contrast any brand-new computers you've turned on for
                        the very first time.
                      As you compare operating systems, consider how the following components vary:
                                  The command line interface
                                  The setup and configuration files
                                  The included everyday applications

Exercise: Adding an Adafruit PiOLED Text Display

An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is one or more LEDs in which an organic compound is added
on top to emit light in response to an electric current. The OLED in the image below provides 128 indi-
vidual white LEDs on the x-axis and 32 individual white LEDs on the y-axis, for a total of 4,096 white
LEDs. In addition to these white LEDs, the printed circuit board of this display also has a single-chip
driver and controller, designation SSD1306. It is through the SSD1306 chip that data and commands
are exchanged between the OLED dot-matrix graphic display system and the device to which it is con-
nected using the I2C serial communication bus--in our case, pins 2 and 3 on the Raspberry Pi GPIO.

Adafruit includes software drivers for use on the device in their Python library, which will allow us
to keep track of the IP address, operating system, CPU load, and disk usage of the Raspberry Pi. The
following steps will need to be done once for each newly installed operating system--specialty drivers
                                                                                                            4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi 108

generally are not installed within the base of a general-purpose operating system such as the Rasp-
berry OS, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, etc.
If the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi are readily accessible, you can connect the PiOLED to the fol-
lowing GPIO pins (use the table to match the image below with the associated Raspberry Pi GPIO, or
General Purpose Input Output, pins being used):

  5V 5V GND
 3.3V #2 #3

Steps

        1. Open a terminal window on the Raspberry Pi. Type in the following to install the needed
            Python 3 libraries and drivers:
            sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306
                      If you get an error that pip is not installed, you will need to rerun the above after
                        first typing in the following:
                        sudo apt install python3-pip
                        sudo apt install python3-pil
                      If this still doesn't work, you may need to do a full update of the Raspberry Pi OS
                        and installed applications by typing in the following before rerunning the above:
                        sudo apt update
                        sudo apt full-upgrade

        2. Next, type the following in the terminal window to create new directories in your home
109 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi

            directory.
            mkdir Code
            mkdir Code/Python
            cd Code/Python

        3. On the Raspberry Pi, click the blue circle icon associated with the Chromium web browser.
            Then enter the following URL:
            https://go.illinois.edu/PiOLED_stats

        4. Skim through the Python code to get a rough sense of what it's doing, and then download
            the code to your Raspberry Pi.
                      It may state that "Your Download is In Progress" while also asking if you want to
                        "Sign Up" or "Log In." This popup can just be closed--no account or log in is
                        required.
                      You'll likely receive a prompt stating, "This type of file can harm your computer.
                        Do you want to keep stats.py anyway?"
                                  As Python files can include malicious code, this is a safety mechanism
                                    to ensure that you trust this program.
                                  Select Keep here.
                      Click on the Carat ( ) symbol where it lists the downloaded stats.py file. From the
                        popup, select "Show in folder" to open the Folders Application.

        5. In the left section of the Folders window, click on the right-angled triangle in front of the
            Code directory to expand the subdirectories within Code. This will let you view the Code/
                                                                                                 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi 110

    Python subdirectory.
              Drag the stats.py code from /home/pi/Downloads into the /home/pi/Code/Python
                subdirectory.

              Click on the Python subdirectory to again view stats.py in the right section of
                Folders.

              Right-click stats.py to receive a drop-down menu of options.

6. From here, select Thonny Python IDE, a relatively beginner-friendly Python Integrated
    Development Environment (IDE) that comes with Raspberry OS Desktop.

7. In Thonny, click on the Run icon.
              If everything goes well, you should see an indication at the bottom of Thonny
111 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi

                        that everything is OK.
                      And on the PiOLED, you should now see the IP Address of your Raspberry Pi.
                      In the following images, note that the VNC Viewer and the stats.py program

                        being displayed using the PiOLED both indicate the same Raspberry Pi IP address,
                        172.16.112.58. After reviewing these images and associated text, proceed to the
                        next step to have stats.py run automatically each time the Raspberry Pi is booted.

                        Below is an image of a Raspberry Pi 3 side by side with a Raspberry Pi 400, on
                        which the PiOLED is also set up. By default, the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi
                                                                                                 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi 112

                400 are on the backside of the keyboard. In the image, an Adafruit CYBERDECK
                HAT is used to provide the same GPIO pin layout in a forward-facing location.
                And an Adafruit GPIO Reference Card for Raspberry Pi has been placed on top of
                the CYBERDECK to provide labeling similar to that provided by the Adafruit Pi
                Protector for Raspberry Pi installed during the first exercise of this chapter.

                Note that both the Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 400 are on the same 172.16
                local area network, and a remote computer's VNC Viewer can make connections
                to both simultaneously.

8. With the stats.py program tested, let's set it up to automatically run every time the Rasp-
    berry Pi boots up.
              In the Raspberry Pi terminal window, type:
                sudo mousepad /etc/rc.local
              Scroll to the bottom of the rc.local file you now have opened in Mousepad. In a
113 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi

                        new line just above the command "exit," type:
                        sudo python3 /home/pi/Code/Python/stats.py &

                      Click on the File option in Mousepad to save the edited file, and then close
                        Mousepad.

                      In the terminal window, type:
                        sudo reboot now

Watch the newly installed PiOLED and the newly configured RealVNC viewer. Together, you should
see that the Raspberry Pi goes through a full reboot process, and that the PiOLED automatically
restarts and provides a continuous update of baseline information regarding the Pi. At this point, you
should be provided with any new IP Address the Raspberry Pi is assigned if it is used in different loca-
tions in which it is set up to connect on the Local Area Network (LAN).

Wrap Up

In these exercises, we've worked to: 1) do a one-time installation of a case on the Raspberry Pi com-
puter; 2) install the Raspberry Pi OS Desktop to a microSD card and do an initial configuration of this
operating system for ongoing remote management; and 3) add drivers and Python code to the Rasp-
berry Pi OS so that when attached, a 123×32 PiOLED mini-display can be used to determine the cur-
rent IP address, operating system, CPU load, and disk usage of the Raspberry Pi.
As was noted in Orange Unit 3B: Computer Building Blocks, the operating system is installed and
maintained on a storage device like a hard drive or microSD card. But even the newest versions of
                                                                                                            4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi 114

SSD and microSD storage devices are like our old paperwork that we store up in an attic. We can't do
anything with it beyond just storing it there. When a computer is turned on, those instruction sets in
the operating system which are immediately needed are moved out of storage and into random access
memory (RAM). We sometimes call this "booting" a computer, also called "boot up" or "start up." We
disabled the splash screen to watch the line-by-line work done to boot a computer.

                                             4D: Coding Electronics

As a final exploration for this unit, we'll bring the hardware together with software, implementing
Python code to turn the LED lights on or off. So far, your LEDs and mechanical switches have func-
tioned together directly as part of isolated circuits coming together as a larger circuit on the bread-
board. Physical motion of the switches is used to communicate choices to other parts of the circuit.
Now, let's rewire them to add digital communication using an application to build a programmable
circuit, adding still another layer of complexity into the system.
NOTE: there are many microcontrollers, such as the Circuit Playground Express we'll use in the Blue
Unit, that have sufficient digital IO pins and can run the Python code we'll use in this concluding
chapter. However, we're using the Raspberry Pi, as it builds from the previous exercises of this ses-
sion of the Orange Unit. Further, the use of the Raspberry Pi here sets the stage for use of Python
code with this RGB LED breadboard prototype in the Rainbow Unit to provide digital switching using
a web browser!

                                                                 In the previous two chapters of this Orange Unit
                                                                 session, 4B: Meet the Microcomputer and 4C:
                                                                 Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi, we began
                                                                 familiarizing ourselves with the application of
                                                                 computer building blocks specifically to the
                                                                 Raspberry Pi microcomputer. After meeting the
                                                                 hardware, we went on to set up a Raspberry Pi-
                                                                 based Linux operating system, an organic (that

                                                                 and a bootup script to display some essential

Pi. The result looked something like the photo at left.

                                                                                 115

  But in doing so, we've also reserved access to six of the General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins,
  including the only two 5-volt power pins.

  Above, you can see two different displays of the pin layout formats commonly used with the Raspberry
  Pi GPIO1.
  Look through these and note that some, like #10, #9, and #11 just below the middle 3.3V pin, can be
  used for multiple purposes, such as digital inputs and outputs, or as a serial peripheral interface (SPI)
  connector with Master Out/Slave In, Master In/Slave Out, and Master Clock pins.

  gram you can run from the terminal window on your Raspberry Pi where you would type: pinout

        The use of the terms "master" and "slave" is rightly discomforting for many. As noted in the
        tween zine Beyond Dark Matter, "The master/slave relationship has been used for centuries
        in technology, often to explain situations where one master process or component controls
        a slave process or component" (p. 31, Beyond Dark Matter).
        Efforts are made periodically to move away from this embedded framing of the master/
        slave relationship within core aspects of all our electronics. This blockquote seeks to unpack
        further the hidden sociopolitical and economic realities that remain encoded within our
        sociotechnical technologies and systems.
  While there are many other pins for us to use than the ones covered by the PiOLED attached directly
  to the GPIO, this layout has proved less than optimal for later exercises, in which the Raspberry Pi is
  used with the breadboard electronics. This is particularly the case when a shared Raspberry Pi is con-
  nected and disconnected with different breadboards as each person tests out their own prototype2.
  For the next exercise, we'll remove the PiOLED from the Raspberry Pi GPIO, and instead connect a
  40-pin ribbon cable to the 2×20 GPIO of the Raspberry Pi. This can then be attached to a Cobbler or T-
  Cobbler on a full-sized breadboard. As we've used columns 1-30 for past exercises in the Orange Unit,
  we'll now attach the T-Cobbler to columns 44-63 of the breadboard.

                                      and ribbon cable
2. During beta-testing 2021-2022, the PiOLED was left connected and a half-sized breadboard was used. Male-to-female
  jumper wires were used to connect the appropriate pins on the Raspberry Pi GPIO with the associated holes on the bread-
  board. This remains an option for those with ongoing access of the same Raspberry Pi and for whom consistent access of
  data from the PiOLED and/or the smaller half-sized breadboard has proved of importance.

Breadboard connected to Raspberry Pi via Adafruit T-Cobbler and ribbon cable

If your IP address changes moving forward, you may need to disconnect the ribbon cable from the
GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi and reconnect the PiOLED temporarily. Alternatively, you can recon-
nect the Raspberry Pi to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

Connecting the Raspberry Pi and Breadboard

While the Fritzing diagrams in the first half of the Orange Unit were illustrated using a half-sized
breadboard, these could be (and hopefully were) done using a full-sized breadboard, which would have
been demonstrated with a Fritzing image as below. The unused space at the right of the breadboard is
just what is needed for this part of the exercise.

        1. Disconnect the USB-to-TTL cable and associated jumper wires from the breadboard.
        2. Insert an Adafruit T-Cobbler Plus into columns 44-63 of the breadboard. Leave at least two

            rows accessible above and below the T-Cobbler.
119 4D: Coding Electronics

The T-Cobbler was chosen to ensure that the ribbon cable does not cover the breadboard holes and the
GPIO pin labels associated with the top and bottom halves of each column. However, this results in
an extended layout of full-sized breadboard, ribbon cable, and breadboard. For some, the Cobbler Plus
may be the preferred alternative, keeping the full-sized length and instead adding the ribbon cable and
Raspberry Pi to the height of the layout.

        3. Use male-to-male jumper wires to provide 3.3 volts to the upper red rail, ground to the
            upper blue rail, 5 volts to the lower red rail, and ground to the lower blue rail.
                      The 3.3-volt GPIO pin immediately above the 5-volt GPIO pin below was chosen
                        instead of the 3.3-volt GPIO pin in the middle of the T-Cobbler to keep the jumper
                        wires to the right when working on later wiring. That said, both 3.3-volt pins and
                        any of the ground pins can be used for this step.
                      Rapid prototyping begins with quick testing of circuits, with jumper wire place-
                        ment of secondary concern. But wires can sometimes get in the way, and so in
                        your layout of the base system for future exercises, spending a bit of time now to
                        strategically create a platform for further work may be of value.

        4. From here, you can insert a 40-pin ribbon cable between the breadboard and the Raspberry
            Pi.
                      A common practice for ribbon cables is to use a white non-conductive shell over
                        the conductive metal wire that connects to pin one and black non-conductive
                        shells for the remainder of the wires. For the Raspberry Pi GPIO, pin 1 is the 3.3V
                        pin, which is now the upper half of column 63. A bump-out on the end-frame of
                        the ribbon cable is also often used, and an associated gap is provided on the T-
                        Cobbler to further help assure pin 1 is appropriately aligned.
                      Removing the ribbon cable does take some force. Holding it by the plastic frame
                        or as close to it as possible while steadily pulling it from the T-Cobbler or up from
                        the Raspberry Pi will help maintain the connections of the 40 wires with their
                        metal connectors inside this frame.
                      The GPIO pins tend to bend a bit if the ribbon cable frame is leaned slightly while
                        being removed from the Raspberry Pi. When possible, consider leaving the ribbon
                                                                                                                                    4D: Coding Electronics 120

                        cable attached to the Raspberry Pi and instead removing it from the T-Cobbler as
                        needed.

Try Something New!
The slide switch can continue to be used as a make-or-break switch to turn on and off 5 volts of
current to the shared anode leg of the RGB LED. This would then provide a mechanical override of any
selections made by code moving forward. However, given that the Raspberry Pi provides both 5-volt
and downregulated 3.3-volt power options, the slide switch can also be used to mechanically select
between voltages, helping to control the brightness of the lights by running a jumper wire from the
3.3-volt rail to the left throw leg of the switch, as shown below.

Schematically, the RGB LED, resistor, and switches within the breadboard circuitry remain the same.
However, now they receive 5V and 3.3V power and ground through the Raspberry Pi by way of the
T-Cobbler.
121 4D: Coding Electronics

From here, consider using resistors to further control the lower level of brightness for that left side of
the switch to match your preference for a dim setting.
Try Something New!
There still may be those times when it is helpful to use the 128×32 pixels of the PiOLED to provide
important data through code running on the Raspberry Pi, whether the stats are given through
stats.py or some other information you'd like sent as part of upcoming exercises.

      NOTE: Testing over two semesters and extended conversations
      with others who have used the PiOLED across the country have
      indicated that there is significant risk of improperly wiring a
      breadboard to the PiOLED, thereby resulting in short-circuiting
      of the PiOLED. This burned-out PiOLED circuit cannot be
      repaired. Therefore, this has been removed as a normal exercise
      and instead has been moved to a Try Something New activity. Use
      caution in proceeding in this selected optional task.

         · To connect the PiOLED to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, you now
            need to run 6 male-to-male jumper wires from the breadboard to
            the PiOLED.
                      There is an Adafruit flower icon on the upper left side
                        of the PiOLED. This points to the hole associated with
                        5-volt power.
                                                                                                                                    4D: Coding Electronics 122

                      The other two holes in the top row are a second 5-volt hole for power and a hole
                        for ground, in that order.

                      The hole just below the 5-volt power hole is the 3.3-volt power hole.
                      The other two holes in the bottom row are the holes for SDA (serial data) and SCL

                        (serial clock) I2C communications, respectively.
         · Pin 1 of the PiOLED is the lower left hole in the drawing below. It is connected to a 3.3-volt

            source on the breadboard.
         · Here it is connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO pin 1, which is the upper rows of column 63 of

            the breadboard. This design choice was made to help align the remainder of the pins of the
            PiOLED with the appropriate connections on the breadboard.
         · Using an orange-colored jumper wire for the 3.3-volt connection, red jumper wires for the
            5-volt connections, and a black jumper wire for the ground connection may help identify
            the connection points in the future.
         · Once you've reached a successful point of "yes," consider using some electrical tape at the
            plastic frames of the jumper wires to keep these wires in their assigned layout at the point
            where they connect to the breadboard, and again at the PiOLED if you will only occasion-
            ally be using the PiOLED attachment.

Key Takeaways
The breadboard is a common way to do rapid prototyping. Many different electronic circuits may be
tested in rapid succession. It's also possible to keep multiple breadboards with different versions of an
electronic circuit on hand to take with you in testing by a diverse range of communities. While it's
sometimes possible to also bring multiple Raspberry Pi's, this layout is meant to provide a means by
which different breadboards can be attached and detached from a given Raspberry Pi in support of
testing of multiple breadboard prototypes.

Digital Switches

So far, we've been working with mechanical switches. We've used the slide switch to move the flow
of current to the anode leg of the RGB LED both between on and off states and between 5-volt and
3.3-volt power sources. We've also used the momentary "on" push button switch to temporarily com-
plete the flow of current to ground, thereby turning on the associated red, green, or blue cathode legs
of the RGB LED. Like light switches in our house, these mechanical switches can serve a valuable func-
tion in our daily lives.

But sometimes the use of a mechanical switch may prove inadequate for a task. Perhaps you still
make use of the mechanical switch for regular use of a light, but need a safety switch to override a
mechanical on/off switch to quickly turn on the light when a fire alarm sounds. Or maybe access to
the mechanical switch is difficult and you'd like to move to a digital control through a phone app.

Digital Input/Output Pins vs. Power and Ground Pins

Before moving on, it's important that we look a bit closer at the labels on the GPIO pins:

                                       In particular, compare those whose labels start with "GPIO #" to those
                                       labeled as "Ground." We've specifically used labeled "Ground" for the
                                       blue grounding rails on the breadboard. Those labeled "GPIO #," on the
                                       other hand, or not designed as a ground source, but are instead gen-
                                       eral-purpose digital input/output pins. Digital inputs and outputs
                                       (IO) are used on microcontroller and microcomputer GPIO pins for
                                       binary on or off logic. In code, this is sometimes written as binary
                                       High and Low or as digital True or False. The current used for digital
                                       IO is relatively small and can include negative as well as positive volt-
                                       age. This can be important when pushing a speaker cone out with a
                                       DC signal that varies between 0 and some positive voltage before
                                       pulling the speaker cone back with a DC signal that varies between 0
                                       and some negative voltage. The general-purpose digital IO pins pro-
                                       vide a perfect match to the momentary and transistor switches.

As the GPIO digital IO pins do move from positive voltage to relative zero voltage, we could just send
our digital outputs straight to the 470  resistors connected to each of the three cathode legs. But as
this is not true ground but a relative zero voltage, it is possible there could be a slight glow of color on
an LED, even though the digitally switched circuit is an open circuit. The relative difference between
power and ground is insufficient to assure the LED is off in keeping with the decision tree within the
code.

                     Digitally switched RGB LED with red, green, and blue legs of the RGB connected
                     directly to their assigned GPIO ports.

Digital switches come in multiple classes and types. To address the misuse of the digital IO ports
as a ground source instead of its intended digital High or Low role, we will use as digital switches
transistors--solid-state electronic devices used as part of much of our daily life electronics, which are
designed specifically for tasks like this. We'll place these between each of the three cathode legs of the
RGB LED and their assigned GPIO ports.

More on Transistors

Starting in the 1960s, a new term was heard in
relation to radios, calculators, and televisions. I
remember the commercial that inspired our fam-
ily to get its first "transistor radio." I also remem-
ber going to the five-and-dime or drug store to
purchase a vacuum tube until we finally got that
transistor television. Transistors replace those
tubes by providing a semiconductor device hav-
ing at least three legs: a source current terminal;
a drain current terminal; and a gate terminal,
which controls the output current.
At its most basic level, the transistor serves as
a switch. While our momentary switch circuits above required a physical act, the pushing of a button
125 4D: Coding Electronics

or the sliding of a switch, a transistor switch uses an electrical input to determine the flow of current.
Further, transistors are designed such that the switching voltage is less than or equal to the volt-
age of the current flowing through the transistor. The 3.3- or 5-volt output from the Raspberry Pi
GPIO pins can be used to turn on and off not only a 5-volt LED, but also a 40-volt DC motor! In this
way the transistor can also serve as an amplifier. "In fact the initial tests of the first transistor
involved hooking a speaking to its output and hearing that it was louder than the input. Every modern
piece of audio circuitry has transistors at its heart amplifying signals." (Dave Astels, "Transistors 101":
https://learn.adafruit.com/transistors-101/basic-operation)

Types of Transistors

Transistors are built using two different types of semiconductor material. Unlike a jumper wire that
is always conductive, a semiconductor is a substance that can conduct electricity under some condi-
tions, but not under others. An n-type semiconductor is mostly made of negative electrons. A p-type
semiconductor is mostly made of positive charge carriers.
When a transistor uses both n-type and p-type semiconductor material, and only those two types of
semiconductor material, it is called a bipolar transistor. The bipolar transistors are three-terminal
devices with the standard Emitter, Base, Collector (EBC) pinout. The emitter and collector on either
end of the transistor are of the same type of semiconductor, while the center base is of the other type
of semiconductor. In this way, the base provides a junction between the collector and emitter. When
a biasing voltage is applied to the base terminal, the junction breaks down, and current can flow from
the collector to the emitter.

As we've been doing with the momentary switches of our parallel red, green, and blue RGB LED cir-
cuits, we can use three bipolar transistors as switches to determine the state of each circuit. To do this,
we need to decide between the two different configurations of a basic bipolar transistor.

         · The NPN bipolar transistor has a collector and emitter made of N-type negative electrons
            and a center base made of P-type positive electrons. For our LED circuits to have current
            flow from the cathode leg of an LED to the collector and emitter of the transistor and
            thereby to ground, voltage is sent to the base leg of this type of transistor to turn on its
            gate.

         · The PNP bipolar transistor has a collector and emitter made of P-type positive electrons
            and a center base made of N-type negative electrons. For our LED circuits to have current
            flow from the cathode leg of an LED to the collector and emitter of the transistor and
            thereby to ground, ground is sent to the base leg of this type of transistor to turn on its
            gate.

Below is a Fritzing drawing and associated schematic in which a momentary switch is used to provide
ground to the PNP transistor base and 5 volts to the NPN transistor base. Let's now use this infor-
mation as our starting baseline for designing and prototyping our programmable RGB LED switched
circuitry.

Exercise: Control LEDs with Python Code

With the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi readily accessible via a Cobbler or T-Cobbler on the breadboard
and with a rudimentary understanding of PNP and NPN bipolar transistors, we're ready to rewire the
electronics to use Python code to input data from the momentary switches and to output data to tran-
sistor switches connected to the three legs of the RGB LED.
For this exercise, we'll use GPIO #5, #6, and #12 for the momentary switches, and GPIO #26, #19, and
#13 for the base of the transistor switches to be integrated into programming code. The grouping of
these pins was selected to roughly match electronics with GPIO pin groupings. But other digital IO
pins with a "GPIO #" hash label at their start could have also been used. What works for one may not
be ideal for others, which is where alpha and beta testing, along with open channels for feedback after
implementation, come in. Feedback from past students doing these exercises has proved essential in
improving functionality for diverse audiences.

Part 1: Steps to Rewire the Circuits

Here's the configuration of our current circuits (without sequin LEDs) as a reminder of where we're
starting:
                                                                                                                                    4D: Coding Electronics 128

And here's the Fritzing image we're working towards:

Instead of using the pressing of momentary switches to directly complete the flow of current from
power to ground by way of an associated leg of the RGB LED, a Python program will now continu-
ously collect digital inputs from each momentary switch to determine if they are pressed or released.
The code will also continuously send output to the base of each transistor to inform them of the state
of the associated momentary switch, thereby electronically switching the red, green, and blue LEDs
between on and off.

        1. Repurpose the three male-to-male jumper wires connecting the three momentary switches
            to the associated red, green, and blue cathode legs of the RGB LED. Connect the right legs
            of each momentary switch with its associated GPIO digital input pin.
129 4D: Coding Electronics

                      Move the jumper wire connected to column 19 to instead connect to the upper
                        rows of column 49, which is associated with GPIO #5. Leave the wire connected
                        to column 3, bringing together the "red" push button with GPIO #5.

                      Move the jumper wire connected to column 21 to instead connect to the upper
                        rows of column 48 which is associated with GPIO #6. Leave the wire connected to
                        column 9, bringing together the "green" push button with GPIO #6.

                      Move the jumper wire connected to column 23 to instead connect to the lower
                        rows of column 48, which is associated with GPIO #12. Leave the wire connected
                        to column 15, bringing together the "blue" push button with GPIO #12.

                      Be sure to leave the male/male jumper wires connecting the left legs of the
                        momentary switches with the blue ground rail on the breadboard.

        2. Add three PN2907A PNP bipolar transistors to the breadboard, connecting the collector legs
            to the associated red, green, and blue cathode legs of the RGB LED and the emitter legs to
            ground. These should be placed in the upper rows of the breadboard, with the flat face of
            each transistor facing the lower rows. In so doing, the emitter leg will be on the left side of
            the transistors and the collector leg on the right side of the transistors.
                                                                                                                                    4D: Coding Electronics 130

                      Place one transistor in the upper rows of columns 25, 26, and 27. Connect column
                        25 to the blue ground rail. Connect column 27 to the upper rows of column 19.

                      Place a second transistor in the upper rows of columns 29, 30, and 31. Connect
                        column 29 to the blue ground rail. Connect column 31 to the upper rows of col-
                        umn 21.

                      Place a third transistor in the upper rows of columns 33, 34, and 35. Connect col-
                        umn 33 to the blue ground rail. Connect column 35 to the upper rows of column
                        23.

        3. Finally, connect the base of each transistor with its associated GPIO digital output pin.

                      Connect the transistor base found in column 26 with the upper rows of column
                        45, which is GPIO #26.

                      Connect the transistor base found in column 30 with the upper rows of column
                        46, which is GPIO #19.

                      Connect the transistor base found in column 34 with the upper rows of column
                        47, which is GPIO #13.

In practice, when doing any of these breadboard exercises, your implementation may look a bit dif-
ferent than the Fritzing image to adjust for the actual components at hand. The key is to achieve the
designated associations that we'll next make use of within a Python program.

Part 2: Steps to Run the Code

For Part 2, we'll now be working in the Raspberry Pi OS. While this can all be done from a terminal
window (the standard Linux command-line Interface, or CLI), for most this is best done through a
graphical user interface (GUI) using a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. These can either be directly con-
nected to a Raspberry Pi, or as demonstrated in Orange Unit 4C, by using a RealVNC Viewer on your
personal computer.
131 4D: Coding Electronics

        1. In the web browser on the Raspberry Pi, enter:
            https://go.illinois.edu/switchLED

        2. Download the file "switchLED.py" to the Raspberry Pi. You do NOT need to log in or sign
            up to successfully open and download the Python code.

        3. Click on the "File Manager" icon in the Raspberry Pi Desktop Menu. Move switchLED.py
            from the Downloads folder to the /home/pi/Code/Python folder.

        4. Double click on the "switchLED.py" file. By default, files that end with .py will be opened
            with Thonny, a popular Python integrated development environment (IDE) that comes pre-
            installed on the Raspberry OS Desktop.
                      Click on the Run icon in Thonny. This is a common method within integrated
                        development environments to test out new code. As such, you will see in the
                        "Shell" window at the bottom the same display that would be shown if this code
                        were being executed in a terminal window in practice moving forward.
                      Click on the Stop icon in Thonny, and then close the Thonny window.

        5. Click on the "Terminal" icon in the Raspberry Pi Desktop Menu. In terminal, type:
            cd /home/pi/Code/Python
            python switchLED.py
            You'll now fully see the text provided by the switchLED.py code, with instructions for using
            the programmable switch. It also provides instructions to hold down the <CTRL> key and
            press the "c" key to exit this program.

Key Takeaways

Take a few minutes to go back to Thonny and skim through the code, especially noting:

        1. The three groupings of components associated with the red, green, and blue parallel cir-
            cuits.

        2. The outputs are designated by the associated LED that will be lit. The inputs are designated
            by the associated momentary switch that is mechanically pressed and released.

        3. Your Raspberry Pi GPIO # should match the listed board.D number, being assigned within
            the digitalio.DigitalInOut library object definitions. For instance, the right leg of the "red"
            momentary switch should be connected to GPIO #5 to match board.D5 being assigned to
            switchR.

        4. At the bottom of the code, you'll find the line "while True:" which starts a Python forever
            loop. The next three lines will continuously be run to update ledR.value to match the cur-
            rent switchR.value.
                      When a momentary switch is pressed, the digital input has a flow to ground. This
                        sets the current to ground, which is identified as a binary zero. And as setup
                                                                                                                                    4D: Coding Electronics 132

                        within the digitalio library, this is identified as a digital False.
                      When the ledR.value is next updated with the switchR.value, it will now be set to

                        digital False/binary zero as well.
                      When the digital False/binary zero output reaches the base of the red transistor,

                        the red rail's 5-volt current, which flowed through the shared anode leg to the red
                        cathode leg and through the 470  resistor to the collector leg of the transistor,
                        can now flow to the emitter leg of the transistor and then to the blue ground rail.
                        The red circuit is closed, and the light comes on!
In previous sessions of the Orange Unit, circuits were constructed using electronic components with-
out code.

Looking at the new programmable code schematically, we can see three parallel momentary switches
and three parallel LEDs as before. But each momentary switch is no longer directly, physically in series
with its associated LED. Circuits are instead dynamically constructed and completed through code.
This schematic shows us only the electronics of our new system. Code is not shown in schematics,
as it can be readily changed to do different acts with the same physical structures. We are now truly
opening the literal and conceptual hood of technology in a way that hopefully begins to demystify not
just this example, but also more of your electronic components used as part of your daily life.
As mentioned at the start of this activity, we chose to use the Raspberry Pi GPIO #5, #6, and #12 for
the momentary switches, and GPIO #26, #19, and #13 for the LEDs to be integrated into programming
code. In this case, the Raspberry Pi's GPIO and associated electronics and embedded code
together create one, more complex circuit. Code, in this case using the Python programming lan-
guage, is used to determine the activities based on the state of the momentary switches and the design
decisions controlling the state of the LEDs.
133 4D: Coding Electronics

In what ways do you find the following true? False? As we move from circuits made exclusively of
physical electronic parts to ones that also include programming code, greater opportunities for inno-
vation-in-use become available.

Opening the Hidden Box of Today's Keyboards

We've been steadily exploring different parts of basic electronic circuits, leading to the most recent
exercises using a microcomputer to read inputs from a switch when it is pressed to complete a circuit.
The microcomputer then provides a designated response, sending a ground signal to the associated
cathode leg of an RGB LED to complete that circuit, thereby turning on that color of light.
The Raspberry Pi is a general-purpose microcomputer, allowing us to make use of a range of unas-
signed GPIO pins to create the electronic circuits and to edit and run Python code to work with these
circuits. Take a moment to consider how many other applications are also running right now on the
Raspberry Pi.
While general-purpose computers provide considerable flexibility, there are times when single-use
computers and microprocessors are instead used. As one example, consider that which is used within
a typical keyboard. Each key on the keyboard is physically a momentary switch push button and per-
forms the same base function as that on our own coded circuit. But imagine what this might look like
if there were 100+ parallel circuits being used, one for each key of your keyboard. That would be a lot
of individual pins going into that microcontroller I/O port!
It's for this reason that the keyboard uses a key matrix. Conceptually visualize your keyboard's key
matrix like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. Maybe you have a spreadsheet with 6 rows and 18
columns, providing you with 108 cells. By creating a cell map, when you see that one cell has just
changed color, you just need to see which row and which column are associated with that cell, and
then look at the cell map to determine what's up.
                                                                                                                                    4D: Coding Electronics 134

As I look at the keyboard I'm using right now to type this text, I can see that my left pinky finger is
hovering over row four, column four, starting from the upper left of the keyboard. That is, it is hov-
ering over the letter "a" of my keyboard. If I move my right pinky finger to row 5, column 15 of my
keyboard, I would hold down the shift key before pressing row four, column four, to get the letter "A"
of my keyboard.

       Instead of needing 108 IO pins for the keyboard microcontroller, I now only need 6 + 18 = 24 IO
       pins, plus an associated software character map.

Keyboards are a great case study in how basic circuit building, combined with strategic electronic
layout design and data mapping, opens a wide range of human-centered design possibilities. For the
Raspberry OS and the Raspbian Configuration program, this means we can quickly change the char-
acter map for any attached keyboard to make it work appropriately for the language of the user. Even
if the keyboard microcontroller has a different character map with which it associates points on the
key matrix of the keyboard, operating system software can often override some or all of that character
map. Of course, this doesn't change the physical characters written on the keyboard itself. But that
doesn't hold back someone who is a touch typist looking at the screen to see which momentary switch
push button was just pressed.

One other note of import regarding our review of the keyboard as an introductory case study. The
microcontroller inside the keyboard case may have 24 IO pins (probably more, as some are used as
outputs for LEDs, and still others to communicate with the keyboard). But a wired keyboard cable
is typically only providing four wires: the ground, power, transmit, and receive associated with the
USB, or Universal Serial Bus, connection. This serves as another great example of how the electronics
around us are often made with a mix of parallel and serial circuits joining and breaking away from
other parallel and serial circuits. The keyboard, then, is a helpful case study in how various simple ser-
ial and parallel circuits artifacts come together to create a somewhat more complex set of serial and
parallel circuit artifacts. Together, these become the system of a keyboard!

Wrap Up

We've gone from basic LED circuits in parallel using different levels of resistance and different volt-
ages, to LEDs in series controlled by momentary switches, to integrated circuits, to code-based circuits.
We have also taken our first dips into the Raspberry Pi microcomputer pond to see how these elec-
tronic parts, along with a range of other electronics, come together to create large, complex systems
like computers.

A wide range of individual electronic components can be brought together using power and ground
sources and conductors to build individual circuits, like the red, green, and blue LED circuits we cre-
ated using the RGB LED with common anode. Using a printed circuit board, electronic components
can be put together to create an integrated circuit, like the Sequin LED integrated circuit. Integrated
135 4D: Coding Electronics

circuits and additional electronic components can be further put together with code to create limited
purpose microcontrollers like the Circuit Playground Express we'll use in the Blue Unit, and general-
purpose microcomputers like the Raspberry Pi.

We've begun to discover that software can open opportunities for further innovation-in-use, as is the
case with different character maps for one keyboard key matrix. And in the character map example,
we've also seen how software can at the same time restrict innovation-in-use, as is the case when an
operating system or other software overrides a selected character map with its own standards for key-
board character associations. The configurations of our sociotechnical devices are multi-tiered hard-
ware, software, and social constructs that are far from neutral. These constructs can come into conflict
as data and information regarding past design choices are lost or hidden from viewing by current inno-
vators. They shape current work, even as the current work seeks to further shape these sociotechnical
devices.

As mentioned in a video segment at the beginning of this session, my history with computers goes
back to the mid-1970s in junior high, and my work with general electronics even longer, as I grew up
in my family's sawmill. In this next video, I share my memories of electronics and programming dur-
ing the late 1980s and early 1990s, as I worked on my research as a PhD student at Rutgers. You may
find some similarities to the work we've just done! [Watch the video "My History with Computers:

Blue Unit Overview

Humans are analog, while computers are digital and binary - zeros and ones. As we will begin explor-
ing in the Blue Unit, part of our work with the following coding activities is to perform translations
between analog and digital. However, it's important to realize that sometimes the analog materials
cannot be replaced by digital. And sometimes, even if the digital could replace the analog, this trans-
lated version may not serve as well as the analog version. There are also times, though, when it proves
best to either use the digital translation or to use information that is collected digitally. In this section,
we will begin using electronics and human analog tools as well as digital-only materials to begin doing
computational thinking in new, creative, inclusive ways by using computational tinkering.

Tinkering, the making of relatively small changes in order to improve or repair, is both a part of every-
day life and also a historic way for sustainable living. While dictionaries recognize that it is often asso-
ciated with a person living in an itinerant community, from my personal experience, this also includes
members of non-traveling communities as well, as some of my close relatives and I identify as tinkers.

Makerspaces are places to both respect traditional crafts and to also explore, create, invent, and learn
using digitally-based crafts that, too, can reflect a tinker mindset. Creative tinkering studios are start-
ing to emerge around the country, such as the Tinkering Studio at the Exploratorium in San Francisco,
California, meant to allow museum visitors to slow down and deeply engage in the investigation of sci-
entific phenomena in ways that, at the same time, open up creations representing their ideas and aes-
thetics. Project Computational Tinkering at the MIT Media Lab has worked with the Exploratorium's
Tinkering Studio to explore computational thinking concepts and practices through both analog and
digital materials to teach and explore the important skills of communication, collaboration, creativ-
ity, and critical thinking as well as the design thinking skills of inspiration, ideation, and iteration.
They define the term computational tinkering as "bringing together decomposition, pattern recogni-
tion, abstraction, and algorithms of computational thinking with tinkering's idea generating, design-
ing, personalizing, expressing, remixing, collaborating, questioning, reflecting, and iterating."

  The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), the Computer Science Teachers Associ-
  ation (CSTA), and a range of computer science teachers, researchers, and practitioners collaborated to
  create an operational definition and series of standards, defining computational thinking as a problem-
  solving process that brings together computer and other tools with critical and algorithmic thinking,
  confidence in dealing with complexity, tolerance for ambiguity, and the ability to communicate and
  work with others to achieve a common goal or solution.1 Moreover, initiatives in K-12 education, such
  as Computer Science for All, focus on educating students in these computational thinking skills, as
  they are now considered the basic skills necessary for economic opportunity and social mobility. These
  skills are not only valuable in the classroom, but also in informal learning environments, corporate
  teams, and the boardroom.

  But as Bertram Bruce notes, there is a "commonly-held view that computer technology is a tool that
  will in and of itself improve education, and ultimately ameliorate social ills."2 This itself builds from
  an underlying assumption that technology and social relations are independent from each other, that
  technologies are neutral tools with fixed meanings, and "that people are agents independent of their
  technologies."3

  To this end, it is important we further consider the deeply intertwined advancements of society, hard-
  ware, and software; that we continue to expand our methodological landscape to incorporate the
  deductive and inductive methods along with critical methodologies; that we search out knowledges
  and wealths beyond those in the dominant narratives of society; and that we work to execute compu-
  tational tinkering in ways that advance inclusive computer science experiences.

  Side by side, we'll also tinker with electronics and code so as to create digital storytelling devices so
  that by the end of this unit, you can use them to share your own counterstory prototypes as developed
  in the Orange Unit.

  As we consider our future professions, it may be helpful to reflect on the following questions adapted
  from the Exploratorium's Tinkering Studio.

           · How can we support people in bringing their different contexts and perspectives into com-
              putational tinkering activities in our future professional endeavors?

           · What could be the role of equity and narrative in computational tinkering activities?
           · How do we create activities that don't result in people just copying the examples at hand

              but having opportunities to get creative in drop-in learning spaces?

         · How can we support learners and teachers alike to be comfortable not knowing the end
            result or the answer with computational tinkering activities?

As noted by Linda Liukas, computer code is becoming the next universal language. It is urgent for us
to find ways to help young people move forward with greater optimism and bravery regarding tech-
nologies. To achieve this, we need to join together and imagine a world in which technology tools
can be tinkered with in ways that make them more wonderful, whimsical, and a tiny bit weird. Above
all, the Blue Unit seeks to provide a studio for communities of practice to begin just this sort of jour-
ney. [Watch the video of Linda Liukas' TED Talk, "A Delightful Way to Teach Kids About Computers,"

Background Knowledge Probe

Bring to mind an everyday computing tool at your regular disposal. On initial reflection:
         · What design motivations may have inspired the original creators of this tool?
                      What may have been happening that they perhaps wanted to happen more
                        through creation of this new/improved/remixed tool?
                      What may have not been happening that they perhaps wanted to happen for
                        the first time through the creation of this new/improved/remixed tool?
                      What may have been happening that they perhaps wanted to reduce or stop
                        from happening through creation of this new/improved/remixed tool?
         · Who may have been involved in the design, development, and creation of this tool?
         · What may have been some of the motivations for those involved?

An Evolution of Computing Tools

From abacus to tabulating machine, early computing tools were designed to achieve inspirational
goals. Who was inspired to guide the design and creation of the tools, their strategies for failing for-
ward in that design and creation process, the motivating factors for their involvement, and the ulti-
mate implementation of these early computing tools varied considerably. Further, the impact of these
early tools on more recent computing devices, including the digital computers of today, are sometimes
embedded within the design inspirations and creation process of past computing devices, even if they
aren't specifically interrelated.

of real situations and real people as they relate to an everyday computing tool. On further reflection:

         · What may have been some of the motivations for those involved?

Many factors have influenced the growth of human civilization. The ways in which this growth was
shaped by the design and creation of computing machines, and the ways in which this growth inspired
and shaped the design and creation of these machines varies considerably. What is certain is that the
demand for more sophisticated and powerful devices was an outcome of the growth of human civiliza-
tion, whether it was a designed and planned objective or not.

 Reading the World, Reading the Word, and Tinkering

  As we look through the journeys of hardware and programming logic, and as we reflect on our expe-
  riences through reflection probes, we begin a process of codification: bringing together the context
  and the content of real situations and real people. This work of systematizing, or reducing to a code, a
  broader range of ideas, practices, policies, and standards into a more ordered plan or scheme, has been
  an ongoing work of sciencific and professional practices throughout human history. Writing computer
  programming code is not a radical change to this historic work of codification, but a new technique
  for doing so using emerging digital technologies in addition to, or instead of, regular analog tools.

  Learning these codifications, and then problematizing, or decodifying, these to ask questions and cri-
  tique more deeply the issues at hand as related to the codifications of these real situations and real
  problems is at the root of Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy. It is an educational process that brings action
  and reflection into praxis through dialogue. While there may be individuals in a specific learning com-
  munity who serve in lead instructional roles within that learning community, their knowledge is less
  than complete, thus requiring them to periodically shift to the role of student. And students, while
  they may have no or limited knowledge and expertise with the specific content and context under con-
  sideration, bring other knowledge and expertise to bear, requiring periodic shifting of roles to that of
  instructor.

  This approach stands in opposition to the dominant banking concept of education, in which knowl-
  edge is bestowed as a gift by experts to the empty vessels who have come to be filled by this learned
  teacher. For in critical pedagogy, the dialogue of all within a learning community presupposes equal-
  ity amongst participants. Each must trust the others as people with expertise in their own rights. An
  instructor-student comes into the learning community with a significant level of knowledge or skill in
  an area of study, and so has certain clear responsibilities with regards to learning outcomes achieved
  using expository techniques such as synchronous and asynchronous audio and video lectures and
  authoritative choices on readings and experiential learning activities.1
  At the same time, the instructor-student must also have mutual respect and love for the student-
  instructor as each one questions what they know. And together, instructor-student and student-
  instructor must realize that through the dialogic action-reflection cycles of problem-posing, education
  leads to potentially reconsidering knowledge in ways that further humanize all participants.

  A central tenet of Freirean literacy campaigns, which strongly fit within the digital literacies of today,
  is the essential recognition that in reading the words, in this case of technology, we are also learning to
  read the world. The instructor-student strives to incorporate strategically selected words, words that
  generate exploration and can be combined to create generative themes, into co-explorations that iden-

   149 1A: The Logic of Hardware and Programming

  tifiy limit-situations built through domination. And for Freire, domination implies its opposite, limit-
  acts leading to the objective of liberation.2

  As we enter into this exploration of person-centered computational tinkering, it is essential that we
  join with a diverse group of others. This is the liberatory literacy work of Jane Addams and the Hull
  House, of Miles Horton and the Highlander Folk School, and it is the work of community inquiry
  and community networking today.3 And it is the work that inspires the construction of the generative
  themes within this book. This requires that we work across difference, bringing together a breadth of
  functional diversities, cultural wealths, and knowledges into dialogue facilitating our critical explo-
  ration of the sociotechnical artifacts in our daily lives. As we do this, we must work towards decod-
  ifying the real situations and real people that are shaping, and being shaped by, these sociotechnical
  artifacts. Through this, we can begin to identify with aspects of the situation, feeling the ways we are
  in the situation, reflecting upon and discussing these various aspects, and thereby bringing the picture
  into better focus through our new recodifications of the concepts and terms at hand.

  As Bertram Bruce notes in "Technology as Social Practice," technology and social practices are not
  separate. Social relations are encoded in technologies. Conversely, technologies are encoded in social
  relations. Social relations and technologies are mutually constituted. But as we become enmeshed in
  these social + technical networks, we are left seeing only the black box. And so we cannot work to
  codify the social separate from working to codify the technical. Just as the invention of writing could
  be considered the first educational technology, so too the moveable-type printing press further altered
  educational practice. But these were mutually shaped, not just mutually shaping. As Bruce further
  notes: "A given technology brought about educational change, but at the same time, requirements of
  society operating through the educational system generated changes in the associated technology."
  Technologies and social practices cannot be separated. Bruce concludes: "A technology is a system of
  people, texts, artifacts, activities, ideology, and cultural meanings. It doesn't so much determine, as
  become social practices. Our task then must be consider critically what those social practices are now
  and what they can become in the future."

 Lesson Plan

  Let's begin by considering how all forms of the creative process, including computational tinkering,
  are social and technical works. Analyzing this can only be done together with others from different
  backgrounds, experiences, knowledges, wealths, and valued ways of being and doing. We'll start by
  working to advance our reflections, more fully bringing together the social and the technical into a
  new picture of real situations and real people. And we'll work to use community of practice group dis-

cussions and individual reflections, along with the hands-on activities, to bring this into sharper focus
in the context of coding concepts and practices.

Our objective is to bring together a complex blend of ideas, concepts, and hands-on practice with
components of our everyday sociotechnical artifacts. Along the way, look for innovation-in-use/remix
prompts encouraging you to make creative adjustments and expansions of the sociotechnical artifacts
to do more of what you and your community of practice value being and doing. What hopes, doubts,
values and challenges might be brought into dialectical interaction with their opposites? How might
this exchange inform our use of existing analog information systems and our design, creation, and use
of complementary digital tools?

Background Knowledge Probe

Take a few minutes to bring to mind an electronic device from home or work that you use daily. Then
think through the following questions as they relate to this device:

         · What do you see as the primary purposes for having this electronic device?
         · What inputs and outputs do you think are used to ensure this electronic device performs as

            expected?
         · What calculations do you think this device makes with the inputs and outputs to ensure it

            performs as expected?

The Shaping of Electronics

In the Orange Unit, we worked to demystify the basic electronics and hardware found in the digital
technologies of our daily lives. To do so, we primarily worked with the physical electrical components
and supporting parts to build a complete, closed path for current to flow from source to ground. That
is, we created circuits.
Consider that someone chose to design and provide instructions for others to create a circuit in which
a momentary switch push button is placed on a breadboard next to a Raspberry Pi computer in a way
that one diffused white LED stays lit as long as that circuit passes current through a resistor to the
passthrough legs of that push button on to the anode (positively charged) leg of the LED, then through
the cathode (ground) leg of the LED and to a grounded connection. Two other LEDs are placed in a
circuit such that they only light up when the momentary switch push button is depressed.

         · Why use diffused LEDs and not ultra bright LEDs?
         · Why white and blue LEDs and not different colors of LEDs?

                                                                                 151
                                                                                                                          1B: Essential Coding Concepts 152

         · Why is only one LED lit unless a switch is pressed while two other LEDs are only lit when
            the switch is pressed?

         · Why connect the wires and electronics in the way selected on the breadboard and then
            through a 40-pin ribbon cable to the Raspberry Pi, and not in one of the many other ways
            they could have been connected?

         · Were these all good enough, less than you would have preferred, exceptionally well chosen,
            or is this question even of importance?

Asking these kinds of questions expands our understanding of the ways in which the shaping of elec-
tronic hardware shapes what data is collected, how it is collected, and ultimately its influence on
knowledge/power.

How are you being shaped by the design choices in this book? Who is doing the shaping?
Why?

In the last unit, our hope was to join together, author and reader, as a learning community to shape
the actions of the electronic components through the building of circuits only using those electronic
components, thereby establishing complete and closed paths in which an electric circuit can flow.
We learned how current flows from a source, through electrical components like resistors, LEDs, and
momentary switch push buttons, to reach ground.

We saw how integrated circuits use printed circuit boards to bring all these pieces together into
a single whole. In this way, all that is apparent is the source entering into the + side of the integrated
circuit and then leaving through the - side to reach ground. In some ways, then, the integrated circuit
begins to place these components into a "black box." But the individual electronics are still there, all
the same.

We also saw it is possible to control the reading and execution of circuits using programming code
rather than through rewiring of physical electronics. Many of our everyday electronic tools, and not
just our computers and smartphones, are built using both physical electronics and programming code.

Indeed, integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, and other components of microcontrollers, micro-
computers, computers, smartphones, and our many other digital technologies, are simply these elec-
trical components integrated into tight containers that are sometimes difficult to see from the outside.

Essential Coding Concepts

There was a long journey for people to move from the mechanical computing done with an abacus to
the electromechanical computing done for the 1900 census to today's general purpose programmable
computers that use transistors to perform calculations.
153 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

Many argue that the first person to create a set of programmed instructions to be used with a mechan-
ical calculating engine so that it could achieve its full potential was Augusta Ada King-Noel, Count-
ess of Lovelace, a mathematician and writer. Ada Lovelace, as she is generally known, worked closely
in the early 1800s with Charles Babbage, who focused on the mechanical general-purpose computer,
the Analytical Engine. Lovelace's papers and presentations were deeply influential within the British
research circles of the day in seeing the full potential of computing machines, today known as com-
puters.

We'll be working with the Raspberry Pi microcomputer, Circuit Playground Express microcontroller,
and electronics purchased from Adafruit, a woman-owned business named in honor of Lady Ada. Our
work with coding is done, also, in honor of this original creator of programmed instructions.

Let's explore how we can create our own programming code to read inputs, control outputs, and per-
form calculations. To do this, rather than working with a general purpose programmable computer
like the Raspberry Pi microcomputer, let's use the limited purpose programmable Circuit Playground
Express microcontroller.

                                                     Microcontrollers are designed to meet specific input/out-
                                                     put specifications. As the purpose of the Circuit Play-
                                                     ground Express microcontroller isn't high performance,
                                                     per se, but rather education, it is a bit more flexible than
                                                     other microcontrollers. To meet various educational speci-
                                                     fications, designers, engineers, and others came together to
                                                     move from prototyping, likely at times using basic elec-
                                                     tronic components, wires, and breadboards, to ultimately
                                                     create a diversity of integrated circuits put together on one
                                                     printed circuit board to result in the Circuit Playground
                                                     Express microcontroller. In shaping this tinker microcon-
                                                     troller, the intent was to provide us with flexibility to use
                                                     the device in ways that can serve a range of open-ended
                                                     learning and design specifications. As we'll learn through-
out this unit, it is a participatory design process that intentionally underdesigns the sociotechnical
artifact to assure greater innovation-in-use by others.

Similar to a diagram showing the LED Sequin Integrated Circuit, this diagram of the Circuit Play-
ground Express doesn't provide specific descriptions of the electronic components actually built into
the printed circuit board, nor how they are brought together with conductive materials. But all the
same, they are miniature versions of the resistors, LEDs, and push buttons, as well as sensors, switches,
speakers and other electronics, just in miniaturized form. They are soldered to a printed circuit board
and connected together using sturdy conductive materials.

So before moving on, take a few minutes to learn about the Circuit Playground Express. The best way
is to visit the the Adafruit Learning Center:

https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express

Especially check out the "Overview," "Guided Tour," and "Pinout" sections to see the otherwise hidden
details of the electronic components put together on this printed circuit board.

Guiding Questions

As you read, keep in mind these social guiding questions:
         · Who shaped the designers and builders of the Circuit Playground Express to create it in
            this way?
         · Was that shaping intentional, accidental, or a little of both?
         · How does Adafruit's goal of teaching electronics and learning to code fit into all of this?
         · As a result of the design and implementation of the Circuit Playground Express, how are
            you being shaped?
         · And how might that shaping ultimately result in the shaping of still other people?

Coding the Circuit Playground Express

We're pretty familiar with our everyday general purpose computers that play an important role in
running a wide range of applications continuously, or at selected times, to accomplish a diverse range
of tasks. To access this book via a web browser, to communicate via email, to talk and text using a
phone, to participate in social media, and so many other activities, you have become rather familiar
with laptop and/or desktop computers, and smartphones, which are microcomputers. (Microcomput-
ers are simply small computers that contain a microprocessor as its central processor.)

The instructions created to control or evaluate electronic components are commonly termed code. As
coded instructions are brought together to control the complex operations of computers and other
machines, they are typically termed programs. These days, doing this work is referred to either as
coding or programming. The specific words, characters, symbols and structuring of code to achieve
the desired works are typically termed a programming language.

As a general rule, microcontrollers are designed to continuously run a single application using a spe-
cific programming language.

The Circuit Playground Express has been designed especially for educational use and so works with
a range of programming languages, including Microsoft's education-friendly MakeCode block coding
   155 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

  language, Adafruit's CircuitPython extension to the Python programming language, and Arduino's
  Arduino integrated development environment (IDE), written using the Java programming language.1

  For the next few sessions, we'll work with MakeCode using Adafruit's website:

  https://makecode.adafruit.com

  It was designed to work specifically with their Circuit Playground Express. It has many similarities
  to Scratch, a programming language developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media
  Lab.2

           · Both use visualized blocks of code which can be combined to create error-free code which
              achieves a certain event.

           · Both are freely accessible to anyone, and creators are encouraged to work collaboratively in
              online communities to share creations.

           · Both are being used by a wide range of explorers, from those in the early grade levels to
              older adults, and all in between.

  A key difference, though, is that Scratch focuses on creation of interactive stories, games, and anima-
  tions visualized using sprites wearing costumes and performing on stage. Adafruit's MakeCode is cre-
  ated online in a Circuit Playground Express prototyping space and tested in a visual simulator before
  code is then downloaded and moved to your physical Circuit Playground Express for live testing.

 Exercise: Introducing MakeCode and Circuit Playground Express

  Adafruit has worked extensively to come up with a range of introductory tutorials, courses, and web
  pages, along with a range of exciting projects for you to use the Circuit Playground Express in your
  everyday lives. Links to these can be found on the MakeCode homepage.

  This next exercise is a remix of different projects and guides found through Adafruit and other sources.
  We'll work to familiarize ourselves with coding concepts while also repeating certain LED and switch
  activities from the Orange Unit.

  But first, let's test the 10 general-use LEDs built into the Circuit Playground Express ring. Take four
  minutes to view the video showing the steps to write the MakeCode Animated Blinky FOREVER func-
  tion, to save this to your laptop Downloads folder, and to flash this to the CPLAYBOOT device after
  connecting the Circuit Playground Express to the USB port on your laptop.

2. Those who are familiar with Python or the Arduino IDE are welcome to create remixes of the following exercises in those

  languages, if desired.
       1B: Essential Coding Concepts 156

Steps

1. In your laptop's web browser, click on "New Project" from the MakeCode homepage.

       When programming in MakeCode, we select blocks from within one of the "Category"
       menus and drag those into the workspace. These are either dropped into an open work-
       space to create a new function, like the default FOREVER control flow statement loop,
       or within an existing function as a statement. All blocks in a category are color coded to
       match the color of that category as seen in the parent window. So we can tell that the
       green FOREVER block came from the green LOOPS category. MakeCode will automati-
       cally begin immediate testing of the code, if possible, in the simulator.
157 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

        2. In the LIGHT category, drag the "show ring" block and drop it into the FOREVER loop.

       By default, all 10 LEDs are set to red, and after a few seconds the LEDs in the simulator should
       also turn red.

        3. From the LOOPS category, drag the "pause" block and drop it below the "show ring" block,
            providing a statement to pause the loop for a set amount of time - by default 100 millisec-
            onds.
                                                                                                               1B: Essential Coding Concepts 158

4. From the LIGHT category, drag the "show animation" block and drop it below the "pause"
    block.

5. Increase the "show animation" time to 2000 milliseconds, that is, to 2 seconds, by clicking
    on the default "500 " setting and choosing 2 seconds.
159 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

        6. Right click on the existing "show animation" block and select "Duplicate" from the provided
            window that pops up.

        7. Drag the second "show animation" block from within the workspace and drop it below the
            first "show animation" block.
                                                                                                                 1B: Essential Coding Concepts 160

 8. Right click again on the first "show animation" block and select "Duplicate" from the pro-
     vided window that pops up. This time it will duplicate its own block, and all blocks below
     it. In this case, that's only the second "show animation" block. Place these below the first
     two.

 9. As of now, the simulator should "show ring," pause for 100 milliseconds, then "show anima-
     tion" default for 4 x 2000 ms, or 8 seconds. Click on one each of the "show animation" block
     animation  visuals and select from the six options provided.

10. This is rapid prototyping, so only take a few moments to create an acceptable testing pro-
     totype through modifications of the six lines of code now within the FOREVER loop, and
     through viewing of the results within the simulator display.
161 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

      11. At the bottom of the MakeCode window, replace the word "Untitled" with "animated-
            Blinky" and click the save icon to the right of the filename.

      12. You now need to flash the code to your Circuit Playground Express. You can review the
            video "Connecting the Circuit Playground Express to Your Laptop," which is a section of
            the previous video to see the specifics on these steps again.
                    a. Connect your personal laptop to the Circuit Playground Express via a USB to
                        micro USB cable.
                                  The lights on the Circuit Playground Express should start flashing dif-
                                    ferent colors if this is the first time you've plugged it in.
                    b. Press the center "reset" push button on the Circuit Playground Express.
                                                                                                                          1B: Essential Coding Concepts 162

                                  You may need to push it longer or shorter to move from flashing LEDs
                                    to a solid green set of LEDs.

                                  This indicates it's ready to be physically reset with new code.
                    c. In your Windows Explorer or Mac Finder window, you should now see the device

                        named "CPLAYBOOT" listed. [Watch the video "Saving and Flashing Code to the
                        Circuit Playground Express" to see a short section of the earlier video demon-
                        strating these last steps.]
                    d. Drag the file circuitplayground-blinky.uf2 from your downloads
                        folder and into the CPLAYBOOT device. This saves the MakeCode you created
                        onto the Circuit Playground Express in away that allows it to be understood and
                        followed by the Circuit Playground Express.

Key Takeaways

         · A block code programming language and Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
            like MakeCode allows you to drag and drop error-free sections of code from the CATE-
            GORY list into a working programming screen.

         · Microcontrollers such as the Circuit Playground Express are typically directed by one
            or more small programming modules or functions with instructions which are continu-
            ously run unless the microcontroller is disconnected from power or otherwise turned off.
                      To achieve this, the MakeCode environment launches a FOREVER block by
                        default when you open a new project. This creates a continuous iteration, a con-
                        trol flow statement used in computer programming to loop back around.

         · We dragged and dropped six blocks that served as individual lines of code to be executed in
163 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

            sequence each time the FOREVER loop was restarted at the top.
         · A live-screen simulator automatically restarts and runs the updated code each time you

            drag and drop a block, letting you test your program in a browser.
         · The Circuit Playground Express is designed by default to allow you to then flash the code

            you created onto it, at which time the physical microcontroller will restart and run the
            code, just like the simulator.

    Choose Your Own Adventure

      A Person-Centered Guide to Demystifying Technology is an introductory textbook using a
      variety of hands-on exercises to evolve a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the
      sociotechnical artifacts we use as a daily part of our professional lives. It seeks to develop
      a critical approach to sociotechnical artifacts and to advance community agency in appro-
      priating technology to achieve our individual and community development goals. As we've
      probed deeper, we've begun to expand our understanding of innovation beyond the package
      inside a box, but to also include the set of practices and remixes that emerge from the social
      setting of its use. We've also explored the hidden and forgotten innovators of technologies,
      including technologies beyond those defined as innovative within male-dominated profes-
      sions and monopolies.

      Working through this space is messy even at the best of times as we work to unpack the
      social and technical bits and their underlying, non-neutral shapers. And so the exercises seek
      to find a means through which a broader Community of Practice collaboration is possible.
      For the Blue Unit, this has been done through the selection of the education-focused Circuit
      Playground Express microcontroller board, and related exercises that explore core program-
      ming concepts through the use of the block-programming language MakeCode.

     Alternative Programming Adventures

      Whether or not you enter into this book with a background in programming, you may want
      to choose an alternative programming adventure to MakeCode to perform these exer-
      cises. Or you may want to do the exercises following the written MakeCode instructions,
      and then do your own innovation-in-use remixes using an alternative programming lan-
      guage. To that end, the Circuit Playground Express is compatible with three major text-
      based programming languages, including:

               · JavaScript: a high-level programming language originally focused on livening up
                  web pages through the use of its plain-text scripts. While its naming includes the
                  term Java, a general-purpose programming language, it is independent from it and
                  includes important features that make it a "safe" programming language that can
                                                                                                                  1B: Essential Coding Concepts 164

            be used with web pages and on web browsers in ways that Java cannot. Of special
            note, the design choices incorporated into JavaScript make it an ideal complement
            to the block-based MakeCode programming language.

                      It's easy to switch between MakeCode and JavaScript with a click of the
                        code selection window options at the top, switching between adventure
                        types. In this way JavaScript might prove an ideal text-based comple-
                        ment to the block-based MakeCode throughout the exercises of the Blue
                        Unit to Do Something New!

         · Python: a popular Open Source Software programming language that has proven
            very helpful within educational contexts as well as within the broader program-
            ming community. Its support of modules and packages means it can easily be
            reused in new projects. And as is the case here, it can be expanded to serve spe-
            cial use contexts, such as with microcontroller boards like the Circuit Playground
            Express. CircuitPython is based on Python and provides the essential hardware
            support needed to work with microcontrollers while including the Python coding
            base.
                      The Circuit Playground Express is CircuitPython-ready, but does not
                        have CircuitPython installed by default. This is because you can only
                        work with one programming language at a time and MakeCode was cho-
                        sen as the perfect introductory pathway. However, it's easy to install
                        CircuitPython. When installed, a new CIRCUITPY drive will appear in
                        addition to CPLAYBOOT. NOTE: be sure to copy your .py program files
                        to CIRCUITPY as that's the only place from which they will run. The
                        Adafruit Explore & Learn site has more to get you started with Circuit-
                        Python on the Circuit Playground Express.

                      To go back to MakeCode, all you need to do is flash your selected Make-
                        Code .uf2 file to CPLAYBOOT. NOTE: in so doing, you are also unin-
                        stalling CircuitPython; that said, you can switch between these regularly
                        and often. Adafruit provides a helpful guide on Moving Circuit Play-
                        ground Express to MakeCode.

         · Arduino: a programming language adding a library of hardare interfaces to the
            C/C++ programming language. The Circuit Playground Express is Arduino-ready
            and you can find out more on this from Adafruit. While Arduino outperforms
            MakeCode/JavaScript and CircuitPython when run on microcontroller boards, it
            can take more time within development uploading/compiling and memory man-
            agement. As such, the other two are recommended for the exercises of the Blue
            Unit.

The adventure is yours for the choosing. While it's important to exercise your choice in
ways that help you reach a sufficient state of "Yet" with regard to the key learning outcome
165 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

      objectives within the unit, it's likely you have as many and more of your own valued beings
      and doings that you are working towards. It is our intent to assure you have choices and the
      means to exercise and achieve these choices in support of those values.

Exercise: Using Momentary Switch Circuits With Conditional Code

                             The animated blinky exercise gave us a chance to test out the MakeCode web
                             browser. It also introduced us to the downloading and flashing of code to our
                             physical Circuit Playground Express.

                             From here, you could further tweak the light display, unplug the Circuit Play-
                             ground Express, connect it to a portable battery source, and voilà! Now you
                             can carry this around after dark as you walk or bike home!! [Watch a video of
                             the finished Circuit Playground Express Animated Blinky display online.]

                             Now let's try using inputs, like the left and right momentary switches of the
                             Circuit Playground Express, to determine the state of the LEDs. So far the
                             sequence of our FOREVER control flow statement loop is run precisely the
                             same over and over with no intentional changes. Using switches to turn on an
off LEDs in our breadboard circuits is an example of conditionals.

Let's work to do the same thing using the Circuit Playground Express LEDs and switches.

For this activity, we'll repeat our Pi-Controlled LEDs activity from the Orange Unit. In that exercise,
one white LED was constantly on. Two more white LEDs only came on when the left switch was
pressed down. The blue LED, on the other hand, was on unless the right switch was pressed down.
Let's use MakeCode to do something similar on the Circuit Playground Express. This is an example of
taking the insights gained from the many prototypes done with a breadboard and electromechanical
components, and using them to extend our prototyping at a higher level of abstraction using a micro-
controller.

One of the most common conditional statements is the "If...Then" statement, also referred to as an
"If...Then...Else" statement. In our case, we'll use this statement such that if the button A is pressed
then turn a white LED on, else turn/leave it off. On the other hand, if button B is pressed, then turn a
blue LED off, else turn/leave it on.

An important first step in coding is to initialize items before moving on to the regular work of the
code. In MakeCode, this is done with the "ON START" initialization control flow statement block. Any
lines of code in this block are done in the order listed, and are done only once when power is first pro-
vided to the Circuit Playground Express. Hence the term initialization. We'll use this to set a brightness
for the LEDs and turn on and leave on another white LED as we've done in the Orange Unit exercises.
                    1B: Essential Coding Concepts 166

Let's get started.

Steps

        1. On the MakeCode homepage, click to start a new project.
        2. From the LOGIC category, drag an "If...Then...Else" block and drop it into the FOREVER

            loop.
        3. From the INPUT category, drag a "button A is pressed" block and drop it within the <true

            > window, like so:

Notice in the image that the <true > and <button A  is pressed> windows both have a yellow
border around them. This indicates that, if you release the mouse or touchpad button now, the
upper Button A window will be dropped in the the lower True window. It'll take a little practice
to get good at this, and I still find I sometimes drop one window into the wrong lower window.
Fortunately, by dragging and dropping, it can be moved to the intended window from wherever
it was accidentally placed.

4. Time for a design choice. Which button will work with the normally off white LED, and
    which the normally on blue LED? For now, let's go with button A = white LED off unless
    pressed.

5. From the LIGHT category, within the More section, drag the "set pixel color at" block and
    drop it into the then section.

6. Change the at subwindow to 4, and change the color from red to white.
7. In the simulator, press the "A" button on the left. Notice the LED below the musical note

    symbol turns white and stays so.

              Could it be that the location of the buttons in the simulator looks similar to the
                location of the buttons on the breadboard sitting next to my computer worksta-
                tion? Design influences come from many physical as well as social and mental
                influences!
167 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

        8. The "else" part of an "If...Then...Else" logic statement is just the place we need next so
            that we can turn/leave the white LED off if the "button A is pressed" condition above is
            NOT true.
                      Take another "set pixel color at" block and drop it into the else section, changing
                        the at to 4, and the color to black.NOTE: You can do this either by duplicating the
                        "set pixel color at" block from the then section and then dragging the duplicate
                        into the else section, or you can enter into the INPUT category and drag a new
                        "set pixel color at" block from there to drop into the else section.Our white LED is
                        now off on the simulator unless we press button A!

        9. Right click in the area of the "then" statement text, and choose duplicate from the pop-up
            window.

      10. Drag the duplicate "If...Then...Else" logic block and drop it below the + symbol at the bot-
            tom of the current "If...Then...Else" statement block.
                                                                                                          1B: Essential Coding Concepts 168

                                    Second "If...Then...Else" logic block properly
                                    placed below first "If...Then...Else" logic block.

                                   Second "If...Then...Else" logic block incorrectly
                                   placed within "Else" of first "If...Then...Else" logic
                                   block.

It is important to drop this into the right location. In the images above, dropping it below
the current "If...Then...Else" statement block specifies that, during each pass through the
sequence of statements within the FOREVER loop, we will first do the top "If...Then...Else"
conditional logic block, then the second "If...Then...Else" conditional logic block.The image
on the right, crossed out in red, demonstrates how we could have otherwise done a single
169 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

            "If...Then...Else" conditional logic block, and one if it is NOT true. We would turn/leave the
            white LED #4 off and then check the conditional as stated in the "If...Then...Else" subrou-
            tine within the else statement. More on this later.
      11. In the second "If...Then...Else" conditional logic block, change button A to button B and the
            at statement from 4 to 5.
      12. To reverse the conditions determining when the LED turned on, in the second
            "If...Then...Else" conditional logic block, change the white color of the pixel within the
            "then" section to black. Change the black color of the pixel within the "else" section to blue.

      13. Experience has shown these LEDs - especially the white LEDs - can be very bright, some-
            times alarmingly so for those with certain visual functional diversities. Before flashing this
            over to the physical Circuit Playground Express, let's add in an "ON START" initialization
            block to determine the brightness of the LEDs, and to also turn on one of the white LEDs as
            a working symbol, as we've used in the Orange Unit prototypes.
                    a. From the LOOPS category, drag an "on start" initialization block and drop it into
                        an open area of the workspace.
                    b. From the LIGHT category, drag a "set brightness" block and drop it into the ON
                        START initialization block.
                    c. From the LIGHT category, drag a "set pixel color at" block and drop it into the On
                        START initialization block underneath the "set brightness" block.
                    d. To finish, change the brightness from 20 to 5, and the set pixel color at 0 from red
                        to white.
                                                                                                                          1B: Essential Coding Concepts 170

      14. Do further testing in the simulator until you think it is working as it should.
      15. In MakeCode, change the file name from "Untitled" to "pushButton," click on the save icon,

            and Download.
      16. On the physical Circuit Playground Express, push down the "reset" button, and drag the

            new circuitplayground-pushButton.uf2 file to the CPLAYBOOT device.
      17. Do initial testing on the physical device, confirming it is working as it should, or identify-

            ing fixes needed within the code. This can include adjustments in the overall design, not
            just in the code as created through the above steps.
      18. Make any changes as identified on the physical device within MakeCode, test further in the
            simulator, save a new copy and flash it to the physical Circuit Playground Express, and do
            additional testing there. Repeat this process until it works well for you, for your co-explor-
            ers, and perhaps even for your intended audience!

Key Takeaways

In this exercise, we extended our electronics prototyping skillset using the Circuit Playground Express
microcontroller.

         · We coded within the FOREVER function loop, extending the number of statements, or
            lines of code, that occur within each sequence through this loop.

         · We studied the "If...Then...Else" conditional control flow statement, which uses a logic
            question such as "If button A is pressed," and provides a platform to then indicate that
            action when true. In our case, that meant turning on a white LED. The "Else" section lets us
            specify what to do if the question is false. In our case, that meant turning off, or leaving off,
            that same white LED.

         · We found how it is often important to initialize items, for instance, by setting the bright-
            ness to a certain chosen level before those LEDs are turned on.

         · We worked in multiple layers of abstraction, while balancing our prior and current
            knowledge and skills and our considerations regarding investment of time and capital to
171 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

            move through this activity.
                      There's quite a bit of electronics now "under the hood," and much of the engineer-
                        ing specifics are no longer known by us, although as used it performs much the
                        same as did our later breadboard prototyping in the Orange Unit.
                      How our blocks turn into text before being compiled and turned into machine-
                        readable code is now hidden from us, but this trade-off gives us a relatively easy
                        way to dip our toes into coding.
                      The programming code that takes our FOREVER function loop and ON START
                        initialization control flow statement and uses them to change to state of the elec-
                        tronics as instructed is also largely underneath the hood and unknown to us. In
                        its design, though, is a pathway for us to do some extensive innovation-in-use of
                        the software and associated electronics to meet our own chosen valued design
                        choices.
                      Abstractions, when designed and implemented well, provide us with new oppor-
                        tunities to go places we had otherwise only dreamed. But, there's always a risk
                        that underneath those hoods are choices that ultimately may take us places we
                        consider problematic or don't value. No matter the stage of design and implemen-
                        tation we find ourselves at, it is valuable to pause regularly throughout and reflect
                        on the seen, the unseen, and the unforeseen in these sociotechnical artifacts.

Exercise: Testing Out Innovation-in-Use to Build a Five Digit Counter

Our Circuit Playground Express now performs as a tool fairly similar to the one we prototyped on our
breadboard previously. But with the Circuit Playground Express, we have more LEDs available. This
might be a good way to further expand our budding design, prototyping, and coding skills.

With five LEDs in the area of button A, what if we used them as a five digit counter?

Through trial and error, I found that the programming code behind MakeCode preset the 10 LEDs with
numbers 0 to 9, in which LED 0 is nearest the green "On" LED of the Circuit Playground Express, and
LED 9 is just below D13 and just above the A9 thermometer symbol of the Circuit Playground Express.

This brings to mind that there are five digits on the same half of the Circuit Playground Express as
button A, numbered 0 to 4. There are five additional digits on the other half of the Circuit Playground
Express, those numbered 5 to 9, on the same side as button B.

This design matches well the normative design of the human body with two hands (analogous to two
buttons) with five fingers on each (analogous to five LEDs in proximity to each of the two buttons).
This prompted new ideas for using the Circuit Playground Express to further advance our coding logic
flows.
                                                                                                                          1B: Essential Coding Concepts 172

For this exercise, let's equate one push of each button with raising the fingers within that analogical
hand. Once all five LED digits are raised within a hand, one with each new press of the associated
button, the next press of the button will turn off all five of its LEDs.

Knowledge Probe

First, let's think through the logic of this new design a bit more, starting with the five LEDs of button
A, LED pixels 0 to 4.

         · In the last activity, for each pass through the FOREVER sequence:
                      If button A is pressed down, pixel at 4 is set to color white, whether it was already
                        set that way or not.
                      If button A is not pressed down, pixel at 4 is set to color black, whether it was
                        already set that way or not.

         · This is an example of combinational logic. In combinational logic, the result depends only
            on the current states of the inputs. What we do in each sequence is determined just based
            on the current state of the system. It is not based on any past states of the system. Some-
            times combinational logic is the absolute best choice, like what I do if I see a squirrel trying
            to eat fruit from my garden. It doesn't matter whether this is the first time or the 50th time.
            Combining species (squirrel), location (garden), conditions (fruits ripe or nearly so), and
            knowledge (squirrels eat this type of fruit), I'll chase it away. This is combinational logic.
            Sometimes combinational logic is the choice we go with just because it's at hand. I'll just
            keep chasing off the squirrel from the fruit tree because it's right next to my easy chair
            where I'm reading a book. But other times, we may use past logic to influence future logic.
            Perhaps squirrels haven't been here before, so chasing it off five times might make good
            sense. But on the sixth attempt to invade our fruit tree, we might logically consider it's time
            to do something more drastic than just chasing it off. Then there are times when combina-
            tional logic just doesn't make sense. Consider the ceiling lights in a kitchen. What if combi-
            national logic was only available to turn them on? Combining intent (cooking dinner),
            conditions (after dark), and knowledge (I've previously used my vision to select and use
            ingredients) suggests we turn on the light. If this meant we needed to walk over and push
            and hold down a button to keep the light on, this combinational logic would keep us from
            doing the rest of the activities.

         · In this activity, we not only want the press of the button to turn on an LED; we want it to
            move down the line, lighting a sequence of up to five LEDs. What action using Button A
            could change the pixel number being lit next?

                    a. Each new pass through the FOREVER sequence while button A is pressed, move
                        to the next pixel?
173 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

                    b. Every 100 passes through the FOREVER sequence while button A is pressed,
                        move to the next pixel?

                    c. At initial change of button A from not pressed to pressed, move to the next pixel?
                    d. Something yet different from that?

         · Back when I used to use a click counter to keep track of an event, a clicker either: 1) started
            a counter that ran until I did a second click, which matches well a and b above, or 2) it
            increased the count by one every time I hit that clicker, which matches well with option c
            above. For now, let's go with option c, then.

Steps

        1. Start a new project in MakeCode.
        2. From the LOOPS category, drag over an "on start" initialization block, and drop it some-

            where in the workspace.
        3. From the LIGHT category, drag over a "set brightness" to the ON START initialization

            block and set it to 5 (or your chosen value) to keep the LEDs from being too bright.
        4. For this exercise, we'll need some variables to keep check on specific things. We'll start by

            creating these variables within the VARIABLES category. Create each by clicking on "Make
            a Variable":

                      Name one "aCount". We'll use this to determine how many times the button has
                        been pressed recently.

                      Name one "buttonALast". We'll use this to remember if it was pressed down dur-
                        ing the last sequence with the number 1, or if it was not pressed down during the
                        last sequence with the number 0.

                      Using variables to remember recent past states and to determine current events is
                        the basis for sequential logic. What to do at this point in a sequence is deter-
                        mined not just on current state, but also on past states.

        5. From the VARIABLES category, drag a "set _____ to 0" to the ON START initialization
            block. This will be labeled the same as the last variable created.
                      Copy two of these over to the ON START initialization block.
                      Use the  label to drop down options, and set one to aCount and the other to but-
                        tonALast.
                      Leave each set to 0 within the ON START initialization block.
                                                                                                                 1B: Essential Coding Concepts 174

 6. As in the last exercise, from the LOGIC category, drag over an "If...Then...Else" block and
     drop it into the FOREVER function.

 7. As before, from the INPUT category, drag over a "button A is pressed" block and drop it
     into the <True > window.

 8. This time, rather than turning a specific pixel white or blue, we'll instead use a new
     "If...Then" block (no "...Else" needed here) within the "Then" section. We'll use this to deter-
     mine whether this is a new press of the button, or an ongoing press of that button.

 9. From the LOGIC category, from within the Comparison section, drag over a <0 = 0> block
     and use it to replace the <True > of this second "If...Then" logic statement.

10. From the VARIABLES category, drag a "buttonALast" variable block and replace the left "0"
     of the comparison we just added. Leave the other "0" as is.
               This "If...Then" conditional is now checking to see if button A was NOT pressed
                 previously as a first step within the "If...Then" conditional in which "button A is
                 pressed" was True.
               To complete the sequential conditional logic being setup with the buttonALast
                 variable, we need to:
                           Drag the "set _____ to 0" variable block within the VARIABLES cate-
                             gory and drop it into the else section of the parent "If button A is
                             pressed" logic statement. Update it to read "set buttonALast to 0," as this
                             "else" section is reached only when button A is NOT pressed. We want
                             to remember that in the past iteration of this FOREVER function
                             sequence, button A was NOT pressed.
                           Drag a second "set _____ to 0" variable block within the VARIABLES
                             category and drop it into the "Then" section of the "If buttonALast = 0"
                             logic statement. Update it to read "set buttonALast to 1" as this "Then"
                             section is reached when button A is first pressed, and we want to
                             remember it is already pressed moving forward into future iterations of
                             this FOREVER function.
175 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

                        Looking at our code, we see that within the FOREVER loop, we now have a parent
                        "If...Then...Else" block that uses a "button A is pressed" block conditional as its
                        starting point.
                      If "False," that is, button A is NOT pressed, we move to the "Else" section and set
                        the buttonALast Variable to 0, or False.
                      If "True," that is, button A IS pressed, we move to the "Then" section. But rather
                        than immediately taking an action, this time we first do another logic check, this
                        time, whether button A was NOT pressed last time using an "If buttonALast = 0"
                        condition. That's because we already know we set the variable buttonALast to 0
                        whenever the "button A is pressed" condition is "False."
                      Now, only when "button A is pressed" is "True" AND "buttonALast = 0" do we
                        change the block Variable to "set buttonALast to 1."
      11. Within the "If buttonALast = 0 Then" statement, add a "set pixel color at" block from the
            LIGHT category.
                    a. From the VARIABLES category, drag over an "aCount" block and drop it into the
                        0 window of the new "set pixel color at" block, so that it now reads "set pixel
                        color at aCount."
                    b. Change the red window to white.
      12. From the VARIABLES category, drag a "change _____ by 1" block and drop it under the "set
            pixel color at" block. Use the  key to set this block up to read "change aCount by 1."
               If you press button A in the simulator now, what happens?
                                                                                                                 1B: Essential Coding Concepts 176

        Here, we see that after 8 individual presses of button A in the simulator, eight pixels have
        been turned to white.
13. To add a conditional limiting the number of pixels turned to white using button A, we need
     yet a third embedded "If...Then" logic statement, this one as with the the top parent includ-
     ing an "...Else."

               From the LOGIC category, drag over an "If...Then...Else" block and drop it under
                 the "set buttonALast to 1" block within the "if buttonALast = 0 Then" statement.

14. Drag the blocks "set pixel color at aCount to white" and "change aCount by 1" into the
     "Else" section of this new "If...Then...Else" statement. It should look as follows:
177 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

      15. From the "Comparison" section of the LOGIC category, drag over a "<0 = 0>" block and
            replace the "true" window of the new "If...Then" statement.
                    a. From the VARIABLES category, drag an "aCount" block and drop it in the left 0
                        window.
                    b. Change the "= " window to ">".
                    c. Change the right 0 to 4.
                    d. Now, "If aCount is greater than 4, Then" we can turn all of the white pixels on the
                        button A side to black. Else, we'll turn the next aCount to white.

      16. To turn the five button A pixels from white to black, we're going to use a new control flow
            statement called the FOR loop.

                      From the LOOPS category, drag a "for index from 0 to 4" block and drop it within
                        the "If aCount > 4 Then" statement.

      17. From the VARIABLES category, drag an "aCount" block and drop it where the "index" block
            is now located within the new FOR loop.

      18. From the LIGHT category, drag a "set pixel color at" block and drop it inside the FOR loop.
                    a. From the VARIABLES block, drag a "aCount" and drop it into the new "set pixel
                        color at" block, replacing the 0.
                    b. Change the red window to black in this "set pixel color at" block.
                    c. This FOR loop resets the aCount back to 0, goes through the "Do" section, then
                        increases the aCount by 1 and repeats the "Do" section, continuing until it
                        reaches the maximum number. In our case, this means it will go through aCount
                        from 0 to 4, turning the pixels black.

      19. Finally, add in a "set _____ to 0" from the VARIABLES category and drop it underneath the
            new FOR loop, using the  to set this to a "set aCount to 0" block.

20. Use the simulator to test this prototype. Every sixth press of button A should now reset our
     counter to zero pixels lit. If this is Not Yet the case, Fail Forward using the troubleshoot-
     ing process to reach Yet.
179 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

      21. Once all looks good in the simulator, save this code as pushButtonCounter, flash it to the
            physical Circuit Playground Express, and give it a field test.

Ta-da!!! Now, let's create a Button B counter in blue to stay with the theme of that button.

Button B Counter Design Probe

We have more design decisions to make. We can either do the new "If button B is pressed Then" logic
control flow statement in sequence with the "If button A is pressed Then" logic control flow state-
ment within the same FOREVER function, or we can place it in a new FOREVER function.

Should one follow the other, or should each run independent of the other?

We also need to decide the order in which button B lights the pixels.

Should it flow from top to bottom on the right, just as it does for button A on the left? This means we
need to start with pixel 9 and move down to pixel 5 in order. Or should we go in pixel order from pixel
5 to pixel 9?

For this exercise, we will conduct these tests independent of each other, starting from the top of the
pixels as seen in the simulator. How might this be shaping your learning? How might this shape your
use of this microcontroller push button counter moving forward?

Steps

Rather than taking the time to go through the copying/pasting and remixing of the first "button A"
FOREVER function to create a second "button B" FOREVER function step by step, let's commit the
time to noticing the key changes needed to have this fit within the design profile listed above.

        1. In your laptop web browser, download this UF2 code:
                      circuitplayground-twoPushButtonCounters.uf2
                      If it does not do so automatically, select to download this file.

        2. Flash the downloaded circuitplayground-twoPushButtonCounters.uf2 file
            to the physical Circuit Playground Express and perform some initial testing of this proto-
            type.
                      Does it fit the design profile as stated above?
                      Does it work well for you and your valued doings?
                                                                                                                          1B: Essential Coding Concepts 180

        3. Go to the MakeCode homepage and drag the downloaded file circuitplayground-
            twoPushButtonCounters.uf2 onto the MakeCode screen. Take a minute to test this
            prototype in the simulator. How does it compare to the physical testing process?

        4. Both FOREVER functions have 19 "lines of text," so to speak, within the blocks.
                      How many are the same? Why?
                      How many are different? How might they have changed?

Side Note on the For Loops

Within the Button A FOREVER function, the FOR loop is written as:

for aCount from 0 to 4, set pixel color at aCount to black

In this "For" control flow statement, aCount starts at 0 and the pixel at 0 is set to black. aCount is
increased by one, and if it's still less than or equal to 4, that pixel is set to black. In this way, it sets
pixels 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to black.

Within the Button B FOREVER function, the FOR loop is written as:

for element bCount of bList, set pixel color at bCount to black

Since Button B does not work with pixels 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, but instead works with pixels 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9,
this basic "For" control flow statement wouldn't work. So in the ON START initialization control flow
statement, a new bList array was created, with the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 put into that list array. In
this "For" control flow statement, every bCount of bList is used to do a "set pixel at" action.

An aList could have been created with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 within this array, replacing the "for aCount from
0 to 4, do" statement with "for element aCount of aList, do" statement. In setting up the button A FOR-
EVER function, you stepped through the simpler version as MakeCode wrote the block code with this
simpler FOR loop block. But both forms of the FOR loop function the same, and using the list arrays
would give greater flexibility moving forward. This demonstrates how there are often multiple ways
to execute code, some of which depend as much on programming preference as on performance.
181 1B: Essential Coding Concepts

Key Takeaways

Sequential logic is used when past conditions (such as the previous state of a switch or the last LED
that was lit) should impact what is to be done in the current sequence of a control flow statement. In
our case, this was used to determine actions to be done or not be done within a sequence of "If...Then"
control flow statements.
Multiple embedded "If...Then" and/or "If...Then...Else" control flow statements can be used to move
from more general True/False, Yes/No logic questions to more specific logic questions.
Variables are data items whose values can be changed. In this case, the variables aCount and bCount
were used to determine which of five pixels associated with button A and button B, respectively,
should be lit. The variables buttonALast and buttonBLast were used to only change the condition of an
LED pixel when the button's state is first changed.
Arrays provided a list specific to button B that was used to give greater flexibility regarding which
LED pixels should be turned on or off. This is an example of how, often in computing, an indexed set of
related elements can prove extraordinarily useful to expand the possibilities regarding data sets held
within variables.
Choices shape our pathways forward. Sometimes the way forward is to use written guides and
hints, or even to download and use already written code. While useful, it can make it more difficult to
know what has shaped these resources as compared to those times when you participate in a commu-
nity of practice to design and prototype something. Even then, it is almost always the case that you
                                                                                                                          1B: Essential Coding Concepts 182

are working at a relatively high level of abstraction, in which case there are still hidden choices under-
neath the hood.

As an example of this last takeaway, you may find it helpful to glance at the JavaScript text to which
the blocks are converted in the MakeCode twoPushButtonCounters code. The "for aCount from 0 to
4, do" as used in the button A forever function could have been changed to "for bCount from 5 to 9,
do" in the button B forever function. But a MakeCode block for this type of for loop was not created,
and so could only be done by making this change to the code in JavaScript, potentially a more difficult
process for those shifting from block to JavaScript programming languages.

Wrap Up

To build further on the key takeaways from the above three exercises, take 11 minutes to watch the
video on "Programming Basics: Statements & Functions" from Carrie Anne Philbin's Crash Course
Computer Science series hosted by PBS Digital Studios:

Coders shape how things work even as they are shaped by how past coders shaped the code. We
started with the blinky code. But behind that code was more complex code, hidden from view.

         · Who set up the blocks we used to work the way they did?
         · How did it work well for us? How could it have worked better?
         · Did we always understand how one block worked compared to another? Why or why not?

By the end, you followed instructions to create your own functions with loops and variables. Each
function included other, hidden functions and variables incorporated into sequences of code operating
sometimes under only certain conditions.

There's a trend to more strongly shape programs and the distributed apps based on those programs.
In doing so, control is taken away from us. In this chapter, we've worked to discover how we can get
control, but only if the Integrated Development Environments like MakeCode and programmable elec-
tronic systems like the Circuit Playground Express have been designed and implemented in ways that
facilitate innovation-in-use by those at every level of the social technical artifact.

Comprehension Check

[The following is an interactive element from the online edition that has been remediated into a dif-
ferent form for the PDF. An online version of this comprehension check is also available.]

We've spent time learning how to write basic programming code to create control flow statements
such as FOREVER and FOR loops, ON START initialization, and "If...Then" conditional statements.
We've used variables and arrays to facilitate use of data within the code to facilitate coding through
abstraction. And we've used FOREVER and ON START functions to break down code into distinct
units.

Let's check our learning of these core coding concepts by bringing the following blocks together to
create a new ON SHAKE function that plays a short siren and blinks between two different LED pixels
rings before turning all LED pixels off. This should be added to the Button A and Button B Five Digit
Counters.

The design criteria includes:
         · Play the siren sound on shake.
         · The ring of LED pixels should change between two different LED colors four times.
         · At the end, all sound and all LED pixels should be turned off.
         · This sequence of events should only happen when the slide switch is moved to the right. If
            the slide switch is moved to the left, no siren or LED pixel rings will occur.
         · Regardless of the state of the slide switch, the five digit counters should continue to work
            whenever the Circuit Playground Express is not being shaken.

Each of the following should be used within the ON SHAKE function:

Background Knowledge Probe

Reflect back on a way that you've taken something you have and used it in a way it wasn't meant to
be used, in order to get something done that you couldn't do otherwise. Then, consider the landscape
of methods you used to accomplish this innovation-in-use.

         · What are some ways you've used this and other methods and practices over time in similar
            contexts? How they have evolved over time? What are some ways these methods and prac-
            tices may have originated as a part of your everyday or occasional praxis?

         · How might these methods and practices have shaped your work so far through this book,
            both positively and negatively?

         · What are some ways these methods and practices may be further developing as you work
            through this book?

Tinkering as Research

My work as a tinker began very early as my family encouraged me to tear apart any and all no-longer-
used tools around me. Of course, while the goal was to discover what was inside and to make them
work again, those earliest days were almost always "Not Yet" fail forward moments. At around 5, I was
offered the opportunity to earn 50 cents an hour to help with basic sweeping, cleaning, and moving
of sawdust and wood in the family sawmill. I didn't know it at the time, but it was my first appren-
ticeship role. It seemed boring, but what was really happening was a first discovery of the music and
performance of the sawmill as sociotechnical system. It is a combination of senses, knowledge, culture,
community, and technology artifacts working in concert. As with most, if not all, such lived experi-
ences and practices in our lives, it was not something that could be learned through a banking con-
cept of education. Rather, it could only be done through community inquiry as part of a community
of practice, which itself is rooted within the apprenticeship model of learning in which students study
with master craftspeople.

                                                                                 185

I am first generation American, first generation English-as-first-language speaker, and first generation
college graduate, let alone PhD. And yet, as I advanced through university and worked professionally
the last two and a half decades within the university, I have found some aspects of the methodological
landscape to be something I knew of, and practiced in part, even during my early years of work in that
family community. While different perspectives may be incorporated, and while they may use differ-
ent terms and practices, the research process is incorporated into many different disciplines beyond
the academic realm. Still, it is in the academic disciplines that special emphasis has been given to iden-
tifying and practicing the perspectives and assumptions underlying our research paradigms. It has
proven an extraordinarily valuable resource in addition to my apprenticeship learning, opening up
new avenues for exploration, advancement, fine-tuning, and new discoveries of practice and knowl-
edge.

Key Takeaways: Purposes of Research Paradigms

Positivist Paradigms

           · Behind all of our electronics and programming code, and much of traditional scientific
              research, stands deductive reasoning, also known as deductive logic. The goal in this
              paradigm is to produce and continuously adapt predictable, reliable, anticipatable, and
              controllable events and processes.

                          Boolean logic brings together one or more propositions into simple Yes/
                            No, True/False, or 1/0 statements.

                          Boolean logic moves from more general to very specific in a top-down logic,
                            in which a conclusion is reached deductively, narrowing the range under
                            consideration until only the conclusion is left.

                          The ordering of our Boolean logic tests matters!

Interpretive Paradigms

           · Within a sociotechnical framing of technologies, the continuous changes of our tech-
              nological tools are events and processes of contingency, which are not fully predictable.
              Case study analysis and situated evaluation use inductive reasoning to develop inter-
              pretive understandings of complex social phenomena.
                                                                                                                  2A: The Methodological Landscape 188

                          While inductive reasoning and interpretive paradigms generally do not
                            serve in the building of the physical technical system, they are essential
                            to meta-design, in which users become co-designers during the formal
                            design process, and throughout ongoing use of a product.

                          Evaluation of "it" moves from the product generally, or even the idealization
                            of that product in design thinking terms, to the innovation-in-use, a situ-
                            ation-specific use of the product by individuals and cohorts.

Critical Paradigms

           · Within a critical sociotechnical framing of technologies, deductive reasoning in support
              of the physical construction of a product and inductive reasoning in support of meta-
              design and innovation-in-use are both essential, but not sufficient. It is necessary to
              also incorporate moral and ethical questioning to unmask and expose hidden forms of
              oppression, false beliefs, and commonly held myths. To do so, abductive reasoning
              is also used, bringing together the best resources at hand to attempt creative leaps in
              understanding.

                          Critical research requires work in community, with community, and for
                            community using methods such as participatory action research and partic-
                            ipant observation to apply a dialectic approach to knowledge.

                          As the intersectionality of individuals brings together oppressed and
                            oppressors in cycles of action-reflection, the resulting new understanding
                            of reality serves to bring forward new starting points for deductive, induc-
                            tive, and abductive reasoning in support of meta-design and innovation-in-
                            use of sociotechnical artifacts.

                          Knowledge is not static or individualistic. At its best, culturally respon-
                            sive, sustaining pedagogy using a critical sociotechnical lens works to
                            foster and incorporate a dynamic, synergistic relationship between the cul-
                            tures of home, community, schools/universities, library/museum spaces,
                            for-profit/not-for-profit institutions, and many other co-exploration spaces.

The Meta-Theoretical Landscape in Practice

Since its release in 2015, Robin Wall-Kimmerer's Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific
Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants has been an ongoing source for expanding my own meta-theo-
retical landscape. As I recommend this book to new generations of readers and listeners, their response
is universally the same. In the context of this text, her chapters "Asters and Goldenrod" and "Learning
the Grammar of Animacy" especially highlight ways in which Indigenous wisdom, scientific knowl-
edge, and the teachings of the more-than-human persons around us complement each other. Together,
this diversity of knowledge and experience enriches and greatly expands our reading of the world, and
of the word as part of action and critical reflection praxis.

"Asters and Goldenrod" brings forward the ways in which our cultural knowledge and wealth is taken
away from us, to be replaced by dominant paradigms and ways of being and doing. We lose a core
part of who we are and what we can be in order to be that which we are told to be. It is a process of
removing parts of our humanity and pushing us to be a disposable thing.
                                                                                                                        2A: The Methodological Landscape 190

  "Learning the Grammar of Animacy" highlights how the subjects around us--the living persons typi-
  cally beyond that which we can conceive to exist--can and need to serve as wise elders. Listening to
  them can lead to creative leaps of understanding. And so it was for Kimmerer, as she discovered that
  the walls keeping her from learning her cultural language, Potawatomi, were ones of language, and
  specifically the English language. In Potawatomi, seventy percent of the words are verbs, indicating
  the animacy of those around us. Plants and streams alike are animate, thinking, feeling entities. This
  compares to English, which is primarily noun-based, and which objectifies much around us, turning it
  into a thing.

  For us to "rapidly shift from a `thing-oriented' society to a `person-oriented' society," as we are called
  to do by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his 1967 "Beyond Vietnam" speech, we need something
  beyond what our existing language and landscapes can often provide. It does not mean we must put
  aside who we are, how we live, what we value, and so much more. But it does mean we need to enter
  into new communities of practice, ones that help us address the shortcomings in our own meta-the-
  oretical landscapes, even as we bring forward our own expertise and knowledge that has built from
  these landscapes. Often, it is not an "either-or" work, but a "both-and" proposition that truly helps us
  reach ever greater individual and collective fulfillment. Lastly, it's essential that this is done in ways
  that push for greater justice for all, and especially for those most pushed to the margins and those who
  are oppressed.

  To finish this chapter, let's explore one further example of the meta-theoretical landscape in practice
  today, as helpfully summarized in René Ostberg Encyclopedia Britannica page on "transhumanism."2
  Since being introduced by Julian Huxley in his 1957 essay "Transhumanism," there has been a growing
  number of organizations, schools, and business entrepreneurs exploring ways in which scientific
  advances can facilitate the extension of human life and overcome human limitations through enhanced
  human cognition and augmented capabilities. Institutes, associations, and individuals have worked to
  develop statements, books, and voices building on the vision, core concepts, and principles as different
  branches of thought have emerged within transhumanism. A landmark example can be found in Ray
  Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines (1999), in which the distinctions between man and machine
  are blurred as computers develop operational capabilities equivalent to those of the human brain. Sil-
  icon Valley venture capitalists such as Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk have gone on to launch
  a range of research and development companies dedicated to various aspects of transhumanism-cen-
  tered technology development and diffusion, through a range of biotechnologies, brain chips, animal
  cloning, exoskeletons, and even space travel and colonization.

  While there are many ways in which we can move from an "either-or" to a "both-and" proposition,
  there are also those times when we need to explore the deeper logic and ethics underlying scientific
  explanation, and the central claims about values and normative reasoning which together shape
  research and development. Data mining, analytics, visualization, and curation can be done in many

different ways using various forms of logic and ethical assumptions. Information in the form of data
goes on to underpin vast initiatives that shape information access, management, and use, which fur-
ther shapes analysis, design, maintenance, and evolution of information infrastructures. As we move
further along the data, information, knowledge, wisdom pyramid, the logic and ethics underlying sci-
entific explanation and their central claims about values and normative reasoning further shape the
creation of knowledge. They do this either in ways that allow a few to exercise power over the many,
or in ways that allow the advancement of power within each and between all as part of active works
of social justice. In his 2004 Foreign Policy "Transhumanism" article, Francis Fukuyama asks a cou-
ple of provocative questions: "If we start transforming ourselves into something superior, what rights
will these enhanced creatures claim, and what rights will they possess when compared to those left
behind? If some move ahead, can anyone afford not to follow?" He goes on to note, "Transhumanism's
advocates think they understand what constitutes a good human being, and they are happy to leave
behind the limited, mortal, natural beings they see around them in favor of something better. But do
they really comprehend ultimate human goods?"

In WNYC Studio's On the Media "Salvation Through Technology" from January 18, 2023, Brooke Glad-
stone brings back a 2021 segment in which she interviewed Meghan O'Gieblyn, author of God, Human,
Animal, Machine: Technology, Metaphor, and the Search for Meaning, taking us through her journey
from her fundamentalist Evangelical church roots and Bible college training to her extensive read-
ing about technology. It led her to an obsession with transhumanism in which most identify as athe-
ists with a worldview based on materialism. Over time, O'Gieblyn began to see in transhumanism a
theoretically plausible offering which included "basically everything that a religious worldview had
once offered me, but it was doing so through science and technology." Bringing these two parts of
her history together has helped her explore ways in which science and technology often recapitulate
old spiritual narratives in ideas such as transhumanism, exposing the shared assumptions of Christian
creationists and transhumanist tech leaders. But this isn't limited just to the transhumanist space, as
more generally, the growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence is "almost like we're making the physical
material world conscious, again, much like this old animus cosmology where we believe that spirits
lived in rocks and trees and that the world was alive and that we could have social relationships with
physical objects."

This shared assumption of Christian creationists and transhumanist tech leaders is distinct from Kim-
merer's call for us to bring into consideration a grammar of animacy as a complement to our Western
scientific explorations. It takes time and effort to unpack the ontology, epistemology, ethics, and claims
about values and normative reasoning concerning what "ought" to be that also inform the research
paradigms informing our works; these shape the deductive, inductive, and abductive logic within the
various scientific explanations and their applications within our ongoing professional research and
development activities. As we develop programming code to address important issues of the day, are
we doing so in a person-oriented way, or in ways that seek to make the technology become person?
                                                                                                                     2A: The Methodological Landscape 192

As critical researchers, we need to explicitly declare and reflect on our value position(s) and provide
arguments for our normative reasoning. This can only be done through conversation with those differ-
ent from us as part of both action and reflection phases of our person-centered community inquiry. In
so doing, we move from an exclusive focus on the question of inquiry within the moment, to also open
opportunities to unpack further the unseen and unforeseen normative reasoning which is shaping our
actions and our reflections on those actions.

Lesson Plan

By demystifying these methodologies and introducing new ideas, we seek to further advance our abil-
ity to consider and tell counterstories.

In the technical session, we will see how the positivist paradigm of research is fundamental to both
electronics and modern programming.

This session helps us better explore the meta-theoretical assumptions and research paradigms that
shape our sociotechnical environment and the social and technical products that arise from our hands-
on activities that put these assumptions and paradigms into practice. What within your Professional
Journal Reflections from last session has helped you move into this session? What has proved prob-
lematic, requiring further codification and decodification in dialogue with others so as to more closely
align to the valued beings and doings of all?

Professional Journal Reflections:

        1. Take a few minutes to review your Professional Journal Reflection(s) from last session.
            Reflect on ways this is a new reading of these reflective words and worlds one session later.
            How have these reflections shaped you? How have you shaped your reading of the world
            and word within these reflections?

        2. In what ways have deductive ontological and epistemological reasoning and Boolean scien-
            tific logic contributed to your action reflection praxis, individually and within your commu-
            nity of practice, since your last reflection(s)?

        3. In what ways have inductive reasoning, meta-design, and innovation-in-use, along with
            associated ontological and epistemological reasoning, contributed to your action reflection
            praxis, individually and within your community of practice, since your last reflection(s)?

        4. In what ways have abductive reasoning and moral and ethical questioning individually and
            within your community of practice helped to unmask and expose hidden forms of oppres-
            sion, false beliefs, and commonly held myths, thereby contributing to your action reflection
            praxis since your last reflection(s)?

        5. Bringing these together, how has this influenced your hands-on coding to build a Toolbox
            Trumpet? How has the design and implementation of the sociotechnical artifacts used in
            these hands-on works shaped your own hands-on work?

 Background Knowledge Probe

  Take a few minutes to bring up a mental picture of each musical instrument you've played yourself, or
  which you've watched others play.

           · How are they played? What similarities and differences are there across instruments?
           · How might they be constructed? What materials are used? How does material choice influ-

              ence use of, and sound creation by, the instrument?
           · Of the instruments considered, which ones might make use of digital technologies? Of pro-

              gramming languages?
  So far, we've used the Circuit Playground Express microcontroller and MakeCode programming lan-
  guage to learn essential coding concepts.1 In particular, we've explored:

           · Conditional logic
           · Iteration loops
           · Variables
           · Modularization

 Technical Introduction

  We've also started exploring how we can write programming code using these concepts to interact
  with analog and digital electronic circuits in order to develop working electronic tools.Now, let's turn
  our attention to the tools that might facilitate our telling of counterstories. We've seen how different
  folks are creating collective digital stories in community-based co-design projects using emergent
  approaches.23 A Little Free Library is one of many examples in which analog information sharing

  takes place to advance community building. Let's consider if the Circuit Playground Express micro-
  controller and Raspberry Pi microcomputer can work together to serve as a digital extension to an
  existing analog Little Free Library in a community. In what ways can digital networked information
  systems serve as tools to help advance the analog? In what ways might it disrupt the analog? In what
  ways is the disruption good? In what ways is it harmful? Rather than considering how the digital
  replaces the technical, perhaps a digital little free library can be a valuable tool -- a digital networked
  information system extension -- for the already existing analog networked information systems shar-
  ing information and knowledge in communities, with communities, and for communities. We will
  create a Little Free Library tool using the Circuit Playground Express and the Raspberry Pi for archiv-
  ing and selective playback of stories. Down the line we will hopefully be able to use touch sensors to
  indicate which story is to be shared.But first, let's put the system through some early testing by turn-
  ing the components into a Toolbox Trumpet!

 Piano Keys and Trumpet Valves

  Let's compare a piano to a trumpet. With a piano, you have a key for every note you want to play.
  For instance, if we want to play the basic C major scale in ascending order, we'd need seven keys as
  follows:

  | C | D | E | F | G | A | B |

  In music, an octave is a series of eight notes that take you from the first note back to that note, but in
  which that note is now twice or half the frequency of vibration that it was before.

  To go down one octave, we'd need another set of seven keys to the left that cut the frequency of vibra-
  tion in half. If we wanted to go up an octave, we'd need seven keys to the right that double the fre-
  quency of vibration. So to play three octaves of the C scale, we'd have something like:

  | C | D | E | F | G | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | A | B |

  Compare this to a trumpet. The standard trumpet has three valves. Each valve is a cylinder that, when
  pressed down fully, moves the airflow from one set of tubing to a different set of tubing. The airflow
  now takes a different path from the mouthpiece where it enters the trumpet to the bell where it exits
  the trumpet. In so doing, it changes the frequency of vibration slightly, changing the note being played.

  To play a scale, you need to press one, two, or three of those valves, or none of the valves, depending
  on the note you are wanting to play. To make this work, you need to add in embouchure. A person
  playing the trumpet uses their lips and facial muscles to adjust the frequency of vibration up and

down, thereby slowly moving up or down scales and octaves in combination with the movement of
the valves.

In this case, we'd play a middle-C scale like so:

 Note Valve 1 Valve 2 Valve 3
 C open open open
 D pressed open pressed
 E pressed pressed open
 F pressed open open
 G open open open
 A pressed pressed open
 B open pressed open

Exercise: First Three Notes

Choose Your Own Adventure

In the introduction to the book, I shared about the tulip poplar, a wood which inspires me, and which I
have used to craft a toolbox for my Raspberry Pi equipment. As visible in the video below, I've attached
nylon conductive tape to the lid of the toolbox. The benefit of completing the exercise in this way is
that it extends the digital capacitive touch sensors into an analog parallel. If you'd like to follow along
in a similar manner, two resources are available to you:

         · Purchase nylon conductive tape from Adafruit.
         · Download and print the toolbox template.

But this is not the only way forward. The following exercises can be completed exclusively with the
Circuit Playground Express. To pursue this remix, jump ahead to Option 2: Circuit Playground Express
Trumpet.

Option 1: Toolbox Trumpet

Let's do some experimenting to find out how we might play notes on our Toolbox Trumpet by using
three nylon electrically conductive tape strips on the cover of our toolboxes, and then using alligator
clips to connect each to a pin on the Circuit Playground Express.

Before going through this and the following exercises, take 4 1/2 minutes to watch a video demonstra-
tion of the Toolbox Trumpet.
197 2B: Make Music with Code

Connect three alligator clip wires between the nylon conductive tape pieces and the Circuit Play-
ground Express:

        1. Connect one end of an alligator clip wire to the nylon conductive tape by the single | col-
            umn. Connect the other end of that alligator clip wire to pin A1 on the Circuit Play-
            ground Express.

        2. Connect one end of a second alligator clip wire to the nylon conductive tape by the double
            | column. Connect the other end of this second alligator clip wire to pin A2 on the Cir-
            cuit Playground Express.

        3. Connect one end of a third alligator clip wire to the nylon conductive tape by the quad |
            column. Connect the other end of this third alligator clip wire to pin A4 on the Circuit
            Playground Express.

Next, we'll follow the steps to develop the code for playing a Middle C.

Option 2: Circuit Playground Express Trumpet

We can also make a trumpet with the capacitive touch sensors on the Circuit Playground Express. On
the microcontroller, identify the sensors labeled A1, A2, and A4.

Steps

         · First, let's develop the code to play a Middle C.

                    1. Start a new project in MakeCode
                    2. To a FOREVER loop, add in an "If...Then" conditional block from the "Condi-

                        tionals" section of the LOGIC category.
                    3. From the INPUT category, take a "button A is pressed" block statement, and drop

                        it into the "If...Then" block statement where it currently says <True>.
                    4. Hit the "button A " window and change that to "pin A1." It should now say "if

                        pin A1 is pressed, then."
                    5. From the MUSIC category, take the "play tone at Middle C for 1/2 beat," and put it

                        below the "if pin A1 is pressed, then" statement.
                    6. In the simulator, move the mouse pointer over to the A1 pin and press down to

                        play a Middle C for as long as you press it.
                        We're playing our first note!
                    7. Let's test it out on the real Circuit Playground Express:

                                a. Save your project as MiddleCTest1.
                                b. Flash this to your physical Circuit Playground Express.
                                                2B: Make Music with Code 198

c. Press A1 on the Circuit Playground Express.

           8. In this first test, the sound was a little soft. Let's crank up the volume a bit and
               test again.
                       a. From the LOOPS category, pull out an "on start" loop.
                       b. Add to this new loop a "set volume" from the MUSIC category.
                       c. For testing, let's set that to 255, the largest number listed.
                       d. Save this as MiddleCTest2.
                       e. Flash this to your physical Circuit Playground Express.
                       f. Press A1 on the Circuit Playground Express.
               Feel encouraged to continuing adjusting this to meet your preferences.

· Next, let's add the ability to play a Middle D. We'll do this in an else "If...Then" block
   statement right below the Middle C "If...Then" block statement.
           1. Click on the + symbol at the lower left of the current "If...Then" block statement.
               This creates an else statement.
           2. Click on the + symbol again to add an else "If...Then" block.
           3. Hit the - symbol to the right of the else statement to remove it.
199 2B: Make Music with Code

                    4. Duplicate the "pin A1 is pressed" block input statement and place that in the new
                        else "If...Then" block statement. Change it to pin A2.

                    5. Duplicate the "play tone at Middle C for 1/2 beat" statement, place it under the
                        "else if <pin A2 is pressed> then" statement, and change it to Middle D.

                    6. In the simulator, move the mouse pointer over to the A2 pin and press down to
                        play a Middle D for as long as you press it.
                        We're ready to start our way up the C scale!

                    7. You might want to do a quick test on the physical Circuit Playground Express by
                        saving the file and flashing it over. We're in a process of rapid design and proto-
                        typing, so for now, if it works, we can move on. But do be sure to take notes of
                        what is working subpar based on your as self-assessment, and your understand-
                        ing of preferences if this were to be made available to other users.

         · With these two notes playing adequately, now what? We've only got three "valves" and we
            want to play seven different notes. Remember that on a real trumpet we could press 0, 1, 2,
            or 3 valves. We could also use embouchure to create more possible combinations. To mimic
                                                                                                                              2B: Make Music with Code 200

            the trumpet, we are using only three buttons or "valves." Is it possible that we can press
            these in combination to play a third note? Let's test this out by pressing both pin A1 and
            pin A2.

                    1. Hit the + symbol at the bottom of the "If...Then...Else If...Then" conditional state-
                        ment twice to add in a third "Else If...Then" block statement below the "pin A2 is
                        pressed" conditional.

                    2. Delete the "Else" at the bottom of this extended "If...Then" control flow statement
                        block of conditionals.

                    3. Go into the LOGIC category and scroll down to the "Boolean" section. From
                        there, grab a "< > and < >" statement and add this to the third "If...Then" block
                        statement.

                    4. Copy the "pin A1 is pressed," and place that into the left "< >" space.
                    5. Copy the "pin A2 is pressed," and place that into the right "< >" space.
                    6. Copy the "play tone at Middle D for 1/2 beat," and drop it below the "else if <<pin

                        A1 is pressed> and <pin A2 is pressed>> then" statement, and change it to Middle
                        E. You should see something like this in the MakeCode programming screen.

                    7. Unless you have a touch screen, you cannot test this in the simulator. So let's con-
                        tinue testing on our physical Circuit Playground Express.
                                1. Let's name this ToolboxTrumpet3Notes and click on the save icon.
                                2. Flash this new downloaded file to your physical Circuit Playground
                                    Express.

Now we are ready to test our Toolbox Trumpet prototype.

We've reached three notes! ...Or did we?

Boolean Logic

In the code we just wrote, we created three "If...Then" block logic statements inside the forever itera-
tion loop. Logical true and false, yes and no, 1 and 0 propositions are the fundamental process used in
both electronics and modern programming languages, as well as in statistics and positivist paradigms
of research.

Boolean logic, or Boolean algebra, uses two possible values, "true" and "false," to test logic state-
ments. This concept was introduced by George Boole in his books The Mathematical Analysis of Logic
(1847) and An Investigation of the Laws of Thought (1854). The Boolean logic written in our first code
was as follows:

Is pin A1 pressed?  True  Play Middle C for 1/2 beat  End

False


Is pin A2 pressed?  True  Play Middle D for 1/2 beat  End

False


Is pin A1 and A2 pressed? True  Play Middle E for 1/2 beat  End

False


End

Note that the order of True/False statements in Boolean logic is essential. If pin A1 is pressed, then play
Middle C. Else, if pin A2 is pressed, then play Middle D. Else, if both pin A1 and pin A2 are pressed,
play Middle E.

This makes perfect sense if our ultimate goal is to move up the C scale, going from the Middle C on to
the Middle D and then the Middle E.
                                                                                                                              2B: Make Music with Code 202

The problem is, code uses Boolean logic, which has already determined that neither pin A1 nor pin A2
was pressed, so logically we already know both are also not pressed. That means we need to reverse
our test in a way that fits within formal Boolean logic. In so doing, we should be in better shape.

Is pin A1 and A2 pressed? True  Play Middle E for 1/2 beat  End

False


Is pin A2 pressed?  True  Play Middle D for 1/2 beat  End

False


Is pin A1 pressed?  True  Play Middle C for 1/2 beat  End

False


End

Crash Course Computer Science series featuring Carrie Anne Philbin, hosted by PBS Digital Studios.

Exercise: Toolbox Trumpet, First Three Notes, Failing Forward

Open the MakeCode project named ToolboxTrumpet3Notes, and swap the "If...Then" block statements
around using our Boolean logic diagram above. Your code should now look like this:
203 2B: Make Music with Code

         · Save and Download this edited version of the MakeCode, calling it ToolboxTrum-
            pet3Notes-FailForward.

         · Hit "reset" on the Circuit Playground Express microcontroller, and then drag and drop the
            ToolboxTrumpet3Notes-FailForward.uf2 file into the CPLAYBOOT device.

         · Press the toolbox's single | or CPE's A1 "valve" and you should now hear a Middle C.
         · Press the toolbox's double | or CPE's A2 "valve" and you should hear a Middle D.
         · Press the toolbox's single and double | or CPE's A1 and A2 "valves" together. You should

            hear that Middle E!

This time it should play the first three notes of a Middle C scale!

Key Takeaways

Failing forward to move from Not Yet to Yet is an unavoidable part of the creative process.

The human experience incorporates multiple ways of knowing and being. But for many of us, Boolean
logic using true/false statements is not a part of our everyday practice.

While in the last session we worked to expand our essential coding concepts like conditionals, func-
tions, variables, and control flow statements, it is only with the incorporation of Boolean logic
that we gain some of the central deductive reasoning skills needed to effectively put our designs into
executable code.

Boolean Logic and Algebraic Notation

Reflecting back on our Toolbox Trumpet code, let's step aside for a minute to consider ways we could
get three "valves" to play seven different notes.

We could have set up that third else "If...Then" block statement to play Middle E with the third valve
alone. What might have been the design choice to instead play it using the first two valves combined?

What would be the next valve or valve combinations of to play the next note in the C scale, a Middle
F?

Base Ten Decimal Notation

Count with me from zero to nine using decimal notation:
Zero      2B: Make Music with Code 204
One
Two                     0
Three                   1

Five                    3
Six                     4
Seven                   5

                        8
                        9

Excellent!

Now, what would we do if we wanted to move to the number ten?

If you kept a close eye, you'll notice the table above had a couple of blank columns to the left of the
column listing numbers 0 to 9. Let's use that as a means to count from zero to twenty.

Zero      0 0
One       0 1
Two       0 2
Three     0 3
Four      0 4
Five      0 5
Six       0 6
Seven     0 7
Eight     0 8
Nine      0 9
Ten       1 0
Eleven    1 1
Twelve    1 2
Thirteen  1 3
Fourteen  1 4
Fifteen   1 5
Sixteen   1 6
205 2B: Make Music with Code  1 7

 Seventeen                    1 9
 Eighteen                     2 0
 Nineteen
 Twenty

Note that now we've had a "tens" column all along. The value was just at zero when we started. Once
we moved over to ten, we reset the "ones" column to zero, and moved the "tens" column to one.

The "tens" column remained at 1 while we moved the "ones" column from 1 to 9. To take the next step,
we moved the "ones" column back to 0, and the "tens" column from 1 to 2, giving us twenty.

Using just these two columns, we could make our way up to ninety-nine. Now, let's move from ninety-
nine to one hundred. To do that, we need to use the third column, that is, the "one hundreds" column:

Zero                          0    0  0
...
Nine                          0    0  9
Ten
...                           0    1  0
Ninety-nine

One Hundred and One
...                           1    0  0
One Hundred and Ninety-nine
Two Hundred                   1    0  1
Two Hundred and One
...                           1    9  9
Two Hundred and Ninety-nine
Three Hundred                 2    0  0
...
Nine Hundred and Ninety-nine  2    0  1

                              2    9  9

                              3    0  0

                              9    9  9

To go any further in base ten, we'd need a fourth column, that is, the "one thousands" column, which
we don't have in the table we've been using for this. We're at our limit.
                                                      2B: Make Music with Code 206

When Base Ten Decimal Notation Isn't the Best Option

So if we somehow could do a lot of real quick tapping on those valves, we could be moving quite lively
through a whole bunch of different notes. Our voices can move steadily through notes by adjusting
the frequency with which they vibrate. The problem is, when we use the valve of a trumpet or our
prototyped equivalent, it serves as a means to accomplish Boolean logic.

         · If the trumpet valve is pressed, move the airflow through this tube. Else, pass it through
            that tube.

         · If our prototyped valve is pressed, that is, if pin A2 is pressed, play a Middle D.

As a matter of fact, in MakeCode, when you click to change the note you were wanting to play if pin
A2 is pressed, clicking on the Middle D of the visual piano also shows the number 294, or 294 Hertz.
Hertz is the frequency, or number of cycles per second that something should cycle up and down. The
slower it cycles, the lower the pitch. The faster it cycles, the higher the pitch.

Middle C is actually specifying that the little speaker on the Circuit Playground Express cycle 262
times per second, or 262 Hz, while Middle D cycles at 294 times per second, or 294 Hz. By cycling a
little faster, the pitch is a little higher.

With a standard speaker, that means a membrane vibrates up and down 262 times per second or 294
times per second, depending on if we're playing a Middle C, or a Middle D, respectively. This is what
makes an analog sound. And it's the same thing that human vocal cords do.

Digital signals collect and distribute data using the digits 0 and 1 to serve as samples of the
analog signals or information. Pins A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, and A7 on the Circuit Playground
Express can serve multiple roles, one of which is as capacitive touch sensors. When per-
forming these readings of skin or other materials that have a slight positive charge, the input
level is interpreted as a binary value of 1 and a logic value of True. When no positively
charged touch is sensed, the input level is low, and a binary value of 0 and logic value of
False are used.

In MakeCode, the word "pressed" in the statement "if pin A1 is pressed, then" is equivalent
to the binary value 1 and the logic value True.

Analog signals are made up of continuously variable physical quantities. The speaker built
into the Circuit Playground Express delivers an analog signal. The frequency of oscillation
from peak to peak in a sine curve as shown below determines the musical pitch we hear. The
note heard in a speaker vibrating two full oscillations, as shown in red in the image below, is
1/7th the pitch of the note played in the speaker when there are 14 full oscillations as shown
in purple in the image below.
207 2B: Make Music with Code

      If the sine wave below showing 14 full oscillations represents 262 Hertz, that is, a frequency
      of 262 oscillations per second, then the one above, showing 7 full oscillations in the same
      time period represents 131 Hertz. As seen in the MakeCode "Play tone at" line, 262 Hertz is
      a Middle C, while 131 Hertz is a Low C. The human ear can hear sounds as low as 20 Hertz,
      and in the image below 2 full oscillations in this time period is equivalent to about 37 Hertz
      given the other two frequency calculations, although it may be that the Circuit Playground
      Express will not play a frequency that low.

      Adafruit's "Circuit Playground Sound and Music" tutorial.

We could work to press our "valve" 262 times a second to play a Middle C over the next second in
time. Or we could give ourselves some liberty and adjust the clocked sequential logic such that if we
tapped it 26 times in 10 seconds, we would play a Middle C scale over the next second of time.
Probably a more practical way forward is to use the conductive touch sensor pins on the Circuit Play-
ground Express. We can take the digital inputs on these sensors and use basic Boolean logic to identify
which of these sensors is touched during the current clock cycle. Then we can calculate a mathemati-
cal conversion to a certain frequency, say 262 Hz, to provide an analog Middle C output via the Circuit
Playground Express speaker.
Building from here, we could design and construct a toolbox piano made from tulip poplar, much like
in the first video of this session. But that would require 21 nylon conductive tape pads, placed close
enough together to let us easily switch between them, but far enough apart that we don't sense a cur-
rent flow between them, confusing the code. Current can conduct over wood, especially when moist
from rain or from just the wear of our moist human hands on the wood and nylon. Doable? Yes. Prac-
tical? Perhaps not.
Is there another design option?

Base Two Binary Notation

It's exactly this conundrum that moved early developers of electronics and the early computers from
base ten decimal notation to base two binary notation. Binary works in zeros and ones only. That is,
they are a standard means of implementing Boolean logic!

Is pin A1 and A2 pressed?  True   Play Middle E for 1/2 beat
False                      True   Play Middle D for 1/2 beat
                           True   Play Middle C for 1/2 beat
Is pin A2 pressed?
False

Is pin A1 pressed?

Or let's revisit the electronics studied earlier in the book: The push button itself is a Boolean logic
processor.

Is the momentary switch push button pressed?   True   Pass current through; LEDs are lit
False

Do not pass current through; LEDs are not lit

As mentioned earlier, Boolean logic is fundamental to electronics, not just computer science program-
ming languages. Indeed, the world around us has many ways of moving from true/false, yes/no, one/
zero. This is why Boolean logic quickly shifted the design of electronics and programming over to
using base two binary notation.

When we count in binary, we move from columns representing ones, tens, and hundreds of base ten
decimal notation, to columns representing ones, twos, and fours. Each column is known as a bit. Let's
see where that takes us, counting-wise, when each bit can only be a 0 or a 1:
209 2B: Make Music with Code

Three   0      1              1     = 003
Four    1      0              0     = 004
Five    1      0              1     = 005
Six     1      1              0     = 006
Seven   1      1              1     = 007

Note, then, that in binary we now have a "ones" column. It can only move from zero to one. So to get
to the number two, we need a "twos" column. Moving it from 0 to 1 and moving the ones column from
1 to 0 gives us the number two. To move to three, we then keep the twos column at 1, and move the
ones column back to 1.

But we're at the end of what those two columns can reach. So we now need a "fours" column. Set
the ones and twos columns back to 0, and move the fours column to 1. Ta-da! We've reached four. By
switching the ones and twos column on and off, we can move the count all the way up to seven!

This demonstrates that a 3-bit counter can move between 8 different decimal numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, and 7. It also demonstrates that we haven't even completed filling in the ones column in decimal, let
alone moving to the tens or one hundreds columns of decimal notation.

Exercise: Creating Code to Play a Full Middle C Scale

Let's put this new Boolean logic and deductive reasoning into practice to play the full Middle C scale
using the three "valves" of our Toolbox Trumpet or Circuit Playground Express. As this is a tool being
designed first and foremost for educational purposes, let's add in pin A4 along with pins A1 and A2.

Remember that order matters in Boolean logic:
                                                                        2B: Make Music with Code 210

Is pin A1 and A2 and A4 pressed? True  Play Middle B for 1/2 beat  End

False


Is pin A2 and pin A4 pressed? True  Play Middle A for 1/2 beat  End

False


Is pin A1 and pin A4 pressed? True  Play Middle G for 1/2 beat  End

False


Is pin A1 and pin A2 pressed? True  Play Middle E for 1/2 beat  End

False


Is pin A4 pressed?  True  Play Middle F for 1/2 beat  End

False


Is pin A2 pressed?  True  Play Middle D for 1/2 beat  End

False


Is pin A1 pressed?  True  Play Middle C for 1/2 beat  End

False


End

       1. Add in five more else "If...Then" block statements below the three we already have. Proceed
           to shuffle these so that the order goes as follows:
211 2B: Make Music with Code

        2. Save this project as TrumpetToolboxCScale, flash it to the Circuit Playground
            Express, and give it a test run.

        3. Can you play all seven notes of a Middle C scale? Keep practicing until you can do this at a
            relatively good pace.

Getting in Your Groove

Feel encouraged to go into the MakeCode project and adjust the volume level that we configured in
the "on start" loop. You may also want to consider adjusting the tempo at which the 1/2 beat is played.
You can do this by pulling out a "set tempo to 120 (bpm)" from the "Tempo" section of the MUSIC cat-
egory and adding it to the "on start" loop. Play the 1/2 beat slower by lowering the beats per minute
to double or single digits. Or speed it up by raising the tempo to setting it somewhere over 200 bpm.
Experiment with changing the beat from 1/2 in each of the if logic statements to something else of
your choice, say down to 1/16th or up to 4. Test it out in the simulator with the Middle C, Middle D,
and Middle F notes. Or test it out on the physical Circuit Playground Express by saving, flashing, and
testing to hit your preferred Toolbox Trumpet performance metrics!

Key Takeaways

Computing devices like computers and microcontrollers use binary notation to represent numbers
and letters. The fundamental Boolean logic used in electronics is founded on base two binary notation.
Digital signals like the capacitive touch sensors of the Circuit Playground Express also use binary.

The continuously variable physical quantities of the world, including the human senses, are analog.

Our Toolbox Trumpet now uses digital sensors on the Circuit Playground Express as conditional
inputs to control the Hertz of the analog audio output of the Circuit Playground Express speaker.

The prevalence of the digital realm, and the notion that more recent generations are born digitally
native, does not change the core of our physical being. But it does add additional tools in our toolbox
for use in our everyday lives, some of which are truly valued in helping us reach our individual and
community goals. We're still physically analog. Or are we?

Has the creation and use of this digital trumpet shaped us in significant ways? How might we have
been changed differently if this session had been conducted only using analog materials, for instance,
using different lengths of wood to play different notes?

Wrap Up

The focus of this session was two-fold: First, to help us expand our understanding of the methodolog-
ical landscape. This includes positivist paradigms, as related to programming code and Boolean logic,
with interpretive paradigms, as related to meta-design and innovation-in-use, as well as critical para-
digms that advance moral and ethical questioning to unmask and expose hidden forms of oppression.
Second, to further our more holistic journey of recognition regarding the deep interconnectedness of
the social and the technical, one that cannot be fully teased apart. At the same time, it is hoped this
journey is now better facilitating our use of deductive reasoning to more effectively create program-
ming code even as we work to use inductive and abductive reasoning to reflect on our sociotechnical
artifacts as we continue to move from a thing-orientation to a person-orientation.

Examining "Development"

The information, communication, and computing technologies we use in our everyday lives -- from
home to play to profession -- arise from complex histories, methodologies, cultures, knowledge, and
philosophies of a just society. They strongly shape our daily experiences and well-being. Strong argu-
ments are made regarding the societal benefits of information, communication, and computer sciences:
from meeting individual needs by empowering people, to advancing essential social services such as
healthcare and education, to facilitating urgent data collection in advance of or during natural dis-
asters and human-induced climate change, and beyond. Yet the sciences, including computer science,
shape and are shaped by sociotechnical artifacts.

                                                                       3A: Valued, Inclusive Information and Computing Technology Experiences 218

  It is important to consider an oft-used word embedded within many conversations regarding the soci-
  etal benefits of information systems: development. This term is used to indicate material prosperity,
  liberation from oppression, a holistic project for personal progress, development of a child, of new
  software, of new countries, of natural resources, and still more. It is a term used both directly, and as a
  hidden assumption. But however it is used, it is not a neutral term; "development" is loaded with value
  judgments, trade-offs, and complexities.

  Some scholars within the Community Informatics community argue for the adoption of Nobel Lau-
  reate Amartya Sen's capability approach to facilitate "human, rather than technical or sociotechnical,
  problem solving."1 Let's explore community informatics and computational thinking as a means to
  advance agency for valued, inclusive information, communication, and computing technology experi-
  ences.

 The Capability Approach

  The capability approach is an alternative to normative approaches to international development poli-
  cies and practices that focus exclusively on resource expansionism such as economic growth, or posi-
  tive/predictive approaches for strategies and practices that emphasize empirical studies, data analysis,
  and hypothesis testing. The capability approach has been highly influential in guiding the United
  Nations to a more holistic human development paradigm with its four essential pillars: equality, sus-
  tainability, productivity, and empowerment.

  Central to the capability approach are those things individuals value being and doing, their function-
  ings. While it is important we do all we can to identify a person's functionings, the focus for devel-
  opment stakeholders is on expanding the set of capabilities, that is, the freedoms for individuals to
  achieve their functionings. Capabilities are the real and actual possibilities from which individuals can
  choose so as to achieve those things they value being and value doing. Functionings are the aspira-
  tions that make up people's well-being.

  Martha Nussbaum has created a list of 10 central human capabilities as follows: Life; Bodily health;
  Bodily integrity; Senses, imagination, and thought; Emotions; Practical reason; Affiliation; Other
  species; Play; and Control over one's environment.2 However, Sen suggests each individual should be
  free to determine if any, all, more, or different capabilities are central to their personal functionings.
  While valuable food for thought as stakeholders gather to co-explore development paths, the essential
  determinant is to consider the possible range of capabilities needed to provide a sufficient capability
  set advancing individual freedom to choose, execute, and achieve their valued goals.

  Capability Approach Community Informatics," The Information Society 30, no. 3 (May 27, 2014): 209. https://doi.org/

  2000), 78-80.
219 3A: Valued, Inclusive Information and Computing Technology Experiences

To expand the capability set, we also need to assure individuals have agency to pursue the goals they
value. Agency is a combination of many individual resources from within a resource portfolio that
includes: Material resources; Financial resources; Natural resources; Geographical resources; Human
resources; Psychological resources; Information; Cultural resources; and Social resources.3 Sen iden-
tifies choice, then, as the aim and the means for human development, recognizing that individual
choice ultimately depends on their personal valued beings and doings. In the article "The capability
approach and the `medium of choice': steps towards conceptualizing information and communication
technologies for development," Dorothea Kleine notes that choice has four key components: existence
of choice, sense of choice, exercise of choice, and achievement of choice. In many cases, Kleine has
found the existence of choice in her works to advance an individual's ability to exercise and achieve
choice, but that this existence is hidden from the individual for a range of reasons. Advancing a per-
son's capability set, then, is more than that of agency and skills development for the exercising and
achieving of choice, but also a broader work to advance the sense of choice.

Resource  Functioning (something people  Capability (the freedom to  Utility (that sought to
bicycle   value being or doing)          achieve the functioning)    be maximized)
          mobility                       ability to move around      pleasure

If we review the table, we can see that the person aspires to be mobile. A bicycle can potentially then
serve to provide agency to the person as a component within their capability set. However, as some of
us may have considered up front, sometimes a bicycle is not the best resource, such as for those who
do not have the technical abilities to ride a bicycle. This may be based on road or environmental con-
ditions, because of balance problems, because of conflicts with the structure of the body, or still more
reasons. Or it may be simply because it is not a capability a person values doing, even though mobility
is a valued being.

It is from this framing of the capability approach that Mario Toboso challenges us to rethink disability.4
Disability is the accepted term used when considering treatment of those in society with physical or
mental limitations outside the considered norms of a human. From within the "medical model," it is
understood that disabilities are medical in nature, that disability is a disease, and that a person can
only contribute to society to the extent they can be rehabilitated or normalized. The "social model," on
the other hand, identifies disabilities as social in nature. Each individual is just as capable as anyone
else of making contributions to society if an environment is designed taking specific requirements into
account. More recently, a "diversity model" has been brought forward to overthrow old concepts of
ability and instead looks for personal identities that are not perceived as negative.

  Communication Technologies for Development," Ethics and Information Technology 13, no. 2 (June 1, 2011): 119-30.

  tion Technology 13, no. 2 (June 1, 2011): 107-18. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-010-9254-2.
                                                                       3A: Valued, Inclusive Information and Computing Technology Experiences 220

  It is within this new diversity model that Toboso articulates "functional diversity" in association with
  Sen's concept of functionings, the valued beings and doings a person aspires to achieve to bring about
  well-being. In expanding the diversity model to incorporate "diversity of functionings," we can con-
  sider mobility with a new lens. Agency to move around will require many different modes in acknowl-
  edgment of the diversity of people, and the ends they are seeking to achieve through the mobility.
  Participating in an information systems project, moving locations under challenging environmental
  conditions, or playing with others in dance or sports each would require different means of executing
  and achieving choice regarding ability to move around, given their agency to do so.

  As community informatics seeks to advance the well-being of individuals and communities through
  effective use of information and communications technologies, the capability approach serves as a
  framework for participatory action and research within a community of inquiry to assure a respected
  person-orientation to achieve real freedoms of agency to achieve that which individuals and collectives
  value being and doing. It is a valuable complement to critical methodological paradigms, and especially
  those within information and communications technology, that provide situated agency as a means to
  provide a critical account of individual agency, that move beyond a simplistic notion of technology as
  goods and resources often seen within capability approach research and practice, a work that advances
  reflexivity and a critical lens so as to identify and address reification and hegemonic potential of tech-
  nology science and research methods and practices.5 This facilitates better design and development of
  digital technologies through an understanding and respect of the unique and rich community cultural
  wealth. It is to actively work to counter oppressive components of sociotechnical artifacts, something
  only achievable through decodification and recodification of the text and context of the technologies,
  so as to see the ways in which they are removing choice, the sense of choice, and the possibilities to
  execute and achieve choice.

 Inclusive Computational Thinking

  Computational thinking brings together 21st century skills of communication, collaboration, cre-
  ativity, and critical thinking with digital technologies to advance collective problem-solving. Drawing
  on community informatics, the capability approach, functional diversity, and inclusive computational
  thinking, it is essential to develop inclusive computer science experiences for learners with disabilities.
  Doing so advances work within the sciences, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics, computer
  science itself, and beyond.6

  The Creative Technology Research Lab at the University of Florida has worked extensively to explore
  advancement of K-12 education based on frameworks and strategies valued within a broad range
  of information and communication technology spaces. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is one

   framework for innovative teaching and learning that combines explicit instruction with open inquiry
   and collaborative problem-solving to foster co-construction of expertise with peers. When combined
   with the capability approach, functional diversity, and community informatics, the Universal Design
   for Learning framework helps build bridges across the full diversity of stakeholders to better align
   design of information and communication technologies in ways that further facilitate innovation-in-
   use to achieve functionings. The three principles of UDL are engagement that stimulates interest and
   motivation for affective learning networks, representation that presents information and content in
   different ways building recognition learning networks, and action and expression that differentiate
   the ways co-explorers can express knowledge to build strategic learning networks.7 These principles
   serve as a solid base for effective, inclusive community inquiry.

         You know learning, it's not a spectator sport.

         Ava Wolf, eLearning Professional, Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning

   Advancing our well-being through use of digital and non-digital technologies to realize our function-
   ings requires active co-explorations within communities of inquiry. Explorations may occur in a sec-
   ond grade classroom, a school library, a university studio class, a public or academic library, a salon
   or barbershop, a community center, a community garden, a civic center, a religious institution, a safe
   space for people who are homeless, or the many other gathering spaces of communities. Inquiry hap-
   pens when co-exploration is driven by community problems, in which questions are raised not only of
   the immediate possible technology under consideration, but also the nature of the community, mem-
   bership within it, competing values, and beyond, so as to challenge and advance the nature of commu-
   nity itself. This, as much as anything else, is what it means to take a person-centered approach. It is the
   transactional model of communication central to community inquiry as members of a community and
   those working in partnership's with and for the community which can be "integrated into our social
   realities in such a way that it helps us not only understand them but also create and change them8. It
   is the "radical revolution of values" the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. calls us to9. It is the problem-
   posing as opposed to banking system of education Paulo Freire calls us to as oppressed and oppressor
   come together in action-reflection praxis10.

   To achieve this, inquiry must be facilitated by the community itself. Innovation-in-use, as with all
   co-exploration learning processes, is a doing accomplished in community, with community, and for
   community. Inclusive computational thinking, then, becomes inclusive community tinkering with an

emphasis on persons first and last, and in which technical teaching, learning, hypothesizing, and test-
ing occur as infill. And even more importantly, as we noted in the Blue Unit chapter 1A: The Logic
of Hardware and Programming this work is a process of reading of word and world so as to under-
stand the codifications of the central tenets of the technology, to decodify these words, to discover the
mutual shaping of those technologies, and a recodification of these to strategically advance individual
and community valued beings and doings.

Through its integration of social and technical components, generative themes, and shared strategies,
frameworks, and paradigms, in what ways might this book be advancing a life-long pattern for
community inquiry and community informatics practice? In what ways is it shaped to hinder such
advancement?

Lesson Plan

Together, we've worked to use a person- and social-first focus to reconsider our everyday technologies
as both positive and oppressive, disruptive technologies. We have worked to advance our skill sets to
serve as facilitators and co-explorers in person-centered demystification and innovation-in-use of our
technologies. How can we assure a fully inclusive approach to these works?

As we now move to "Build Functions for Remixable Code," we add functions into the Toolbox Trumpet
to create a four octave scale before concluding with an LED pixel counter challenge. What ways, if
any, could this be used as a test space for assuring fully inclusive approaches?

Background Knowledge Probe

Reusing/remixing code is a central tenet of the free and open source software movement. And indeed,
it's a central tenet of the Internet, as we'll discover in the Rainbow Unit. But as we've discovered
throughout the book and especially highlighted in The Unknown Tech Innovators, there's also an
active work to give the credit for innovations to certain people, and particularly to white males.
Take a few minutes now to reflect back on the innovative designers and builders of the code we're
now using for our own Community of Practice works, and especially those hidden and forgotten that
we've worked to bring forward as part of our explorations.

                      How has their work helped shape your own use and reuse/remixing works?
                      In what ways might your remixes be used by others in their works?

Technical Review

Let's take a minute to reflect back on the final exercises in sessions 1 and 2. Note that in the "Five
Digit Counters" exercise, we used a range of variables and arrays to expand our opportunities for
collecting and sharing data using several functions.

                                                                                 224
225 3B: Build Functions for Remixable Code

Compare this to the "Middle C Scale Toolbox Trumpet" exercise. Here, we committed our attention to
deductive reasoning and Boolean logic to guide us in the creation of an appropriate, functional
sequence of conditionals, thereby playing the notes in order from Middle C to Middle B.

 Exercise: Variables & Functions Remix of the Toolbox Trumpet

  Let's begin by considering how we could remix the Toolbox Trumpet using variables and functions to
  expand the capabilities of this tool.

 Steps: Creating a binary to decimal calculator

  To begin, we will create a new variable and use conditionals to collect the binary notation values,
  000 to 111, provided using the three "valves." We will use this to calculate the decimal notation equiv-
  alent, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.1

          1. In the VARIABLES category, create a new variable called CapTouchCounter. This will be
              used to determine which capacitive touch sensor "valve" or "valves" are pressed in that
              sequence.

          2. Drag a "set CapTouchCounter to 0" block from the VARIABLES category and place it in the
              default FOREVER function.

          3. Add three "If...Then" blocks from the LOGIC category to the FOREVER function, and con-
              figure them using a "button A is pressed" block from the INPUT category to have condi-
              tionals for pin A1, pin A2, and pin A3.

          4. In each of the "If...Then" conditionals, add a "change CapTouchCounter by" block. Set the
              pin A1 conditional so that CapTouchCounter is changed by 1. Set the pin A2 conditional so
              that CapTouchCounter is changed by 2. Set the pin A3 conditional so that CapTouch-
              Counter is changed by 4.

          5. Under advanced, go down to the CONSOLE category. From there, drag a "console log"
              block and add it as the last line of code in the new FOREVER function.

          6. Finally, from the VARIABLES category, drag a "CapTouchCounter" block and drop it into
              the right oval window of the "console log" block.

  [Watch the video "2x Playback of Capacitive Touch Sensor 3 bit Counter" for a recording of these steps
  to compare with your own process.]

  Feel encouraged to change 1X to 2X to play it back at high speed. Note that the console provides a
  means to enter a new level of testing within the simulator. Remember that we cannot test the pressing

227 3B: Build Functions for Remixable Code

of multiple capacitive touch sensors simultaneously. At this point, we can only assume the "change"
statement will add in the value, rather than replacing the previous value.

Steps: Playing the Middle C Scale

As we move forward, much of the time we use our Circuit Playground Express, we may want to use
these to select a digital counterstory to play through speakers rather than playing the notes of a C
scale. Sometimes we may want to do both. Sometimes we'll want to use the calculations for yet other
purposes.
For this reason, we will now create a new function called playTrumpetNote. We'll pass the Cap-
TouchCounter value to the function and set it up to determine the Hertz the note should be played at.

        1. From within the ADVANCED category, open the FUNCTIONS category. Within FUNC-
            TIONS, click on "Make a Function."
                      Replace "doSomething" with the name playTrumpetNote.
                      Add a parameter "Number" and replace "num" with "decimalNotation."

        2. From the FUNCTIONS category, drag the "call playTrumpetNote 1" and drop it at the bot-
            tom of the current FOREVER function, beneath and NOT WITHIN the end of the "If pin A4
            is pressed Then" block.
                                                                                                    3B: Build Functions for Remixable Code 228

3. Drag a "CapTouchCounter" block from the VARIABLES category and drop it into the "call
    playTrumpetNote 1" function, replacing the number 1.
              A number from 0 to 7 will now be sent to the function playTrumpetNote every
                time we call it.

4. We'll now use eight "If...Then...ElseIf" logic tests to work through the possible different
    decimal notation values we may receive given the 0 to 7 decimal scale we might receive via
    the function call.
229 3B: Build Functions for Remixable Code

        5. In the VARIABLES category, create a new variable called Hz.
        6. Drag the "set Hz to 0" block into the "If decimalNotation = 0" logic statement.

                      When the variable decimalNotation is equal to 0, no capacitive touch sensors are
                        currently pressed, so no note should be played.

        7. Copy and paste this "set Hz to 0" 7 times, putting one in each of the remaining "If decimal-
            Notation =" logic statements. Set the Hz to the following numbers:
                          3B: Build Functions for Remixable Code 230

decimalNotation Note  Hz

0  Silent 0

1  Middle-C 262

2  Middle-D 294

3  Middle-E 330

4  Middle-F 349

5  Middle-G 392

6  Middle-A 440

7  Middle-B 494

    8. From the LOGIC category, drag over one additional "If...Then" logic statement and add
        beneath the last "else If decimalNotation = 7 Then" conditional.

    9. To this new "If...Then" logic statement, replace "True" with a "<0 = 0>" comparison state-
        ment from the LOGIC category, within the Comparison section.
                  Replace the left 0 with a "decimalNotation" variable block.
                  Change the "=" comparison to a ">" comparison.

     · This will assure that a tone will only be played if one or more of the "valves" is pressed.

   10. Finally, from the MUSIC category, drag a "play tone at Middle C for 1/2 beat" and place it
        within the new "If decimalNotation > 0 Then" conditional statement.

     · Drag a "Hz" block and drop it into the "play tone at Middle C for 1/2 beat" block, replacing
        the "Middle C" window.

   11. Take a few minutes to test this out in the simulator. Then save this as ToolboxTrumpet-
        MiddleC-variablesFunction, and flash it to your physical Circuit Playground
        Express for further testing.
231 3B: Build Functions for Remixable Code

Key Takeaways

Functions serve to run certain control flow statements and other code when called upon by other parts
of the program. Indeed, MakeCode itself is written using many thousands of lines of code, most of
which we do not see or even know about. But within that code, they make a call to the FOREVER
function we create. This is the MakeCode implementation of the Clocked Sequence Programming I did
                                                                                                              3B: Build Functions for Remixable Code 232

as a graduate student back in 1990 to collect data from a controller I designed to do my own research.
Then it was in the C programming language, but the lines of code themselves have a lot of similarities.
By moving the playing of a note into its own function, we can now use the more general capTouch-
Counter value for a wider range of activities beyond just playing a note in a C scale, and potentially
even instead of that.
Indeed, take a moment to drag an "If...Then" logic block from the LOGIC category and drop it around
the "call playTrumpetNote CapTouchCounter" block. Then, at the very bottom of the INPUT category,
drag out a "switch right" block and replace the "True" statement within this "If...Then" logic block.
Save and flash this to your Circuit Playground Express. Now, depending on the position of the slide
switch located at D7 on the Circuit Playground Express, the notes of your scale will or will not be
played when pressing the "valves." However, the CapTouchCounter values will still be calculated, as
seen if you use a CONSOLE category "console log" block to record the "CapTouchCounter" value.

Exercise: 4-Octave Toolbox Trumpet

In "Essential Coding Concepts," we set up the momentary switch push buttons so that the blue LED
was on unless button A was pressed, and the white LED was off unless button B was pressed. Essen-
tially, this was equivalent to:

         · No buttons = 1 LED
         · Left button = 0 LEDs
         · Right button = 2 LEDs
This design could be seen as equivalent to the Middle C scale with no buttons pressed, Low C scale
with button A pressed, and High C scale with button B pressed. Let's do a remix of our code to see
how an electronic device can do the same thing, sometimes with added functionality, by remixing the
233 3B: Build Functions for Remixable Code

lines of code. To do this, we'll add these calculations into the FOREVER function, and then pass them
on to the playTrumpetNote function.

Steps and images are provided. Or, you can download the completed file:

Open and review it in MakeCode, and flash it to your Circuit Playground Express for further prototyp-
ing.
                                                                                                              3B: Build Functions for Remixable Code 234

The key additions:
         · Add a new variable called buttonCount to conduct three "If...Then" conditionals, setting
            buttonCount to 0 if only Button A is pressed, to 2 if Button B is pressed, and to 3 if both
            Button A and Button B are pressed. Otherwise, buttonCount remains at its default of 1.
         · Pass buttonCount as a second number to the function playTrumpetNote.
         · Divide the variable Hz by 2, taking it down one octave, if buttonCount is 0. Else, the vari-
            able Hz is multiplied by buttonCount. If neither button was pressed, it equals 1 and the Hz
            stays in the middle octave. If button B is pressed, the Hz is multiplied by 2 and it goes up
            one octave. If both buttons are pressed, it is multiplied by 3, and the Hz goes up two
            octaves.

Steps

        1. Create a new variable called buttonCount. At the top of the FOREVER function, add a
            "set buttonCount to 1" block so that in each iteration, this value is reset to the value if nei-
            ther button is pressed.

        2. Add a new set of "If...Then" logic statements, such that:
                      If button A is pressed and button B is pressed, then set buttonCount to 3.
                      Else if button B is pressed, then set buttonCount to 2.
                      Else if button A is pressed, then set buttonCount to 0.

        3. Right click on the "call playTrumpetNote" and select "Edit Function." Add a new number
            parameter and call it "buttonCount."

        4. In the "call playTrumpetNote" function, add a "buttonCount" block as the second number in
            the function call.

        5. Between the "decimalNotation" "If...Then...ElseIf" logic statements and the "If decimalNota-
            tion > 0 Then" conditional statement, add in a new "If...Then...Else" logic block from the
            LOGIC category. Configure this sequence of lines of code such that:
                      If buttonCount = 0, then set Hz to Hz ÷ 2.
                      Else, set Hz to Hz × buttonCount.

Wrap Up

We should now have two variables, CapTouchCounter and buttonCount, that we can pass to functions.
As a part of the "Comprehension Check" for this session, let's next look at how these variables can be
remixed in different functions.
235 3B: Build Functions for Remixable Code

Comprehension Check

Do Something New!

We've used the LED Pixels as indicator lights and even 5 digit counters in a few exercises now. As a
"Comprehension Check," create a new LED Pixel Counter function to do the same with our Toolbox
Trumpet. Indeed, this can prove helpful if we've forgotten we have the sliding switch to the left, keep-
ing the Toolbox Trumpet notes from being played by the Circuit Playground Express speaker. Record
a video image of this being run from your physical Circuit Playground Express, as well as a copy of
a screenshot of this new function as a way of demonstrating you've learned the core steps to create a
new function.

Design Criteria

        1. Open up the "ToolboxTrumpet4Octave" project in MakeCode. Rename this as "Toolbox-
            Trumpet4Octave-pixelCounter" and click on save.

        2. Create a new function called "pixelCount" and add in the number called "digitalNotation"
            and the number called "buttonCount."

        3. Create blocks of code such that pixel 9 is one of four colors, depending on the value of the
            variable "buttonCount."

        4. Create blocks of code such that pixels 0 to 6 are turned on to match "digitalNotation - 1"
            and off if no values are pressed.

ulator test of the prototype I created.]

A Self-Reflection on Sociotechnical Systems

My mother and my father's parents came to the United States in their 20s. Each of their journeys began
in Eastern Europe, where they were a part of Volhynian German communities. My family's roots in the
Volhynia region go back to the 1850s. Of those family members who lived through destruction of lands,
forced starvation, and deportation to Siberia, some of my relatives have remained there, while oth-
ers of my close family moved to Germany, the United States, and Canada. Some moved before World
War I, including a great grandfather, some moved between the wars, including my father's parents,
and some only moved at the end of World War II, including my mother. Some participated as soldiers
in the German military, some the Russian military, some the American military; some were soldiers,
some interpreters, some medics. Some were early Eastern European participants and leaders of a Mid-
western American Christian religion with a commitment to pacifism. Others claimed to be 13 genera-
tions "pure" -- a racist concept of purity that does not have a scientific basis -- and so were allowed by
government officials to become members of the Nazi party. All made great sacrifices to protect other
family members directly and indirectly. But always we sang, played instruments, and celebrated life to
its fullest.
I was born in Benton Harbor, Michigan, in the same hospital as my father. My grandfather, grand-
mother, and all my uncles and aunts on my father's side lived within a one-mile radius. Much of my
grandmother's family, including my uncle, lived a few miles away in another nearby community. Later

                                                                                 236
   237 4A: Sharing Our Counterstories

  in life, I learned that my father faced challenges in elementary school because of his health issues,
  immediate connection to German immigrants, and the associated name-calling based on these. The
  region where I grew up was one of the areas where the Volhynian Germans found the needed support
  to immigrate. And they remained together to provide essential community cultural support, just as
  they had in the Volhynian region before they fled violence, forced recruitment, and civil wars. I am a
  child and grandchild of immigrants, and I am ethnically of this culture.

  My middle and high school days, and my junior college days as well, brought me from the farming
  community into spaces primarily attended by students of color. And I thrived, participating in a range
  of in-class and extracurricular music and acting events. I am from a family of tinkers, although recent
  generations are not the formally-defined tinkers: people within itinerant communities who travel from
  place to place to mend metal utensils and other home and farm implements. It is from these many dif-
  ferent lenses that I reflect on my past and present cultural and ethnic identities and values and explore
  my future possibilities.

  I am one of the first in my families' direct line to receive advanced degrees, even though my speaking,
  writing, and explorations sometimes haven't fit within expected norms and practices. I also reflect on
  my identity as a white, cisgender, heterosexual male scholar working at a higher education institution
  in the United States. Through this, I have great privilege that arises in significant ways through the
  arrival of the first European settlers on the shores of this continent centuries ago and the introduction
  of a culture in which the relative worth of whites has been placed above all others.1

  In this self-reflection, I come to see myself as a person born into and thereby inheriting many different
  socio-cultural-historical components. I am a first-generation German American; I am ethnically a Ger-
  man Christian socialist pacifist who also has disturbing, close links to Nazism and who inherits the
  centuries-long embeddedness of American white supremacy. But in addition, I also see myself as a
  person further shaped by my ongoing interactions with family, neighbors, schoolmates, the broader
  community, and more as my sphere of influence continued to evolve. Importantly, while much of this
  shaping comes from those whose socio-cultural-historical components are similar to mine, at times,
  whether through chance or through choice, abductive leaps in my development have occurred through
  associations with groups different from me.

  In "Whose Culture has Capital?" Tara Yosso brings forward the essential importance of focusing on
  and learning from "the array of cultural knowledge, skills, abilities and contacts possessed by socially
  marginalized groups that often go unrecognized and unacknowledged" brought forward by communi-
  ties of color. In this context, she states that:

  http://www.racialequityresourceguide.org, 7.
                                                                                                                            4A: Sharing Our Counterstories 238

        Culture refers to behaviors and values that are learned, shared, and exhibited by a group of
        people. Culture is also evidenced in material and nonmaterial productions of people.2

        Community cultural wealth is an array of knowledge, skills, abilities and contacts possessed
        and utilized by Communities of Color to survive and resist macro and micro-forms of
        oppression.3

        Tara J. Yosso, "Whose Culture Has Capital? A Critical Race Theory Discussion of Commu-
        nity Cultural Wealth"

  My own cultural influences have come in conflict with the dominant systems within which I have been
  shaped over my personal lifespan. But it is also true that I sometimes, and perhaps often, fit into these
  dominant systems specifically because of my white, cisgender, heterosexual male identity. And some-
  times I fit in because I have taken on as part of my practice the dominant systems. And sometimes,
  perhaps even often, I inculcate the practices of those dominant systems into my students and into my
  socio-technical artifacts. Rather than focusing on and learning from socially marginalized groups, I
  emphasize dominant narratives, structures, artifacts, and systems.

  Yet, I also continue to consider the ways my culture and ethnic identity matches that of my family
  -- who often de-emphasized income and wealth accumulation and instead emphasized the broader
  community cultural wealth within Yosso's model, which includes aspirational, familial, social, naviga-
  tional, resistant, linguistic, and cultural capital.

  In what ways do the pedagogy of this textbook and the hands-on exercises therein serve the goal of
  education "to `fit' students constructed as `other' by virtue of their race/ethnicity, language, or social
  class into a hierarchical structure that is defined as a meritocracy," as so effectively highlighted by Glo-
  ria Ladson-Billings in her seminal article "Toward a Theory of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy"?4

  The Blue Unit has sought to introduce the essential skills needed in support of the data-to-information

  ming logic that have brought us to this point within the socio-technical artifacts of our daily lives, and
  the methodological landscape we can use to decodify the dominant understandings of these artifacts.
  Now the question turns to ways we can "systematically include student culture in the classroom as
  authorized or official knowledge," leading to recodification of the essential defining terms and skills of
  our everyday technologies.5 To do so, we need to continuously research the self, research the self in
  relation to others, join in engaged reflection and representation, and shift from self to system. These

four key points constitute the framework brought forward by H. Richard Milner IV in the article "Race,
Culture, and Researcher Positionality."

And directly as related to this session of the book, these four key points hopefully provide a means by
which we can question anew our own counterstories.

The essential resources listed below have been an active part of my more recent works to structure
my own courses and structure the layout of this textbook. My personal reflections at the start of this
chapter are not placed in this section to defend or justify the works of the Blue Unit, or of the text-
book more generally. Rather, I bring them forward as a hopefully useful example of an individual's
self-reflection and location within a unique, interdependent system of cultures and ethnicities. This
system influences my participation in, and attempts to counter, the webs of oppression which discrim-
inate against and disadvantage certain races, classes, and genders over others. And it seeks to prompt
a guiding question for the remainder of this unit: how can we, as a community of practice, work to
further design and prototype our work in ways that allow us as professionals to counter the normative
webs of oppression around us as we move forward?

Lesson Plan

As you work in our hands-on exercises, consider the influencing factors shaping the information sys-
tem you create. MakeCode, the capacitive touch sensors and the momentary switch buttons of the
Circuit Playground Express come together to collect inputs and determine audio outputs. These inputs
can even be stored to track requests. Why is this information system the primary technical exercise
for the Blue Unit? What cultural and pedagogical factors might have shaped the design of this unit?
For the advancement of what capital? In what ways is the design of these coding exercises helping or
hindering the advancement of the core learning outcome objectives for this unit? Why?

Technical Overview

We've slowly been working towards creating a digital Little Free Library extension to the wonderful
analog Little Free Libraries we find in many neighborhoods. Microcontrollers like the Circuit Play-
ground Express provide a range of sensors and indicators that can be very useful to communicate back
and forth with Little Free Library patrons. Microcomputers like the Raspberry Pi, on the other hand,
serve as an e-library stacks, library catalog, chat room, and much more. Together, these can be hid-
den away in a toolbox and run with an extension cord or solar panel and battery pack. For now, our
goal is to bring the Circuit Playground Express and Raspberry Pi together. We will set up the Circuit
Playground Express to communicate through serial connection with the Raspberry Pi, and the Rasp-
berry Pi to play MP3 audio recordings through its audio jack. In this exercise, we will begin to explore
the possible relationships between a single-purpose computer, such as the Circuit Playground Express,
and a multi-purpose computer, such as the Raspberry Pi.

Data Communications Between Devices

The Raspberry Pi, like many microcomputers and microcontrollers, provides pins to which you can
attach transmit and receive wires to connect with personal computers. In this way, even if there is no
network or keyboard, mouse, and monitor to provide access to one of these devices, a simple USB to
serial cable can be used to configure, diagnose, or perform regular tasks on it. Many operating systems,
such as the Raspberry Pi OS, also provide a control window to output and input text from and to the
device through this serial interface.

A note on the technical terms Master and Slave:
         · Historically, the technologists who developed these data communication tools used the
            term Master to indicate the controlling device and Slave to indicate devices being con-
            trolled by that device. I follow the lead of Python developers who, moving forward, are
            using the terms Parent and Worker, respectively. These changes within Python coding
            were made in November 2018, after heated discussion launched by a change request sub-
            mitted in September 2018 by Victor Stinner, a developer with the software company Red
            Hat.1

         · Other programming languages have implemented similar changes. Drupal uses the term
            replica to replace slave and primary to replace master. As another example, Django has
            moved to follower and leader.

         · The terms still largely used within engineering and computer science remain slave and
            master. In discussions regarding these change requests, many argued that these common
            terms are used to refer to the operation of technology independent of, or at the direction of,
            another technology with no reference to human slavery. They argue that because there is
            no common replacement that could easily be made given the existing labels on electronics
            and in code back many decades, it is important to stay with the stock terminology.

         · As you read through this document and look at abbreviations listed on your electronics and
            in code, note that sometimes the listed abbreviations -- for instance MISO, below -- do not
            align with written descriptions in this text -- Parent In/Worker Out.

Communications between devices takes many shapes and forms using a range of protocols. Three of
the most commonly used are:

         · I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit and pronounced I-squared-C) was developed in the
            early 1980s and is widely used to connect lower-speed peripheral integrated circuits to
            microprocessors and microcomputers using the bus topology (think of a physical bus you
            ride to travel with others between locations). It is designed to work over relatively short
            distances, and allows multiple "worker" integrated circuits to communicate with one or

1. Daniel Oberhaus, "`Master/Slave' Terminology Was Removed from Python Programming Language," Vice, September 13,
  2018. https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8x7akv/masterslave-terminology-was-removed-from-python-programming-lan-
  guage.
243 4B: Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library

            more "parent" integrated circuits. I2C only requires two wires and can support up to 1008
            worker devices. It can also support multiple parent devices, allowing for more than one par-
            ent to communicate with all devices on the bus.
         · SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is another widely used bus topology protocol used to
            send data between peripherals and microcontrollers/microcomputers. What is unique about
            SPI is that it uses a serial clock in addition to a MOSI (parent out, worker in) data line and a
            MISO (parent in, worker out) data line. The serial clock's oscillating signal allows for data
            communications to occur synchronously. As with I2C, multiple workers can connect to a
            single parent. To accomplish this, a fourth line, SS or Worker Select, alerts a particular
            worker that it should wake up and send and/or receive data, as well as to detect that multi-
            ple workers are present.
         · UART (Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit) interfaces: UART is actually a
            microprocessor with a package of integrated circuits on a printed circuit board, along
            with program logic, and is used to attach serial devices to a computer. This allows the com-
            puter and attached devices to "talk" and exchange data. There is a range of USB (Universal
            Serial Bus) TTL (Transistor Transistor Logic) serial cables used to provide connections
            between USB and serial UART devices. For our purposes, UART is the simplest and a very
            effective strategy for basic work in the console window of the Raspberry Pi using a per-
            sonal computer.

Exercise: The Circuit Playground Express Meets the Raspberry Pi

In the first three technical session chapters, we've explored MakeCode and configured our Circuit
Playground Express microcontroller, eventually working to create our own functions. In this session,
we'll bring together the microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi microcomputer to allow us to use the
"trumpet valves" to play selected counterstories saved on the Raspberry Pi. To do this, we'll use the
UART serial communications pins found on the Circuit Playground Express and the UART Python
extension on the Raspberry Pi to transmit valve press sensor data from the Circuit Playground Express
to the Raspberry Pi, and to then assess this data to choose which of the available MP3 counterstories
to play using the audio output of the Raspberry Pi.

We'll accomplish this in three steps:

STEP 1: Set up the Raspberry Pi to store and play counterstories using the VLC free and open-source,
cross-platform multimedia player. This may have already been done previously, as it is an exercise
within the Orange Unit.

STEP 2: Set up your Circuit Playground Express. The Toolbox Trumpet will now be expanded to use
components of the MakeCode Serial UART Communications Extension to transfer capacitive touch
and momentary switch data to the Raspberry Pi to play counterstories based on sensor inputs.
                                                                                                   4B: Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library 244

STEP 3: Use the Toolbox Trumpet to play short counterstories (no momentary switches pressed), intro-
ductions to the counterstories (left switch pressed), and extended counterstories (right switch pressed).
A simple Python-based program has been included to test out the Circuit Playground Express, the USB
to TTL serial cable, and the Raspberry Pi as a media center.

To work through these steps, it is now time to bring together the technical activities with the social
activities. Work through these in pairs. Or perhaps before doing these activities in pairs, join in a com-
munity of practice to consider ways to approach this within a diversity of community cultural wealths
that are present. This is to be a work not of doing alone, but of being present within the space, with the
people in this room. The book Emergent Strategy highlights several principles relevant in considering
technical activities within a community of practice, and a community of practice as something that is
completed through being present rather than as driven-doing acts. These include:

      There is always enough time for the right work.

      There is a conversation in the room that only these people at this moment can have. Find it.
      Never a failure, always a lesson.

How can the following be accomplished in such a way that the community cultural wealth of all pre-
sent are advanced as part of taking on these activities collaboratively?

How can this be part of a larger task of advancing a counterstory regarding sociotechnical innovation-
in-use?

Step 1: Transfer MP3 Files to the Raspberry Pi

If you haven't been using the Raspberry Pi since the end of the Orange Unit, it might be helpful to
review Orange Unit 4B: Meet the Microcomputer, including videos found within the chapter, and Exer-
cises found in Orange Unit 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi.

         · If you need help using RealVNC (Virtual Network Computing) on your laptop to serve as
            the keyboard, mouse, and monitor interface with the Raspberry Pi, review the later steps in
            the Exercise: First Boot of the Raspberry Pi OS.

         · If you are now connected to a different Local Area Network (LAN), you'll need to connect
            the Raspberry Pi to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor temporarily to get it to connect to that
            network. If you have problems getting the monitor to serve as a screen for the Raspberry Pi
            in this new location, you'll find FAIL FORWARD Tips in the Exercise: First Boot of the
            Raspberry Pi OS.

         · If you need help using the PiOLED to identify the IP address so that you can reconnect the
            VNC View on your laptop to the VNC server on your Raspberry Pi, review Exercise:
245 4B: Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library

            Adding an Adafruit PiOLED Text Display.

With the Raspberry Pi up and running, the first step is to set up a folder called "cstories" in the home
directory of your Raspberry Pi, containing your counterstory MP3 files. You may have completed this
step as part of the Orange Unit. If not, jump to Coding Electronics. In the steps below, we'll continue
working with this folder.

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mkdir cstories                      cStory1-intro.mp3
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd cstories
pi@raspberrypi:~/cstories $ ls

   cStory1.mp3 cStory1-extended.mp3
pi@raspberrypi:~/cstories $

Transferring files from your laptop or other source will depend on a number of factors. For many,
the File Transfer toolbar button in the VNC Viewer dropdown window has worked exceptionally well
when VNC Viewer on your laptop is connected to the VNC server on the Raspberry Pi.2 Others have
saved files in a central course Learning Management System (LMS) or "Cloud" storage space such as
Box. These files can then be downloaded to the Raspberry Pi using the Chromium web browser prein-
stalled within the Raspberry Pi OS. For those familiar with the Linux command line, another way is to
make use of the SCP command.

However you do this, make sure to transfer your .mp3 counterstories to the /home/pi/cstories subdi-
rectory.

NOTE regarding the naming of your counterstory files:
         · The prefix of your counterstory files should be "cStory", where lower and upper cases do
            matter, as Unix and Linux-based operating systems are case-sensitive. The applica-
            tions and Python code we run later will use a matching case-sensitive naming structure.

         · Next, add a number between 1 and 7, with 1 being the first story told when the A1 is
            pressed on the Circuit Playground Express, and 2 being the second story told when the A2
            is pressed, etc.

         · The postfix of the filename is .mp3. For the two- to three-minute main part of the story, for
            the first counterstory to be told, you would now see the name:

cStory1.mp3

· If it is the short introduction to the story, add a -intro between the story number and the
   postfix. The name of the introduction to the first story would thus be:

2. The instructions for enabling the VNC Server Interface on the Raspberry Pi and for setting up the VNC Viewer on your
  laptop can be found starting at STEP 5 of the Exercise: First Boot of the Raspberry Pi OS in Orange Unit 4C: Getting
  Started with the Raspberry Pi
                      4B: Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library 246

cStory1-intro.mp3

· If it is the part providing the listener with further information, add a -extended between the
   story number and the postfix. The name of the additional information on the first story
   would thus be:

cStory1-extended.mp3

A quick way to test this out is by playing your MP3 file using the VLC media player, which runs either
as a graphical display (VLC) or as a command-line program (CVLC), which is what we'll run from a
terminal window:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd cstories
pi@raspberrypi:~/cstories $ cvlc cStory1.mp3 vlc://quit

FAIL FORWARD TIP: You may need to right-click on the Volume control icon at the upper right of
the Raspberry Pi menu. Doing so will show you the available audio ports, by default "AV Jack" and
"HDMI." Plugging in a USB Headset or some speakers will add further options, from which you can
hear the story currently being played by CVLC. Be sure to choose the right option for the media player
you are wanting to use.

Step 2: Set Up Your Circuit Playground Express

On your laptop, make the following update to the Circuit Playground Express so that it can work with
the Raspberry Pi to play counterstories:

        2. Download the 4-Octave Trumpet Counterstory UART Prototype for the Circuit Playground
            Express: https://go.illinois.edu/CPE_4OctavePlusUART

        3. Review the new conditional that has been added to the MakeCode, building from the previ-
            ous Toolbox Trumpet 4 Octave exercise. In this case, we now do a serial write of data
            whenever the capacitive touch sensor count is greater than zero. This is possible because
            within the Advanced section, we've taken a serial redirect Configuration block and added
            that to the On Start function. (NOTE: The first time it is used, you need to go into +EXTEN-
            SIONS to find Serial. From then on, it will be located directly within Advanced.)

        4. Connect the Circuit Playground Express to your laptop via the microUSB to USB cable and
            flash the new UF2 to your Circuit Playground Express.

        5. Note that you now need to move the off/on switch on the Circuit Playground Express to on
            to hear the audio playback of the trumpet. Turn this on and double-check that you can still
            play the notes.

        6. Disconnect the microUSB to USB cable.
   247 4B: Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library

 Step 3: Use the Toolbox Trumpet to Play Your MP3 Files

  Now let's connect up your Raspberry Pi to your Circuit Playground Express using a USB to TTL
  cable and some male to alligator clips. You will now provide power to the Circuit Playground Express
  directly from the Raspberry Pi via the USB port, by connecting the red TTL wire to the VOUT on the
  Circuit Playground Express using a fourth male to alligator clip wire. In this way, one power source
  directly attached to the Raspberry Pi is all that is needed to run the whole digital Little Free Library!
  NOTE: Do not connect the red wire to VOUT power if your Circuit Playground Express is getting
  power from another source, such as your laptop.3

          1. Use three or four male to alligator clip wires to connect the TTL side of a TTL/USB Serial
              Cable to the Circuit Playground Express microcontroller:
                        Black wire to ground (GND)
                        Red wire to power (VOUT) (do NOT connect if Circuit Playground Express is get-
                          ting power from another source, such as your laptop)
                        White wire to transmit (TX)
                        Green wire to receive (RX)

2. Plug the USB side of the second serial cable to one of the four USB ports on the Raspberry
    Pi. Any one of these should work OK. You should see the Circuit Playground Express green
    power light go on. If not, a few tests can include:
              Confirm that there is power on the Raspberry Pi and that it is not in the boot-up
                phase.
              Check to see if the cable USB is fully pressed into the USB port of the Raspberry
                Pi.
              Try using a different USB port on the Raspberry Pi.
              Confirm that the GND and VOUT pins are properly connected to the red and
                black wires on the TTL/USB serial cable.

3. From a web browser, enter: https://go.illinois.edu/cstories
              Take a glance at the code, but most importantly, right-click in the window to
                download the program as cstories.py (not as cstories.txt as automatically
                listed).
                          Make sure to move cstories.py to the /home/pi/Code/Python directory,
              You can download the Python code in several ways:
                          Directly from the Raspberry Pi's Graphical User Interface, using a web
                            browser on the Raspberry Pi.
                          By downloading it to your laptop's cstories folder, and then transferring
                            the file using the USB to TTL serial console connection.
                          By downloading it to your laptop's cstories folder, and then transferring
                            the file using SSH/SCP (secure shell and secure copy) in a terminal
                            (Mac) or PowerShell (Windows 10) window. For this approach, first
                            identify the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. Jump to Network Trou-
                            bleshooting for instructions. Visit Introducing the Unix Command
                            Line for details on using SSH/SCP.
              The cstories.py code does an import of two libraries with supplemental code: one
                library for serial communications, which we'll use to communicate with the tty to
                UART cable, and the second for the VLC library of commands. The serial library
                comes pre-installed, but we now need to install the VLC library using pip3:

                pi@raspberrypi:~ $pip3 install python-vlc

              If you have more than one cstory with intro, main, and extended files, open csto-
                ries.py with Thonny or the graphical editor mousepad to edit the Python code.
                Change the variable "numStories" from 1 to the number of cstories now on the
                Raspberry Pi.

                      In Thonny, you can click on the Run icon. Look in the Shell window in the bottom
                        half of Thonny to see the output that would normally go to a terminal window.
                      In the terminal window, type the following, and then touch the different Toolbox
                        Trumpet valves to see if you can hear a story being read to you:

                                  To exit the Python command output, provide a keyboard interrupt by
                                    holding down the Control (that is, CTRL or ^) key, and then hitting the
                                    "c" key.

FAIL FORWARD TIPS:
         · Sometimes, the connection of the USB/TTL Serial Cable from the Circuit Playground
            Express to the Raspberry Pi may have changed. In the terminal window on the Raspberry
            Pi, type:

       pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls /dev/ttyUSB*

       Note the result. If nothing is listed, then the USB/TTL Serial Cable may not be connected. Other-
       wise, compare the returned value(s) with the one listed in the "uart" variable within the csto-
       ries.py code. The best way to do this is by using nano. If the value returned from the "ls"
       command is different from that listed in "uart = serial.Serial," then change the number accord-
       ingly in the Python code, save, and retest.
         · The cstories.py code does not have a way to cut short the playing of a selected story. The

            VLC player also can handle the playing of multiple stories by default. Stop the cstories.py
            prototype to end the telling of one story early, and restart the Python program again to
            start a new story with the A1, A2, and A4 key combinations, along with Button A or Button
            B as needed.

From Here

If you'll be jumping in and out of your Raspberry Pi periodically, feel encouraged to leave it powered
on, just as you would any server. Exit VNC Viewer or close out of your ssh connection to the Raspberry
Pi by hitting ^D (that is, holding down the Control key and hitting the `d' key), or by typing logout.
Either way, you should see the following window display at the end, making it possible for you to
reconnect via VNC or SSH back in via Terminal or PuTTY whenever you need to.

Wrap Up

The primary objective of the Blue Unit is to bring together our microcontroller and microcomputer
systems as a means of sharing data between devices, thereby creating a basic physical network. That
is, we've worked to create a digital networked information system. Together, we can advance a range
of technical skills in addition to a number of cognitive and socio-emotional skills to help your commu-
nity of practice use a growth mindset to build these multi-layered systems.

Do Something New!

Entering into this final stage putting together a Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library, there
have been a range of expertise and community cultural wealth brought into the activities as a team.
For some, strengths may especially be in the computer programming front. For others, you may bring
with you a background within issues of social justice. Consider also the diverse lived experiences, cul-
tures, and other influences that have shaped your selection of a story that you have turned into one
you would tell through this sociotechnical system.

         · How might you now work together to create a series of seven stories selected to especially
            speak to a special audience?

         · Which would play with A1, that is cStory1?
                      A2, that is cStory2?
                      A1 + A2, that is cStory3?
                      A4, that is cStory4??
                      A1 + A4, that is cStory5?
                      A2 + A4, that is cStory6?
                      A1 + A2 + A4, that is cStory7?

         · What would play if someone simultaneously pressed both Button A & B? How might this
            be used as a secret "Easter Egg" part of the story (Easter Egg is a gaming metaphor for a
            hidden aspect).
251 4B: Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library

The exercises have stepped you through the sharing of this story through integration of the Circuit
Playground Express UF2 code and the Raspberry Pi Python code. The Python code itself provides
opportunities to share between 1 and 7 different stories headless, that is without a monitor. But as we
learned in Orange Unit 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi, Python also has a library file to
work with a the PiOLED we've been using to identify the IP address assigned to the Raspberry Pi.

         · How might you reuse the PiOLED to instead indicate a list of stories and to share which
            story is currently being played?

         · Are there ways we could use a small, low-powered monitor attached to the Raspberry as
            part of a portable Little Free Library to indicate a list of stories and to share which story is
            currently being played?

As you explore this Do Something New! be sure to use the various strengths of your team, and seek to
bring in other expertise as possible, to investigate and prototype these possibilities of a sociotechni-
cal system to share seven strategically selected critical social justice stories within a person-oriented
social perspective.

  This "real life" hands-on project by four information science graduate students provides a step-by-step
  example of ideation and iteration of code to support counterstories.

 The Process: Inspiration and Ideation

  As a group of four current and future educators, we knew we wanted to focus on one person, whose
  story is not well known in the history of technology, and we wanted the game to be fun and accessible
  for late elementary students. We were particularly interested in inspiring young girls because women,
  as a whole, are a group that is underrepresented in technological fields. Often when children are taught
  the history of technology, women who have contributed to the field are left out. We hoped that by
  creating a game that was fun and accessible for late elementary students young girls who were inter-
  ested in technology would be inspired to learn, create and change the way women are represented in
  technology fields.

  From this initial spark of inspiration, we quickly moved into the ideation phase. Fueled by the recent
  release of the picture book Grace Hopper: Queen of Computer Code by Laurie Wallmark, the group
  chose to focus on Grace Hopper. Much of the initial debate focused on whether or not Grace Hopper's
  story was truly a counter-story. However, we decided that since none of us--four educated women,
  who work with children and technology--had heard of her, her story did indeed meet the requirements
  of a counter-story.

  Then, the group member who had by far the most experience coding with Scratch, suggested using a
  maze with scrambled letters to decode.1 This seemed both feasible technically for us and fun and acces-
  sible for our target audience. We decided we wanted to have multiple levels of the game, each telling a
  different story about Hopper's life. We were especially enthused about telling the story of Hopper

                                                           girls to see themselves in the mainstream history
                                                           of technology, and in the terms and code we use
                                                           today. We also discussed possible stories for the
                                                           other levels, and some of Hopper's more pithy

                                                           game [See Image 1].

                                                           The Process: Iteration

In an early iteration, we planned to include three
mazes. However since one of the reasons we
were taking the course was to improve our tech-
nical skills, we decided it would be ideal if all
four members of the group gained experience in
Scratch. So, we decided early on that the best
course of action would be to have each group
member individually code a level of the game.

Early in the design process, one team member's
letter blocks didn't work when other team mem-
ber's played the game. Through some pair pro-
gramming over email and on Blackboard Image 2: The backdrop and sprites in place for beginning the
Collaborate, we realized the problem was she Level 2 Maze.
used separate sprites as blocks and letters, where
as the rest of us used different costumes. We were able to fix this "bug" much more quickly working
as a team than one of us could have as an individual.

In another iteration, we started adding more content to each level in order to give children as much
information about Grace Hopper as we could. We wanted to make sure our game was person-oriented
rather than thing-oriented. After testing this prototype, a couple of the members of our group that
work with children in a primary setting stated that the extra information caused a lot of visual clut-
ter on the screen that would make it less accessible to some students-for example, those with visual
                                                                                             REMIX: Ideating and Iterating Code: Scratch Example 258

deficits or those who are easily distracted. So in the interest of keeping our counter-story as tailored
to our audience as possible, we decided to get rid of the extra information on each individual level and
instead streamline the information into one backdrop at the end of the game. The slide also provided
links to more information. This approach would provide the best experience for children of all abilities,
and those students who were inspired by Grace's story could easily continue to learn more about her.

                 Image 3: Set of costumes for the decoy balloons.

One of the members of our team worked in an elementary school library that serves Kindergarten
through fifth grade students. In order to get feedback from our target audience, she took our prototype
in and asked two fifth grade students to test it out. The students identified two areas of concern. In one
level, after all the letters are revealed and the Grace sprite gets to the end of the maze, the question
mistakenly covered all of the letters. Based on this feedback, the team was easily able to change the
location of the letters, to allow for them to be seen during the question phase.
259 REMIX: Ideating and Iterating Code: Scratch Example

The second issue the students found was a big-
ger one: if the mouse pointer touched Grace in
levels 2-4, she would return to level 1. This glitch
made it impossible to finish the game. Through
paired programming, we determined that the
issue was in one of the initial sequencing codes,
specifically, the code that starts the game. Basi-
cally, the code was telling the computer every
time Grace is clicked to restart at level 1, which
is not what we wanted. It took some time to fig-
ure out how to fix this, but eventually, we dis-
covered that by simply adding a stop script control to that particular sequence, we were able Image 4: End screen with link to further information.
to "debug" our game. Without rapid prototyping
our game and asking students to play it, we would not have found these errors nearly as quickly. The
students' feedback was critical to the next iteration of our game.

                                           Image 5: First iteration of code. This caused the
                                           Grace sprite to return to Level 1 whenever she
                                           was clicked with the mouse.

                                           Image 6: Second iteration of this line of code.
                                           This allows for the sprite to only complete this
                                           set of instructions once.

The Process: Mutual Shaping and Teamwork

Our group had a lot of shared social factors since we are all current and aspiring educators. We were
inspired by our backgrounds working with children in a school setting, and we wanted to create a
                                                                                             REMIX: Ideating and Iterating Code: Scratch Example 260

game we could use with our own students. Our backgrounds influenced us to style the game as a series
of mazes to be more fun and appealing to children. Our backgrounds also determined the level of the
content; we wanted to teach players about Grace Hopper in a way that would be understandable and
also make them realize they too have the capacity to learn and create technology.
Despite the similarity of our backgrounds, we had different strengths and weaknesses. We were able to
leverage each team member's strengths by using pair and triplet programming, thorough communica-
tion, and taking on specific team roles. As discussed previously, pair and triplet programming helped
us to "debug" our game much more quickly than we could have individually. Initially, each team mem-
ber worked alone on their level, but almost right away we encountered issues with the letter sprites. If
one member of the team tried to program a letter sprite, it moved in other level. Through paired pro-
gramming, we realized that we needed different sprites for each level and that we had to rename those
sprites right away with the specific levels name to avoid confusion. Each sprite needed to be coded
separately and each sprite needed to have its own costume, i.e. balloon.

                            Image 7. This game required the use of 21 sprites. Each with individual
                            coding.

Another aspect of our teamwork that made us successful was the unofficial roles that each member
of our team took on. One member of the group took on a project manager role, taking meeting notes,
scheduling weekly meetings, and sending out action items for each group member. Another person
took on the task of managing the written portion of the project and recorded the group's progress
261 REMIX: Ideating and Iterating Code: Scratch Example

throughout the design thinking process. The person with the most Scratch experience researched ways
to code the maze backgrounds. The final person's job was to be the final editor. She carefully walked
through all of the programming and located any errors in the programming that required attention,
and put the finishing touches on the introduction and conclusion screens of the game.

Although we naturally fell into these roles that fit our own personal strengths and weaknesses, we
also were flexible working as a team. If the Scratch expert hit an obstacle with Scratch, we would all
work on the problem together. If the project manager couldn't make it to one of the meetings, another
group member took notes and scheduled the next meeting.

After the desk critique with Martin, Martin was concerned that we were just "telling" a story. He
questioned our motivation in choosing Grace Hooper as our counter-story and challenged us to think
deeper. After much discussion, the group really focused in on using Grace's story to inspire and chal-
lenge young girls into STEM fields. As with any teaching tool, it is critical to provide context to the
game. We felt strongly that this could be a launching off point for students, especially girls, to cre-
ate their own games or do their own research into concealed stories in technology. Futhermore, just
the fact of seeing that a woman is the reason we are coding in English instead of 1's and 0's is pretty
incredible. Our hope was that young girls could see that what we are doing with computers today
wasn't just because of the Bill Gates and the Steve Jobs of the world, but because of the Grace Hoppers
of the world, as well.

At the first in-class peer critique, each member of the group had to present the team' idea. One of the
big feedback items we all received was to simplify the word choices for our unscramble. We had ini-
tially chosen very specific words from Grace's life, losing site of the fact that our primary audience
was elementary students. For example, initially one of the unscrambles was "Waves", which was the
women's branch of the Navy that Grace joined. Elementary students would likely not be familiar with
Waves, so we opted to change the unscramble answer to "Navy, making the game more accessible for
young students.

After the second class peer critique, we changed the coding to slow down the text throughout the
game, giving players more time to read the words. Again, we felt this was a positive change to our
prototype making it more accessible overall.

The Process: Computational Thinking

We decided to use programming that we learned in class to not over-complicate the assignment. Using
the push buttons that we set up in Chapter 1 of the guidebook allowed us to focus on finding an inno-
vative and fun way to tell Grace's story and engage our young audience. Early on, we decided not to
use the touch and motion sensors because they did not add to the story we were trying to tell. We
would just be including them for the sake of adding more "cool" tech stuff.
                                                                                             REMIX: Ideating and Iterating Code: Scratch Example 262

By the time we created our final iteration of the game, we had incorporated all five of the computa-
tional thinking terms into the programming. Below are examples of the how we incorporated the five
elements into our final product.
Sequence: In order to make our game user-friendly, we wanted our game to be easy for students to
understand how to play. We wanted even the youngest of players to be able to play the game without
a teacher or adult having to explain it. The game, quite simply, had to explain itself. We accomplished
this goal by using sequencing to give players a set of "instructions" when they start the game. When
the backdrop switches to "Instructions," the Grace sprite appears then goes to a specific location and
says a series of statements, including basic directions, that start the game.

Iteration: We incorporated iteration into our programming in order to make the balloons react to
Grace touching them, transform to a clue letter and fly up to the corner of the screen. Specifically, we
used the forever block so that these actions would continue again and again.
263 REMIX: Ideating and Iterating Code: Scratch Example

Conditionals: We wanted players to be able to progress through the different levels of the game. Cre-
ating conditionals allowed us to tell the computer that if the player gets the answer right, then open
up the next level. If the player gets the answer wrong, then ask them to try again. We accomplished
this leveling up function by using the if/then blocks in Scratch.

Variables: Using data blocks, we created correct answer variables. This allowed players to move for-
ward through the game based on those variables. Variables were essential in creating a multi-level
game platform.
                                                                                             REMIX: Ideating and Iterating Code: Scratch Example 264

Modularization: We knew that we wanted players to have to answer questions about Grace, so that
they would gain knowledge about her while playing the game. By using the more blocks function in
scratch, we were able to define questions for each game level.

Conclusion: Continued Mutual Shaping

The work we did in this class continues to shape and influence each member of our team as well as our
instructor and future users of this guidebook. One member of our team has plans to use this project
as the foundation of her work as an elementary school librarian. One of her goals as a practitioner is
to inspire elementary students to design, create, and challenge their thinking by having them work in
groups to research a lesser known individual from history and tell their story through a unique game.
Furthermore, this project, which is based on an earlier version of this guidebook, shaped the version
of the guidebook that you are reading. This iteration of the guidebook will continue to shape future
information scientists, and, in turn, they will continue to shape and refine the contents of this guide-
book.

Rainbow Unit Overview

As we went through the Orange and Blue Units, we dove into essential electronics technology and
computer hardware and software concepts that make up our sociotechnical artifacts and systems.
We've also networked together separate sociotechnical microcontroller and microcomputer artifacts
to create our first networked information system. As we move into the Rainbow Unit, it's time to bring
together the technical, cognitive, socio-emotional, and critical sociotechnical skill sets, frameworks,
and standards we've been advancing within our community of practice into a more holistic under-
standing of networked information systems.

For over a century, professionals in a range of information sciences have sought to use the information
and communications technologies of the day to provide liberating directions for social justice out-
comes for individuals, communities, and society. As the twentieth century came to an end and we
entered the twenty-first, new digital networked information systems emerged, and the information
sciences added to their repertoire digital resource services for libraries, digital humanities, social infor-
matics, community networking, community informatics, digital literacies, citizen science, classification
on the web, information infrastructures for science, human-centered data science, human-AI inter-
action, crisis informatics, trauma and memory studies, digital health, health informatics, critical data
studies, critical archival studies, learning analytics, data analytics, biomedical informatics, everyday
information behavior, data science storytelling, linked data, knowledge organization, management of
data, information, and knowledge, data curation, data visualization, data and text mining, coupling
cognitive systems, natural language processing, mathematical optimization, cultural theory, compu-
tational semantics, game studies, collective leadership, business information, innovation culture lead-
ership, accessible computing, and information law, policy, and inequality. This is but a partial list as
the information sciences continues to explore the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom (DIKW)
realm in full as a broadly interdisciplinary space that also uses multidisciplinary research with many
267 Rainbow Unit: Networks Big and Small

other sciences, from engineering to political science to journalism to education to African American
and African studies to women and gender studies and beyond.

There has been a significant tension, though, between user-centered practices that too easily result in
users being identified as entities completing a task, and a more human-centered, design justice focus
that recognizes the ever-present relationship between design and power, a relationship that is often
used to benefit some over others through the social shaping of information technology artifacts and
systems. And so, here too, it is critical to bring in the voices of the marginalized and oppressed, whose
community cultural wealth and indigenous ways of knowing have been excluded, hidden, and socially
and physically destroyed. Social justice storytelling has been an important start, which this unit works
to expand to ensure that we continue to provide liberating directions for social justice outcomes for
individuals, communities, and society.

In the Rainbow Unit, each session will more closely bring together the technical and the social within
the two chapters of the session to introduce the sociotechnical Internet of Things and smart devices
(session one); the global and community Internet networks (session two); the expansion of historic,
and introduction of new, divides through digitization (session three); and the hope of recovering com-
munity through design justice (session four). The first three sessions will continue to explore core con-
cepts and skills through a more structured set of hands-on technical activities. Networking of data and
information can happen over a range of different networks, as we'll explore. We'll integrate data and
information from the breadboard electronics and Circuit Playground Express with the Raspberry Pi in
new and creative ways. Many of these could instead be integrated with your laptops, or with local or
remote server farms. But in using the Raspberry Pi to demystify digital networked information sys-
tems, we will hopefully also demystify the sociotechnical networked information systems in ways that
open the potential for more just pathways in your future professional endeavors as an information sci-
entist. This will especially be brought forward in session four, as we explore issues of design for justice
in the information sciences.

Today, networked information systems bring together the rich, lived, analog realm that has evolved
over millennia with the digital technologies that have developed over the last decade. These continue
to include the still-relevant Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit (UART) serial communications
protocol we've used in previous exercises of the textbook, and related protocols like Inter-Integrated
Circuit (I²C) and Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). In addition, as dialup bulletin-board systems and
commercial online services entered the scene in the 1980s, central servers began to provide informa-
tion and communication services to larger communities. In some cases, these systems came together to
form larger internetworks using more open models. One serial communication protocol that emerged
at this time was the peer-to-peer protocol. Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications are not just used to facili-
tate communication between two peers passing data back and forth, such as our Circuit Playground
Express microcontroller and our Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Some peer-to-peer applications are set
up for home file and multimedia sharing, while others make use of the Internet to extend peer-to-peer
connections globally, often using a "store-and-forward" principle in which data is first stored at a peer
                                                                                                               Rainbow Unit: Networks Big and Small 268

hop in its journey before being forwarded to the next peer. BitTorrent is a widely used peer-to-peer
file-sharing software, while Bitcoin is a well-known peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, with many emerging
mobile peer-to-peer payment services coming to market using Bitcoin's underlying blockchain tech-
nology.

Another space in which peer-to-peer protocols have emerged is within the "Internet of Things" space,
and this is where we'll start in session one of the Rainbow Unit as we also gain a first view of the
underlying Internet Protocol (IP). But as we'll also explore within this session, too often, Internet of
Things devices are actually simplified programmed devices that use a centralized command and con-
trol. This shaping of the sociotechnical "IoT" devices reduces or removes design and the advancement
of power that should be centered within the individual and with the community of which the individ-
ual is part. The constant tension regarding whose design has been used, and whose power has influ-
enced these decisions, have moved forward within the digital realm on a path that centers around
extractive economic and societal dominance, something we'll especially explore in session two regard-
ing the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol.

The majority of Internet services used today, including many "smart" sensors, controllers, and com-
munications devices, still function using the client-server architecture. While in peer-to-peer architec-
ture, each device on an IP network is equally privileged so that tasks and workloads can be distributed
among peers, within a client-server architecture, specific nodes play a centralized role as servers.
The server provides services and resources upon request from individual client nodes, often through
front-end applications that interact with the human users of the application. The open standards and
protocols of the Internet are systems agnostic, and thus peer-to-peer and client-server technologies
can work well together using a range of different internetworking platforms. However, today, we are
shaped in a wide range of ways to consider the server as the essential information and communi-
cation thing floating up there in the cloud, from which we are the fortunate recipient and through
which we can be transformed. But servers are always local devices, and the cloud is often just a bank
of servers within local networks owned by corporations. It remains that the local networks on which
servers are housed can be anywhere. And while there is considerable value in locating our core email,
video streaming, and social media services within a Microsoft or Amazon or Google cloud located
within regional server banks, there remains significant value in more localized community networks
and decentralized Internet of Things devices, a concept we'll explore throughout sessions one and two
as we configure our Raspberry Pi as a local "web server" using two different strategies. Together, ses-
sions one and two are works seeking to guide us beyond the dominant, neoliberal "American dream" of
digital technological determinism, radical individualism, and supply-side, free-market capitalism that
has especially emerged since the 1990s.

As we move into session three of the Rainbow Unit, we'll explore how the technological determinism
that embeds our digital "thing-orientation" works both intentionally and unintentionally to extend the
historic racial and cultural divides into the digital realm. A name that has stuck in this regard is the
"digital divide," which is especially framed as "a national crisis of competitiveness, defined as a human
   269 Rainbow Unit: Networks Big and Small

  capital deficit and resolved through public-private partnerships for access extensions."1 The breadth of
  socially driven divides is instead turned exclusively into a technical one. The challenge is to shift focus
  towards both digital inclusion and also digital equity, in recognition that today's digital technology
  "is a necessary tool for civic and cultural participation, employment, lifelong learning, and access to
  essential services."2

  Our digital information and communication technologies arise through a range of design principles
  and processes that merge social and technical considerations. Within digital inclusion, affordable,
  robust Internet service provision is an essential first element, but it is something that has especially
  been influenced through monopoly power within the United States, something we'll especially high-
  light as we move further into session three. But internetworking of information systems does not need
  to be this way, something we'll (re)consider throughout sessions three and four of the Rainbow Unit,
  as each learner is encouraged to reflect back and plan forward ways that they can solidify their intro-
  ductory understanding of the core learning objectives through a person-centered, networked informa-
  tion systems adventure. We'll also work to explore the ways in which a design justice framework and
  its underlying emergent strategy principles can be used to advance new pathways for social justice
  practice within the information sciences. The open protocols and standards of the Internet Protocol
  continue to give us considerable freedom of choice. As we conclude the Rainbow Unit, the adven-
  tures are meant to provide a means to test execution of choice, especially as exercised at the local
  premises, neighborhood, and community levels. We'll learn to track down network performance issues
  and rapidly move up the support tier levels to ensure that our Internet service providers give us what
  we pay for with regard to Internet provision. And as we'll see in the Rainbow Unit, not only can we
  build our own local networks and even community networks, we can also build our own web servers,
  and from there could expand to build our own database and communications servers, if we so choose.
  But there are communities and even regions that are stepping up their works to build campus and
  community networks at larger scales, pushing Internet service providers to play more by community
  rules, and not just by corporate rules.

  This is a long journey, but hopefully as we work through the Rainbow Unit, we'll begin to demystify
  the clouds that keep networked information systems within a mist, thereby opening up a visioning of
  the revolution of values that are person-oriented, rather than thing-oriented, as King called us to do
  over forty years ago.

The Mechanical World

I wake up a little before the sun rises. I stand up and stretch, then walk out of the sleeping quarters
and over to the outhouse with composting toilet. It's light enough out now so my kerosene lantern
isn't needed, although it's still a little dark in the outhouse. I start my campfire and 30 minutes later
have some water boiling eggs and making some tea. The morning is first spent feeding and providing
clean water to the chickens and washing clothes in the nearby stream before putting them out to dry.
Then I take some time weeding in the garden while nibbling on the few first strawberries and snow
peas of the season and picking the cold-tolerant spinach and kale greens of the spring garden. Getting
out of the warming midday sun, I head into the woods to forage for mushrooms, ramps, dandelions,
and nettles. Check on the clothes drying, catch a fish from the stream, make dinner over the fire or
inside over the woodburning stove, turn on the lantern to read for a bit, and back to bed I go.

The romance of time in a mechanical world!

While I have and continue to live with a wide range of daily-use electronic devices for lighting, heating
and air conditioning, cooking and cleaning, and the other staples of modern life, I come from a long
family line who also keep a hold on the mechanical side of life in a range of ways. And I have a family
who continues this tradition in our own ways. While we don't live off-grid in a tiny house producing
and preserving all our own food and resources, we continually explore and periodically test ideas from
local rural and urban farmers and foragers.

At the same time, we're a family who uses the Internet to explore resources such as Mother Earth
News and Bryce Langston and Rasa Pescud's Living Big in a Tiny House YouTube Channel to expand
our understanding of the balance between mechanical and electronic, off-grid and on-grid, physical
community and the larger online communities of practice. I'm someone who writes code, designs and
builds electronics, has facilitated setup of a number of local networks and helped explore a couple
community networks, and consulted on Internet choices, while also using a wide range of electronic
and mechanical woodworking tools.

I live in a family and in communities that flex between the both/and of the mechanical and electronic,
of the analog and digital, of the in-person and online.

From Mechanical to Programmable to "Smart"

For purposes of this discussion, we'll consider mechanical devices as those involving pure physical
processing. A common style of toilet within the United States flushes because we push down on a
physical component that adjusts other physical components, thereby allowing water to leave a tank
275 1A: Programmable Electronics, Smart Technology, and the Internet of Things

and flow through the toilet bowl. The water flows in an effective manner to remove liquid and solid
waste through the physical porcelain S-shaped siphon, designed to remove wastes while physically
protecting sewer gas from venting back into the room after the flush cycle has completed. Together,
this represents a classic mechanical technology.

While we continue to make use of a range of mechanical devices as part of our daily lives, we have
increasingly made use of electronic devices as the latter half of the 19th century experienced the
advancement of electrical power generation and the eventual emergence of electrical engineering.
We've moved from the building of wax candles or gas-soaked wicks in lanterns as a source of lighting
to the incandescent light bulb providing an electrical device in which the flow of electricity can
pass through a wire filament embedded within glass. More recently, we've seen the transition from
the incandescent light bulb to light-emitting diode lamps, or LEDs, that use significantly less energy
to achieve equal brightness and with greater longevity. Each of these represent simple non-pro-
grammed circuits.

But it many cases it is possible to expand the circuit to include additional components. The simple LED
circuit can be constructed so as to include the necessary resistors, capacitors, transistors, and photo-
cells such that it automatically dims or brightens depending on the amount of light currently within
the area. This can be designed as a non-programmed circuit, but often is incorporated into a microcon-
troller or microprocessor to control the brightness of the LED based on certain levels of light as sensed
by the photocell. It is now a programmable circuit.

The programmable circuits can become increasingly complex, as when an LED only comes on at the
appropriate brightness based on current light levels when movement is detected via an integrated
motion sensor. It may include built-in switches or touch sensors that can be used to determine whether
to make use of the dimming and/or motion sensing functions of the program. Depending on the tech-
nology being used, it's possible that as we observe our own or others' uses of the technology, our
behaviors are shaped by the choices being made in that use. And it may be that we begin shaping
our choices to further shape behavior. The electronic devices continue on as sociotechnical artifacts.
Over time, the programs running some of our electronic devices were further expanded to incorporate
code that altered the actions of other segments of the code based on previous data collection by that
software. To begin, machine learning code can be combined with a mathematical model using initial
"training data" to create predictive decisions. Over time, machine learning algorithms are set up such
that the software learns from new data in ways that help set up more precise predictions and corre-
sponding actions.

The predictive analytics of machine learning has emerged from the broader exploration known as
artificial intelligence (AI). Programming languages such as LISP started emerging in the late 1950s,
helping to advance the field of AI that was also emerging at the time. As with other programming lan-
guages, AI makes active use of "if-then" Boolean logic statements, or increasingly newer Fuzzy logic
with a continuum between 0 and 1, to create a knowledge base that is then used by an inference engine
                                                                    1A: Programmable Electronics, Smart Technology, and the Internet of Things 276

  to draw deductions. Autonomous devices with software facilitating perception of its environment and
  execution of actions that maximize chances of achieving target goals are formally referred to as intel-
  ligent agents within AI, and popularly as smart devices or technologies today.

        It might be helpful to more quickly review the Blue Unit chapter 2A: The Methodological
        Landscape to more fully consider the Positivist Paradigm within which the deductive logic
        of AI. While essential, work within the Positivist Paradigms, including machine learning
        and AI, are insufficient to investigate the full spectrum of data, information, knowledge,
        and wisdom within the information sciences. It is important to also use inductive reason-
        ing to develop interpretive understandings of complex social phenomena, and a dialectical
        approach to knowledge that enables people to see hidden forms of control, domination and
        oppression. Only in this way is it possible to enable people, and especially those in the mar-
        gins, to seek change and reform existing conditions and social order.

  In their 1997 article, "An Overview of Smart Technology," Goddard, Kemp, and Lane noted that the
  term "smart" for a diverse range of materials, structures, systems and technologies originated in the
  early 1980s, mainly via researchers working in the United States and funded through defense bud-
  gets. It was the reports of "smart" bombs and other "smart" munitions of the Gulf war in newspapers
  and popular science journals that brought about public awareness. From this emerged the fashionable
  use of "smart" technologies as part of industrial applications well beyond the original aerospace and
  defense uses that began in the early 1980s. Thus, while "intelligent agents" were already being devel-
  oped at about the same time as part of various dedicated research groups, these academics "had been
  working on `smart' technologies for several years without realising it!"1

  Intelligent or smart systems include: 1) sensors used to collect associated information on environment,
  condition, or operating history; 2) a trainable control algorithm to read sensor data, draw inferences
  on that data, and alter system characteristics based on these inferences; 3) control hardware intercon-
  necting arrays of sensors, a microprocessor running the algorithmic code, and actuators; 4) the actua-
  tors, or mechanical devices that can move or control something and thereby implement the change in
  configuration based on the control algorithm; and 5) structural members allowing the sociotechnical
  artifact or system of artifacts to perform its primary function.

         For a deeper exploration of machine learning and artificial intelligence, take 11 minutes to watch
         the video "Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence" from Carrie Anne Philbin's Crash Course
         Computer Science series hosted by PBS Digital Studios.

  Bringing this together, each of these terms and concepts, from circuits that are mechanical or pro-
  grammable, to sociotechnical artifacts and systems, to artificial intelligence and intelligent agents, and
  to smart devices and technologies is shaped by and shapes individual people, scientific disciplines,

  research funding resources and their governmental, corporate, and non-profit funders, journalists and
  popular media, and many other social, cultural, political, and economic influencers. As the previous
  sentence is complex, so too is each individual word within it. But only in acknowledging the complex-
  ity is it possible to meaningfully enter into true works of liberation of all direct and indirect stakehold-
  ers seeking advancement of their individual and communal valued beings and doings.

 Bringing Together Sociotechnical Artifacts into an Internet of Things

  As we've seen in the Blue Unit, it is possible to bring together microcontroller-based programmed
  sensors with microcomputer-based processing software using data communications cables such as our
  UART serial cable. This can be very effective for connecting the microcontroller to the microcomputer
  as a single device. But a difficulty arises as control algorithms work to facilitate interdevice inter-
  networking--that is, to facilitate two or more devices working with each other, whether or not inter-
  device internetworking code incorporates artificial intelligence functions and thus formally serves as
  intelligent agents. From farming to the home to the office cubicle to the library shelves, a growing
  number of independent, small microcontroller/microcomputer sociotechnical artifacts are capturing
  and routing volumes of data between devices. The code on these devices, while much smaller than cen-
  tralized cloud computing devices and services, can be very effective at the rapid collection and analysis
  of data.

        If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things--using data they
        gathered without any help from us--we would be able to track and count everything, and
        greatly reduce waste, loss and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repair-
        ing or recalling, and whether they were fresh or past their best.

        Kevin Ashton, "That `Internet of Things' Thing"2

  It is here that the open protocols and processes of the Internet serve an essential role, leading
  researchers such as Neil Gershenfeld and others to formally advance an Internet of Things (IoT), allow-
  ing myriad devices to intercommunicate and interoperate.3 The initial IoT concept could incorporate,
  but did not require, use of broadband connectivity to support much of its functionality. Key is the
  recognition that the circuits and software, even including a Web server, can be brought together on
  very low-cost microcomputers. While our educational-focused toolkit includes a $35 USD Raspberry
  Pi and $25 USD Circuit Playground Express, along with a range of other materials, it's possible to
  build various everyday devices for as little as $1 USD. Alarmingly, many of our smart devices today are
  really not intelligent agents, but rather basic data gathering devices that use the Internet to communi-
  cate with proprietary controllers located in the "Cloud," storing (and often taking ownership of) data

  and the information emerging from this data. Management and use of data and information of sen-
  sors, which include both known and unknown input from consumers in many cases, is determined by
  the commercial providers, and then returned to the devices to be implemented. Devices are indirectly
  interconnected via cloud platforms and software, divorced from the interdevice interconnectivity envi-
  sioned within an Internet of Things. Such conflicting meanings also appear in terms such as "smart
  grid," "smart homes," and "smart cities."

  Neil Gershenfeld provides an excellent introduction to the opportunities and challenges of this
  sociotechnical space within this four-minute segment of a World Sciences Festival panel, on which one
  of the "fathers of the Internet," Vint Cerf, also sat, and who joins in some humorous bantering at the
  start. [Watch the video "The Internet of Things" with Neil Gershenfeld online.]

  For Neil Gershenfeld and the team at the Center for Bits and Atoms, this has meant bringing together
  the computer and physical sciences to explore how to turn data into things and things into data, by
  creating location fabrication facilities, Fab Labs, and a global network for training people and sharing
  knowledge, a Fab Academy, thereby digitizing fabrication in the same way that we digitized commu-
  nication over the last two decades. In so doing, the purpose is to shift the focus from plumbing and
  power to safety and convenience, from pills to proper medication. To do this, it requires shifting focus
  to the local edges rather than a centralized cloud, exploring the boundaries between the digital and
  physical worlds.4 Over the last five decades, the digital revolutions of computing and communication
  have transformed the world by enabling unprecedented productivity, and have catalyzed remarkable
  changes in everyday life while also providing opportunities for enormous wealth generation. But with
  the exciting possibilities for some people have come the exclusion and downward impacts for others.
  As Neil Gershenfeld, Alan Gershenfeld, and Joel Cutcher-Gershenfeld note in their 2017 book Design-
  ing Reality: How to Survive and Thrive in the Third Digital Revolution:

        The negative aspects of the first two digital revolutions are not simply accidents. Nor were
        they driven by some unseen hand. Decisions made (and not made) and priorities set (and
        not set) early on, as the technologies were being developed and introduced to the market,
        have had lasting effects. We built breakthrough digital communication capabilities, but we
        failed to build in cultural norms, feedback loops, and algorithms that could have reinforced
        civil discourse. We created incredibly efficient new models of digital commerce, but have
        also introduced new threats to privacy and security. We value the advances made possible
        with digital automation, even as we struggle with impacts of lost jobs due to technology. (p.
        5)

  For the Gershenfelds and others within the community of the Fab Lab movement, this third, fabrica-
  tion revolution brings together the virtual world of bits and the physical world of atoms in inno-
  vative ways in which we can find another chance to shape our societies. Digital fabrication provides

  new possibilities for enabling self-sufficient local communities beyond dependency on the centralized
  cloud of today. In so doing, it also opens up potentials for global sustainability for everyone, rather
  than just the fortunate few.

  Gartner is a global research and advisory firm that has developed the Gartner Hype Cycle model to
  inform its customers, senior leaders across the enterprise, regarding technology hype versus commer-
  cial viability. This can be another helpful way to more broadly recognize the ongoing shaping and
  reshaping of sociotechnical artifacts over an extended period. Initially, innovation of emerging tech-
  nologies leads to early proof-of-concept stories and increasing publicity of a product. However, as this
  often still requires further research and development, increasing wide use of the product can lead to a
  "Peak of Inflated Expectations" as success stories begin to be accompanied by increasing stories of fail-
  ure. In many cases, interest continues to wane until the product reaches a "Trough of Disillusionment."
  Only through ongoing development and testing do we reach a "Slope of Enlightenment" leading to a
  "Plateau of Productivity." View the Gartner Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2020 video to see
  an example of this methodology in practice, with indications that we are slowly moving from a BIT-
  NET of Things, as noted by Gershenfeld, to an increasing plateau of productivity that includes both
  the edge and the cloud, each in its own way.

  Also compare the highlights within this 2020 Gartner Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends to their
  Press Release introducing the Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2023, which adds to their opti-
  mize, scale, and pioneer themes that of sustainability.

        "However, in 2023, delivering technology will not be enough. These themes are impacted by
        environmental, social and governance (ESG) expectations and regulations, which translate
        into the shared responsibility to apply sustainable technologies. Every technology invest-
        ment will need to be set off against its impact on the environment, keeping future gen-
        erations in mind. `Sustainable by default' as an objective requires sustainable technology,"
        said David Groombridge, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner.

  To consider the possibilities and pitfalls of the Internet of Things through a critical lens is to recognize
  the many seen, unseen, and unforeseen dangers, as Richard Milner brings forward in "Race, Culture,
  and Researcher Positionality."5 Furthermore, it is to question "Whose Culture Has Capital?"6 as asked
  by Tara Yosso, a question that we explored at the end of the Blue Unit in chapter 4A: Sharing our
  Counterstories. It is essential that we continually bring not only our positivist and interpretive meta-
  theoretical assumptions, but also our critical meta-theoretical assumptions into the methodological
  landscape. For the alternative is to use the normative investigations based on deductive reasoning in

  its evaluations of our sociotechnical artifacts, such as the Turing test many have adopted to determine
  whether a computer running artificial intelligence software can "think."7

 Lesson Plan

  Ultimately, choice between cloud services, local servers and server farms, or the Internet of Things and
  smart devices does not require either "this or that" decisions. In many cases, strategic decision mak-
  ing, design, and implementation may reveal that a combination of several different networked infor-
  mation systems is the ideal practical path to facilitate functional diversity in achieving valued beings
  and doings for the broadest range of stakeholders. The first objective of this session is therefore to
  introduce us to the concepts and terms, the technical components, and the sociotechnical codifications
  underlying these networked information artifacts and systems, helping advance the existence and
  sense of choice, as well as our ability to more effectively execute and achieve that choice to advance
  our valued beings and doings. While these activities can be done using many types of computers and
  server farms, we'll make use of the Raspberry Pi computer throughout to especially advance a greater
  sense of the choices we do have but often are unaware of having given we are often directed into
  consumptive patterns of a specific product line. Indeed, some of these activities throughout this book
  using the Raspberry Pi have evolved from earlier works in communities for whom the sharing of data
  and information needed to be carefully controlled in acknowledgement that access beyond a room
  or a carefully controlled local area network could put an individual or groups life at risk. Low-cost
  Linux-based general-purpose computing devices can provide freedom and safety within environments
  in which individual or societal dangers otherwise would create barriers to liberating actions.

  A second objective as we decodify these materials of this session then is to recognize that the data
  and information being collected is not just of things. It is often data and information about human
  and more-than-human persons and their activities. Individually and collectively, people have shaped
  the devices and systems which collect data and facilitate information processing for a range of objec-
  tives. In this process, we gather data on people's actions and behaviors within various social and envi-
  ronmental contexts which we also are observing. How we reflect upon, investigate, and act upon this
  determines the form of power that is used: power within ourselves to advance our power over others,
  or power within others to advance power within all, to every extent possible. How the artifacts are
  shaped--and how we are shaped by them --also influences how we go on to shape things and persons
  alike. Considering how we can use our newly developing social justice storytelling skills within a data,
  information, knowledge, and wisdom pyramid to incorporate diverse wisdom in ways that advance
  knowledge in support of self-sufficient local communities and global sustainability for everyone is
  essential as we move forward within the information sciences.

As a reminder, the Lesson Plan found in the Introduction of the book, think of our travel through the
many session of this book as pre-season training activities within a sports metaphor. Each is meant
to strengthen a different aspect of ourselves and ourselves in relation to others. As with pre-season
training, by the end of the Rainbow Unit we will have not reached the finish line, but rather the end
of pre-season training. In entering the Rainbow Unit, use these four sessions to further advance a
clearer and stronger person-centered community inquiry mindset and to also push even further within
your action-reflection collective leadership practices to develop stronger muscle memory so that these
methods are an active part of your daily practices as an information science professional moving for-
ward.

Technical Overview

As we saw at the end of the Orange and Blue Units, there are many ways to provide data communi-
cations between devices. In the Orange Unit, we learned more about the ports available on our com-
puters, such as the USB and HDMI ports, that provide ways for us to connect external devices such
as keyboards, mice, and monitors. And in the Blue Unit, we learned about serial data communications
interfaces such as the Universal Asynchronous Receive and Transmit (UART) interface we've
been using to transmit and receive data between the Raspberry Pi and the screen or PuTTY console
of our laptop, and between the Circuit Playground Express and our Raspberry Pi. While technically a
keyboard and a computer or a microcontroller and a microcomputer are two separate devices, via the
software we use, they work as one unified system. They are our computer. They are our counterstory
trumpet.
But underlying the concept of the Internet of Things--which today is often popularly referred to as
Smart Devices coming together to create Smart Homes, Smart Grids, Smart Cities, and more--is an
interconnection of electronics. A mechanical keyboard connected to a personal computer is not an IoT
device. But a programmable keyboard that uses machine learning to predict changing contexts based
on data from a range of local IoT devices and functionally evolve accordingly would be an IoT key-
board. It is to create an Internet of Things, whether or not this is connected to the physical Internet.
There are actually many choices that can be made regarding this interconnectivity, only some of which
make use of the Internet Protocol, something we'll learn more about in session two of the Rainbow
Unit.

Data Transport

As the evolution of computer networking continued into the 1970s, a number of different government-
and corporate-sponsored programs led to the development of protocols, standards, and frameworks
for data, information, and communication distribution between computers. This included CYCLADES
in France, NPL network in the UK, and ARPANET in the United States. Through extended work by
international bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Telecom-
munications Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T), an Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model was created and formally published in 1984 as both
ISO 7498 and X.200. A key component of the OSI is a seven-layer model.

With regard to the Internet, these layers are practically combined into four groups, as follows:

Application   Provide the physical client/server (e.g. web browser client/Hypertext Transfer Protocol,
&             or HTTP, server and Structured Query Language, or SQL, database server) or
Presentation  peer-to-peer (e.g., Bittorrent, Bitcoin) applications with which end users work & the data
Layers        translation and representation used in support of those applications
              Provide interhost communication and connections using protocols such as the User
Session &     Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). While TCP is the
Transport     most commonly used, leading to the standard TCP/IP suite reference, UDP is used when
Layers        speed is prioritized over occasional dropped packets, for instance in live streaming and online
              gaming contexts.
Network       The core of the Internet Protocol (IP) used to provide end-to-end routing of data packets
Layer         across the backbone
Physical &
Data Link     The unique identifiers associated with key hardware devices and the communications
Layers        technology used to interconnect these devices

Limor Fried of Adafruit Industries partnered with DigiKey to create the web series "All the Internet
of Things," highlighting essential tools for building Internet of Things devices. Traditional Internet-
based systems and structures combine the seven layers into four groups as listed in the table above.
But Internet of Things applications often focus on the Physical and Data Link, Network, and Transport
layers, as is highlighted in the video.

To prepare for our own work in the Rainbow Unit, watch the first 13 and a half minutes of the video
"All the Internet of Things - Episode 1 - Transports," Fried's review of Ethernet and Wi-Fi transport
(read the full video transcript on Adafruit's website).

Data transfers between Internet of Things devices do not always (or even often) require human-com-
puter interaction. The applications commonly used within Internet of Things devices do typically make
use of common protocols such as HTTP and SQL that work within the Session and Presentation layers
of the OSI model, but often can do so without the need for human-computer interfaces such as a web
browser, or use the human-computer interface only occasionally for testing and configuration/pro-
gramming purposes. In episode two of "All the Internet of Things," Fried introduces us to commonly
used application protocols including HTTP, which we'll be using in the exercises below.

To get started, watch the first 4:10 of the video. For those wanting to do a deeper dive, you may con-
sider watching the video "All the Internet of Things - Episode 2 - Protocols" through minute 11:04 to
learn about the REST API (Application Programming Interface) that can be used with HTTP to create
more extensive intercommunication between devices (read the full video transcript on Adafruit's web-
site).

Towards Our Own Internet of Things

In the following three exercises, we will work with the key components used to create IoT devices.

        1. First, we will return to the MakeCode Serial UART Communications Extension used with
            the Raspberry Pi Counterstory Digital Little Free Library exercises from session four of the
            Blue Unit. This time, we'll add in temperature and light sensor data to the A1, A2, and A4
            touchpad and A and B push button sensors. We'll also include the current runtime of the
            Circuit Playground Express since it was last powered on or rebooted, providing five unique
            data points. We will transfer this data to the Raspberry Pi via the UART connection every
            second. A simple Python application run on the Raspberry Pi will then print these to a ter-
            minal window.

        2. Second, instead of displaying this data within a terminal window, we'll display the data
            within a dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) document, viewable from a web
            browser client. Starting with Python version 3, Python code can be used to set up an HTTP
            server, watching for HTTP client requests for data. When a client request is received, the
            server dynamically creates an HTML page providing the real-time data, previously col-
                                                                                          1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World 286

            lected data, static text, or a combination of the above.
        3. Third, we will add the option to power LEDs on and off from a web browser. To accomplish

            this, we can use Python code, bringing together the HTTP server code from exercise two
            with code from the Coding Electronics chapter in the Orange Unit. Two options are avail-
            able: The first uses the push buttons and LEDs as configured in the Orange Unit Coding
            Electronics chapter. The second uses a diffused RGB (Red, Green, Blue) LED to allow us to
            choose one of seven different colors for the LED display.

As we get started with these exercises, you may find it helpful to quickly review Blue Unit, Session 4,
"Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library." In particular, make sure you have your Circuit Play-
ground Express connected to your Raspberry Pi using a TTL/USB Serial Cable. The TTL connects to
the Circuit Playground Express using male to alligator clip wires. Disconnect the red wire from power
(VOUT) on the Circuit Playground Express as we'll be connecting the Circuit Playground Express to
your personal computer with a microUSB to USB cable to edit the Circuit Playground Express code for
these exercises.

If you haven't been using the Raspberry Pi since the end of the Orange Unit, it might be helpful to
review Orange Unit 4B: Meet the Microcomputer, including videos found within the chapter, and Exer-
cises found in Orange Unit 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi.

            the keyboard, mouse, and monitor interface with the Raspberry Pi, review the later steps in
            the Exercise: First Boot of the Raspberry Pi OS

         · If you are now connected to a different Local Area Network (LAN), you'll need to connect
            the Raspberry Pi to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor temporarily to get it to connect to that
            network. If you have problems getting the monitor to serve as a screen for the Raspberry Pi

Opportunity to Remix

These activities do not use databases or machine-learning code to create that true IoT device. Further,
while both the Circuit Playground Express and Raspberry Pi devices are configured to transmit (TX)
and receive (RX) data via the Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit (UART) protocol, MakeCode
currently does not support the RX pads on the Circuit Playground Express. For those wanting to do a
deeper dive, follow Adafruit's tutorial to use CircuitPython on the Circuit Playground Express, instead
of MakeCode, to effectively use both the TX and RX pads and create a full serial bi-directional com-

  munications with the Raspberry Pi. Note: If you want to return to working in MakeCode after using
  CircuitPython, Adafruit provides instructions for uninstalling CircuitPython.

 Exercise: Using Python to Monitor Sensor Information

  Let's return to the circuitplayground-ToolboxTrumpet4Octave-WithUART.uf2 MakeCode1 used within
  Blue Unit chapter 4B: Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library. We can reuse that code, remixing

1. MakeCode © 2020 Microsoft and Adafruit. Screenshots used with permission.
                                                                                          1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World 288

it slightly to re-purpose the "serial write" so that it outputs sensor data. We'll test out this modification
using a new Python program instead of the previous cstories.py.

See the above image for where we're beginning.

        1. Within the FOREVER loop, delete the "if CapTouchCounter > 0" LOGIC statement. This
            should also delete the two serial write number blocks within the if statement. Deleting this
            conditional "If...Then" logic statement is needed as we'll want to transmit the serial write
            values whether or not the pads A1, A2, or A4 on the Circuit Playground Express have been
            touched.

        2. Add five new "serial write value "x" = 0 blocks just above the "pause 1000 ms" block. These
            should be set up as follows. NOTE: value names are case sensitive as this will need to match
            the Python code run on the Raspberry Pi.
                    a. `serial write value "Temp"` should be setup to transmit the INPUT "temperature."
                        It can be left as °C or changed to °F if you prefer Fahrenheit over Celsius.
                    b. `serial write value "Light"` should be setup to transmit the INPUT "light level."
                    c. `serial write value "Runtime"` should be setup to transmit the CONTROL "millis
                        (ms)," that is, the number of milliseconds elapsed since power on.
                    d. `serial write value "Note"` should be setup to transmit the VARIABLE "CapTouch-
                        Counter."
                    e. `serial write value "Button"` should be setup to transmit the VARIABLE "button-
                        Count."

         · NOTE: Previously we transmitted a number. These are sent in 1-byte packets (1 byte = 8
            bits). These numbers, which were in the range of 0-4 and 0-7, were predictably sent as a sin-
            gle 1-byte packet. Moving forward, values such as Runtime will range, requiring 1 or more
            byte-sized packets. In MakeCode, the easiest alternative is to send each as a complete line
            of data that ends with a carriage return and line feed. In this way, they can easily be dis-
            played line by line in a console window, just as if you were typing in the data using a key-
            board and then hitting the "Enter" key at the end of each line of data. Your lines should now
            look something like this. Note the two new sensor icons within the simulator window:
289 1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World

        3. Change the name of the file to SimpleUART, hit the save icon, and then flash this to your
            Circuit Playground Express.

        4. With the slide switch on the Circuit Playground Express to the right, you should be able to
            again play four octaves of the `C' scale. Slide it to the left if you do not want it to play the
            scales moving forward.

        5. With the Circuit Playground Express now running the new code, disconnect the USB cable
            between the CPE and your laptop or Raspberry Pi. You'll instead connect your Circuit Play-
            ground Express to the Raspberry Pi using the USB to TTL cable. Connect the black to
            ground, red to VOUT, white to TX, and green to RX.

        6. From a web browser, enter: https://go.illinois.edu/simple_uart5.
        7. Take a glance at this new Python code called simple_uart5.py:

                    a. This code first imports some needed Python library packages accessed through
                                                                                             1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World 290

                          the Python Package Index2, including:
                                    serial, used to receive and transmit serial data

                                    os, which will let us to run Linux commands and read data

                                    sleep, which lets us run the time function

                                    RPi.GPIO, the PyPI project specifically for the Raspberry Pi GPIO.

                      b. The code creates a variable called uart and connects it to the /dev/ttyUSB0
                          device. If you needed to change the USB port used for the Blue Unit Toolbox
                          Trumpet Counterstory Player, keep this in mind. You'll need to make that change
                          again after downloading this file.

                      c. A key addition is a new function, convert, that is created to change the Run-
                          time from milliseconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.

                      d. The last half is a "while True" FOREVER loop that reads in the five lines each time
                          they are sent from the Circuit Playground Express. It fine tunes each of the lines
                          to make them more readable and then prints them to standard out, which typi-
                          cally is a terminal window display of the Raspberry Pi.

                      e. NOTE: An essential piece of the fine tuning is related to the "decode" process. In
                          particular, the Circuit Playground Express sends lines of data encoded using
                          UTF-8. According to Wikipedia, "Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit is a vari-
                          able-width encoding that can represent every character in the Unicode character
                          set. It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII and to avoid the com-
                          plications of endianness and byte order marks in UTF-16 and UTF-32."3 ASCII is
                          the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It was the standard for
                          US-based computers and the basic encoding scheme initially within the Internet
                          Protocol. However, this limited usable character sets, something that plagues
                          much of global Internet usage to this day.4

          8. Right click on the simple_uart5 programming code and save it as sim-
              ple_uart5.py to your personal computer (if connecting to the Raspberry Pi using a
              screen, PuTTY, or SSH) or to your Raspberry Pi (if using a keyboard, monitor, and mouse
              with the Raspberry Pi). Make sure to save it as a Python file with the .py extension, not
              with the default .txt extension.
                        If the simple_uart5.py file was saved to your personal computer, copy
                          it over to your Raspberry Pi using the scp command.

4. Endianness defines the ordering of bytes of a word of digital data, with big-endian-based and little-endian-based com-

  puter architectures ordering bytes in storage in two significantly different ways. Today's major personal computer
  providers use the little-endian format.
291 1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World

                      If you have more than one USB device connected to your Raspberry Pi,
                        you may need to edit the Python code using nano, to match the /dev/ttyUSB0 line
                        to your exact USB.

        9. In a Raspberry Pi terminal window, type in:

         · pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python3 simple_uart5.py

Once the program begins, you will see new sensor information printed to the terminal window every
second. Try pressing different sensors and buttons to see the data output change. You can end the
Python session at any time by hitting CTRL-C. The display will look something like this:
                                                                                          1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World 292

This may take some pair programming and failing forward to get up and running. Remember to work
through the troubleshooting basics cycle to work from "not yet" to "yet"!

Key Takeaways

Microcontrollers are common in many of our everyday electronics, from computers to printers to
microwaves to cars. Sometimes they only serve to sense device context and then control the motors
running a device accordingly. Other times, sensor data is collected and passed on to other microcon-
trollers and to microcomputers. And sometimes microcontrollers collect data from other sensors first.
The Circuit Playground Express has been designed first as an educational tool, but as we've seen first
building the Toolbox Trumpet Counterstory Player and now in this exercise, it has a range of sensor
capabilities that could be used as datasets informing actions for a range of information services.
What might you do next to remix this?
So far we've used the terminal window to view Python information. But since Python version 3, it is
also possible to print this information as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server data instead of,
or in addition to, a standard output like we've now sent to the terminal window. With the Python code
and UART communications confirmed, let's explore how this data can be made remotely available.
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a well-established, highly used TCP/IP-based client/server protocol
that we'll explore more formally in Rainbow Unit, Session 2. For now, consider that you make regular
use of web browsers which perform a client role putting forward requests to associated servers using
the same protocol. Today, web browsers are mostly used to access pages stored on HTTP servers by
293 1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World

typing in an http:// or https://, followed by an Internet Protocol name associated with that server,
and perhaps further subdirectory names on that server, each separated by another `/' symbol, and
finally the resource name at the end of the last `/' symbol if needed. Together this creates a Uniform
Resource Locater (URL). The URL is a commonly used form of the more general Uniform Resource
Indicator (URI), strings of characters used to unambiguously identify a particular resource. The first
part of the URL states the protocol to be used. Web browsers actually support a number of different
protocols, but we almost always make use of the HTTP protocol or the secure Hypertext Transfer Pro-
tocol, HTTPS. For the following exercises, the remainder of the http:// URL will include the Raspberry
Pi's IP address and a special port number we'll define in the Python code to separate it from any other
web servers that may be running on your local network.

Exercise: Using http to Remotely Monitor Sensor Information

For this exercise, we do not need to change anything on the Circuit Playground Express or with the
TTL/USB cable connection to the Raspberry Pi. The focus instead is on the Raspberry Pi IP Address
and the Python code that will be used to read the five lines of serial data sent once every second by
the Circuit Playground Express using the TTL/USB cable.

        1. From a web browser, enter: https://go.illinois.edu/simple_uartWebserverCPE.

        2. Take a glance at this new Python code called simple_uartWebserverCPE.py. This is pretty
            complex, and do not worry if it doesn't make much sense at this time. Notes have been
            added, delineated using the comment character "#". Doing a quick read of these comments
            might be helpful to just highlight key aspects of the Python code. Later, after running this
            Python code on the Raspberry Pi and then reading data through a web browser, come back
            and review it again.

        3. Right click on the simple_uartWebserverCPE.py programming code, and save it as
            simple_uartWebserverCPE.py to your personal computer (if connecting to the
            Raspberry Pi using a screen, PuTTY, or SSH) or to your Raspberry Pi (if using a keyboard,
            monitor, and mouse with the Raspberry Pi). Make sure it is not saved with a final .txt exten-
            sion.

        4. This code will now need to be edited using a simple text editor on your laptop, or using
            Thonny or mousepad on the Raspberry Pi:
            pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mousepad /home/pi/Code/Python/simple_uar-
            tWebserverCPE.py
            Whichever text editor you use, here are the changes that need to be made:
                      In the third section at the top of the code, note that the host_name is configured
                        to the IP address assigned to my home Raspberry Pi (more on connecting your
                        Raspberry Pi to a Local Area Network (LAN) is provided in the backmatter of this
                        textbook). The host_name variable will need to be changed after downloading the
                                                                               1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World 294

                Python code to match the IP address you find when typing into the Raspberry Pi
                terminal window the following:

              pi@raspberrypi:~ $ hostname -I

                Also included in this section is a host_port. Think of a shipping port of call as an
                analogy. When arriving at a shoreline with designated docking ports for a boat or
                ship, a set of names or numbers are used. This is the same for the Internet Proto-
                col. By default, HTTP uses port 80 and HTTPS uses port 443. Ports from 0
                through 1023 are well-known system ports and are stricter than ports above this
                range. Port 8080 is actually a common number used for test web servers. The
                iSchool course for which this textbook is commonly used is IS401, and so 8401 is
                the chosen host_port listed here. But this can be changed, and indeed should be
                changed if the same Raspberry Pi is attempting to run multiple different web
                servers simultaneously.

              If you have more than one USB device connected to your Raspberry Pi,
                you may now also need to revise the /dev/ttyUSB0 line to an appropriate USB
                device other than 0.

5. Save the changes to the Python code.
              If simple_uartWebserverCPE.py was edited using mousepad on the
                Raspberry Pi, save the file and exit mousepad.
              If simple_uartWebserverCPE.py was edited using the Thonny Python
                IDE on the Raspberry Pi, save the changes. You can then use the Run icon at
                the top of Thonny to test out the code.
              If simple_uartWebserverCPE.py was edited on your personal com-
                puter, copy it over to your Raspberry Pi next.

6. With the Python code tweaked to match your IP address and possibly your /dev/tty-
    pUSB assignment, type the following in a Raspberry Pi terminal window:

 · pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python3 simple_uartWebserverCPE.py

7. In a web browser located on the same local network as your Raspberry Pi, type in
    your Raspberry Pi's IP address, followed by :8401, like this:

 · http://10.0.0.30:8401
   295 1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World

  This is the most complex piece of programming code we've worked with yet. It includes changes
  needed within Python to match it with the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. For some, this may be the
  first time you've edited Python. You may have been using the Raspberry Pi in Graphical User Interface
  mode with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor; and thus it might be the first time you've had to work
  with the IP address of the Raspberry Pi.

  In addition, many new concepts related to networking are just starting to be introduced. In all, there
  are plenty of "fail forward" opportunities to advance a growth mindset. Maybe too many for the time
  being, in which case "yet enough" might be working collaboratively with another person to walk one
  of you through this exercise on one Raspberry Pi.

  But I would encourage you to spend at least 45 minutes or so working to fail forward on each Rasp-
  berry Pi available, comparing and contrasting what works and what doesn't work as a community of
  practice.
  When you're ready, take a closer look at the following highlights of the simple_uartWeb-
  serverCPE.py code:

           · In addition to several other Python libraries, the code imports the http.server module of the
              base Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, request handler and server library package.

           · The core part of the Python code is the class BaseHTTPRequestHandler. In Python, "classes
              provide a means of bundling data and functionality together."5 BaseHTTPRequestHandler
              "is used to handle the HTTP requests that arrive at the server. By itself, it cannot respond
              to any actual HTTP requests; it must be subclassed to handle each request method (e.g.
              GET or POST)."6

           · In this case, do_HEAD() sends the headers for a typical GET request sent from a HTTP
              client such as your web browser, including a 200 OK response and a content type `text/
              html' noting text and/or Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is being sent back to the
              client.

           · The do_GET() does the lion's share of the work setting up a dynamic HTML page. It can do
              this because a special implementation of BaseHTTPRequestHandler is being used for read-
              ing data from and controlling GPIO of a Raspberry Pi--note the Import RPi.GPIO at the top
              of the file.

           · At the bottom of the do_GET() function, you'll note a wfile.write statement, written in the

Key Takeaways

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a widely used client/server protocol. For most, you'll
encounter the HTTP application as a general-purpose server--a common one being Apache--in which
many different parent and child web pages are located through websites located on a single web server.
This textbook in its online version is a gathering of many individual web pages located on one of those
general-purpose servers. There are other Illinois Open Publishing Network "Windsor & Downs Press"
books, and also a number of "Publishing Without Walls" books and "IOPN Journals" all located on this
general purpose web server.
In this exercise, though, we're running a special-purpose, Python-based HTTP server on a microcom-
puter and we are setting it up for the specific purpose of distributing data it collects both from its
own hardware and data provided over a serial connect from a microcontroller--all gathered within
the Python program to share as a single web page. But as is the case with the majority of HTTP-
   297 1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World

  provided data, it is sent using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the standard for web pages.7
  An important takeaway is the distinction between HTML standard and the HTTP protocol. Both are
  Internet Protocol-based. But while standards serve as guidelines that can or should be followed, pro-
  tocols serve as rules defining exactly how data is exchanged and the expected behavior to be followed
  within this change. You can put anything into an HTML page that you want, and it will be sent to the
  requester--whatever is in there. But if it is something outside of the standard, it may be ignored or
  even lead to distorted communication between the client and the server using this protocol.

  Within an object-oriented programming language, a collection of data variables are acted upon using
  defined functions that are brought together as an object. A class then serves as the blueprint for that
  object. In this exercise, the class BaseHTTPRequestHandler brought together two functions, do_HEAD
  and do_GET, each beginning with the Python function keyword "def". The do_GET() method, or func-
  tion, implements the standard GET method of HTTP/1.1 used to retrieve whatever information is
  identified by the Request-URI. The do_HEAD() method, on the other hand, MUST NOT return a mes-
  sage-body but rather the metainformation continued in the HTTP headers. This is different from the
  <head></head> of the HTML standard, which is instead meta-information as defined within the HTTP
  protocol.

        For more, take a look first at the formal protocol definitions page. This was the original doc-
        ument used by W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium based on sections from RFC9110 and
        which was referenced in the first edition of this textbook, published in 2020. Subsequently,
        in June, 2022, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) published RFC 9110, HTTP Seman-
        tics. This now supersedes the W3C document and the better source to learn more about the
        semantics used in the above paragraph. The IETF and the Request for Comments (RFC)
        process are formally introduced in Rainbow Unit 2A: Digital Internets Past and Present.

  Currently MakeCode on the Circuit Playground Express only supports the writing of data using one
  of the serial write blocks, thereby providing data to the other side of the UART connection. It does not
  support the serial read blocks. Otherwise, we could enter the data into variables and use those, for

instance, to set LED pixels to specified colors. But think back to the Orange Unit's Coding Electronics
chapter where we used the Python command switchLED.py to read the three momentary switch push
buttons and turn on or off associated LEDs via transistors for each of the three parallel circuits.

Exercise: Using HTTP to Remotely Control LEDs

As we enter this last exercise, let's consider how we might make use of the Python class BaseHTTPRe-
questHandler on the Raspberry Pi to not only provide regularly updated Circuit Playground Express
data, but also information regarding which LED is currently running on the breadboard based on the
status of the Momentary Switch push buttons just reviewed above. While this will bring together two
"things" on one Raspberry Pi, this also provides a potential launchpad for considering ways different
microcontrollers and microcomputers could ultimately further be brought together to create a range
of local "Internet of Things" devices.

This final Python program is a remix of the simple_uartWebserverCPE. A new table has been added
to the HTML portion of def do_GET from which a selection can be made regarding which of the
three LEDs should be on, and which should be off. And below that, additional variables have been set
up to read from, and write to, the appropriate GPIO pins.

        1. From a web browser, enter: https://go.illinois.edu/simple_uartWebserverLED
        2. As before, take a quick glance at this new Python code called simple_uartWebserverLED.py.

            Much of it is taken directly from the simple_uartWebserverCPE.py program. And as before,
            after downloading this, you will need to edit the Python file to change the "host_name"
            from 10.0.0.30, the local IP Address of my Raspberry Pi at my home office, to be whatever IP
            address you were assigned on your local network. The file is much longer, though, because
299 1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World

            of the new HTML table and then the new series of "If...Then...Else" conditionals, one to
            provide an edited output of the Circuit Playground Express data, the other to interact with
            the GPIO pins and edit associated variables.
        3. Right click on the simple_uartWebserverLED.py programming code and save it as sim-
            ple_uartWebserverLED.py to your personal computer (if connecting to the Raspberry Pi
            using a screen, PuTTY, or SSH) or to your Raspberry Pi (if using a keyboard, monitor, and
            mouse with the Raspberry Pi). Make sure it is not saved with a final .txt extension.
        4. This code will now need to be edited using:

                      Thonny Python IDE, in which case you can test the code through the Thonny Run
                        icon, or

                      using mousepad on the Raspberry Pi
                        pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mousepad /home/pi/Code/Python/sim-
                        ple_uartWebserverLED.py

         · Whichever text editor you use, here are the changes that need to be made:
                      ALL: Change the host_name to match the IP address assigned to your Raspberry
                        Pi as seen in the hostname command, or as used to ssh into your Raspberry Pi.
                      If you have more than one USB device connected to your Raspberry Pi,
                        you may now need also revise the /dev/ttyUSB0 line to an appropriate USB device
                        other than 0.
                      ALL: save the changes you just made.

        5. Before going to the next step, be sure other Python programs we've been running are
            stopped. This includes:
                      simple_uartWebserverCPE.py used in the previous exercise is not still
                        running as it is already using the assigned port number for its own HTTP server.

                      switchLED.py which you might have run in the Key Takeaways of the last
                        exercise.

                      To stop a program running on the Linux command line, you typically will type:
                                  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ CTRL-C
                                    Where CTRL- indicates for you to press and hold down the control key
                                    on your keyboard while typing in the additional key, which in this case
                                    is the letter `c'.

        6. With the simple_uartWebserverLED.py Python code tweaked to match your IP address and
            possibly your /dev/ttypUSB assignment, in a second Raspberry Pi terminal window,
            type in:

serverLED.py

7. In a web browser located on the same local network as your Raspberry Pi, type in:

· http://172.16.112.58:8401 Again, replace the IP address above with your Rasp-
   berry Pi's. As you can see, this example is on a different LAN from the previous examples.

Key Takeaways

In this exercise, we have revisited an exercise from the Orange Unit in which Python code was used
to create a programmable circuit allowing us to selectively turn on and off LEDs using Momentary
Switch push buttons. We have continued to use a MakeCode Toolbox Trumpet program on the Circuit
Playground Express, which allows us to play four octaves of the C-Scale. And, finally, we expanded the
Python code from the previous exercise to both report on data from the Circuit Playground Express
and also from the Raspberry Pi GPIO, and also add in the ability to remotely control another red, green,
and blue LED set.

An illustration demonstrating the multiple communication channels active simultaneously. These include digital I/O
communications between the breadboard and Raspberry Pi, UART communications between the Circuit Playground
Express and the Raspberry Pi, and HTTP communications between a web browser and the http server Python code on the
Raspberry Pi.

Pause to look again at the two images taken to display the target outcome of this exercise. Now that
these are set up and working properly, consider the following probe questions:

         · How many different devices are now playing a role as tools within this third exercise?
         · How many different computer programs are now playing a role facilitating the use of these

            tools?
         · Which tools could be used independent of the other tools shown in the images? Which

            ones must be used together to work? Which ones cannot work fully independently, but
            could be used through slight adjustments, for instance, by just being provided a separate
            power source?
         · Which ones now require access to the Internet periodically, or continuously, to function
            effectively? Consider the Internet not as the local network, even though it works using the
            Internet Protocol, but rather the connection to the global Internet provided by your Internet
            Service Provider.
         · Are there times when you see discrepancies in the timeline of information collected vs. dis-
            played? Which components might be shaping these discrepancies, if any?
         · Who shaped the different tools, including the electronics and computer programs used to
            create these tools? How does this shaping go on to shape your use of them?

Wrap Up

As we've worked through Session One, we've worked to demystify what it means when someone says
a thing is an Internet of Things, or Smart device. We've worked to unpack what is actually within these
devices, and also what is essential for them to work together. The goal is for this to help us to see that
IoT devices can often stand separately and work independently. But as they are brought together on
a local network, the data can start being combined to further influence the monitoring and activity of
these interrelated devices. Also, as we've seen here, a local microcomputer can be set up to collect the
data from multiple other datasets separately collected on devices and consolidated into a single output.

From here, consider that both the Raspberry Pi and Circuit Playground Express themselves can collect
data from multiple worker devices as a parent using the I2C serial data transmission protocol. When
Circuit Playground Express is programmed using Python or Arduino, this could include both input
and output data with a range of remote microcontrollers and integrated circuit sensors and motors,
with data being stored in a file instead of, or in addition to, sending it to the Raspberry Pi using the
UART serial communications protocol. Likewise, the Raspberry Pi can both provide data dynamically
to a web browser and also store this data in a file or database. And while our programs have been used
to provide a consistent unconditioned stimulus and response pattern, it is possible that through the
use of machine learning algorithms, this can be expanded to create conditionals to reshape stimulus
and response patterns. All of this can readily be done without Internet connectivity using local net-
working technologies.
303 1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World

But it's also important to note that there's the Internet of Things and there's the Bitnet of Things as
differentiated by Neil Gershenfeld and his colleagues. If the Raspberry Pi serves exclusively or primar-
ily as a storage center for data, this is more like a centralized Bitnet of Things. Even if this centralized
system facilitates remote control of devices, it has not yet moved to being an Internet of Things device,
especially if each microcontroller/microcomputer device with which it might communicate remains
separate from all other devices within its arena.
As an example, I found it increasingly important to purchase a window air conditioner for our home
woodshop given the rising nighttime temperatures, increased humidity, and the negative impacts this
was having on the metal tools and wood used in our carpentry projects. This week I purchased a
Toshiba Smart Wi-Fi Window Air Conditioner with Remote and ENERGY STAR. In setting it up, I was
able to use the easy to use touch controls. What about some of the other methods for working with
the air conditioner specified using the terms Smart, Wi-Fi, and Remote? Toshiba clarifies the Remote
Control as a now standard radio frequency handheld remote used within the same room. The Wi-Fi, on
the other hand, requires a connection to the Local Area Network, thereby facilitating communications
with the associated smartphone app and with voice controlled using Amazon Skill. Toshiba has help-
fully clarified that their use of the term smart indicates the air conditioner, like our remotely controlled
LEDs, can interface with smartphones. And while the Amazon Alexa Skills system does incorporate
machine learning and narrow artificial intelligence (AI for a specific task), these are not incorporated
within the air conditioner to provide ongoing engineering of the auto settings.
This is the concept behind the Bitnet of Things for Neil Gershenfeld and others.

While many home devices today make use of the Internet for routing and transport, it can often be for communication a
centralized "Bitnet of Things" command and control center rather than between a range of Internet of Things devices.

What might be the alternative pathway in which the air conditioner was integrated within an Internet
of Things workshop? The table saw, bandsaw, planers, chop saw, woodlathe, air compressor, dust col-
lector, and various other mechanical tools and also the wood resources would include sensors set
                                                                                          1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World 304

up as Internet of Things devices. The dust collector, air compressor, and air conditioner would mon-
itor the saws, planers, and lathes to detect usage and performance levels. These would be used to
adjust settings on the climatic and air quality standards within the space to increase performance and
longevity of machine, human, and more-than-human alike. In part, this would be done through inte-
grated machine learning that worked not only individually on each of the many sensors and con-
trollers, but through end-to-end strategic learning to recognize the best adjustments given the different
contexts and current requirements. After all, the woodshop is a very different space when it is also
being used to raise a new gathering of soon-to-lay-egg chicks, or when it is used by my students to
design, cut, and build computer tables, or when it is used by my family to build gifts, sometimes in
rapid succession.

Internet provides routing and transport between a range of Internet of Things devices and associated interface devices.

This is the concept behind the Internet of Things. Machine learning moves from a centralized com-
mand and control to each of the various tools that now have as part of the construction electronic
sensors, servomotors, and other controllers. These tools then work in an artificial community of prac-
tice to achieve objectives the algorithms on each individual device could not do alone.
It is not essential for there to be Internet access, although sometimes it might be useful for there to be.
For instance, if we were to configure the home router, which is provided a public IP address, to forward
port 8401 requests to the private IP address of the Raspberry Pi, then web browsers around the world
could choose the LED color! If done in this way, the Internet is not needed to collect and analyze the
data and adjust algorithms accordingly, but instead is used to provide additional data as helpful.
And there are times when it is helpful to send data to remote databases, HTTP servers, and other sys-
tems, either as the primary server array for storing and consolidating information, or as a secondary
location in addition to the primary local server. This will be the focus of Session Two of the Rainbow
Unit.

The USB to TTL serial UART connection between a microcontroller and microcomputer.

As we have explored throughout the textbook, there are many ways to connect, or network, two
devices together. We've made use of the Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit, or UART, protocol
with our own devices. We have also briefly reviewed the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), which is a syn-
chronous, multi-parent, multi-worker, packet switched, and single-ended serial computer bus.

There are many other ways to network devices together, through physical cables (Ethernet, fiber) or
varying wavelength frequencies (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, infrared, cellular, satellite, low-powered radio).
My own history with networking goes back to the 1970s and the growth of radio-controlled model
airplanes. While attending Hull Middle School, I used a teletype device and landline phone to dial in to
a minicomputer located at the high school, both to play Star Trek video games in my free time and to
write my first BASIC programming language code to calculate the board feet of a log for my family's
sawmill. (My dad was not impressed. He preferred continuing to use our analog, hand-held Doyle log
rules).

Then in the early 1980s I bought a Commodore 64! The night before I picked it up, I remember using a
manual typewriter to complete an English class assignment at Lake Michigan Community College and
continually thinking, "This is the last time I will ever need to use whiteout!!" When I got it, I also got a
few issues of PC Magazine so that I could read the BASIC programming code stories that I could then
enter in and use to play games and to begin creating my own calculating devices for making. And for
a short period I also tested out CompuServe, a commercial online service, from which I could join in
discussions and download other BASIC programming code. But landline phones were expensive when
used to connect from my rural home. So for all of these, there was only one way I effectively internet-
worked -- sneakernet. Sneakernet is an informal term sometimes used tongue-in-cheek to reference
those times when the best, or perhaps only, way to transfer electronic data between devices is by phys-
ically moving storage media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, hard drive, USB flash drive) from device
to device.
                                                                                                                    2A: Digital Internets, Past and Present 308

  A Modulator-Demodulator, or modem, converts the text of the sender into binary so that the data can be sent over the
  network. The receiving modem then demodulates the binary back into text.

  But the early 1980s also saw the emergence of BITNET, an international cooperative network
  launched by Ira H. Fuchs at the City University of New York and Greydon Freeman at Yale University.2
  It used IBM's Remote Spooling Communications Subsystem (RSCS) protocol and a peer-to-
  peer (P2P) network "store-and-forward" principle in which data and information at a given BIT-
  NET-connected computer was sent to a central mainframe computer, stored, and then forwarded to
  other mainframe computers. This university-focused network eventually spanned the coasts of the
  United States and was also joined in 1982 by the European Academic and Research Network, or EARN,
  providing a means for communications across a broad research community. For me, this first true
  internetworking as I worked towards my PhD degree at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey,
  provided a means to easily email and store and forward research data across campus and between uni-
  versities. But as with previous networked systems I had used, the primary focus was towards central-
  ized administration and a focus on target audiences. For me to get the support I needed from outside
  University BITNET members to fix microcontroller or C programming code problems with our sup-
  porting small startup businesses, I needed to communicate via landline phone and send digital data
  and electronics via postal mail.

 Emergence of an Open Model for Internetworking

  At the same time that commercial service providers such as CompuServe and cooperative university
  networking systems such as BITNET were emerging with a focus on centralized servers and services,
  other models for internetworking were also under development. A key design of these open internet-
  working structures was that each computing device connected to that network has responsibility for
  reliable processing and delivery of data. This pioneering work came from Louis Pouzin and the French
  Cyclades Network in the early 1970s.3 It was created to allow end-to-end protocol transparency of
  application-specific features even when the devices are on different types of networks. Pouzin selected
  Cyclades as an inspirational description of between networks, or internets, from the Greek islands
  with the same name that form a circle in the Aegean Sea. In his presentation of the Cyclades network
  to French ministers in 1974, Maurice Allegre provided this metaphor:

        One should retain the image [of the Cyclades islands]; the processing centers are still today
        islands isolated in the middle of an ocean of data, which overwhelms our civilization. Now,
        thanks to the networks, these islands will be able to connect and thus contribute to a wide
        circle of information exchanges which will shape the future development of our society.4

  Ultimately, the French government chose the Transpac telecom monopoly's plan for centralized con-
  trol by the network provider within the network of data traffic and quality of service until 2012 before
  fully transitioning to commercial Internet, something for which the Cyclades open model provided
  essential inspiration.

  However, key features of Cyclades influenced the design of the Internet Protocol (IP), another packet
  switching distributed communications network, this one being developed through the Advanced
  Research Projects Agency (ARPA) established by the United States Department of Defense in 1966
  and officially named ARPANET. ARPA itself was formed as an agency in 1957 with the objective to
  establish a United States (US) lead in science and technology applicable to the military after the launch
  of the satellite Sputnik by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). This agency was in large part
  a continuation of post-World War II high-technology industries of the Cold War period. Like many
  agencies of the post-war development period, it included extensive basic research by academia and
  industry for the development of generic infrastructure, protocols, and standards.

  One central development based on this unique US open internetworking sociotechnical system was
  the launch of a Request for Comments (RFC) system in 1969 to keep unofficial notes on the devel-
  opment of ARPANET as well as peer-reviewed official documents of Internet specifications, com-
  munications protocols, and procedures.5 Today it is overseen by the Internet Engineering Task

  Force (IETF), founded in 1986 by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) as part of the United
  States Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 1992,
  it became a part of the Internet Society (ISOC), an American nonprofit organization founded as part
  of a larger transition of the Internet away from being a United States governmental entity.6

        Examples of the Request for Comments (RFC) Process

        The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is one example of how open standards and pro-
        tocols develop through the RFC process. Its initial development from 1989 to 1992 by Tim
        Berners-Lee and colleagues happened as a part of their work at CERN in Switzerland. It was
        first released publicly on USENET newsgroups alt.hypertext, comp.sys.next, comp.text.sgml
        and comp.mail.multi-media. It wasn't until 1996 that an informational RFC 1945, HTTP/1.0
        was released. This was followed by a proposed standard, RFC 2068, HTTP/1.1 in 1997 and a
        draft standard, RFC 2616, HTTP/1.1 in 1999.

        For comparison, consider the earlier development of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
        (SMTP). This protocol evolved through early drafts submitted in 1980 (RFC 772) and 1981
        (RFC 780 and RFC 788). It became an internet standard with RFC 821 in 1982.

        In both examples, the original standard was iteratively extended as needed to fit contempo-
        rary Internet contexts.

        Take a few minutes to look at the abstracts of these RFC drafts and standards. Read through
        the introduction of RFC 2616, HTTP/1.1 (published in 1999) and compare it to the introduc-
        tion and "The SMTP Model" from RFC 821 (published in 1982). How do these two RFCs dif-
        fer? How are they the same?

  In 1993 I joined the Neuronal Pattern Analysis group at the Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at
  Urbana-Champaign, as a post-doctoral researcher. One project I was a part of was exploring ways we
  could share raw data between research labs around the globe using the Internet. At the same time, the
  University's National Center for Supercomputing Applications was developing NCSA Mosaic, the first
  widely used graphical web browser. Participation as part of this research team seeking to collect, store,
  and share large raw datasets using HTML through our in-house NCSA Mosaic HTTP server meant
  spending considerable time poring through USENET discussions and through review of web page raw
  HTML, looking for examples as the protocol was still in early development. And sometimes it meant
  getting pre-notifications of changes through hallway conversations with those working on Mosaic.

  And for me, this journey through systems for networking and internetworking took another radical
  turn when in 1995 I decided to test the waters outside of the tenure system and neuroscience to join
  the team developing Prairienet Community Network at the Graduate School of Library and Informa-
  tion Science, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

 The Free-net and Community Networking Movements

  In 1995, an informational Request for Comments, RFC 2235, was submitted by Robert H. Zakon and
  the Internet Society. As noted in the introduction, "This document presents a history of the Internet in
  timeline fashion, highlighting some of the key events and technologies which helped shape the Inter-
  net as we know it today."7 This includes a listing of many different national and international internet-
  working organizations and companies, including the Cleveland Free-Net, launched in 1986 by Tom
  Grundner of Case Western Reserve University.

  Cleveland Free-Net used a community-based bulletin-board system (BBS) model in which com-
  munity forums are hosted by a community server to facilitate the sharing of public information of
  local citizens online and launched a wider free-net movement. Free-nets made use of local voice-grade
  landline phone dial-ups to provide free or low-cost access from home, school, and library comput-
  ers to a multiuser computer within a central location of a community. The phone was connected to a
  Modulator-Demodulator, or modem, that turned the text data provided from computing devices into
  the binary zeros and ones being used by that digital network through connection to a remote set of
  modems connected to the multiuser computer. The multiuser computer itself ran a range of server
  applications in addition to BBS software and also provided access to the Internet, including USENET
  with its store-and-forward framework, that together inspired much of the forums that became avail-
  able through the emergence of the World Wide Web because of HTML and HTTP.

  In a speech delivered to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1994, Grundner brought
  forward the term "cybercasting" to compare Free-nets to "broadcasting." He goes on to provide the fol-
  lowing vision:

        Basically, it's the same service you find in radio or television networks. You might have,
        let's say, a local radio station here in Urbana and you might have your own radio talk show
        hosts or disc jockeys. But you might also be taking feeds from ABC Radio. Similarly, we
        have independent affiliates who operate their community computer systems, drawing upon
        local people, local information resources, and so forth. Then we try to supplement that with
        high-quality feeds from the network level--information services and features that supple-
        ment what they're able to do locally.8

  For Grundner and the Free-net movement, community computing was about building stronger citizens
  through community conversations and information sharing, advances in local K-12 education and gov-
  ernment two-way interactions, support for small- and medium-sized businesses who could not oth-
  erwise afford the services only major corporations could obtain, the agricultural community who are
  often left out of conversations with county officials and extension agents, and hundreds of local com-

   munity organizations. Further, while community media historically has made strong use of Public,
   Educational, and Government access (PEG) cable television channels to express concerns for local
   issues, engage in democratic debate, and deliver reliable access to information, art, and music, they too
   found this community computing movement of great value. And with its official grand opening in June
   1994, this embodied the inspiration and dreams of Prairienet Free-net, later called Prairienet Commu-
   nity Network, which I joined in the fall of 1995. Other early networks also were being developed and
   embedded similar principles, including the Community Memory project from the late 1970s, FidoNet
   and other public bulletin board systems, and other early community networking systems including
   PEN (Public Electronic Network) and the WELL (Whole Earth `Lectronic Link) in California.

         Community Networks

         Every community has a system of `core values' that help maintain its `web of unity'... A
         community network supports these core values by supporting the information and com-
         munications needs of smaller communities within the larger community and by facilitating
         the exchange of information between individuals within these small communities ... and by
         encouraging the exchange of information among communities."

         Douglas Schuler, "Community networks and the evolution of civic intelligence"9

         Prairienet

         Prairienet is used to make community information available in electronic form and is also
         used as a free access point to Internet information resources... The fundamental question to
         be addressed by the research is, "to what extent is Prairienet serving its intended purpose as
         a community forum for education and information access?"

         Gregory B. Newby and Ann P. Bishop, "Community System Users and Uses"10

   Free-nets and other community networks in part served an essential role at a time when Internet
   access remained the venue of research projects using the NSFNET-based Internet. In 1995, NSFNET
   reverted to a research network backbone linking super-computing centers, with United States WAN
   traffic now routed through interconnected commercial network service providers and backbone
   providers, opening up full commercial use of the Internet. Throughout the late 1990s and into the
   mid-2000s, core aspects of Free-nets and centrally-located community computing systems provid-
   ing dialup access were replaced by commercial Internet Service Providers and larger web service
   providers. Any Free-nets that remained, such as Austin Freenet, changed their focus to technology
   training and access to residents of the city. Others, such as Prairienet, ended over a decade of service as

the host School of Information Sciences continues its work to foster community networking through
graduate and undergraduate education, community inquiry and participatory action research, service-
learning and design studios, and mentoring and internships. In so doing, a range of community-based
stakeholders strive to bridge silos by coming together to innovate-in-use Internet-based tools for social
and democratic participation. At their core, community networks remain a gathering of schools and
libraries, of governmental and small and medium businesses, and of a range of community organiza-
tions addressing local issues for all sections of the community, thereby advancing community devel-
opment for a more just society.

The Commercialization of the Internet

During the early 1980s, some commercial vendors began to incorporate Internet protocols into their
digital artifacts used on their competitive, private network services, as noted by some of the early
Internet developers in their article "A Brief History of the Internet." Then in 1983, the United States
Department of Defense separated from ARPANET to create its own separate network, MILNet. In
1986, the United States National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) was created, establishing five
super-computing centers to provide open high-computing to ARPANET users around the world. Loca-
tions included Princeton (John Von Neumann Center, JFNC), Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center, PSC), University of California, San Diego (San Diego Supercomputing Center, SDSC), the Uni-
                                                                                                                     2A: Digital Internets, Past and Present 314

   versity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (National Center for Super-computing Applications, NCSA), and
   Cornell (Theory Center). In 1988 an NSF-initiated conference at Harvard's Kennedy School of Govern-
   ment entitled "The Commercialization and Privatization of the Internet" built off of a growing number
   of initial three-day workshops to begin a broader conversation on the topic. This shortly led to the
   establishment of the first Interop trade show, started in September of that same year. Vendors also
   started attending periodic formal meetings of IETF meetings to discuss new ideas regarding Internet
   protocols. The late 1980s and 1990s also saw a strengthening of US intellectual property rights poli-
   cies. This "pro-patent" posture opened up possibilities of university faculty-founded firms and estab-
   lishment of new public-private partnerships.11 Combined, this established a rich, mutually cooperative
   evolution of the Internet for a range of research, end user, and vendor stakeholders from a primarily
   military-funded research program to an internetworking suite available both publicly and privately.
   And so while other global models of internetworking faded, such as the French Cyclades Network
   which lost out to corporate monopolies, the US Internet model rapidly expanded through this pub-
   lic-private partnership, some of which was introduced through initial first use via local and regional
   community networks.

   In 1995, the United States National Science and Technology Council's (NSTC) Committee on
   Computing, Information and Communications chartered the Federal Network Council (FNC). The
   NSTC itself is a Cabinet-level council established as Executive Order 12881 in 1993 by President Bill
   Clinton early in his first term and is part of the Executive Branch's Office of Science and Technology
   Policy. The membership of the FNC consisted of one representative from each federal agency whose
   programs utilize interconnected TCP/IP Internet networks. Its charter was two-fold:

            · to provide a forum for networking collaborations among Federal agencies to meet their
               research, education, and operational mission goals.

            · to bridge the gap between the advanced networking technologies being developed by
               research FNC agencies and the ultimate acquisition of mature versions of these technolo-
               gies from the commercial sector. This helps build the NII, addresses Federal technology
               transition goals, and allows the operational experiences of the FNC to influence future Fed-
               eral research agendas.

         RESOLUTION: The Federal Networking Council (FNC) agrees that the following language
         reflects our definition of the term "Internet." "Internet" refers to the global information system
         that -- (i) is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet
         Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons; (ii) is able to support communications
         using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent exten-
         sions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and (iii) provides, uses or makes accessi-

         infrastructure described herein.12

   As we've worked through this textbook, we've explored the ever-present social shaping of technology
   in recognition that technologies are not, and can never be, neutral. The systems for internetworking
   are both deeply technical systems and also deeply social systems. They are sociotechnical artifacts and
   systems. They have been designed, developed, and implemented within a range of political, economic,
   social, and cultural structures. The outcomes of this shaping of sociotechnical design and implemen-
   tation will positively impact and shape some but not others, and also potentially negatively impact
   and shape some. Remember that tinkering is a research process, one that incorporates various aspects
   of the methodological landscape. Without incorporating critical paradigms though incorporation of
   moral and ethical questioning to unmask and expose hidden forms of oppression, false beliefs, and
   commonly held myths, we continue to advance the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and mili-
   tarism.

   So let's finish this chapter by exploring a limited government, supply-side, market-oriented think tank
   that has also been one of the shapers of the sociotechnical Internet, one that has influenced both gov-
   ernment policy and technology innovation very differently than that of the Free-net and community
   networking movement model.

   In 1993 The Progress & Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit think tank, was launched. The first paragraph
   of its mission statement notes:

         The Progress & Freedom Foundation is a market-oriented think tank that studies the impact
         of the digital revolution and its implications for public policy. Its mission is to educate poli-
         cymakers, opinion leaders, and the public about issues associated with technological change,
         based on a philosophy of limited government, free markets, and individual sovereignty.

   In August 1994, the foundation released the publication "Cyberspace and the American Dream: A
   Magna Carta for the Knowledge Age." In its preamble, authors Esther Dyson, George Gilder, George
   Keyworth, and Alvin Toffler begin by stating:

         The central event of the 20th century is the overthrow of matter. In technology, economics,
         and the politics of nations, wealth in the form of physical resources has been losing value
         and significance. The powers of mind are everywhere ascendant over the brute force of
         things.

         In a First Wave economy, land and farm labor are the main "factors of production." In a Sec-
         ond Wave economy, the land remains valuable while the "labor" becomes massified around
         machines and larger industries. In a Third Wave economy, the central resource a single word

         broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture, ideology, and values is
         actionable knowledge.

         The industrial age is not fully over. In fact, classic Second Wave sectors (oil, steel, auto pro-
         duction) have learned how to benefit from Third Wave technological breakthroughs just as
         the First Wave's agricultural productivity benefited exponentially from the Second Wave's
         farm mechanization.

         But the Third Wave, and the Knowledge Age it has opened, will not deliver on its potential
         unless it adds social and political dominance to its accelerating technological and economic
         strength.13

   Soon after this publication, a range of scholars began introducing the terms technolibertarianism or
   cyberlibertarianism to explore the ways both the political left and right within the United States were
   beginning to incorporate these central Third Wave concepts of a Knowledge Age introduced within the
   Magna Carta. In "Cyberlibertarian Myths and the Prospects for Community," Langdon Winner high-
   lights three key aspects within the Magna Carta:

           1. technological determinism -- changes that are inevitable, irresistible, and world-transform-
               ing;

           2. radical individualism -- ecstatic self-fulfillment and the putting aside of anything that might
               hinder the pursuit of rational self-interest;

           3. supply-side, free market capitalism as formulated by Milton Friedman.14

   UK media theorists Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron explore how the US New Left movement
   that formed as part of '60s radicalism -- collaboratives with campaigns against militarism, racism, sex-
   ual discrimination, homophobia, mindless consumerism, and pollution -- and the US New Right --
   those resurrecting an older form of economic liberalism based on liberty of individuals within the mar-
   ketplace -- came together in a hybrid faith they termed the Californian Ideology. In "The Californian
   Ideology," they go on to underline:

   "Crucially, anti-statism provides the means to reconcile radical and reactionary ideas about technolog-
   ical progress. While the New Left resents the government for funding the military-industrial complex,

   the New Right attacks the state for interfering with the spontaneous dissemination of new technolo-
   gies by market competition."15

   More recent work by David Golumbia indicates there remains a strong political voice championed by
   both the political right and left regarding the liberatory nature of mass computerization and "digital
   practices whose underlying motivations are often explicitly libertarian." For instance, Golumbia states:

   "We must not mistake the `computer revolution' for anything like a political revolution as various
   leftist traditions have understood it. The only way to achieve the political ends we pursue is to be
   absolutely clear about what those ends are. Putting the technological means for achieving them ahead
   of clear consideration of the ends is not merely putting the cart before the horse; it is trusting in a tech-
   nological determinism that has never been and will never be conducive to the pursuit of true human
   freedom."16

   In considering the prospects for community given the broad adoption of cyberlibertarianism, Winner
   concluded by noting: "Superficially appealing uses of new technology become much more problematic
   when regarded as seeds of evolving, long term practices. Such practices, we know, eventually become
   parts of consequential social relationships. Those relationships eventually solidify as lasting institu-
   tions. And, of course, such institutions are what provide much of the actual framework for how we live
   together. That suggests that even the most seemingly inconsequential applications and uses of innova-
   tions in networked computing be scrutinized and judged in the light of what could be important moral
   and political consequences. In the broadest spectrum of awareness about these matters we need to
   ask: Are the practices, relationships and institutions affected by people's involvement with networked
   computing ones we wish to foster? Or are they ones we must try to modify or even oppose?"17

   The last half century has seen a rich exploration of various sociotechnical artifacts and systems for
   digital networking and internetworking. These tools have provided opportunities to address a range of
   individual and social issues and meet a range of individual and social needs. The commercialization of
   the Internet has further opened up amazing possibilities for community networking and the advance-
   ment of stronger citizens through community conversations and information sharing, education and
   government two-way interactions, support for small- and medium-sized businesses, of agriculture, of
   community media, of Makerspaces, DIY and do-it-together culture, and of many, many more means
   for advancing civic intelligence. But the social shaping of technology also includes a range of political,
   economic, and social influencers that have problematically shaped the technologies and our visions for
   these technologies.

   As Eduardo Villanueva-Mansilla notes in "Section 2.3. The early mirage, and the current desert" of his
   2020 First Monday paper "View of ICT policies in Latin America: Long-term inequalities and the role
   of globalized policy-making"18:

         Inequalities, both new and old, find a home on the Internet, and multiply happily. Commer-
         cial giants dominate the conversation and fail to pay their due. Public spheres become toxic
         and uncontrollable through the tools that exist on the Net19. Nonetheless, governments ded-
         icate resources to promote access and discuss policy frames in order to provide an attractive
         environment to invest. This points to a divorce between the reality of the past 25 years of
         Internet development, and the imagination of its potential. How to deal with this divorce
         (or may we call it a divide?) requires an understanding of the ideological perspective behind
         most of the development/promotional efforts about the Internet. This is especially seen by
         those undertaken by the government themselves, as it has happened in Latin America and
         specially in Peru for the past decades.

   But we do not stand at an "either/or" inflection point. Internetworking can happen in many shapes
   and forms which regularly incorporate the Internet suite of protocols and applications. The key is
   the level to which we enter into use of an Internet-based tool from a `thing-oriented' compared to a
   `person-oriented' framing. A dominant narrative is centered within `thing-oriented' framings such as
   cyberlibertarianism. But as we work to open new critical lenses that help us see the `person-centered'
   counterstories past and present, and enter into communities of practice across difference using collec-
   tive leadership and community inquiry, we begin to dismantle the many webs of oppression within
   these sociotechnical systems while effectively using carefully selected aspects to achieve social justice
   outcome goals, as Judy Wajcman notes in a video segment on the impact of digital technology. [Watch
   the video "Gearty Grilling: Judy Wajcman on the impact of digital technology" online.]

  Lesson Plan

   In this session we begin our journey exploring the Internet and other digital internets which serve as
   the base of many of our Networked Information Systems today. The history of internetworking, the
   range of organizations that helped in its design, and the influence specifically of the United States in
   shaping and codifying these designs is important to remember as we move forward in the Rainbow
   Unit. The mutual shaping, past and present, is both significantly solidified within the black boxes that
   are our daily smart devices used within our smart homes and smart cities, and also highly fluid within
   our tinker, maker, and DIY innovation-in-use spaces.

Essential Resources:

The essential resources for this extended session chapter are many and varied.

First, skim these in connection with related sections of this chapter, bringing in a critical mindset to
tease this sociotechnical review apart a bit further as it relates to the broader themes of this textbook.
With this as an entry point, carefully choose two or three of these to delve further into the ways we
are not confronting our ignorance on the various conflicting impacts based on the social shaping of
technologies, but rather the ways our hidden intelligent practices have impacted other individuals and
communities.

Professional Journal Reflections:

In the Blue Unit chapter 2A: The Methodological Landscape we explored the assumptions that serve as
a landscape for the three major research paradigms within Western science today. For those working
within positivist paradigms, the purpose for research is to discover regularities and causal laws so
that people can explain, predict and control events and processes. For those working within the inter-
pretive paradigms, the reason for research is to describe and understand phenomena in the social
world and their meanings in context. And for those within the critical paradigms, the reason for
research is to empower people to change their conditions by unmasking and exposing hidden forms of
oppression, false beliefs and commonly held myths. We've also discovered that the deductive reason-
ing or logic used within positivist paradigms is essential for tasks such as the writing of programming
code which goes on to shape development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. As we saw in
the Blue Unit, though, writing instructions integrated into education using inductive reasoning can
lead to errors in the instructions which themselves need to be done using deductive logic as was seen
in writing the first three notes of the middle-C scale as part of 2B: Make Music with Code.

Throughout the book, another core assumption is drawn from critical paradigms which acknowledge
that any research is a moral-political and value-based activity which require us to explicitly declare
and reflect on their value position(s) and provide arguments for their normative reasoning. As Richard
                                                                                                                 2A: Digital Internets, Past and Present 322

Milner notes, it is important within critical research for us to research the self, research the self in rela-
tion to others, to take part in engaged reflection to think what is happening in a particular research
community, and to shift inquiry from self to system. I have found this to be relevant as much within
tinkering as research as it is within formal research in academia and the business sector.

Thus, the goal of this week's Professional Journal Reflection is to help bring together reflections of our
self into conversation with our inquiry into the Internet past and present to advance a more holistic
understanding of networked information systems which is shaped by, and which shapes, the relation
of self and others.

        1. Using a positivist paradigm lens, note several key technical takeaways from the chapters
            and essential resources from this session of the Rainbow Unit.

        2. Using an interpretivist paradigm lens, move from the simple nuts and bolts to note several
            evocative insights from this session of the Rainbow Unit.

        3. From a critical paradigm lens and acknowledgement of a non-neutral stance, what mutual
            shaping has influenced the development and use of the Internet and major sociotechnical
            artifacts that are parts of our personal and professional lives? With our professional
            engagement with others around us near and far?

        4. What first thoughts do you have on how we can work together to actively decodify key
            terms and concepts related to networked information systems to better understand ways in
            which the oppressive components within these can be countered moving forward?

                          2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet

Technical Overview

                     A visualization of the seven conceptual layers of the Open Systems Interconnection
                     (OSI) model.

The hardware infrastructure of the Internet happens at layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model. Layer 1 pro-
vides the cable and radio wave media that interconnect devices, along with the network interface
controller (NIC) installed within the computing device to which media connects. When formally con-
nected to an Internet Protocol (IP) network the NIC becomes a node on the network. Layer two of
the OSI model provides the identification mechanisms for the node. A computing device can have one
or more than one NIC. For instance, your laptop may be simultaneously connected to a network with
both a wired Ethernet media & NIC and a Wi-Fi media and NIC, and your smartphone to a cell radio
wave media and NIC and also a Wi-Fi media and NIC. Each NIC is uniquely identifiable so that infor-

                                                                                 323
                                                                                                                  2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet 324

mation is correctly disseminated to the appropriate device. To direct the flow of information between
nodes, there must be an interconnect device or a combination of devices to facilitate communica-
tions. The only exception is when two nodes use the NIC, node identifiers, and media to do direct
peer-to-peer communications.

 Computer Network Building Blocks

  There are four main components needed for a computer or other computing device to join as a node
  on a local area network (LAN) within a building such as a home, library, office, or cafe.

 Node Identifier

  Any device directly connected to the network that has been assigned a unique identifier on that
  network. Examples include:

             · MAC address (also known as the hardware, physical, or Ethernet address): The serial
                number for Ethernet cards.

             · IP address: The address used by the Internet protocol.

 Network Interface controller (NIC)

  The hardware necessary for a node to connect to a network. Examples include:
             · Ethernet controller (wired Cat5/Cat6 or wireless/Wi-Fi): Used for LANs.
             · MODEM (cable, DSL, dialup): Used for traditional internetworking with the Internet.
             · Optical Network Terminal (ONT): Used for fiber to the home Internet.

 Media

  The communications technology used to connect nodes. Examples include:
             · Copper transmits low-voltage electricity (e.g., wired Ethernet, DSL, cable, dialup).
             · Fiber optic transmits light (e.g., fiber to the home).
             · Radio waves (e.g., wireless Ethernet or Bluetooth).
   325 2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet

   Interconnect Device

    A device used to interconnect nodes. Examples include:

               · Switch or hub: Wired Ethernet LAN.
               · Access point: Wireless Ethernet (Wi-Fi) LAN.
               · Router or gateway: Builds an Internet by connecting different LANs together.
               · Hotspot:

                             a. A popular alternative term to access point on a Wi-Fi LAN; or
                             b. A mobile device (e.g. Smartphone, Coolpad Surf, NetStick USB Modem, or

                                 MiFi 8000) that is both a cell-based wireless router and a Wi-Fi access point
                                 providing Internet access through the cell-based Internet connection.1

  Nodes interconnect with other nodes in different ways, depending on how far they reach geographi-
  cally, how many people are meant to use them, and who primarily owns or controls them. Some cover
  a very small area and may be used for very specific devices, while others are more general, cover larger
  areas, and are especially effective for use on the Internet.

   Network Areas of Coverage

               · Personal Area Networks (PAN) provide a simple computer network organized
                  around a few personal devices, allowing the transfer of files, photos, and music without
                  the use of the Internet or your home's local network. Two common examples would
                  be your Bluetooth headset or keyboard and mouse. Depending on the Bluetooth range
                  selected (or chosen for you), this could span three feet, ten feet, or one hundred feet.
                  Beyond Bluetooth, other common PAN connectivities include Infrared (IR), USB, Zig-
                  Bee, Wi-Fi, and radio frequency (RF, including short-distance AM and FM radio).

               · The simplest type of Internet-based area network is a Local Area Network (LAN). A
                  LAN is a network with connected devices in a close geographical range. It is generally
                  owned, managed, and used by people in a building. For example, connecting to a Wi-Fi
                  network at a coffee shop or library would mean that your device would be a node on
                  the café or library's publicly accessible LAN. Many public spaces may have a second,

                                                                                                                  2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet 326

                private LAN for use by staff only.
             · A Wireless LAN (WLAN) is another name for a LAN used over Wi-Fi. In some cases,

                a router is used to strategically isolate the wired Ethernet LAN from the wireless Eth-
                ernet LAN and may therefore distinguish between the networks specifically using LAN
                versus WLAN connectivity.
             · A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is a collection of LANs and devices in an area
                the size of a city. A version of a MAN is a Campus Area Network (CAN), which
                would be a network the size of a college, organization, or business campus. These types
                of networks are typically community-owned and/or managed, and may also provide
                the infrastructure for one or more local/regional Community Networks.
             · A Wide Area Network (WAN) covers the size of a state, country, hemisphere, or
                globe. A WAN is comprised of multiple MANs and/or LANs interconnected through a
                backbone or core transmission line or set of lines. The primary WAN we know of today
                is the Internet, a federation of local and regional networks interconnected through
                transmission lines typically owned and managed by one or more Internet service
                providers (ISP: the business that provides connections to each LAN), network service
                providers (NSPs: the business(es) that provide connections between ISPs), and back-
                bone providers (the business(es) that provide the more extended connections between
                NSPs).

The backbone of the Internet, that part serviced by network service providers and backbone providers,
is constructed using a fiber optic cable infrastructure. To carry signals rather than using electrical
signals, glass fibers are used to carry light, with upwards of a thousand fibers being located within a
single cable cladding. It is often the case that more fibers are included within a cable than are needed
at the time of installation (called dark fiber) to allow for future growth without additional instal-
lation expense. Further, Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM) is used to allow multiple different
wavelengths of light to be distributed on each strand of fiber (multiplexed) and then later separated
(de-multiplexed), transmitting multiple communication streams simultaneously though a single light
pulse. As technology continues to improve, replacement of multiplexers for newer models is allowing
for still further data to be transferred over existing lines without additional installation expense of the
cables themselves. The data itself is transferred using pulses of light transmitted using light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) or small lasers. This can be done at very high speeds and over very long distances
with less susceptibility to interference. A few different techniques are used to separate different wave-
lengths of light in ways that allow multiple communication streams, each at high frequencies, sup-
porting higher capacity in addition to high frequencies. This opens up data transfer rates using fiber
optics that are 20 to 1,000 times faster than copper cable and outdoor Wi-Fi Internet service and for
a larger customer base. As Susan Crawford points out in her 2018 book, Fiber: The coming tech revo-
   327 2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet

  lution--and why America might miss it, "If the information-carrying capacity of copper wire is like a
  two-inch-wide pipe, fiber optic is like a river fifteen miles wide."2
  Within the United States, most Internet service providers, on the other hand, make use of existing
  communication technologies developed for phone and cable television to also provide Internet access.
  Indeed, it has often been marketed as the "triple play," a discounted package providing these three at a
  discounted price compared to the purchase of each one individually from the provider, or from several
  different providers. In some cases, a provider primarily uses one technology, such as the cable Inter-
  net used by Xfinity/Comcast. On the other hand, depending on your geographic location, you can get
  Internet service from AT&T via copper digital subscriber line (DSL) or fiber optics Internet lines, as
  well as via radio waves through their wireless phone services.

               · 5G is based on previous-generation cellular principles that use current low-band wire-
                  less frequencies with slower speed but longer distances3

                               5G-NR (New Radio) can incorporate mid-band and millimeter wave
                                 (mmWave) high-band frequency bands.

                               mmWave provides the highest speeds but with a much shorter distance
                                 range, while mid-band balances data transfer speeds and distance covered.

                               5G is capable of transferring data at ten to one hundred times the speed of
                                 4G within these new radio frequencies; Non-Standalone (NSA) 5G allows
                                 for the combination of 4G infrastructure for voice communications and
                                 mmWave frequencies for increased data capacity

                               5G upload speeds remain generally slower than download speeds, but have
                                 improved significantly over 4G, especially within the mmWave band being
                                 directed towards Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

                               Actual performance can vary significantly, as some packages provided by
                                 5G providers for businesses will differ significantly from those provided to
                                 the general public, and information on availability and for whom can prove
                                 difficult to find.

               · Equivalent to bus (shared) topology as radio signals can overlap; half duplex
               · Applications of cellular services generally prioritize download speeds

   Satellite Internet

               · Indoor Unit (IDU) provides a modem connecting premises router to antenna dish (out-
                  door unit, or ODU).

               · The very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) dish antenna, which can also be used for
                  satellite television service, requires a clear line of sight to facilitate microwave commu-
                  nications directly with the geostationary satellite serving the Internet provider, or to a
                  shared Gateway Earth Station (gateway hub) that then connects to the satellite.

               · Broadband speeds have improved considerably, with download speeds now reaching up
                  to 40 Mbps. Download speeds are prioritized over upload speeds.

               · Latency of signal, the delay between end node data transfers, is typically over 500 mil-
                  liseconds. Wired Ethernet on a LAN is typically below 2 milliseconds; regional copper

For most homes, community organizations, and small office/home office contexts, a gateway router
is used that provides a WAN port used to connect the media leading to the first router of the Internet
service provider. While sometimes this WAN port may need to first connect to a DSL/Cable modem
or a fiber optics Optical Network Terminal (ONT), in other cases, this interconnect device is inte-
grated into the router. Typically, a gateway router will also incorporate both wired Ethernet switch and
Wi-Fi access point interconnect devices for interconnectivity on the LAN side of the router. In addi-
tion, a gateway router typically integrates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server
that dynamically or statically assigns IP addresses to connected nodes on the LAN. The router will be
configured to route essential Internet "phone book" type lookups to a designated ISP or third-party
Domain Name System (DNS) server that contains a database of public IP addresses and associ-
ated IP names. All of these additional services facilitate its core function as the router between the
LAN and the WAN.

We've worked through quite a few underlying concepts related to computer networks. Before moving
into our first exercise, take a few minutes to review what we've already covered and also to get a
glimpse at materials we'll be covering next by watching Carrie Anne Philbin's introduction to Com-
puter Networks, Crash Course Computer Science episode #28.
                                                                                                                  2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet 330

Exercise: Listing Building Blocks of Your Computing Devices

Before moving on further, take some time to look at your own Local Area Network (LAN), whether
it's the one in your place of residence, the LAN of a family or friend, or that of your workplace, library,
community center, etc. To the extent possible, do this at a physical location where you can see the
various network building blocks, and maybe do it with the person who took the lead in setting things
up if you weren't the one who did that.

A Local Area Network (LAN) documentation template.

Download the Excel spreadsheet template.
        1. Begin with the information regarding the Internet Service Provider connecting the
            premises to the Internet. What type of communication technology and media is used to
            connect the premises to the Internet? What are the specified upload and download speeds
            for the service being provided? Are there any monthly data caps limiting use? As other
            things come to mind, also include notes on this information.
331 2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet

        2. Next, explore the gateway router that provides the first hop between the WAN and the LAN
            you are documenting. To the extent possible, document the MAC and IP addresses of the
            router's WAN Network Interface Controller, and also that of the router's LAN NIC (remem-
            ber, many devices have multiple network interface controllers, and therefore multiple node
            identifiers). Are there additional devices between the outdoor media and the router, such as
            a modem or optical network terminal? Does the router provide one or more LAN ports?
            Does it serve as a wireless access point? What are the settings for these? Does it provide a
            DHCP server giving IP addresses to other LAN nodes, and if so, what are the settings for
            this service? Are any IP addresses reserved for specific devices? Does it forward port
            requests that come to its WAN IP address to specific LAN node IP addresses? Are there any
            security access controls, block sites, and block services being used?

        3. Finally, do all you can to document every node connected on this LAN, noting the type of
            device, the media being used, the assigned MAC and IP address, and any notes you think
            would be helpful to keep on record. Remember to that your laptop, printer, Raspberry Pi,
            and other devices might be connected through multiple means such as via WiFi and also
            wired Ethernet. You might also document devices that are connected to multiple different
            networks, for instance a smartphone that is connected to the LAN using WiFi and also to a
            cell network. And there may be devices like that smartphone that also serve as hotspot
            routers, connecting some devices to the Internet via the cell network instead of the LAN's
            ISP.

Key Takeaways

This exercise synthesizes concepts integral to computer and network building blocks. It also demon-
strates an important principle regarding documentation. It's easy to forget some of this information
until computer network trouble is encountered. Filling out this form and occasionally updating it
before again tucking it away in an easy-to-access file folder can prove of significant value when trou-
bleshooting an array of computer network issues.

Also, it is sometimes helpful to have these notes on hand and add to them strategically in combination
with the Network Troubleshooting chapter.

More on IP Addresses and IP Names

When we type in a URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, in a web browser, we're almost always typing
in an Internet Protocol name. Consider for instance the URL to this book:

https://iopn.library.illinois.edu/pressbooks/demystifyingtechnology/
                                                                                                                     2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet 332

  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the ever-present client-server protocol we have used for the
  last several decades to move information across the Internet. In this case, the first part, https, indicates
  the resource we're searching for is the secured HTTP protocol (HTTPS). The second part indicates the
  providing resource is the web server with name iopn.library.illinois.edu. The last two parts indicate the
  directory and subdirectory in which the specific resources being requested are located. Not specified
  is the specific file, which in this case probably defaults to index.html, index.php, or something similar.

  But as with our phone system, the name doesn't truly get you in. Rather, the IP name needs to be
  associated with an IP address to pull up a web page, just as a person's or organization's name needs
  to be associated with a phone number to make a phone call. As of this writing, to get to the website,
  iopn.libary.illinois.edu is actually first converted to the IP address 130.126.162.192 in order to access
  the server. We can do this ourselves by typing in:

  https://130.126.162.192/pressbooks/demystifyingtechnology/

  Only IP names are converted to IP addresses. The directory and subdirectory listings use whatever
  characters were used to create those directories.

 The Formation of IP Domain Names

  The basic structure of the Internet came out of research launched in 1973 through funding from the
  U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Researchers developed came a system of
  protocols known as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), or TCP/IP
  Protocol Suite.

  In 1983, a conceptual framework for domain names was established through the RFC, in order to sup-
  port the growing number of applications spanning multiple hosts, networks, and finally the Internet.4
  RFCs 883 and 973 expanded the domain name system (DNS) to build an intentionally extensible sys-
  tem. In 1987, two new RFCs made 882, 883, and 884 obsolete. These were "Domain Names - Concepts
  and Facilities, Request for Comments 1034" and Domain Names - Implementation and Specifications
  Request for Comments 1035.

  These, too, have since had a range of RFC updates related to specific components of DNS: 1101, 1183,
  1348, 1876, 1982, 2065, 2181, 2308, 2535, 4033, 4034, 4035, 4343, 4035, 4592, 5936, 8020, 8482.

 Design Goals of DNS

  The primary design goal of the domain name system (DNS) "is a consistent name space which will
  be used for referring to resources. In order to avoid the problems caused by ad hoc encodings, names

4. P. Mockapetris, "Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities," Network Working Group, November 1983,

   333 2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet

  should not be required to contain network identifiers, addresses, routes, or similar information as part
  of the name."5

  Today, we have a range of top-level domains, some of which are based on organization type (e.g., .gov,
  .edu), geographic location (e.g., .uk, .es), or general category (e.g., .org, .com, .net, .site).

  Individuals and organizations can apply for second-level domains they can then use on the Internet
  (e.g., illinois.edu, raspberrypi.org, adafruit.com, wolske.site).

  Individuals and organizations can then create subdomains to extend their DNS tree to represent sub-
  groupings (e.g., ischool.illinois.edu, makecode.adafruit.com, martin.wolske.site).

  Fortunately, another thing the RFCs for domain names came up with was a solution to the pesky phone
  system.

  Consider that to call someone with our phone we need to know a series of numbers in order to dial
  them, employ our smartphone's contacts app, or create our own name/phone number listing system
  that informally maps a name we can remember to that series of numbers we need to dial.

  By contrast, all IP names that are to be accessible need to be formally mapped within a DNS server.
  Each registered second-level domain runs its own local DNS server that holds the authoritative map-
  pings. Top-level domain providers then run DNS servers that map the second-level domains, like illi-
  nois.edu, with the authoritative DNS servers for that domain. Internet service providers also run DNS
  servers that can be used to temporarily remember mappings for a set period of time, generally as
  defined by the second-level authoritative DNS servers. These are used by our local area networks so
  that we only have to type in illinois.edu in our web browser, and not 192.17.172.3.

 IP Addresses

  Internet Protocol addresses are the formal identifier of a node on a TCP/IP network. These addresses
  are used to route messages between source and destination across a network. Introduced in 1983, IP
  version 4 addresses use a 32-bit number broken into four 8-bit numbers separated by periods. When
  working in 8-bit binary notation, the decimal equivalent ranges between zero and 255. That is, an IPv4
  IP address can range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. Protocols and policies have been developed to
  provide clear guidance regarding these addresses.

  Almost all IP addresses, ones such as 192.17.172.3, are publicly accessible over the Internet. While some
  are not formally mapped to domain names widely known across the Internet, and some have strong
  security measures to restrict access, these numbers all can work across the Internet as needed/desired.
  For this reason, any router that is publicly available over the Internet (linking a Local Area Network

5. P. Mockapetris, "Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities, Request for Comments 1034," Network Working Group,
  November 1987, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034.
                                                                                                                  2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet 334

to Wide Area Networks) must have one of these public IP addresses. The router you use at your home,
office, or other organization to connect to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider is typically
assigned one of these public IP addresses. Often, it's only given to you temporarily, and may change
dynamically in structured or semi-structured ways. But for those needing to ensure reliable access to
nodes, for instance to web or database servers, you might purchase a static IP address so that you can
set up routing information in a DNS server.

In the late 1990s, the Internet began running into the limits of IP addresses in version 4. As a 32-bit
number, the maximum number of addresses available was 4,294,967,294. While that seems like a lot,
given an increasing number of people have several different Internet "smart" devices in addition to
their own laptop, four billion addresses isn't nearly enough. These protocols were given out in for-
mal ways that suited the 1970s' and 1980s' understanding of the limited uses of the Internet--a far cry
from what really evolved. IPv6 was ratified in 2017 but has yet to be fully implemented. It uses 128-bit,
allowing 3.4×1038 possible addresses.

Private IP Addresses

In creating the Internet Protocol, there were several blocks of IP addresses that were made private.
Anyone can have access to any of these without any required registration of them. The only caveat is
that they are meant for use on private networks and cannot be routed through the public Internet.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) directed the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
to reserve the following Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) address ranges for use on private networks:

IP address range             Maximum number of addresses available to a single Local Area
                             Network
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255    16, 777, 216
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255  1, 048, 576
192.168.0.0 -
192.168.255.255              65, 546

Private IPv4 addresses are widely used today. They allow a home or organization to create personal
private networks for internal use and then set up routers to translate traffic (NAT, or Network Address
Translation) meant to pass between that private network and the public Internet. Or more likely, when
you purchased Internet access through an Internet Service Provider, the router they purchased came
set up with a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. This router hands out private IP
addresses to nodes like your laptops, desktops, phones, and printers, or to those connecting to the
router via WiFi. That router also is a NAT doing the network address translation to its Wide Area Net-
work public IP address assigned to it by that Internet Service Provider.

Take a few minutes to watch Carrie Anne Philbin's introduction to the Internet, from Crash Course
Computer Science episode #29.

Exercise: Internet Detective

When the Internet is working at expected levels, we generally don't think about the extensive col-
lection of sociotechnical artifacts needed for one node to communicate with another node on a local
network, let alone the many more that allow us to connect when the end-points cross the globe. When
things are less than optimal, our responses vary from stepping out for coffee in passive acceptance,
to pangs of guilt that we must be doing something wrong, to anger that nothing can be done when
essential services are being lost.
This exercise equips us with sleuthing tools as we work to demystify the Internet further.

                                                                                                                  2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet 336

As explored in the extension chapter on Network Troubleshooting, there is a range of network trou-
bleshooting tools such as ping, traceroute, and speedtest. And there are a couple of tools that are espe-
cially helpful when sleuthing IP names: whois and dig. These tools are often installed or available to
be installed on different operating systems. They are also integrated into various webpage tool sets.

Before beginning, we must update and upgrade the Raspberry Pi operating system. This is necessary
for The General Purpose Raspberry Pi Web Server exercise later, so let's get a head start. At the same
time, we can install whois and dig in the operating system. The advantage to this is ensures the fol-
lowing exercises are completed in a consistent manner.

Enter these commands to update the Raspberry Pi and install the following packages. Note that each
of these commands start with the word "sudo." This indicates the command that follows (such as apt)
is issued as a superuser: a user with administrative privileges. As you go, you may periodically be
required to enter "y" for yes, or hit "q" after reading upgrade information, before you can proceed with
the upgrade.

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt update

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt upgrade

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt install dnsutils

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt install whois

Take a few minutes to test the strategies for tracking down problems and identifying if there's some-
thing we might do about them in Network Troubleshooting. Take a close look especially at traceroute.
What can the following tools tell you about a network?

         · link lights
         · ifconfig/ipconfig
         · ping
         · traceroute
         · speedtest

Let's do a quick initial exploration with the traceroute command to see where the Adafruit.com web-
site might be located physically:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ traceroute adafruit.com

For those running the traceroute command in a Windows PowerShell terminal, you'll type in tracert
adafruit.com instead.
337 2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet

I see a first hop that takes me to my gateway router on my LAN, and then the first router of my ISP. A
few lines down, I see I've reached ntt.net. A quick search on my web browser, typing in ntt.com in the
search bar, takes me to NTT Communications, a Global IP network. In my search, it actually defaulted
to Japanese which I had my browser translate, indicating this is likely a Japanese-owned corporation
providing backbone service in the United States. The 5th hop also includes "chcgil09.us" within the IP
name, which suggests the router is probably in Chicago, Illinois, United States. This would make sense
as I live and am doing this traceroute just a couple hours south in Champaign, Illinois. Hop seven takes
me to an IP address that includes the name "cloudflare" before finally reaching 104.20.38.240, the IP
address associated with the IP name adafruit.com as listed at the top of the traceroute.
                                                                                                                     2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet 338

  One thing that isn't fully clear is the details regarding the second hop of the traceroute, the one that
  leaves my premises and takes the packets of data to my ISP. This is a place where the `dig' command
  can sometimes prove very helpful. Before moving on to explore the use of that command, above is a
  snapshot of a search I did indicating that second hop was to iTV-3.com, the leaser of the fiber optics
  municipal area backbone network owned by the cities of Champaign and Urbana in collaboration with
  the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

  Once installation for dnsutils (which include the dig command) and whois is complete, proceed. Let's
  learn more about the dig command, starting with a search of the manual command within Linux before
  moving on to do a couple of searches specific to the Adafruit.com IP name and IP address.

  From the Raspberry Pi command line, type:

  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ man dig

  Dig (domain information groper) performs Domain Name System (DNS) lookups. It's a flexible tool
  which can take some time to understand fully. After skimming through the manual entry, let's do a
  couple of quick tests of the command.

  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ dig adafruit.com

  Here, we see within the "QUESTION SECTION" that we're looking for type `A' information. In DNS,
  `A' records store the 32-bit IPv4 address(es) associated with a hostname. Here, we see the IP name
  adafruit.com actually has been assigned two, 104.20.38.240 and 104.20.39.240.

  In a web browser, type in first one, then the other, of these IP addresses. What do you get as a web-
  page? What does this tell you?

  Let's do a reverse lookup to get the `PTR', a pointer from an IP address to the associated canonical
  name.

  pi@raspberrypi:~ $ dig -x 104.20.38.240

  Here we see in the "AUTHORITY SECTION" that ARPA provided `SOA', that is, the start of a zone
  of authority record, in which this IP address is associated with dns.cloudflare.com, the authoritative
  Domain Name Server for cloudflare.com. According to their "About" page, Cloudflare is a "service that
  protects websites from all manner of attacks, while simultaneously optimizing performance."6 While
  we don't know specifically how, we do know that Adafruit Industry is associated with, or makes use
  of in some way, Cloudflare.

  Let's now use the whois command to see if we can learn more about Adafruit and Cloudflare. From
  the command line, type:

6. "About Cloudflare," Cloudflare, accessed July 18, 2020, https://www.cloudflare.com/about-overview/.
339 2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ whois adafruit.com | less

(NOTE: the pipe symbol, found on the upper right between the "enter" and "backspace" keys on US
keyboards, takes the output from one command and passes it to the next command, in the case "less"
which allows us to view the contents one page at a time, moving back and forth within the text.)

Here, we see that the domain "adafruit.com" is registered through NameCheap, Inc. The name was cre-
ated in May 2005, was last updated July 2018, and will expire May 2026 -- IP names are not owned, but
only leased.

We then find that the Domain Name Server for the domain name "adafruit.com" is hosted by Cloud-
flare.com. Adafruit, Inc. may still host the website in-house, or may use another service to do the host-
ing using an Infrastructure-as-a-Service or Platform-as-a-Service "cloud" web server. From this, the
only thing we do know is that Cloudflare is performing as a Domain Name Server for Adafruit. The
DNS system actually has quite a range of record types that can be effectively used to support a wide
mix of IaaS, PaaS, and in-house infrastructures simultaneously in support of one domain name. As a
result, Adafruit.com can actually be making use of a number of different in-house and remote-located
services.

Use the up and down arrows to explore further the Registrant, Admin, Tech, and Name Server infor-
mation records for the Adafruit.com domain name. Then let's do the same for Cloudflare.com by typ-
ing:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ whois cloudflare.com | less

We do see some information regarding creation, updated, and expiry dates, and also the Name Sever
for the domain. But we also see that while early in the establishment of the Internet Protocol all
records were kept open, today many items can be held private from the public. So we see far less in
whois for Cloudflare than we did for Adafruit.

Before moving on, let's take a quick look at the whois manual:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ man whois

This description specifies this application searches for an object in the Request for Comments (RFC)
3912 database. Towards the bottom of the manual, NOTES are listed clarifying the search process and
some of the underlying official resources searched depending on context.

Key Takeaways

The tools traceroute, dig, and whois can provide us with a considerable amount of information
regarding the Internet backbone and the different end-point entitities that comprise the social and
                                                                                                                  2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet 340

technical infrastructures that for the most part we just think of as a website. From the LAN of the
personal computer running the web browser to the LAN of the computer or system of computers run-
ning the web server, there is an array of other LANs running the Domain Name Systems used to go
from IP names to IP addresses, and then to specific server LAN locations that may vary depending on
personal computer LAN geographic location, and then to various performance and security services,
such as that from Cloudflare, that are used to further advance performance, and the many other sys-
tems and services hosted on still other LANs, only some of which are using HTTP web services. This
Internet web, something that happens out of sight and mind, transfers untold packets of data around
the globe every millisecond, coming back to our personal electronic devices as web pages, email, and
audio/video communications in what appears to be a single, consolidated information artifact. What
we don't see is the wealth of sociotechnical artifacts all influencing the shaping of this single informa-
tion artifact we have received or transmitted.

Digging Deeper

From Adafruit to Raspberry Pi: We used several tools to explore the hops to Adafruit.com, the IP
address of Adafruit, the registrar used to lease the IP name and the Domain Name Server used to asso-
ciate the IP name with an IP address, and other bits and bobs about the provider of core parts of the
toolkit used for hands-on exercises in this textbook. Consider repeating this now to explore further
raspberrypi.org. How does this compare and contrast with the adafruit.com exploration? Is there any-
thing new that you learn from this parallel exploration?

The Author's Site: You can find my blog, http://martin.wolske.site, a subdomain under my leased
domain name wolske.site. This domain name is hosted by an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
provider, Dreamhost. As the iSchool was winding down Prairienet as a regional community network
web-hosting service in the early 2000s, we searched for alternative web-hosting services for our non-
profit patrons. Dreamhost not only provided web hosting, they also provided domain name registra-
tion, both at no cost for 501(c)(3) non-profits. As we helped move many non-profits to Dreamhost, I
also moved my own website there and pay a yearly fee so that I can continue leasing the domain name
wolske.site and also provide a WordPress service for subdomain martin.wolske.site. I have a second
website, http://apcg.wolske.site, that currently redirects to the IOPN home for this book. In the com-
ing years I may again deactivate this redirect and reactivate Dreamhost hosting of a WordPress site
and using a PressBooks theme to allow testing of new chapter sections for a 3rd edition if I so choose.
What can you learn about these two subdomain websites and the IaaS through the use of traceroute,
dig, and whois in addition to the things you can learn by using a web browser to go to these sites?

community cultural valued beings and doings. We found it technically impossible to set up commu-
nity wireless on the island because of volcanic deposits that significantly interrupted Wi-Fi signals. We
also found a nation that valued analog interactions within the marketplace and that made use of the
public and community radio stations available. And their ISP provided wired broadband that valued
upload speeds over download speeds so as to bring forward the information of people to others instead
of focusing only on centralized corporate information sources being brought down to the people. But
to bring this all to a broader audience, the official website of the nation is not located on the island.
Where is it located? Who oversees this website?

To do this last Internet detective dig, consider the different top-level domains that might be used in
association with this nation. Within the United States, where the Internet was birthed from ARPANET,
we would use the ".gov" top-level domain name for a government, and ".edu" top-level domain name
for an educational institution. But other nations needed to either apply to the United States for sec-
ond-level domains associated with a top-level domain (which they couldn't do for .gov but could do
for .com), or they needed to use their national top-level domain first (e.g., .co.uk specifies a .com site
within the United Kingdom). For this detective task, try out different subdomains, such as stp.gov.st
(the site listed within the Wikipedia listing for São Tomé), saotome.st, and saotome.org. Which are
trusted sources of information about the nation, if any? Who hosts these websites? Who manages
them? What is left unknown through the use of these tools?

Cloud Computing

When discussing Internet-based applications today, the term cloud or cloud computing is often used.
Indeed, sometimes the word cloud is used synonymously with the word Internet. Cloud computing,
like the Internet of Things, is an evolving paradigm. For this reason, in 2011 the National Institute for
Standards and Technology, as part of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Secu-
rity Management Act of 2002, developed a short document highlighting important aspects of cloud
computing. The goal was to provide a baseline for further discussion regarding cloud computing and as
a means for comparison of cloud services and deployment strategies. Essential characteristics include
on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.
Together, these provide a means by which multiple organizational, community, or public consumers
to which these services are deployed can each have great individual flexibility and freedom to unilat-
erally adjust services to fit current and anticipated demands across a range of devices. These essential
characteristics and deployment models are associated with one of three service models:

             · Software as a Service (SaaS): The consumer runs applications running on a cloud
                infrastructure.

             · Platform as a Service (PaaS): The consumer uses the cloud to deploy applications
                                                                                                                     2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet 342

                  they have created or acquired and that make use of programming languages, libraries,
                  services, and tools provided and/or supported by the provider as part of their platform.
               · Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): The consumer is provided a base of computer
                  resources such as processors, storage, and networks upon which they can deploy and
                  run software.

  Others have noted that the distinction between higher-level Platform and lower-level Infrastructure
  as a Service found within a large data center is not a crisp line and should be considered together as
  utility computing.7
  What is not generally recognized in relation to Cloud Computing is that, as part of the Internet with
  its foundational concepts of the end-to-end protocol creating a federation of the locals, data centers
  themselves are housed within their own Local Area Networks (LANs), some of which may be located
  within broader corporate Campus Area Networks (CANs). As part of a federation of the locals, these
  data centers should not be seen as centralized servers with overriding authority control, but rather

local nodes internetworked with other local nodes to provision hardware and software services, a con-
cept that was underlined within the Essential Characteristics section of the NIST Definition of Cloud
Computing.

Wouldn't it therefore be accurate to consider the research servers (e.g., Prairienet Community Network
server computers), the University library servers, and University campus infrastructure servers that
serve on- and off-campus associates a Cloud service?

Wrap Up

As noted earlier in this session, internetworking can happen in many shapes and forms which regu-
larly incorporate the Internet suite of protocols and applications. The key is the level to which we enter
into use of an Internet-based tool from a "thing-oriented" compared to a "person-oriented" framing.
Through the exercises within this part of the session, we've made use of different research methods to
explore key social and technical aspects of the Internet suite, seeking to decodify key terms and con-
cepts related to networked information systems.

I have been part of the iSchool at Illinois since 1995, where "we believe in the power of information to
change the world," as noted at the top of our 2022-2027 Strategic Plan. The strategic plan goes on to
highlight our innovative research at the intersections of inquiry and engagement, that includes inter-
disciplinary partnerships across broad communities. Internetworking happens both within the com-
munity and through the cloud, across Internet of Things devices on a local area network and local
end-point devices across the Internet, within local servers and on server farms. Socioeconomic and
sociopolitical frameworks have been introduced over the years, such as through the The Progress &
Freedom Foundation and in publications such as "Cyberspace and the American Dream: A Magna
Carta for the Knowledge Age," working to shift to an exclusive supply-side, free market capitalism
rooted within technological determinism and radical individualism. Emphasis is placed on removing
individuals from their information activist communities, and instead into positions of consumption of
data and information resources provided by platforms and services in the Cloud. Bringing together
topics introduced in the first two sessions of the Rainbow Unit, we can now see Neil Gershenfeld's
championing the bringing together the virtual world of bits and the physical world of atoms in innova-
tive ways, through the Fab Lab movement and Internet of Things devices and through his opposition to
the Bitnet of Things as the supply-side, free market solution to the grassroots Internet of Things alter-
native. For some economic and political framings, accelerating technological and economic strength
can only happen through social and political dominance that focuses on this unique free market cap-
italist form. But as I've presented various aspects of the Rainbow Unit nationally and internationally,
there have been a number of companies and community organizations that have provided their vig-
orous affirmation of the need for work at the intersection of inquiry and engagement beyond such a
singular, hyper-individualized socio-political and economic lens.
                                                                                                                  2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet 344

If we are to address the opportunities and urgent needs of the day, there is a need for both community
and corporate stakeholders to join in collective leadership. It may start through service and outreach,
but needs to actively work beyond these to engagement that is reciprocal and mutually beneficial.
Further, this requires the voices of diverse groups across cultures and disciplines. And as we've
explored throughout this book, that requires inquiry that brings in the voices of the marginalized
and oppressed. This can often start through works such as social justice storytelling, using story data,
information, knowledge, and wisdom to counter the dominant think-oriented narrative through con-
cealed stories to respond to stock stories, resistance stories to highlight injustices, and emerging and
transforming stories to (re)construct knowledge built on concealed and resistance stories. But as we
move forward within the Rainbow Unit, we'll also see the importance of such inquiry and engagement
to move into all realms of creative endeavors. This is true now more than ever, as noted within the
iSchool at Illinois's strategic plan's "Intersections of Inquiry and Engagement" section:

      "Information in the form of data underpins vast initiatives, including artificial intelligence
      (AI), machine learning, data science, big science, and more. Poor quality data, poorly inte-
      grated and conserved data, and unacknowledged data biases can corrupt these efforts."

As we've explored in this session, the infrastructure of the Internet provides an amazing opening, but
also some significant hurdles, for us to build from "person-centered" digital internets past and pre-
sent, and to also open new critical lenses to further challenge the dominant "thing-oriented" framings
through new pathways as we move forward within the information sciences.

Background Knowledge Probe

Across the journey through the Orange, Blue, and now Rainbow units, we've worked to increasingly
advance a more holistic and nuanced understanding of both the multiple social layers and the multiple
technical layers of networked information systems. Small decisions can lead towards large outcomes
which are both shaped by those small decisions, and which go on to shape future small aspects in an
iterative, nonlinear process. As we explored in Digital Internets Past and Present, the smallest decision
such as the end-to-end principle upon which the Internet Protocol is founded works to assure device-
to-device connectivity is front and center. And so there can be a community networking movement
or an Internet of Things philosophy allowing different devices to work as needed within their local
spaces while also assuring the ability to work with other devices working as needed within their local
spaces. Small or large, every other aspect of the Internet Protocol works to assure this internetworking
of end-point devices. But the end-to-end principle can also shape other pathways, too, such as when
individuals come together to form a nonprofit think tank such as the Progress and Freedom Founda-
tion from which the first publication "Cyberspace and the American Dream: A Magna Carta for the
Knowledge Age."
And so it is within our own lives that we are both shapers of, and people being shaped by, the events
and materials around us. Bring to mind a few recent events that have happened within your lived
experiences. Think broadly, considering your times outdoors as well as indoors, at stores and markets
as well as at community centers, with community and family as well as time alone.

         · What is one technical strength that was demonstrated by you or another person, human or
            more-than-human, within one or more of these events?

         · What is one economic strength that was demonstrated?
         · What social hierarchy and/or social equity was demonstrated by you or another person

            within one of these events?

 The "Digital Divide"

        Digital Divide

        The economic, educational, and social inequalities between those who have computers and
        online access and those who do not.

        Merriam-Webster, "Digital Divide" 1

  One central theme during President Bill Clinton's administration in the 1990s centered around foster-
  ing an economic transition based on technology investment national competitiveness. Goals included:
  long-term economic growth that creates jobs and protects the environment; making government more
  efficient and more responsive; and world leadership in basic science, mathematics, and engineering.2
  Core within these goals was an advancement of human capital through education and training, and
  the advancement of an "information superhighway" through general deregulation and targeted pub-
  lic-private partnerships. As part of the assessment, the National Telecommunications and Infor-
  mation Administration (NTIA) published a series of four Falling through the Net reports between
  1995 and 2000. The 1995 report brought forward a survey of "have-nots" in rural and urban Amer-
  ica, while the 1998 and 1999 reports were the first to especially highlight the "digital divide." The final
  report in this NTIA series moved from reporting on the digital divide to considering ways to move
  towards digital inclusion.

  For the Clinton administration, combating poverty and connecting the "have-nots" to a privatized
  National Information Infrastructure (NII) was considered a national economic emergency. As
  Daniel Greene notes in "Discovering the Divide: Technology and Poverty in the New Economy", it
  is important to frame the digital divide "as a poverty program as well as a technology program."3 To
  this end, a healthy citizenry was redefined as "a bundle of human capitals brought to market by infor-
  mation technology" and digital literacy training became a limited investment in "workforce oriented
  technology provision and training."4 Greene goes on to state:

        Within this first part of the digital divide frame, combating poverty is a problem not of alle-
        viating suffering in the present, but of making the correct investments in "information have-
        nots" so as to resolve current crises of underutilized labor, realize future capital growth, and
        achieve post-Cold War international economic hegemony.5

  The NII originated in 1991 as part of the High Performance Computing Act, created and introduced
  by then US Senator Al Gore who had spent years working to this point. In 1991, Gore published the
  following in Scientific American:

        The unique way in which the U.S. deals with information has been the real key to our suc-
        cess. Capitalism and representative democracy rely on the freedom of the individual, so
        these systems operate in a manner similar to the principle behind massively parallel com-
        puters. These computers process data not in one central unit but rather in tiny, less powerful
        units.

        Capitalism works on the same principle. People who are free to buy and sell products or
        services according to their individual calculations of the costs and benefits of each choice
        process a relatively limited amount of information but do it quickly. When millions of indi-
        viduals process information simultaneously, the aggregate result is incredibly accurate and
        efficient decisions.... Communism, by contrast, attempted to bring all the information to a
        large and powerful central processor, which collapsed when it was overwhelmed by ever
        more complex information.

        Al Gore, "Infrastructure for the Global Village"6

  Greene concludes by stating: "This conflation of different scales -- infrastructure and individual, per-
  sonal computing and national markets -- was not just New Democrat spin, but an overarching regula-
  tory regime emphasizing market competition as the primary political calculus and market citizenship
  as the primary political unit."7

        Take a minute to pause and reflect on how this consideration of a healthy citizenry and
        market citizenship compares to a key intention of Free-Net and Community Networking
        movements generally, and the information sciences more specifically, to foster an informed
        citizenry as highlighted in this textbook.

  One significant shaper of the "digital revolution" explored in the last session was the Progress & Free-
  dom Foundation, which sought to educate policymakers, opinion leaders, and the public regarding
  technological change based on a philosophy of limited government, free markets, and individual sov-
  ereignty. A central "futurist" thought leader who played a major role in fostering the creation of the
  Progress & Freedom Foundation was Newt Gingrich, a professor of history and geography at the Uni-
  versity of Western Georgia in the 1970s before serving in the US House of Representatives from 1979
  until 1999. His time as a Representative included serving as House Minority Whip from 1989 to 1995,
  and as Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999. Further, as noted in the Frontline episode "The Long

   March of Newt Gingrich," an initial principal project of the Progress and Freedom Foundation was Gin-
   grich's college course called "Renewing American Civilization".8 The course, like "Cyberspace and the
   American Dream," and released at about the same time, highlighted an important need to move from
   a Second Wave to a Third Wave economy by adding "social and political dominance to its accelerating
   technological and economic strength."9 As a professor of history, for Gingrich the renewal of American
   civilization required something more than the reinvention of government which the Clinton adminis-
   tration was working towards -- including through their digital divide framing that was emerging from
   Gore's extended congressional initiatives. While Gingrich agreed with a significant part of this, from
   his viewing of American history, the renewal of American civilization required the replacement of the
   entire structure of the "welfare state" with an "American values-based model" of the government.10

   It's important to note that while Gingrich and Gore became highly vocal rivals in the 1990s, they both
   entered congress in the late 1970s and quickly became part of a bipartisan in-house futurist think tank,
   the "Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future," where they came to know and respect each other for
   important common ground that they shared. These shared ideals are demonstrated in the similarities
   seen between the activities of the Clinton administration and those of the Progress & Freedom Foun-
   dation. While there was a clear demarcation between the role of government and that of the Founda-
   tion, it was more one "between government as referee and government as spectator."11 It was between
   reinventing government through advancing a healthy citizenry for market citizenship, part of which
   included digital literacy and inclusion to help individuals leave the welfare system, and the replace-
   ment of the entire structure of the welfare state.

   In the preface to her book, Digital Dead End: Fighting for Social Justice in the Information Age, Virginia
   Eubanks notes "magical thinking" as a driver of technology-based economic development programs.12
   It is a deeply "thing-centered" approach. The underlying assumptions within these digital divide initia-
   tives are that some people lack access to technology and/or the skills to effectively use the technologies
   meaningfully as citizens. Schools, libraries, religious institutions, and other community spaces play an
   essential underlying role to bridge the digital divide through provision of community technology cen-

   paternalistic, racialized bent. Programs funding the bridging of the digital divide centered on educa-
   tional quick fixes in which short hour-long courses ensuring individuals could turn on a computer,
   type on a keyboard, connect to the Internet, and fill out a job application form were prioritized over
   individual and community valued beings and doings. Quarterly reports to grant agencies prioritized
   head counts and defined skills checkboxes over community-defined learning outcome objectives. Ulti-
   mately, these were programs that crossed party lines, and were part of a broader neoliberal agenda.
   As Greene notes: "By reviewing the links between the digital divide frame and other contemporary
   neoliberal projects, it becomes clear that a crisis of human capital deficits was articulated in multiple
   domains and that final result of the frame -- redefining access not as available tools or skills but as
   the opportunity to compete -- fit cleanly not just with the demands of post-Fordist capital but with
   the common sense of laborers who really were excluded from the transition to a knowledge economy,
   and those helping professionals -- librarians, in Stevenson's [2009] account -- who really do work for
   inclusion."13

   In the end, even as the left edge of neoliberalism under the Clinton administration began to weaken
   and the right strengthened, the problematic magical thinking of the digital divide framing has per-
   sisted, as Greene notes in his conclusion:

         `Digital divide' stuck in the United States because a frame announcing a national crisis
         of competitiveness, defined as a human capital deficit and resolved through public-private
         partnerships for access extension, created a fundamental definition of `access' that resolved
         the contradictions between a punitive, paternalistic poverty policy and the premise of the
         New Economy. If the opportunity to compete was made available by information technol-
         ogy, then investments in those opportunities -- publicly encouraged but privately executed
         so as to not violate the sanctity of competition -- were urgently required. Unfortunately,
         more competition creates not just more winners, but also more losers. Therefore, individ-
         ual failures of competitiveness had to be excused as lacking initiative or improperly plan-
         ning, whereas mass failures could be understood as populations surplus to New Economy
         requirements--thus justifying the expansion of the prison and workfare systems that paral-
         leled Clinton-era digital divide initiatives and bounded their antipoverty aspirations.14

   At some point in our participatory action research community inquiry projects, we may discover our
   own complacency within oppressive structures through an over-reliance on a distributive paradigm
   setting up computer labs, providing digital skills training, and helping "digital immigrants" keep pace
   within the digital revolution. We thus miss seeing the many non-technical, socio-political, and eco-
   nomic realities of generational oppressions that dismiss the community cultural wealth and local val-
   ued beings and doings to instead prioritize neoliberal agendas. One of my own deep nights of the soul
   occurred in 2008 when, through an abductive leap, I came to see a radically different understanding
   of the oppressive works I was doing and helping others do through teaching and practice as part of

our bridging the digital divide tasks. But following deep conversations with my community partners
of color regarding unspoken truths of my own works centering on white supremacy, and also works
towards new processes of reconciliation, our community of practice, oppressed and oppressor, used
Freire's popular education approach in a deeper way to continue those aspects of projects that were
deemed of value, innovated-in-use further those aspects we considered reparable in some meaningful
way, and cast off those things that clearly worked to continue the intersecting webs of oppression.
And it has been this continued work that has guided much of the development of this textbook.

As we've explored throughout this textbook, the technical can never be separated from the social. The
sociotechnical artifacts and systems are complex webs of interdependent social and technical compo-
nents. We each need to make use of new critical thinking and expanded digital literacy skills to tease
apart aspects using individual action-reflection, and even more within communities of inquiry action-
reflection using collective leadership and popular education strategies.

A great visualization of this transformative movement into a more people-centered, popular technol-
ogy approach in which the marginalized "other" can challenge our preconceptions regarding the Dig-
ital Divide can be found in Eubanks' "Trapped in the Digital Divide: The Distributive Paradigm in
Community Informatics." Together with YWCA workshop participants in Troy, New York, Eubanks
created a series of drawings. She notes how her initial sketch used to answer their question, "What is
the digital divide?" a new-to-them term, ultimately helped step workshop participants from the initial
codification in which "have-nots" are helped to reach the desired "have" side of the chasm, to popu-
lar technology discussion and a new mutual understanding of the term. The revised drawings of the
divides by workshop participants were essential in guiding this work of decodification and recodifi-
cation. Some considered ways in which this needed to be re-articulated as technology for the people
as skills, strengths, and resources from both sides of the "divide" are brought together. Others visu-
alized the ways the divide actually represented a conflict between "The Man", those with power who
used hoarding and shortcuts to advance personal gain, and "The Rest of Us," the survivors. And over
time, this moved to considerations of new paths forward, ones that sought for possibilities of equal
exchange in which digital technologies become one tool to bring stuff together within ethics of shar-
ing and community.

These visualizations can provide an example of a recodification of one term, the digital divide. In doing
this work of decodification and recodification in action reflection, we discover not an end point, but a
new starting point. Alternate images of the "digital divide" serve as question prompts such as: if this is
the true divide, what works do we now start, what works do we re-invent, and what works do we put
aside as unusable to begin addressing this newly understood digital divide?

Moving From the Digital Divide to Digital Inclusion

As noted earlier, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)'s final
Falling through the Net report focused on digital inclusion, a theme selected to especially highlight "the
progress made and the progress yet to be made."15 They go on to state:

The rapid uptake of new technologies is occurring among most groups of Americans, regardless of
income, education, race or ethnicity, location, age, or gender, suggesting that digital inclusion is a real-
izable goal. Groups that have traditionally been digital "have-nots" are now making dramatic gains.

This first use of digital inclusion left open a more formal definition of the term. For many, the discus-
sion has remained on the digital divides that leave some excluded from full participation online and
all that brings. Others, like the nonprofit National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA), have found the
term digital divide to be problematic given the multiple intersecting divides within. They have instead
forwarded a more formal definition of the key terms digital inclusion, digital equity, and digital
literacy as follows:

Digital Inclusion

Digital Inclusion refers to the activities necessary to ensure that all individuals and commu-
nities, including the most disadvantaged, have access to and use of Information and Com-
munication Technologies (ICTs). This includes 5 elements: 1) affordable, robust broadband
internet service; 2) Internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user; 3) access to
digital literacy training; 4) quality technical support; and 5) applications and online content
designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation and collaboration. Digital
Inclusion must evolve as technology advances. Digital Inclusion requires intentional strate-
gies and investments to reduce and eliminate historical, institutional and structural barriers
to access and use technology.

Digital Equity

Digital Equity is a condition in which all individuals and communities have the information
technology capacity needed for full participation in our society, democracy and economy.
Digital Equity is necessary for civic and cultural participation, employment, lifelong learn-
ing, and access to essential services.

    353 3A: The Digitization of Divides

        Digital Literacy

         NDIA recommends the American Library Association's definition of Digital Literacy via
         their Digital Literacy Taskforce:

         Digital Literacy is the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, eval-
         uate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.

         A Digitally Literate Person:
                  · Possesses the variety of skills - technical and cognitive - required to find, under-
                     stand, evaluate, create, and communicate digital information in a wide variety of
                     formats;
                  · Is able to use diverse technologies appropriately and effectively to retrieve infor-
                     mation, interpret results, and judge the quality of that information;
                  · Understands the relationship between technology, life-long learning, personal pri-
                     vacy, and stewardship of information;
                  · Uses these skills and the appropriate technology to communicate and collaborate
                     with peers, colleagues, family, and on occasion, the general public; and
                  · Uses these skills to actively participate in civic society and contribute to a vibrant,
                     informed, and engaged community.

         National Digital Inclusion Alliance, "Definitions"16

   To the above digital literacy skills, as noted in the Orange Unit, I would add progressive community
   [inter]action and critical social + technical skills, brought forward as part of person- and community-
   centered deliberative dialogue processes using critical research paradigms, pedagogies, and abductive
   reasoning. This is embedded throughout this textbook and has been developed through a range of dig-
   ital literacy-oriented courses and workshops done over the last two decades. And as noted earlier in
   this chapter, sometimes there have been deep nights of the soul that have been part of a critical abduc-
   tive leap as a transformative moment reveals unseen or unforeseen works dehumanizing others. But
   at other times, I have had wonderful insights provided by those who are experiencing these works of
   marginalization and oppression.

   As an example of the latter, consider a five-part workshop that included parents and teachers from a
   Kindergarten-5th grade elementary school whose constituents come primarily from households with
   low socio-economic status. The school's motto, "Technology and Literacy for the Community," inspired
   them to look for creative ways to further engage parents as collaborators in their children's education,
   knowing that a significant number of households did not have each of the five key elements neces-
   sary for full digital inclusion. One African-American parent noted at one point the frustration they

feel when questioned regarding their decision to purchase a smartphone rather than a laptop. They
went on to state how, as a parent of color, they need to teach their children to call a relative or trusted
other whenever a police officer seems to be looking at them closely, and to then put their smartphone
in a pocket with the connection open in case a negative encounter develops. As such, the smartphone,
while an inferior device to the laptop in some ways for educational purposes, has a unique lifesaving
property, the value of which trumps other considerations if the purchase of only one device is possible.
Stories similar to this have been shared with me individually or within a class group discussion in a
range of workshops by people of color, and highlight the intersectional realities of digital technology
and Internet experiences, and the essential need for digital inclusion and equity to continually strive
to advance social justice considerations within all aspects of policy and practice.

This highlights the essential need for digital inclusion and equity activities to consider the five key
elements within a range of contextualized, dynamic individual, cultural, and community-defined con-
ditions.

To conclude this chapter let's probe further the first element regarding digital inclusion, "affordable,
robust broadband internet service." As NDIA notes, digital inclusion must evolve as technology
advances. In a myriad of ways, broadband access within the United States has lagged behind that
of other nations. In particular, given the advancements in Internet service that today includes fiber-
to-the-home (FTTH) or premises (FTTP) in many nations, to what extent is FTTH a necessary
condition for there to be full Digital Equity? In what ways is full civic and cultural participation,
employment, lifelong learning, and access to essential services for the many places within the US
where home fiber not available, or not affordably so, achievable?

Fiber is a central media used in building the backbone of the Internet throughout the world. But when
it comes to Internet provision by the Internet Service Providers to the home, community centers, and
small- to medium-businesses, what is primarily available is the old copper wires that had previously
been installed to provide phone and television service. These proved more than adequate for voice ser-
vice and the downloading of television audio and video. But these significantly underperform if we
look at broadband Internet within a broader conceptualization beyond simple information consump-
tion plus some basic social media and email tasks. To do live-stream sharing in support of interactive
audio/video, selected asynchronous sharing of large datasets from home to community without use
of cloud servers, or an emerging array of IoT device interactions centered within the original Inter-
net Protocol's end-to-end principle high speed (20+ Megabits per seconds; Mbps), low latency (8 mil-
liseconds or less) upload speeds are needed in addition to high speed downloads of online audio/video
information and communication. If a musical group wants to do a live performance in which each
is performing from a different LAN, but as if they were in the same room, they must have latencies
at or under 8 milliseconds. To share video along with audio without lags, they must have 20+ Mbps
uploads to share their audio/video with the others rather than just downloading the performance of
their band. Adding to this, if there is more than one computing device on the LAN seeking to partic-
ipate in live streams, asynchronous data sharing of large datasets, and IoT device activities, then each
    355 3A: The Digitization of Divides

   of these devices will each require high speed, low latency upload and download speeds, increasing the
   requirements for infrastructure service from the WAN to the LAN by the ISP. Digital Subscriber Line
   (DSL), Cable, WiFi, and cell-based Internet do not meet these needs, and they cannot be engineered
   to eventually meet such needs. Only fiber optics can, and it continues to be further developed, adding
   even greater possibilities for distance socializing in ways that advance civic and cultural participation,
   employment, lifelong learning, and access to essential services.

   This highlights a way in which truly just digital inclusion and equity often requires fiber-to-the-home
   to fully provide the conditions for full participation in civic and cultural participation, employment,
   lifelong learning, and access to essential services.

  Affordable, Robust Internet Service Provision

   In her books Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age (2013)
   and FIBER: The Coming Tech Revolution - And Why America Might Miss It (2018), Susan Crawford
   brings together her professional experiences as a member of the board of directors of ICANN from
   2005-2008, as co-leader of the FCC transition team between the Bush and Obama administrations, and
   her time within the Law Schools at Michigan and Harvard, among other lived experiences. From this,
   she richly brings together the history of the Internet with current political contexts nationally and
   internationally to consider the impacts of the Internet today on our lived experiences. The monopoly
   power has significant power over health care, education, urban administration and services, agricul-
   ture, retail sales, and offices, something that has been a constant even as the emergence of transforma-
   tive Internet of Things devices is reshaping the landscape. She has traveled around the United States
   and internationally to see the many different municipalities, regions, and countries that have, in some
   cases for decades, established ways to implement home fiber Internet as a utility to advance full dig-
   ital inclusion and equity as defined by individuals and their communities. While I personally have
   been part of various Community Networking projects, some of which have included fiber-to-the-home
   grants, I found her interview with Bill Moyers to be a very insightful introduction to the deeper social
   shapers of key barriers that have been raised keeping us from this true integration of digital equity.17

   fact sheets, videos, and podcasts highlighting ways communities are working to implement cost effec-
   tive, publicly owned, cooperative models, and other nonprofit approaches for community broadband.18

   Today, FTTH over the publicly owned UC2B is being provided to a growing number of homes and
   other premises in the area through its private partner, I3 Broadband. During the COVID-19 pandemic
   and stay-at-home orders, this proved essential as I and my son sometimes were each participating in
   separate University Zoom live video sessions while my wife was participating in a HIPAA-compliant
   Doxy.me live video session with a patient. The FTTH Internet connectivity provided 1 Gbps download
   and 300 Mbps upload speeds, while our wired Ethernet connectivity to each room provided 100 Mbps
   upload/download to each of our laptops. We consistently had latencies under 8 milliseconds to the
   regional I3 Broadband. But there were many times when a Zoom indicator or traceroute test would
   indicate failures either at the cloud level, or more often at the other end of our connection. When func-
   tional diversity requires communication over voice and video rather than text following a Traumatic
   Brain Injury, as became my case after a 2016 bicycle accident, full participation may be lost with a
   bad audio/video feed somewhere along the Internet backbone or end-points, and a significant human
   aspect is lost. When a pair-programming hands-on activity with electronics or a face-to-face therapy
   session happens online without high quality video, a significant analog, social aspect is lost. When
   several minutes are lost troubleshooting technical problems, a significant analog, social aspect is lost.
   When people already experiencing levels of stress find themselves at a loss, problematic social aspects
   are increased.

   This provides an example of how digital inclusion and equity is too often addressed only on one side
   of the Internet when viewed from the underlying end-to-end principle that arose from the French
   Cyclades model -- a vision of interconnecting a group of islands, a metaphor from the Aegean Sea
   island group -- and later guiding the Internet Protocol development first funded in support of a flexible
   military during the Cold War.

   As one final example, my brother has had epilepsy since early childhood and suffers from refractory
   seizures that are drug resistant.

         Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder in the world. If you have epilepsy,
         surges of electrical activity in your brain can cause recurring seizures. [Watch the video
         "What is Epilepsy? from epilepsy.com" online.]

         Seizures are sudden surges of abnormal and excessive electrical activity in your brain and
         can affect how you appear or act. Where and how the seizure presents itself can have pro-
         found effects.

      Not all seizures are the same. Many people with epilepsy have more than one type of seizure
      and may have other symptoms of neurological problems as well.

      The Epilepsy Foundation, "About Epilepsy: The Basics"

For my brother, treatment experience has taught him that maintaining a complete personal record of
seizures and treatments is an essential complement to, and at times even more informative than, the
expensive tests commonly used within the medical profession such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRIs) and Electroencephalogram (EEGs). He demonstrates collective leadership in practice. For thirty
years he has used his personal computer to document hundreds of seizures, over a dozen anti-seizure
medications and their assigned usage regimens, and other valuable medical details. And today new
seizure diary programs are becoming available to assist epilepsy patients in documenting the treat-
ment path (my brother has been finding Seizure Tracker very useful to document and forward to his
doctor treatment data). Combined, this rich personal dataset connects these medical-focused notes
within the broader personal context in ways that help inform conversations with his care team and
with the broader epilepsy community.

Recently, he was provided with an innovative NeuroPace brain-responsive neurostimulation (RNS)
system. Tiny wires with electrodes, called leads, are placed in the area of seizure onset and connected
to a neurostimulator placed under the scalp. This small battery-powered microcontroller is pro-
grammed by the doctor to monitor brainwaves, detect unusual activity, and respond in real time. It is
personalized by the doctor for the individual, but this personalization can include additional new ana-
log feedback of the individual to the doctor further expanding the information flow. [Watch the video
"NeuroPace: How the RNS System Works" online.]

At least in ideal conditions. My brother still lives in the rural area in which we grew up. And as is the
case for many rural areas, Internet service is still inadequate to meet all needs, especially within the
context of tele-health. Provision of Internet is currently being provided by a Satellite provider, with
latencies consistently over 700 milliseconds. This is far less than the <8 millisecond latency required
to feel as if you are in the same room, and something not effectively supported within today's general
purpose live streaming services such as Zoom. Further, beyond diminished or lost live stream conver-
sations required as a result of Covid-19 social distancing, essential weekly uploads of NeuroPace data
can sometimes fail for extended periods. In his speedtests, he finds that while his download speeds
are often >30 Mbps, his upload tests at times have given the message "Upload Test Error". Thus, as my
brother notes:

The new RNS treatment demands more than a computer and the skills to operate it-sufficient upload
speeds are required to weekly transfer data to the doctor. Also, the COVID-19 outbreak has left me
using the telephone to speak with a doctor and therapist more than once instead of using the tele-
health option. Will RNS eventually offer the chance for doctors to alter the Neuropace device settings
from home? Not without sufficient computer speeds.
                                                                                                                               3A: The Digitization of Divides 358

   Ultimately, information sharing between a distanced community of practice in support of collective
   leadership fails at multiple levels, even as the 20 Mbps download, 3 Mbps upload (20/3) speed definition
   of minimum service as defined through the US FCC Lifeline program is recorded as met within corpo-
   rate and governmental Internet records.

   As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. notes: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
   We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever
   affects one directly, affects all indirectly."19 Truly just digital inclusion and equity is more than an indi-
   vidual issue. It is a community and social issue that requires a high-quality infrastructure not only at
   the backbone of the Internet, but at each end-point as well and all nodes in between. Each missing
   element as listed within the definition of digital inclusion, and each element that is less than what is
   needed as defined from within the individual and community's defined valued beings and doings based
   on a community's cultural wealths, is another intersecting component of the many different analog
   and digital divides that reinforce the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism.

Professional Journal Reflections:

The social shaping of technology includes a range of political, economic, and social influencers and
frames shaping technologies and our visions for these technologies. The digital divide further repre-
sents a social framing of a range of sociotechnical artifacts as exclusively technical matters, something
the digital inclusion and other movements are trying to reframe.

        1. Take some time to read through your past Professional Journal Reflections. As you reread
            your own reflections, what has remained consistent throughout these? What has slowly
            transformed within these?

        2. In what ways do the readings of this session build from the past reflections? In what ways
            do they counter those past reflections?

        3. What are some first thoughts regarding next steps you need to take individually and within
            your communities of practice in response to your journey through A Person-Centered Guide
            to Demystifying Technology?

 Technical Overview

        My philosophy is very simple: When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just,
        you have to stand up, you have to say something, you have to do something.
        My mother told me over and over again when I went off to school not to get into trouble,
        but I told her that I got into a good trouble, necessary trouble. Even today I tell people, "We
        need to get in good trouble."
        John Lewis, interviewed by Valerie Jackson for StoryCorps1
  We began this session considering the codifications of the digital divide and beginning a process of
  decodification of this and related terms. We explored some examples specifically related to NDIA's first
  element of digital inclusion, "affordable, robust broadband internet service." Digital inclusion, equity,
  and literacy, as brought forward by NDIA, ALA, and others, give a more formal definition that can
  serve as a framework to move on from the magical thinking that is pervasive within current neolib-
  eral understandings of sociotechnical networked information systems. But this is an ongoing work of
  community inquiry and action-reflection.
  As we move forward in our professional practices, we each will likely make use of a range of sociotech-
  nical digital tools within our daily activities, which, together in work with others, include works
  towards advancing digital inclusion and equity goals. But in practice, information science profession-
  als have encountered limits and constraints to the social justice parameters given their permitted roles,
  and given how certain socially structured fabrics and certain community values are placed above oth-

  ers, particularly in light of dependencies on public funding that gives greater power to the middle-
  class, white population.2

  As an introductory text, A Person-Centered Guide to Demystifying Technology has worked to open up
  the closed box of digital technologies sufficiently so that we can explore ways in which we can inno-
  vate-in-use our everyday technologies so that our choice, [re]design, and use of digital technologies
  better serve the diverse community knowledge and cultural wealth within the fabric of communities.
  It is an introductory text seeking to help us see better those aspects of digital technology that are "not
  right, not fair, not just," to quote John Lewis. As noted throughout the Rainbow Unit, there have been
  an extraordinary growth in digital computing and communications over the last 50 years. The com-
  munity networking and community FabLab movements are but two of the many examples of ways
  digital bits and physical atoms have been brought together with the objective of advancing the real-
  world goals of local people to address the situations limiting them from being more fully human as
  active members within civil discourse as part of a community forum, life-long learning, and informa-
  tion access and use. But there have also been key influences and influencers that have prioritized inte-
  gration of social and political dominance within accelerating technological and economic strengths
  through works of individualism, technological determinism, and supply-side, trickle-down neoliberal-
  ism. These have served to relocate some divides while working to reinforce and expand others, often
  in the name of digital inclusion.

  To move beyond the many historic and ongoing divides fostering existing injustices and the digitiza-
  tion of information systems that are birthing new injustices in many areas of society locally, region-
  ally, and beyond, "you have to say something, you have to do something" in meaningful ways. This
  digitization of the divides continues even as we remain caught in that inescapable network of mutual-
  ity and are thus being affected, whether it be directly or indirectly, as Martin Luther King, Jr., notes.3
  As information science professionals, this can come in many forms, including: as part of social justice
  storytelling; as part of our selection and construction of electronic components; within our work to
  integrate, modify, and write new programming code; and in the selection, creation, and use of algo-
  rithms, including those incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning.

  Let's finish sociotechnical session three of the Rainbow Unit by taking some first steps to create a
  general-purpose Raspberry Pi Server. At a minimum, we'll setup the Raspberry Pi as an Apache Web
  Server with the WordPress content management system (CMS). From here, it can use this general-
  purpose space strategically to prototype multiple subcomponents within the larger digital Little Free
  Library, which can be used to get into good trouble, saying something, doing something to address an
  injustice. Or maybe you'd like to try out creating a DIY community wireless network, or set up multi-
  ple Internet of Things devices to get into that good trouble.

  As you take on this adventure, keep forefront in your mind ways to ensure that this is a person-cen-

 Exercise: The General Purpose Raspberry Pi Web Server

  In session one of the Rainbow Unit, we did a few different exercises exploring some of the underlying
  concepts behind the Internet of Things, also highlighted in Limor Fried's segments "All the Internet of
  Things." Of special note now, reflect back on the Hyptertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), an example
  of a client/server protocol that works at layers 6 and 7 of the OSI model.

  Let's now test out a more general-purpose installation of HTTP on the Raspberry Pi, setting it up as
  web server that can be used on the World Wide Web. While we did create an HTTP-based web
  server in session 1, the Python library code used created a special-purpose web server. This time, we'll
  install the Apache web server, a widely used, general-purpose web server.4 Before starting the instal-
  lation of Apache, take a few minutes to watch Carrie Anne Philbin's Crash Course Computer Science
  episode #30 on the World Wide Web.

 About the Apache Web Server

  Reflecting back on my time from 1993 to 1995 as a postdoctoral researcher at the Neuronal Pattern
  Analysis group at the University of Illinois's Beckman Institute, I remember our explorations of ways
  to make use of this brand-new thing called a "web browser" to share our raw data sets across the Inter-
  net with other researchers. One of the challenges we faced was the rapid ongoing changes in the code
  for the campus's National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) HTTP server, in support
  of their just-being-developed Mosaic web browser. What worked on the http server or on the web
  browser one day might not work the next day. Further, changes made within HTTP or HTML may cre-
  ate conflicts with the newly written code needed on the Sybase database server to effectively share the
  data by way of the hypertext protocols. I'd actively work on the HTTP/HTML side, while my colleague
  would work on the database server side. This is the rapid prototyping, fail-forward, growth mindset
  in action. It also represents those times when innovations go viral while still in their alpha phase, the
  lab time before an artifact or system enters the beta testing phase and eventual stable release. I was
  already working with the Linux operating system, version 0.9. I don't remember the 0.x versions of
  Mosaic and NCSA HTTP, or if they were even listed yet.

  The University of Illinois meets the Carnegie Classification R1: Doctoral Universities - Very high
  research activity in part because the core focus of these research and learning activities are to "pioneer
  innovative research that tackles global problems and expands the human experience. Our transfor-
  mative learning experiences, in and out of the classroom, are designed to produce alumni who desire
  to make a significant, societal impact."5 For me, innovative research had expanded from my initial
  grant-funded electrophysiology-based project to also include an HTTP server and web browser pro-
  ject sharing the raw data stored in multiple Neuronal Pattern Analysis group databases. This inspired
  me to switch tracks, moving from my postdoctoral research at the Beckman Institute, and joining the
  Prairienet Community Network research project at the School of Information Science in 1995, which
  was using community inquiry to explore how the Internet and a HTTP-based networked informa-
  tion system could be used in support of various community information, communication, and learning
  activities. Earlier that year, the Apache HTTP server project began as the NCSA research for which the
  HTTP server and Mosaic web browser were initially being developed was winding down. The NCSA
  code was available for use in other projects through what became the free and open-source licensing
  framework. Robert McCool--who as an Illinois undergraduate student helped lead the initial NCSA
  HTTP server development in support of Mosaic--joined with a group of other computer programmers
  who were patching the NCSA HTTP server to meet their own project requirements, such as Brian
  Behlendorf--a founding member and president for three years of the Apache Software Foundation--to
  release the Apache HTTP server using the NCSA code as its base. The use of existing code and a series

  of software patches led to the early development team's use of the pun "A PAtCHy" server, a pun that
  somehow stuck and became the formal name, respelled Apache HTTP.6

  As Carrie Anne Philbin notes at the end of the Crash Course Computer Science video above with
  regard to net neutrality, the implications of decisions matter. And so it is with The Apache Way, as
  listed within the Apache Software Foundation website. It is a 501(c)3 non-profit public charity orga-
  nization incorporated in the United States of America, formed for open, collaborative software devel-
  opment within a principle of "meritocracy": government by merit. It is one built within the spirit of
  community, in which various projects were emerging that together become the "projects" by which
  the separate communities were identified. And so a framework was created within which each com-
  munity, or project, was designated as the central decision-making organization for their community
  within the broader Apache world.

  But it is also a foundation in which the pun that inspired the name "Apache" came with acknowledged
  cultural appropriation implications. Co-founder Brian Behlendorf noted in the documentary "Trillions
  and Trillions Served," as cited by both The Apache Software Foundation Wikipedia page and Natives
  in Tech Blog post "Apache® Appropriation" 7: "I suggested the name Apache partly because the web
  technologies at the time that were launching were being called cyber this or spider that or something
  on those themes, and I was like we need something a little more interesting, a little more romantic,
  not to be a cultural appropriator or anything like that, I had just seen a documentary about Geron-
  imo and the last days of a Native American tribe called the Apaches, right, who succumbed to the
  invasion from the West, from the United States, and they were the last tribe to give up their terri-
  tory and for me that almost romantically represented what I felt we were doing with this web-server
  project..." (NOTE: The YouTube video of the "Trillions and Trillions Served" documentary has since
  been made private, although is still referenced as a source in both the Wikipedia page article and the
  Natives in Tech Blog post references above. I still include this quote even though I was not able to con-
  firm this citation during the writing of this on April 24, 2023 as even the decision to make private the
  YouTube video itself adds meaning to this issue of cultural appropriation and the stories that are told
  in relation to this.) The name "Apache," which is trademarked by a U.S. charity nonprofit foundation,
  is thus inspired by "the last days of a Native American tribe" without recognition that the Indigenous
  peoples currently have eight federally recognized tribes with many thousands of living Apache citi-
  zens today, without full consultation, and without enumeration. The trademark was awarded to the
  nonprofit foundation by the same U.S. government that acknowledges the sovereignty of these eight
  tribes--Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New
  Mexico; Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; San Carlos Apache Tribe
  of the San Carlos Reservation, Arizona; Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona; White Mountain Apache Tribe
  of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona; and Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reser-

   vation, Arizona. In so doing, we found two decisions, the first an acknowledgement of the sovereignty
   of eight Apache tribes, and the second an awarding of the Apache trademark to a foundation with The
   Apache Way logo of a feather that "was chosen out of reference and appreciation for the people and
   tribes who refer to themselves as `Apache.'"8 But we also find in these the unaddressed need for direct
   mediation and conflict resolution found within models such as restorative justice, as the trademark
   was requested and awarded without consultation, and without acknowledgement and respect of the
   name's provenance and origin from those who had been awarded sovereign nationhood.9

   As mentioned at the start of the Background Knowledge Probe to begin this session, small decisions
   can lead towards large outcomes, which both are shaped by these small decisions and go on to shape
   future small aspects, in an iterative, nonlinear process in which the larger systems and structures
   become a reflection. The Apache HTTP server is shaped by the various small decisions listed above and
   many more as well, some of which are community- and collaboration-centered in ways that strongly
   match core principles of the Internet Protocol. Apache remains commonly used, especially on Linux-
   based computers, making up over 25 percent of the websites around the world, and is the perfect
   choice for a general-purpose HTTP server on the Raspberry Pi building community-led networked
   information systems. The following instructions are a slightly modified version of those found on the
   Raspberry Pi Foundation documentation site. Using the DIKW framework as introduced in the Orange
   Unit 4A: Storytelling in the Information Sciences, these modifications are meant to facilitate explo-
   ration of this networked information system from both technical and social lenses to connect data
   with context. In organizing and structuring the instructions in this way, these modifications seek to
   finetune the relevance of the general-purpose HTTP server set up for the more specific purposes of the
   learning context at hand. And as part of the shift from a "thing-orientation" to a "person-orientation",
   the modifications are meant to help your community of inquiry make this information actionable, that
   is, turn it into knowledge. It is in this way that we've seen such digital information and communica-
   tion technologies subsequently serve as useful tools for movement work, for standing up to say some-
   thing, to do something to facilitate a more just society for all, and especially for those who have been
   pushed to the margins. With creative works comes failure, requiring a fail-forward and growth mind-
   set, as we first learned in Carol Dweck's video10 shared in the Introduction and which we've explored
   through the book. As we near the conclusion of this introductory text advancing a more holistic and
   nuanced understanding of the multiple social and technical layers of networked information systems,
   it is important to highlight the need for each of us to be open to rebuke and correction within the
   range of sociotechnical layers, including those of cultural appropriation. For to the extent that this
   is acknowledged and addressed through direct mediation and conflict resolution, we open more case
   examples of the arc of the moral universe, which, while long, does bend towards justice, as many

   social justice warriors, including the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., have noted. For as Presi-
   dent Barack Obama stated in a 2009 Time magazine article, "while you can't necessarily bend history
   to your will, you can do your part to see that, in the words of Dr. King, it `bends toward justice.'"11

   Net neutrality is a critical issue as we work on the World Wide Web through the installation of a
   general-purpose web server, and is something we as professionals should follow, given its ongoing
   impacts shaping our work. And it is something we can serve to influence as members of our soci-
   eties, wherever this may take us moving forward. So, too, is the identification of issues of cultural
   appropriation, however. As we explored in the Blue Unit chapter 4A: Sharing Our Counterstories, we
   need to continuously research the self, research the self in relation to others, join in engaged reflection
   and representation, and shift from self to system, as H. Richard Milner IV notes in the article "Race,
   Culture, and Researcher Positionality: Working Through Dangers Seen, Unseen, and Unforeseen." In
   briefly unpacking the many positives, along with a newly emerging exploration of an injustice of cul-
   tural appropriation found within the name, we mean to recognize the dangers in a way that can begin
   a process of restorative justice, and ensure that this process is kept alive and active as we seek ways to
   do our part. But to learn of this unforeseen danger that comes with installing an actively used, open-
   source web server like Apache, without adding this to our story library to be strategically used moving
   forward, we have then swept it under the rug, so to speak, like the dust we want to hide from visitors.
   It is to make it Unseen and to therefore become part of the ongoing systems that in this context has
   been centuries of work to erase Indigenous presence, past and present, within the Americas. In my
   writing of these paragraphs following the exploration of student reading notes on the previous draft
   of this chapter April 24, 2023, I am responding to my own (re)introduction to the Apache Software
   Foundation as more than pun, and as something I need to delve into further moving forward. I need
   to do this while also continuing to actively make use of this server as an example of free and open-
   source software, which remains foundational to key aspects of my community networking movement
   and teaching work.

  Steps

   Install Apache

           1. First, update the available packages by typing the following command into the Terminal:

           pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt update

           2. Next, install version two of the Apache web server by typing:

           pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt install apache2 -y

367 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure

Test the web server
By default, Apache puts a test HTML file in the web folder. This default web page is served when you
browse to http://localhost/ using the Chromium Web Browser on the Pi itself, something that works
well for those who connect to the Raspberry Pi graphical display using RealVNC, or who have their
Raspberry Pi attached directly to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor. For everyone, you can also access
the test HTML file using something similar to http://192.168.1.10 (whatever the Pi's IP address is) from
another computer on the network. To find the Pi's IP address, type hostname -I at the command
line (or read more about finding your IP address).
Browse to the default web page either, on the Pi or from another computer on the same LAN, and you
should see the following:

Unlike in session one, this time around, we do not add a port number after the IP address. The HTTP
protocol has as a default port 80. So you could type in http://192.168.1.10:80, but you do not need to do
this, as it is assumed by default.
                                                                                 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure 368

This also means that you could have two web servers running simultaneously, the Apache general-
purpose one on port 80, and one of the Internet of Things Python HTTP servers that use port 8401.
Check this out by typing into the terminal window:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python3 simple_uartWebserverLED.py

Now, in a second web browser window, go to your IP address equivalent of http://192.168.1.10:8401.
Voilà! Two web servers on one Raspberry Pi!

Initial Reflections

         · What is a web browser?
         · From where does a web browser get its web pages?
         · What's different regarding the web pages retrieved from port 80 versus those retrieved

            from port 8401? When might this matter?

Changing the default web page

The default web page created during the installation is just an HTML file in the computer's filesystem.
When installing servers, typically also installed is one or more configuration file(s). Within Linux oper-
ating systems, these are usually installed in the /etc, or et cetera, directory. In the terminal window,
type:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -al /etc/apache2

Notice a file called apache2.conf. This is the main configuration file used to guide the launch of
an Apache HTTP daemon. This provides the start-up information needed for a server to perform in
the specified way. The listed apache2.conf, ports.conf, and additional conf-enabled, mods-enabled, and
sites-enabled files provide those who are administering the HTTP with server abilities to further inno-
vate-in-use the base Apache software. Changes can be made on the fly, and then integrated into the
server through a refresh without disrupting ongoing and new page requests.

      In computing terms, a daemon is a computer program that runs in the background, pro-
      viding services as needed. In this case, each time it is launched, the HTTP daemon starts
      itself based on the specifications within the configuration file, and then mostly hangs out,
      twiddling its thumbs and waiting for a call in asking for something. When the call comes,
      it gets busy doing its stuff before going back to waiting mode. You'll often see a running
      HTTP server daemon listed as httpd. These daemon server applications are a way for things
      to perform a similar manual function to that done by a human call support service where
      the worker closely follows a checklist. When might it be better for this service to be done
369 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure

      by the "thing"? When might it be better for this service to be done by the "person"? In what
      ways might machine learning and artificial intelligence advance to the point where some of
      the current "person" tasks may be replaced by a "thing"?

To review these configuration files for Apache, head over to /etc/apache2. It is especially recom-
mended to skim the apache2.conf and ports.conf files.

We don't need to review the configuration files to know that the default location for HTML files in
Apache is generally under the /var, or variables, directory. When we install Apache, a new directory,
/var/www, is created to specifically host World Wide Web data. And Apache goes on to create a test
index.html HTML file. (In the /etc/apache2 configuration files, index.html is one of the default files
looked for when someone requests a parent page for a website. This is why we can get a webpage by
typing in something like "www.raspberrypi.org." This web browser request, combined with the config-
uration of the HTTP server, results in the return of "www.raspberrypi.org/index.html" or something
similar, as specified within the HTTP server configuration file.)

Let's go over to the HTML directory space and edit the index.html file /var/www/html/
index.html. Even as we do this, let's keep the python3 HTTP server running for the moment, as
we'll bring these together in a later step. So, navigate to this directory in a second terminal window so
that we can have a look at what's inside of this test page:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd /var/www/html
pi@raspberrypi:/var/www/html $ ls -al

This shows that by default, there is one file in /var/www/html/ called index.html, and it is
owned by the root user (as is the enclosing folder). In order to edit the file, you need to change its
ownership to your own username. Change the owner of the file (the default pi user is assumed here)
by typing into the terminal:

pi@raspberrypi:/var/www/html $ sudo chown pi: index.html

You can now try editing this file using mousepad and then refresh the browser to see the web page
change. To do so, in the terminal window, type:

pi@raspberrypi:/var/www/html $ sudo mousepad index.html

Next, scroll through the <head> section, which contains a range of metadata and also various Cascad-
ing Style Sheets (CSS) code, until you see the tags </head><body> on two separate lines.
               3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure 370

Diving Deeper

Consider some quick changes, such as changing the title "Apache2 Debian Default Page" and the note
"It works!" to something different. You might also add in additional <p></p> paragraphs sharing your
thoughts at this moment.

When done editing the html, save the changes. You don't need to exit, but can now refresh the browser
to see the web page changes. This may take some trial and error to get working--keep failing forward!

Once done testing out changes of the default index.html file, exit mousepad.

Creating our own webpage

Starting at minute 4:05 of the video "The World Wide Web: Crash Course Computer Science," Carrie
Anne Philbin gives a quick example of an HTML page.

To create new web pages, you'll need to run mousepad or your favorite text editor with super user
privileges, as the /var/www/html directory is owned by user "root." For example, to create the page
mypage.html, type:

sudo mousepad mypage.html

Once you've opened the text editor, take a few minutes to explore creating a webpage. If you haven't
done this before, you can test out Philbin's example. Or if you've done web page creating directly
through text editing before, feel encouraged to use your own creativity to create a new page. Once you
think you have something reasonable, save the file (you don't need to exit, though), and then go to a
web browser and go to the new page. In my case, I'd type in:

http://10.0.0.30/mypage.html

Creating an Internet of Things iframe page

The iframe tag is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. The iframe
tag is used throughout this textbook to bring in YouTube videos. And we can now use this frame to
bring in a web page from another server--in this case, that created by the HTTP server run through
simple_uartWebserverLED.py.

Open up a new text file in the www directory called iot.html. If I'm using mousepad, I'd type:

pi@raspberrypi:/var/www $ sudo mousepad iot.html

Now, create a page that looks something like:
371 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure

<html>

<head><title>IoT Gathering Page</title></head>

   <body>

             <h1>Internet of Things Gathering Page</h1>

             <p>This page is used to gather datasets from various

                           local Internet of Things devices

             </p>

             <iframe width="1024" height="768"

                                    src="http://10.0.0.30:8401"

                                    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>

             </iframe>

   </body>

</html>
Notice that it is a combination of static HTML and also an iframe tag bringing in source data from
the other HTTP server running on the Raspberry Pi. Make sure you've listed the IP address of your
own Raspberry Pi instead of my 10.0.0.30 Raspberry Pi address. Then save the document. Be sure you
have your breadboard and Circuit Playground Express components attached and that your Python3
program simple_uartWebserverLED.py is up and running successfully. Now go to your web browser
and open up both the Python page directly, as we did in session one, and also through the Apache
server, as we've just set up now. For my Raspberry Pi, with an IP address of 10.0.0.30, I'd go to:
http://10.0.0.30:8401/
http://10.0.0.30/iot.html
And remember, if you have other LAN-based computing devices with web browsers installed, such as
your smartphone, you can use those to access these pages as well.

Install PHP

When we used the Python3 BaseHTTPRequestHandler library in session one, we were able to bring
together some static HTML page tags with some Python programming code to create a dynamic
web page whose data was continuously updated. With the iframe tag, we were able to bring this
dynamic web page data into an otherwise static web page we were creating. Let's finish this exercise
by installing PHP.

PHP is a preprocessor: it's code that runs when the server receives a request for a web page via a web
browser. It works out what needs to be shown on the page, and then sends that page to the browser.
Unlike static HTML, PHP can show different content under different circumstances. Other languages
are also capable of doing this, but since WordPress is written in PHP, that's what we need to use this
time. PHP is a very popular language on the Web: huge projects like Facebook and Wikipedia are writ-
ten in PHP.

"PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-
purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into
HTML."12 To allow your Apache server to process PHP files, you'll need to install the latest version of
PHP and the PHP module for Apache. While still in the /var/www/html directory, type the follow-
ing command to install these:

pi@raspberrypi:/var/www/html $ sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y

Now, rename the index.html file to index-orig.html:

pi@raspberrypi:/var/www/html $ sudo mv index.html index-orig.html

Create the file index.php:

pi@raspberrypi:/var/www/html $ sudo mousepad index.php

Put some PHP content in it:

<?php echo "hello world"; ?>

Now, save the index.php file you've edited in mousepad, and refresh your browser. You should see the
phrase "hello world" displayed. This is not dynamic, but still served by PHP.

12. "What Is PHP?" PHP Manual, accessed July 21, 2020, https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php.
373 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure

If you see the raw PHP above instead of "hello world", reload and restart Apache like so:
pi@raspberrypi:/var/www/html $ sudo service apache2 restart
Now try something dynamic using mousepad to add the following line in index.php:

<?php echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); ?>

Underneath the hood, PHP is now running Linux operating system apps to collect current information
and bring it back to a dynamic web page. This is the PHP equivalent to Python's use of /opt/vc/
bin/vcgencmd measure_temp to get the current temperature of the Raspberry Pi, like we did in
session one of the Rainbow Unit.
To add in some static text using standard HTML tags, consider adding an <h1>Title of page</h1> line
above the PHP code, and maybe some <p>paragraphs of text</p> after the PHP to see what it looks
like.
Going a step further, you can show a rich listing of your PHP info at the bottom by adding an addi-
tional PHP hypertext preprocessor call:

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

Key Takeaways

We've now used a few technical exercises over the sessions of the Rainbow Unit to explore different
ways we could create a Raspberry Pi HTTP server. While at first, we used Python3 BaseHTTPRe-
questHandler to provide special purpose HTML page data and information, we've now added the gen-
eral-purpose Apache HTTP server and PHP preprocessor to create a broader range of HTML pages
that could be accessible upon request by an HTTP client. While a Python3-based HTTP server can
prove of value in support of a specific task, it is the general-purpose HTTP server which has become
the foundation of the Internet's World Wide Web.
In this exercise, we've seen how flexible server platforms like Apache have been developed using the
open protocols and standards of the Internet and an open community of developers to work on a
range of different computers and to meet a range of different use objectives. This design strategy pro-
                                                                                 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure 374

vides opportunities for innovation-in-use, something we tested as we moved from initial installation
of Apache, to the creation of a first HTML page, to the addition of an Internet of Things iframe, to the
addition of the PHP Hypertext Preprocessor. We've also seen how, through the use of the default port
address with the Apache server and an alternate 8401 port for the Python3 server, one computer could
run multiple distinct instances of the HTTP server package simultaneously, providing us with even
greater flexibility to innovate-in-use.

As we saw in Rainbow Unit 2B: The Infrastructure of the Internet, and as was again highlighted to
start this chapter, the Internet Infrastructure itself is primarily comprised of the Network, Transport,
and Session layers of the OSI model. It is not designed for a specific purpose, just the general one of
end-to-end communication between devices. The HypterText Transport Protocol (HTTP) then works
at layers 6 and 7 of the OSI model to facilitate data translation, representation, and "end user" visu-
alization, even if that "end user" is another HTTP server working to link together different data and
information. The HTTP server can be single-purpose and run through Python code, or it can be gen-
eral-purpose, as it is when running through Apache. Add-ons like PHP and javascript can also be
added to extend what an HTTP server such as Apache can accomplish. As we saw in Rainbow Unit
1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World, the small decisions made in the designs of
our breadboard circuit, of the Raspberry Pi GPIO port, of the Raspberry Pi OS, of the Python code run-
ning on the Raspberry Pi OS, of the Circuit Playground Express, of the CPE controller that includes
support of MakeCode .uf2 programs, and of the MakeCode program running on the CPE, each shaped
the larger experience of the user interacting with the system that was created. So, too, can we see now
the many small design decisions made on the many smaller components that make up the Apache and
PHP platforms and the HTML and PHP code running within these platforms. But it is important that
we also take a further step back to recognize ways in which the small design decisions regarding the
many individual aspects of the infrastructure of the Internet that work at layers 3, 4, and 5 of the OSI
model have shaped the decisions that make up the applications and platforms working at layers 6 and
7 of the OSI model.

As John Lewis states, "when we see something that is not right, not fair, not just, we have to stand up,
we have to say something, we have to do something." We need to get in good trouble. When we look
at the digital divide and take on work to instead foster digital inclusion and digital equity, it is actu-
ally by design that we often only see the black box of the Internet, instead of seeing the many small
components of which the Internet serves as a reflection. As we look at the Internet using the dominant
thing-orientation and technological determinism framing, we miss seeing the social that is as much
and more what shapes the technical, even as people are then shaped by the technical in return.

Take a moment to reflect back on your journey through the Orange and Blue Units leading up to the
start of the Rainbow Unit. Think especially about the construction of the different technical compo-
nents that together have become a digital Little Free Library. Think also about the social justice sto-
rytelling activity which has been an active part at different times during this journey. Then work to
envision the different ways in which these smaller parts have come together, at different times and in
375 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure

different ways, to create larger components and systems that are sociotechnical in nature, rather than
just one or the other. Finish by thinking further about ways in which the large reflects the various
small components, and the ways that these shape each other.

A WordPress-Based Public Information System

The Raspberry Pi Foundation includes instructions for a project to Build a LAMP Web Server with
WordPress. Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, and PHP/Perl/Python (LAMP), a term that became pop-
ular in the late 1990s, represents a bringing together of these sociotechnical systems to create a flexible
web stack, a collection of software applications to perform specific tasks, in this case specific to web
development. WordPress is a commonly used extension to the widely used base LAMP stack.

Back in the Orange Unit 4C: Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi, we explored the Raspberry OS, a
GNU Linux operating system designed for the Raspberry Pi microcomputer and based on the Debian
GNU Linux distribution. Linux itself is only the kernel of the operating system, the part that serves as
the interface between the hardware and software of the computer. The GNU (GNU is not Unix) suite is
most commonly used to provide the wider range of software used to give us the full operating system
platform. The distribution further determines which GNU packages and other Linux-based packages
of software to include. Debian was launched in 1993 and is composed only of free and open-source
software. It has a more structured versioning release structure that serves some purposes well in pro-
viding greater stability, but is subpar for others, as it may slow down change for others. These are
factors which were considered when the Raspberry Pi Foundation decided to use Debian as its base.

Linux installation, check. As Raspberry OS also comes with Python, check to that, also.

We've now completed the Apache web server and PHP installation steps from the Raspberry Pi project
to Build a LAMP Web Server with WordPress.

Apache installation, check. PHP installation, check.

We've now got the LAP portions of the LAMP web stack installed and running both for single-pur-
pose Python web applications and for general-purpose static and dynamic webpage applications. So
far, the instructions have been provided through the textbook. The text for these instructions pri-
marily comes copied and pasted from Build a LAMP Web Server with WordPress. This can legally be
done because the Raspberry Pi Foundation published these under the Creative Commons Attribution-
ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license. You'll also notice that this textbook is released
using that same license. This is required when you see the ShareAlike listing within a specific Creative
Commons license used. The Creative Commons was already the primary assumption for publications
released through the Illinois Open Publishing Network, but as the author, I decided to modify the form
of Creative Commons license to be used to have open use of the Raspberry Pi Foundation text, so that
I can adapt and remix the Apache and PHP instructions to fit the context of this book. Take a moment
                                                                                 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure 376

to learn more about the Creative Commons Share Alike license as another example of the small shap-
ing the large.

What remains is the installation of popular database engine MySQL and the WordPress CMS.

MySQL is a database system. It uses the structured query language identified through its abbreviation,
SQL, and spoken as either S-Q-L or "sequel." It is used to manage the data found in relational database
management systems. Data itself can be stored in many ways, including in text files or in spreadsheets.
Spreadsheets help to organize the data using rows and columns, and can further organize them using
multiple sheets. Links can even be made between different cells across different sheets. This is a base
level database. But relational database management systems take this up many notches by bringing in
data definition, update, retrieval, and administration functions. It is here that SQL also comes in, by
providing ways to access multiple records from a database with one command. In part, this is because
SQL requests do not need to specify how to reach a record.

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) founded by the Swedish
company MySQL AB in 1994. Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB in 2008, and then Oracle
acquired Sun Microsystem in 2010. There is now both a GNU General Public License (GPL) version
and a proprietary version. In 2010, one of the co-founders of MySQL launched MariaDB, a community-
developed, commercially supported fork of MySQL. MariaDB seeks to maintain high compatibility
with MySQL, and is the RDBMS now used in the Raspberry Pi foundation project instructions, starting
with step 4.

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP and paired
with MySQL/MariaDB. It was first released in 2003 and is used by many websites around the world,
either directly or through platforms built using WordPress as their base. WordPress is licensed under
the GPLv2 from the Free Software Foundation. Take a few minutes to explore more about this mission,
history, and story of WordPress at: https://wordpress.org/about/. Here's where you go to download
WordPress for installation, along with a range of themes, plug-ins, and other material. Do so by mov-
ing to step 5 of the Raspberry Pi Foundation LAMP with WordPress project.

There is also a hosted version of WordPress at https://wordpress.com/. Go into the about page to com-
pare how the story shared through this site compares to the one in the .org site. How is the story
similar? Different? What are their different audiences?

Key Takeaways

Since early in the Orange Unit, we've been exploring aspects of data--the symbols used to present
real-world entities created through abstraction--and information--the formatted, structured, and orga-
nized outcome of the process of meaning-making and value assessment from data. By the start of the
Rainbow Unit, we were able in chapter 1B: Connecting Our Electronic `Thing' to a Wider World to
377 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure

read data such as 0, 1, 77, 21, and 2144772, read from the Circuit Playground Express every second
using Python code on the Raspberry Pi to display this data in a terminal window or a web browser
as information using format, structure, organization, and meaning-making names, such as Note, But-
ton, Temp, Light, and Runtime. But since the Orange Unit, we've also worked to step up a major level
of information through the ongoing meaning-making through social justice storytelling. As we ended
the Blue Unit, chapter 4B: Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library provided us with the means to
readily make available up to seven stories, using the Circuit Playground Express in combination with
the Raspberry Pi running Python code. In both Blue Unit 4B and Rainbow Unit 1B, we made use of
single-purpose MakeCode and Python programs to accomplish a specific task.

We've now worked through a series of exercises resulting in a LAMP web server with WordPress.
We've also worked to identify various decisions influencing the design and implementation of many
of the sociotechnical components that make up this web stack, as installed using the base instructions
provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. We now have the ability to write dynamic HTML using data
and information of many types stored within both text and database files. This data and information
can be further processed as part of meaning-making by individuals and groups of people, resulting in
different format, structure, and organization, and thereby creating yet different information. We con-
cluded this set of exercises by adding the MariaDB Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
and WordPress Content Management System (CMS) to our LAMP server to facilitate the ongoing work
of collecting, organizing, formatting, and distributing data and information in collaboration with web
clients. In doing so, we've created a higher-level sociotechnical network information system.

From Orange Unit Session one forward, we've worked to demystify the social and technical com-
ponents that together shape the larger daily use technologies amongst us. These mutually shaped
sociotechnical components and systems shape us even as we practice innovation-in-use to shape these
devices. We've now got a digital Little Free Library system with electronics, microcontrollers, single-
purpose web servers, and a general-purpose LAMP web server with WordPress CMS. But we also now
have worked to demystify in significant ways the basic building blocks of these various aspects, open-
ing up agency to innovate-in-use these various components. In so doing, we have hopefully discov-
ered ways that stock stories have been used to create a lens on the sociotechnical components and
systems that aren't right, aren't just. Moving further, the goal has been to provide us with base skills
for social justice storytelling in which we can discover, develop, and share counterstories that buck the
status quo in different ways. These can come through concealed stories that serve as direct responses
to stock stories, resistance stories that not only buck against stock stories but also highlight injustices,
and emerging and transforming stories that (re)construct knowledge built on concealed and resistance
stories. Going further, we ourselves are hearing the counterstories in ways that are (re)constructing
knowledge--actionable information--that we can use as we design, build, put into practice, and/or
innovate-in-use networked information systems as part of our own professional practices as informa-
tion professionals getting into good trouble, necessary trouble.

Do Something New!

Set aside some time for reflection now to consider the three different networked information
systems we now have on hand for our use for a range of purposes, including as a mobile
Digital Little Free Library and Counterstory Player:

         · The Raspberry Pi Counterstory Little Free Library

         · The Raspberry Pi Special-Purpose Current Statistics Reporting and Remote LED
            Controller

         · The Raspberry Pi General-Purpose LAMP with WordPress Server

1. What are some times when you would choose one of the three over the other two?
    Why?

2. What is an innovation-in-use you would like to do to ensure that each one better
    meets the needs of its use as you described above?

3. Are there ways that an innovation-in-use could help each of the networked infor-
    mation systems facilitate its use by different audiences to help them make the data
    and information actionable--that is, to help people turn it into knowledge?

The following are a few ideas for something new you can do to tighten your understanding
of the key learning objectives of the textbook. In taking one of these ideas, it may be that
you do not currently have the needed connections with community members to make this
real. Further, your work through this textbook may have been done in a restricted time-
frame which may be coming to an end. Thus, this may be more of a thought experiment with
targeted skillset development, rather than a real-life, critically engaged community inquiry
activity. But starting this activity with some imagining of members of a community that find
themselves in the margins in a critical way, a way for which you need to stand up and say
something, do something, will help you to bring a more holistic sociotechnical exploration
into the chosen "Do Something New!" exploration, as you consider ways to professionally
get into good trouble, necessary trouble as you move forward.

Expanding Your Digital Little Free Library

You've now set up a WordPress CMS on your Raspberry Pi, running under the Apache
Server and connected to a MariaDB Server. How might you make use of these to grow your
Digital Little Free Library into something that can facilitate data and information collec-
tion, management, analysis, and distribution to serve a specific need or opportunity? Beyond
your community of practice, who needs to be brought into the conversation as part of a
human-centered design and implementation? There are a range of ways in which today's
networked information systems, including but not limited to social media, have incorpo-
379 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure

      rated systems, structures, policies, and practices that have been exclusionary for those on
      the margins of society. How can this system be used to address a community-identified limit
      situation? How can this be done in a way that allows those community members who have
      been oppressed and marginalized to become active innovators-in-use of the system, so as to
      ensure that it provides an actionable way for these members of the community to address
      the limit situation in a way that matters to them?

      To integrate this into a learning opportunity, you might also check out the Raspberry Pi
      Foundation, which provides a range of other educational projects you can do to learn more
      about web servers, websites, and webpages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. More gener-
      ally, the Foundation provides projects to further explore different software and coding lan-
      guages. Some of these might be directly integrated into the WordPress space, while others
      might be a complement to that space.

     What's Next?

      For those who choose this adventure, how might you use this space strategically to proto-
      type multiple subcomponents within the larger Digital Little Free Library system in order
      to "say something, do something" to "get in good trouble" in, with, and for a marginalized
      community in a way that matters to them?

    MAZI Zone DIY Community Network

      The core work with the Raspberry Pi within this book has made use of the newest version
      of the Raspberry Pi OS. But there are now Linux operating systems targeted for embedded
      devices to do a range of special-purpose tasks. Both the Raspberry Pi and the Circuit Play-
      ground Express are made using embedded devices. As an example, The OpenWrt Project is
      a Linux operating system designed to facilitate the routing of network traffic using a range
      of embedded devices, including the Raspberry Pi. The OpenWrt Linux operating system can
      thus be used to turn the Raspberry Pi into a router connecting a Local Area Network
      (LAN) to a Community Area Network (CAN) using wired and wireless Ethernet ports.
      For those with a deeper technical background, this may be of interest to explore as a means
      for building a Community Wireless Network by attaching a Raspberry Pi to a LAN using a
      wired Ethernet cable, and then setting up the wireless LAN to create a new LAN (e.g., see
      these instructions from Sparkfun).

      Perhaps a better starting point for this introductory text, those wanting to Try Something
      New! might consider creating a MAZI Zone community network that includes not only a
      LAMP with WordPress server, but also additional programs, and even the possibility of link-
      ing together multiple Raspberry Pi's into a broader community network.
                                                                                      3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure 380

         MAZI means "together" in Greek. The MAZI project is part of the Collective Awareness
         Platforms for Sustainability and Social Innovation initiative, promoted by the European
         Commission, and funded through the European Union's H2020 framework. Their goal is "to
         provide technology and knowledge in order to:

                  · empower those who are in physical proximity, to shape their hybrid urban space,
                     together, according to the local environment and context.

                  · generate location-based collective awareness as a basis for fostering social cohe-
                     sion, conviviality, participation in decision-making processes, self-organisation,
                     knowledge sharing, and sustainable living.

                  · facilitate interdisciplinary interactions around the design of hybrid space and the
                     role of ICTs in society."13

         According to MAZI, do-it-yourself (DIY) networking using such toolkits "can serve two
         complementary objectives:

                 1. to improve Internet connectivity in a certain region or local area
                 2. to support local interactions and services."14

        The MAZI Toolkit

         The MAZI Toolkit is made up of three elements. All of these are available from the MAZI
         Toolkit page on this website.

                 1. Low cost hardware: Currently the Toolkit is using the Raspberry Pi system.
                     Designs for making your own hardware casings will be available soon.

                 2. Software and applications: These are specifically developed by the MAZI Project,
                     including a set of local web applications ready to be installed on the captive portal.
                     The functionality will range from very simple communication services, like chat-
                     ting, forums, wikis, and polls to more sophisticated collaborative applications for
                     social networking, deliberations, community organizing, project development, etc.

                 3. Guidelines and knowledge, including examples and inspirations: Installation
                     scripts and step-by-step guides are part of the toolkit, enabling you to build and
                     deploy your own network zone, to configure a user-facing captive portal, and to
                     select and customize software applications.

         In addition, you can directly access the Toolkit guidelines on GitHub, which includes up-to-
         date documentation.

381 3B: A Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure

      For this adventure, consider flashing a second 16GB MicroSD card with a ready-made MAZI
      toolkit image that includes the Raspberry Pi Operating System and the rest of the LAMP +
      WordPress stack, along with a number of other software applications that can be used by
      choice as part of your own MAZI Zone. This MAZI Zone can be used offline on its own, as
      part of a LAN or CAN intranet, or online with the Internet. You can use it exclusively as
      a web-based ICT, or you could also include Python-based IoT communications, integrating
      and innovating-in-use into your MAZI Zone exercises from session one of the Rainbow Unit.
      The MAZI website lists several test examples, but consider other ways this might be used as
      part of an Urban or Rural Community Network, or perhaps even in support of digital agri-
      culture on that five acre farm seeking sustainable agriculture pathways.

     What's Next?

      For those who choose this adventure, how might you now use your MAZI Zone to prototype
      ways this can be designed, so that you could "say something, do something" to "get in good
      trouble" in, with, and for a marginalized community or communities within a geographic
      region?

    From an HTTP Thing to Multiple Internet of Things Devices

      Through the exercises of the Rainbow Unit, we've explored a few different ways we could
      bring together the Orange Unit electronics and the Blue Unit code with the Rainbow Unit
      internetworking to build a basic Internet thing. How might you now start combining mul-
      tiple basic Internet things together to create a plural Internet of Things? This adventure
      could be done using the Python3 and/or Apache HTTP server setup already in place, done
      in combination with one of the above "choose your adventure" possibilities above to provide
      a richer web interface, or using the Adafruit IO. [Watch the video "All the Internet of Things
      - Episode 4 - Adafruit IO: An IoT Service for Everyone" online.]

      The Adafruit Learning site also has instructions on how you can take a newly emerging
      pathway to set up your Raspberry Pi as a Home Assistant. Unlike IFTTT or Samsung Smart
      Things, your data can remain local, not needing to tie in with the Internet, or can be used in
      combination with the secured Adafruit IO to add in remote access.

      And for those comfortable in CircuitPython who want to test out an open-source web
      application that includes data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical
      modeling, data visualization, and machine learning, still another adventure could include
      CircuitPython with Jupyter Notebooks as a first exploration of how machine learning and
      weak artificial intelligence could be brought into these works. [Watch the video "Machine
      Learning & Artificial Intelligence: Crash Course Computer Science #34" online.]

What's Next?

For those who choose this adventure, how might you now use your Internet of Things to
prototype a way you could "say something, do something" to "get in good trouble" in sup-
port of a marginalized community? This is a more technical activity but there may very well
be members of the oppressed community who are ready and able to be an active member of
your community of practice. However, it may also be that they do not have available time
as they find themselves working multiple jobs and serving different community leadership
roles because of the limit situations keeping them in the margins. In this case, you might
work in collaboration with some to design for design after design so that community mem-
bers can use these in ways that allow innovation-in-use to assure the IoT prototype can be
adapted to advance a given activity overcoming the limit situation specific to the current
community context.

Wrap Up

To the extent possible, working on the various activities of this textbook have been done within a
community of practice. Bringing investigations together with reflection and discussion with others
whose lived experiences are different than yours is essential if we are to identify unknown and unseen
meanings, values, and intentions that are embedded within the words of text and within the design of
hardware and software. As we come to better understand the codification within these, we can begin a
process of decodifcation and recodification, making the data and information potentially actionable in
some new way. It is to re-center our work as information scientists from a thing-orientation towards a
person-orientation. And as noted several times throughout the textbook, it is to use this as an oppor-
tunity for doing pre-season training activities within a sports metaphor. Each is meant to strengthen a
different aspect of ourselves and ourselves in relation to others.

But core through each of the activities within this textbook has been the advancement of sociotech-
nical skills in ways that prepare each member of our community of inquiry for a deeper, critically-
engaged community inquiry. Ongoing pre-season action-reflection collective leadership practices are
working to develop stronger muscle memory so that these methods are an active part of your daily
practices as an information science professional moving forward. Such adventures will include in dif-
ferent ways at different times active bottom-up participatory action research in community, with com-
munity, for community throughout your lifetime. This is something we'll explore further in Rainbow
Unit 4A: Recovering Community: Designing for Social Justice.

        To conclude, there are two possible futures for libraries: one is a passive future, in which
        libraries sit back and let others design solutions to information problems. The second one,
        and the one I know I prefer, is the one that libraries design. Design thinking is so pervasive
        in librarianship that libraries and librarians already have the power to create unique, pow-
        erful, value-laden experiences and help individuals, communities, and even societies solve
        information problems. It's time to embrace design as a fundamental component of librarian-
        ship in order to create a better future for all.

        Rachel Ivy Clarke, Design Thinking3

  As noted by Merriam-Webster, design is a word with a range of definitions. To begin, let's consider this
  within a very broad framing: to make something, it first needs to be implicitly or explicitly designed.
  When we are trained within a profession to move from rote use of tools and techniques at our disposal
  in order to accomplish tasks, to instead expanding upon the tools and techniques to assure they work
  for different populations and contexts, we are being taught to design and make new things or to fur-
  ther innovate-in-use and remix existing things. We have moved from use to design. We all design per-
  sonally and professionally to some extent or another. But only some of us are formally given the job
  description of designer. As we've journeyed through the Units of this textbook, we've been immersed
  within a deep hands-on social + technical dive into sociotechnical artifacts including electronics, soft-
  ware, and networks culminating with what is hopefully now a more holistic understanding of net-
  worked information systems. We've met, and made active use of, skillsets, frameworks, and standards
  employed by a wide range of information professionals in selecting, co-designing, appropriating, and
  innovating-in-use networked information systems. Throughout this deep dive, a central objective has
  been the development of a critical approach to sociotechnical artifacts and the advancement of com-
  munity agency in appropriating technology to achieve individual and community development goals.
  Core is an intent to move away from information science professionals as passive recipients of net-
  worked information systems designed by others to address information problems, and instead build
  from our already existing professional "power to create unique, powerful, value-laden experiences and
  help individuals, communities, and even societies solve information problems."4 Information science
  professionals and our patrons each move from use to design and back as needed to effectively take on
  information problems. In Design Thinking, Rachel Ivy Clarke notes:

        Supporting patrons has always been a key component of librarianship, which has prided
        itself on being a user-centered profession. Early American librarianship was rooted in ser-
        vice to library users with the goal of improving their lives through exposure to books,
        reading, and literacy. Reading was emphasized as a means of intellectual, moral, and social
        education and improvement. But this meant that the tools and services created by libraries
        for users were often based less on what users wanted to read and more on what librarians
        thought users should read; usually this meant classic, culturally uplifting texts in the Western

        literary canon. Although this agenda certainly had users at its center, today it is criticized
        for its cultural presumption and its imposition of certain values.5

  Especially beginning in the mid-twentieth century, efforts have been made to move from assumptions
  to investigations of what is actually needed and wanted, such as through the use of "needs assess-
  ments." This form of design has been heavily influenced through user-centered design (UCD) in
  which "design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environments; is driven and
  refined by user-centered evaluation; and addresses the whole user experience. The process involves
  users throughout the design and development process and it is iterative. And finally, the team includes
  multidisciplinary skills and perspectives."6

  However, as noted by Sasha Costanza-Chock in Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the
  Worlds We Need, "Design always involves centering the desires and needs of some users over others.
  The choice of which users are at the center of any given UCD process is political, and it produces
  outcomes (designed interfaces, products, processes) that are better for some people than others (some-
  times very much better, sometimes only marginally so). This is not in and of itself a problem. The prob-
  lem is that, too often, this choice is not made explicit."7 Clarke adds, "User-centered approaches, by
  their very name, focus on use: things like completing a task or accomplishing a goal. The word user
  reduces people to the use of a thing, rather than engaging with their experiences as human beings."8

  While user-centered practices are works of design, user-centered design too easily results in the user
  being identified as an entity completing a task, ultimately a work of dehumanization. An alternate
  holistic approach incorporating empathetic techniques has emerged attempting to re-center human
  beings as individuals. "It's a process that starts with the people you're designing for and ends with
  new solutions that are tailor made to suit their needs. Human-centered design (HCD) is all about
  building a deep empathy with the people you're designing for; generating tons of ideas; building a
  bunch of prototypes; sharing what you've made with the people you're designing for; and eventually
  putting your innovative new solution out in the world."9 A central aspect of human-centered design is
  to consider not only the actions of design work, but the thought processes that underly these actions.
  Design thinking emerged as a term in the 1960s to describe this key aspect of design found across a
  wide range of design disciplines.

  Indeed, consider our own work throughout the sessions and units of this textbook, and you'll find
  ongoing cycles of action-reflection praxis -- reading, watching, discussing + hands-on actions alone

and within pairs/small groups + individual and corporate reflections. Together, these move us from use
to design to broader thinking regarding design processes and the shapers of design and product. There
is the risk that as with so many other concepts that reach popular use, design thinking is taken out
of the more rigorous, extended work of design as a mental pat of congratulations for being thought-
ful and empathetic while continuing a user-centered approach. And there is a risk that this design
thinking is done in ways that shape design to conform to dominant narratives. But critically, strategi-
cally, and communally used, design thinking becomes a valuable mindset while working to resolve ill-
defined problems using critical abductive reasoning within a broader design justice approach as we'll
explore in the next section. [Watch the video "What is Design Thinking?" online.]

In the 1990s, one of the lead faculty at the Stanford University Design School, David Kelley, also
worked to bring design thinking into the field through the founding of IDEO, a global design and con-
sultancy company. And through more recent funding by the Global Libraries program at the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation, IDEO led to the creation of a Design Thinking for Libraries toolkit in col-
laboration with Chicago Public Library in the United States and Aarhus Public Libraries in Denmark.

Libraries are a center for information access and serve to benefit their people in a wide range of
ways. Over time, approaches and perspective have had to change to adapt to new opportunities and
needs. But the challenges are real, complex, and varied within a rapidly evolving information land-
scape. Design thinking within the library context seeks to foster deeper understanding of the needs
of patrons and to engage with communities in new ways. The design thinking processes listed in the
toolkit bring forward a few formulas that might prove useful in moving from learning about the terms
and concepts of digital technologies to considering ways these technologies can be further designed
and remixed by the communities of practice of which you are a part or whom you are serving within
a support and resource role. And as information scientists, the activity toolkit may also prove a useful
base as we enter into collaborations with design professionals who bring to the collective leadership
deeper formal training in design techniques, including form, composition, balance, typography, visual
literacy, color theory, etc. In practice, it's also helpful to include within the toolkit alternate terms to
those within the "Design Thinking" framing, such as:

         · Inspiration: Discovery, Interpretation, Empathize, Define

         · Ideation: Ideate, Create, Prototype, Rapid Prototyping

         · Iteration: Implementation, Experimentation, Deliverable, Test, Evolution

And consider, too, that this design thinking framework itself is another way of considering the ongo-
ing inquiry cycle done in community, with community, and for community that includes: ...  Ask

  Design Justice

   Library and information science is a profession dedicated to advancing the informed decision-making
   abilities of individuals, communities, and societies. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century:

         Libraries played a significant role by portraying themselves as socially uplifting agents,
         developing library services to meet the needs of European immigrant populations during
         the foundation years (1900-1917), or during the era of depression and war (1930-1945),
         and afterwards, where the focus was on economic recovery and revitalization. During these
         times, the library provided liberating directions for social justice outcomes in nurturing just
         and fair ideals, expanding the base of impact to include outreach populations, creating a ser-
         vice-based ethics in the profession, and forging partnerships with community-based social
         justice agencies towards common goals.10

         Bharat Mehra, Kevin S. Rioux, and Kendra S. Albright, "Social Justice in Library and Infor-
         mation Science"

   As the twentieth century came to an end and we entered the twenty-first century, these works
   also included community networking, community technology centers, digital literacy training, and
   addressing the digital divide. "These included social justice activities and initiatives, even though the
   rhetoric and vocabulary of `social justice' had not been significantly incorporated into the mainstream
   profession."11 Mehra, Rioux, and Albright acknowledge there is no universally accepted definition for
   social justice, and moreover, social justice theory specific to library and information science is still
   within its infancy:

         Historically, social justice has been concerned with the tensions between: 1) the individual's
         right to choose her/his own ends; 2) conflicts with other individuals' rights to make similar
         choices; and 3) the debate on individual rights vs. the good of the community.12

         The lessons from the past are today providing libraries directions to develop a new approach
         that recognizes:

                 1. importance of outcome-based, socially relevant evaluation methods in assessing
                     library services;

                 2. value of local experiences and ontologies and their representation into formalized
                     organizational tools of information; and

   Human-centered design has served as an important transition point from previous user-centered
   approaches to design in helping the information science profession move towards a person-centering
   of sociotechnical design, implementation, and use. This textbook builds from over 20 years of social
   justice-oriented teaching, research, and practice that has included extensive use of service projects,
   community inquiry, and engaged scholarship to bring together the school and community to advance
   community goals. But a 2008 ethnographic study of my course "Introduction to Networked Infor-
   mation Systems" conducted by Junghyun An found that without greater criticality, incorporation of
   human-centered design techniques and social justice-oriented pedagogies and goals into design stu-
   dio service projects too easily left true action-reflection praxis at a superficial level.14 An's valuable
   study underlined important aspects, and highlighted key shortcomings, of my own ongoing research
   that has emphasized the essential need for critical ongoing thinking regarding the various social issues
   and problems within our own technology design and use practices, as well as those of others shaping
   these technologies. And of central importance is that these reflections include collaborative discus-
   sions within our own profession and related professions, and also very importantly with the wider
   range of stakeholders, especially those marginalized and oppressed via the shaping that is embedded
   within and emerges from these technologies.

   This textbook was birthed through deep nights of the soul that especially emerged beginning in the
   late 2000s. Rather than learning-by-doing specifically as a service-learning action, it now seeks to be
   a learning-by-doing action-reflection praxis as a primer for true ongoing professional design justice
   works. The action-reflection learning-by-doing praxis of this textbook happens as we use our deep-
   ening understanding of the components and concepts underlying electronics, software, and networks
   to build a picture, or codification, of these artifacts within real situations and people, including those
   forgotten and marginalized. It happens as we then work to decodify the artifacts and associated codes
   by looking at certain aspects in order to build a new lens on the larger sociotechnical artifacts. It con-
   tinues to happen as, through this work of action and reflection, we reach towards a recodification to
   move from magical thinking about networked information systems that are designed by others for our
   passive professional use to meet patron needs, and instead envision an alternate, social justice path for
   our profession that centers around community inquiry and collective leadership engaging all members
   of local communities.

   But for this to happen, we need to assure our human-centered design thinking is centered within a
   design justice approach. Costanza-Chock argues that this work is:

         ...about the relationship between design and power. It's about the growing community of
         designers, developers, technologists, scholars, educators, community organizers, and many
         others who are working to examine and transform design values, practices, narratives, sites,
         and pedagogies so that they don't continue to reinforce interlocking systems of structural
         inequality. It's about design, social justice, and the dynamics of domination and resistance at
         personal, community, and institutional levels. In essence, it's a call for us to heed the grow-
         ing critiques of the ways that design (of images, objects, software, algorithms, sociotechnical
         systems, the built environment, indeed, everything we make) too often contributes to the
         reproduction of systemic oppression. Most of all, it is an invitation to build a better world, a
         world where many worlds fit; linked worlds of collective liberation and ecological sustain-
         ability.15

   Costanza-Chock works towards a recognition that development of new information and communica-
   tion technologies (ICT) needs to "not only take shape in Silicon Valley, they also emerge from mar-
   ginalized communities and social movements, both during waves of spectacular protest activity and
   also in everyday life," in order to "advance the growing conversation about the pitfalls and possibilities
   of design as a tool for social transformation."16 The Design Justice Network and its underlying prin-
   ciples are central to Costanza-Chock's vision. Considered part of a living document, these principles
   emerged over several years of work as part of the Allied Media Conference held in Detroit. As of a
   summer 2018 update, the Design Justice Network Principles are:

         Design mediates so much of our realities and has tremendous impact on our lives, yet very
         few of us participate in design processes. In particular, the people who are most adversely
         affected by design decisions -- about visual culture, new technologies, the planning of our
         communities, or the structure of our political and economic systems -- tend to have the least
         influence on those decisions and how they are made.

         Design justice rethinks design processes, centers people who are normally marginalized by
         design, and uses collaborative, creative practices to address the deepest challenges our com-
         munities face.

         Principle 1: We use design to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as well as to
         seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems.

         Principle 2: We center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcomes
         of the design process.

         Principle 3: We prioritize design's impact on the community over the intentions of the
         designer.

         Principle 4: We view change as emergent from an accountable, accessible, and collab-
         orative process, rather than as a point at the end of a process.17

         Principle 5: We see the role of the designer as a facilitator rather than an expert.

         Principle 6: We believe that everyone is an expert based on their own lived experience,
         and that we all have unique and brilliant contributions to bring to a design process.

         Principle 7: We share design knowledge and tools with our communities.

         Principle 8: We work towards sustainable, community-led and -controlled outcomes.

         Principle 9: We work towards non-exploitative solutions that reconnect us to the earth
         and to each other.

         Principle 10: Before seeking new design solutions, we look for what is already working
         at the community level. We honor and uplift traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge
         and practices.

   Design justice re-centers the role of digital literacy training using what Virginia Eubanks calls pop-
   ular technology. Introduced in her 2007 article "Popular technology: exploring inequality in the
   information economy" and expanded further in her books Digital Dead End (2011) and Automating
   Inequality (2017), Eubanks systematically investigates the ways high-tech tools and jobs continue and
   expand social inequalities within the United States. To move beyond this dominant narrative, Eubanks
   brings forward an alternative digital literacy agenda that "make[s] technology analysis and develop-
   ment both relevant and empowering to people who live in persistent poverty, by drawing on traditions
   of popular education in South America (articulated by Paulo Freire) and the United States (articulated
   by Myles Horton and the Highlander Research and Education Center)."19 Eubanks underlines that as a
   digital literacy strategy, "popular technology reminds us that technology is not a destiny but a site of
   struggle."20 A popular technology approach:

            · Resists oppression in the form of exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural
               imperialism, and violence;

            · Draws on cognitive, cultural, and institutional difference as a resource; and

   In the Laura Flanders Show episode below, Eubanks further introduces Automating Inequality: How
   High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor before describing the 2018 Allied Media Conference
   and the "Our Data Bodies" project, developed in collaboration with members of the Detroit Commu-
   nity Technology Project. These all serve as examples of coalition work and collaboration that should
   be the essential centering of all radically reconsidered digital literacy training, technology design, and
   sociotechnical artifact and system implementation. Eubanks highlights the Allied Media Conference
   as an "incredible space where we have difficult conversations about media, technology, and social jus-
   tice. But the folks who are here are makers. They're organizers, they're activists, so they make spaces
   and they make movements. But they also make stuff." She highlights the math-washing that leads us
   to believe things, issues, and solutions are more complicated than we can handle: "It's true there might
   be a really technically complicated system that takes a little bit of breaking down for us to understand,
   but we understand the problems and we understand the solutions and we understand actually even
   some of the really complicated technologies that are out there once we have the language, the basic
   language to do it." [View the video "Automating Inequality: Virgina Eubanks" to hear her story.]

  The Studio Space

   Makerspaces, Tinkering Studios, Fab Labs, and other creative spaces have become increasingly com-
   monplace as workspaces bringing people together to engage in conceiving, designing, and developing
   new artifacts. They often incorporate both traditional crafts and also emerging digitally based crafts.
   Beyond general action-reflection that includes various inspiration, ideation, iteration, and "act, investi-
   gate, create, discuss, reflect" cycles, a key component of effective design is the critique process. Clarke
   describes the critique in Design Thinking:

         Critique is a rigorous form of evaluation that is central to the discipline of design. Critique
         may call to mind scary memories of harsh, negative criticism, perhaps in front of peers, like
         reading a poem aloud in a creative writing class only to have the instructor and classmates
         rip it to shreds. However, well-executed design critique is not subjective negativity. Critique
         is not about whether you "like" a design or approve of its aesthetics. A good critique says
         why something does or does not work for that individual. It asks questions and elicits the
         rationale for a design decision. A critique is about discovering what's not working in order
         to make a design better. It can be a hard process to learn to take critique well, and even
         harder to learn to give a critique well. The critique of a design--especially one you are emo-
         tionally invested in--can feel like a personal blow. This is why it's important to seek critique
         throughout the design process.21

Critique can take many different forms, and it is often helpful to make strategic use of selected forms
at different points within the design process. The following is a list of some of these I've found helpful
within my community informatics studios:

Rooted in the apprentice model of learning in which students study with master craftspeople or artists
to develop their craft, studio classes emphasize learning by doing, often through iterative, multimodal
analysis, proposition building, design, making, and critique of different alternatives that might address
community-based problems. It has been an integral pedagogy in practitioner-based fields such as
architecture, urban planning, and fine and applied arts. Studio-based learning aligns closely with John
Dewey's concept of experiential learning. For instance, Dewey emphasized the importance of helping
students shape their purpose for a given activity by constructing a plan based on their impulses, past
experiences, and community knowledge to maximally shape the current learning environment. In this
way, teachers act more like "guides" to assist students in developing and implementing their design
and making choices. Students and instructors work together within a studio space that serves as a
model of professional practice. Regular written reflections also help students think more deeply about
the paths that lead them to their final project processes, outputs, and outcomes.

    Scaling ideas through multiple community inquiry cycles using collective leadership as a foundation for iterative testing
    and critique spirals

   Much of the service-learning coursework that has guided the creation of this textbook emerged orig-
   inally through my work as part of the East St. Louis Action Research Project (ESLARP), one of the
   oldest community-university partnership programs in the United States. The University of Illinois
   Urbana-Champaign was pushed to engage with the East St. Louis community, situated 175 miles away,
   when in 1987 State Representative Wyvetter Younge aggressively worked to bring the University into
   this most devastated city in the state, in order to provide essential assistance through participatory
   action research (PAR) projects in community, with community, doing collective inquiry and exper-
   imentation grounded in lived experiences and social histories. Later, Recreation Sports and Tourism,
   Library and Information Science, and Law joined the collaboration.23 It was here that I first began
   unwittingly making use of studio techniques for analysis, proposition building, design, making, and
   critique as I watched the works of other university instructors. I also later began a series of commu-
   nity-university collaborations to develop and introduce to the LIS profession a formal Community

   Informatics Studio course that centralizes place-making and popular technology workshops, within
   which sociotechnical artifact design and implementation serves a valuable supporting role.2425 This
   aligns strongly with the person-centered, hands-on guide for working with information and commu-
   nications technologies as covered in this textbook, and provides a potential tool for establishing and
   further advancing design justice as a part of our ongoing community inquiry activities in daily profes-
   sional field practices.

   Whether in the Makerspace or Tinker Studio, as part of design justice projects and networks, or in
   a community center meeting room, you have knowingly or unknowingly joined into a studio which
   includes various aspects of design and making. While some will have had formal training as designers,
   all of us bring in our lived experiences doing design practices. These movements are working to break
   down barriers to full participation in the analog and digital realms of sociotechnical artifacts, and to
   advance empowerment for all. But as Angela Calabrese Barton and Edna Tan note in STEM-Rich Maker
   Learning: Designing for Equity with Youth of Color:

         At the same time, it is important to ask questions about how the movement defines who
         makers are, what makers do, and what kinds of access makers need to tools and opportuni-
         ties to keep making. These questions cannot be divorced from considering the social, racial,
         gendered, economic, and political conditions in which particular makers are bound. Espous-
         ing an egalitarian vision of making may symbolically level the playing field, while the real-
         ity is that access and opportunities to make for some groups of the population continue to
         remain sporadic.26

   Barton and Tan further note: "It is always rooted in the history and geographies of young people's
   lives and in the broader context of making and makerspaces in the United States and beyond."27 Prob-
   lem identification and analysis, design, and making practices and expertise build through iterative and
   incremental works. But what types of practices and expertise are built? How does this go on to impact
   the longer-term shaping of people, communities, and societies? For us to move from social justice
   intent to truer forms of social justice practices, it is essential for the information science profession to
   continue our progression implementing design justice principles and practices.

   This chapter serves as a brief general introduction to design thinking, design principles, and design
   processes, and the ways that these need to center around design justice as one aspect of addressing

   real-world problems with community-based and -led social justice action and reflection praxis. To do
   this, Costanza-Chock notes that "design justice builds on, but also differs in important ways from,
   related approaches such as value-sensitive design, universal design, and inclusive design."28 Oth-
   ers, too, are finding it important to bring together a breadth of design approaches while also consid-
   ering ways in which designing for values will need to differ from certain approaches given current
   contexts.

   Located in The Netherlands, Delft Design for Values Institute brings together a diversity of design
   approaches, theoretical backgrounds, considered values, and application domains within the design
   field more broadly. Internal and external value dynamics across the broad spectrum of stakeholders
   need to be grasped and connected to achieve a more inclusive and successful design. [Watch the video
   "Designing with Values in Complex Projects" online.]

   Pieter Vermaas et al. note how "increased attention in design for values of users and of society at
   large has found its way also to design methodology."29 Modern design methods have moved from a
   previous focus on functionalities, affordances, and disaffordances, to contemporary methods that use
   methodologies such as ethnographic research to clarify the values at play in the problems of users,
   for instance regarding conflicting values of safety and privacy. To this end, a common design method
   bringing together user perspectives and user-driven design is participatory design.

   But as the scale of design outcomes expands, it is sometimes necessary to move beyond user-driven
   user perspective change, to broader user-driven social perspective change using transformation
   design methods to broaden the distribution of power within the decision-making process and bring
   forward a broader social perspective, as may be the case in the design of backbone Internet services
   used to connect multiple First Nations first-mile local area networks. As the complexity continues
   to increase, it becomes ever more challenging for design to be directly user-driven, and therefore
   design for values sometimes uses larger-scale, designer-driven social implication design methods.
   Still, even as complexity increases, as Fischer and Herrmann note in "Meta-Design: Transforming and
   Enriching the Design and Use of Socio-Technical Systems," a meta-design framing can be used to
   design for design after design, facilitating user-as-designer, or what Bruce et al. call innovation-in-
   use, at the use time of a product.3031

   Community technology design, as with many other areas of design, requires the bringing together
   of many different fields of research and practice that also include human-computer interaction (HCI),
   design studies, computer science, community studies, and community informatics. This is not some-
   thing the information sciences profession can do in a silo. For all involved, concerns continue to grow
   regarding the cultural black box in community technology design, expanding on the existing range of
   social shaping of technology concerns that have been raised throughout this textbook.32 It is for this
   reason that design justice might provide an essential central gathering point if we are to rapidly tran-
   sition from a "thing-oriented" society to a "person-centered" society.

  Lesson Plan

   In the last chapter, you were introduced to a famous quote by the late John Lewis, an American civil
   rights icon who was part of the 1961 Freedom Rides, served as the first chairperson of the Student
   Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and was a leader with the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther
   King, Jr., of the march on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, that was violently
   halted by police and later became known as "Bloody Sunday." John Lewis went on to direct the Voter
   Education Project before being appointed by then-President Carter to lead ACTION, the umbrella fed-
   eral volunteer agency that included the Peace Corps and Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA). In
   the 1980s, Lewis became a politician in the Atlanta city council, and then served as a representative in
   the U.S. Congress. For Lewis, each of these were part of his larger philosophy of a life well lived.

         My philosophy is very simple: When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just,
         you have to stand up, you have to say something, you have to do something.

         My mother told me over and over again when I went off to school not to get into trouble but
         I told her that I got into a good trouble, necessary trouble. Even today I tell people, "We need
         to get in good trouble."

         John Lewis, interviewed by Valerie Jackson for StoryCorps33

   Getting into "good trouble" can take many forms throughout one's life as we participate in ongoing
   inquiry cycles of asking the better question, investigating possibilities, doing creative acts to address
   limit situations, taking part in community discussions, and doing ongoing works of reflection. These
   are the works of recovering community through design for justice.

399 4A: Recovering Community: Designing for Social Justice

This session especially focuses on design frameworks and approaches that 1) recognize the designer in
each of us, and 2) the essential need for an integration and practice of design to advance the recovery
of community. As with all aspects of popular education, these cycles do not bring us to an end point,
but rather bring us to new starting points as we continue true social justice works. It is for this rea-
son that popular technology training and design-justice-related processes cannot be done exclusively,
or sometimes even primarily, within formal education and professional practices. But where and how
this should be done is not something that can be taught. It is something that needs to be discovered
in community, with community, and for community. Core to the lesson plan for this session, then,
is a goal of opening up possibility for you to discover individually and, to the extent possible within
your communities, what introductory development of design frameworks and processes you specifi-
cally still need.

This article is a 2014 Keynote given at the Illinois State University Critical Media Literacy Conference,
and was written by five University of Illinois students who tested the feasibility of several of the key
aspects of the De-mystifying Technology workshop framework that is now represented in this book.
This feasibility was tested as part of a participatory action research process in community and with
community that included design as one part of a Community Informatics Studio course, and gives a
valuable example of the critical design process in action within its broader community inquiry con-
text.

As a teenager working in the family sawmill, I found myself working closely with one of my dad's
cousins who worked at the sawmill over the winter months, when he wasn't working as a road worker
the rest of the year, when the roads and the land weren't frozen. He started referring to me as a buf-
full--a cross between a bull and a buffalo. While I could often be a bull in a china shop, knocking down
the beautiful plates, bowls, and cups all around me, I also was someone who would join in community,
our backs to each other to take on whatever might be out there. Over time I came to see the deeper
meaning of the term.

I was an individual bull from a line of bulls that had a knack for tearing things apart to figure out how
to put them back together. We were tinkers. While at times we left a wake of destruction behind us,
ultimately, we seemed to find a way to fail forward. The larger something was, the more small parts
could be found inside that needed to be torn apart and rebuilt. The bull side of "buffull" was meant to
serve as a reminder to temper the vigor in my movements, but to not lose it, either. And so it's been
session by session over this book, as we've learned to tear down and rebuild parts, whether on a bread-
board, within a microcontroller, or as part of a server. The large is a reflection of the small components
of which it is built. The building blocks of a circuit on the breadboard are the base of the building
blocks for a microcontroller, which are the base of the building blocks computer, which are the base of
a network of controllers and computers. Or so it is within the tinker mindset of a bull.

I am also of the buffalo clan. My cousin was a Kublick, as was my grandmother Wolske, who bore
my dad after her arrival from Eastern Europe to the United States. My mom was a Henkelmann born
from the womb of a Rosler in Eastern Europe. All four lines were ethnically Germanic, but never had
formal citizenship within a nation-state, as they roamed looking for places of community and space
for growing and crafting. The buffalo know how to bring backs together to form a circle of protection.
But they also provide a wide viewing through many different lenses. Different members are able to see

                                                                                 402
403 4B: Community-Centered Design: An Emergent Strategy for Community Organizing and Action

different distances and depths, depending on their angle of view. Together, there is a growing holistic
understanding regarding the lay of the land, and also what is being told between the lines of that text.
And so it's been session by session, as we have worked to build a community of practice in which we
could build a circle of protection to support and nurture each other's growth with the intent to have
as an outcome a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. And it is also to give us a diverse set
of lenses with which to see the various social and technical aspects, which themselves create a whole
greater than the sum of its parts through mutual shaping. Or so it is within the mindset of a buffalo
clan.

Being able to identify the electronics that together become networked information systems provides
new insights into the raw data--the symbols used to represent real-world entities--that are eventually
converted into digital form to be transmitted or processed using binary. And this seeks to help us to
see how the large then reflects these smallest of components. But as the networked interchange of data
over the Internet included at its origins and continued to require for an extended time the use of the
American Standard Communication Information Interchange (ASCII) codes, characters, and symbols,
we also can read more fully the lay of the land and the story being told between the lines. Story data is
the ability to identify and interpret data from which information emerges that can be communicated
in story. Social justice storytelling means to understand the codification within this data sufficiently
to decodify it, in order to better understand the various social and technical aspects that may be con-
tributing to the stock story and to facilitate a sharing of the concealed, resistance, and emerging and
transforming stories that respond to the stock stories, highlight the injustices, and reconstruct knowl-
edge built on the counterstories bucking against the stock stories.

As we worked through the Orange Unit and then the Blue Unit, a goal was to increasingly commu-
nicate data with context as story in both form and narrative experience. This required an increasing
merging of the social and technical aspects to structure story information, the second part of the Story-
DIKW framework proposed by Kate McDowell. The Rainbow Unit has sought to further bring a range
of different story data and information together as budding story knowledge. As noted within the
Story-DIKW framework, this would be the ability to convey knowledge as complex, actionable infor-
mation through the construction and telling of a story that importantly ensures the incorporation of
cultural and contextual cues. The Rainbow Unit thus worked to bring together programmable electron-
ics and the Internet of Things with its counterpart, today's often centralized structures that serve as a
primary master device to its many remote slave devices, or what Neil Gerschenfeld calls the Bitnet of
Things. The unit has further worked to bring together internetworking and the digital Internet, which
includes multiple and often conflicting paths, including those primarily community-led and those pri-
marily corporately led, along with many pathways in between. From here, the unit has worked to
explore ways in which a restructuring of social welfare systems has been done in part through defi-
nitions of haves and have-nots and through terms such as "digital divide" and "digital inclusion;" this
restructuring served as a core aspect of workforce development efforts in United States policies and
practices. At the same time we worked to explore the social restructuring, we also worked to discover

  that in demystifying technology through a deep, hands-on dive into the codification of the sociotech-
  nical Internet, new opportunities open to reflexively decodify it, so as to facilitate knowledge creation
  and acts of person-centered "good trouble, necessary trouble"1 in communities, with communities, and
  for communities of the oppressed as part of our social justice sociotechnical praxis.

  We're now coming to the finish as we also reconsider the design aspect of the tinker, adding a design
  justice framework to the framework of information sciences data, information, knowledge, and wis-
  dom. It is important to see design not as a start point, nor as a finish point, but rather as itself but
  one tool within a toolbelt. For design to occur justly and lead effectively towards good trouble, neces-
  sary trouble, it is essential that the tools of design are used in support of community and movement
  work that centers critical, person-centered connections, conversations with the people in a room in a
  moment, the building and preserving of trusting relationships with others, and still other aspects of
  building and sustaining community. As we've discovered, it is then that design and innovation can
  occur. And even here, it is not primarily product-focused, but more one of process, in which that which
  is designed can go on to be further designed through innovation-in-use.2

  It is exactly here that we find the strength of the Internet Protocols and Request for Proposals
  processes from which the core of the Internet has arisen, not as solution, but as the starting stage for
  ongoing creative works to solve the needs of local people and their communities. This is the End-to-
  End Principle first introduced by Louis Pouzin and the French Cyclades Network in the early 1970s.
  But others, such as the Freedom and Progress Foundation, have championed, and often successfully,
  for federal policies and corporate practices that would allow one nation, the United States, to use the
  technological breakthroughs to not only accelerate technological and economic strengths, but also
  social and political dominance3. But the core of the Internet and the potentials for networked infor-
  mation systems remain intact and provide us with the existence of choice. This textbook strives to
  facilitate the awareness of this choice, along with an introduction into the ways which we can exercise
  and achieve this choice4 as part of our work as information professionals, when design and innova-

the member of these communities and movements have identified.

Reflecting Back on the Learning Objectives of this Journey

Let's take a moment to reflect back on a few key highlights from the Introduction to the Book. Let's
start with the general learning outcome objectives of this book:

         · Develop a clear, hands-on working understanding of the physical and software layers of
            computers and networks. As learners journey through the units of this book, they will
            hopefully develop a growing comfort and competency: working with the basic nuts and
            bolts of computers and networks; appropriately integrating components to serve as tools
            for computational and information processing; and performing basic troubleshooting.

         · Evolve a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the sociotechnical artifacts we use as
            a daily part of our professional lives. The hardware, software, human, and social whole that
            is a digital artifact is greater than the sum of the parts. Beyond developing technical compe-
            tencies, we need to develop an awareness of, and skillsets to influence, the emergent prop-
            erties that come from specific combinations of the different social and technical building
            blocks of information systems.

         · Develop a critical approach to sociotechnical artifacts. Social systems are constructs of
            economy, politics, race, class, gender, social institutions, and other cultural dynamics. The
            design, diffusion, and implementation of technical innovations both reflect and shape these
            social systems. Critically examining social and technical information systems from multiple
            individual and societal perspectives opens up consideration of idealized expectations versus
            actual positive and negative impacts within specific user communities.

         · Advance community agency in appropriating technology to achieve our individual and
            community development goals through a reconsidered digital literacy learning and practice.
            Far from being just passive adopters of different digital technology artifacts used to find,
            evaluate, create, and communicate information, as Information Science professionals, we
            have opportunities to initiate and lead communities of practice, leveraging the plurality of
            our community's social and technical insights.

To achieve these outcome objectives, this is a book meant to be done as part of a community of practice
studio. The different units of the book and the sessions within each unit work within a virtuous cycle
that includes asking initial questions, joining in active co-learning, reading the words and worlds of
knowledge shared in a range of ways, internal reflection, group discussion, critical questions, and jour-
naling. Collective leadership, community inquiry, and action and reflection directed at the structures
to be transformed have been some of the key frameworks used within the textbook, and hopefully
                                           4B: Community-Centered Design: An Emergent Strategy for Community Organizing and Action 406

  within your community of practice studio, to collectively work within the virtuous cycle. Core to all
  of this is the call of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.:

        We must rapidly begin the shift from a `thing-oriented' society to a `person-oriented' society.
        When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more
        important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable
        of being conquered5.

  To help us advance our full range of skills--social and technical--needed to achieve our works as crafts-
  people, each session in this book includes two thematically-linked chapters, one more social-oriented
  and one more technical-oriented. Each of these thematically-linked chapters, along with the various
  activities, group discussions, and your Reading Notes and Professional Journal Reflections, form one
  session. Sessions are brought together into several larger units:

           · Orange Unit with social chapters providing underlying perspectives and mindsets and
              technical chapters introducing electronics.

           · Blue Unit with four social and technical sessions challenging us to exploring histories,
              mutual shaping, and innovations-in-use through a clearer grasp of the meta-theoretical
              landscape found within Western science and within Indigenous ways of knowing, while
              bringing together electronics and programming code within microcomputer and microcon-
              troller systems.

           · Rainbow Unit with four sociotechnical sessions seeking to tighten our growing holistic
              and nuanced understanding of the tools and technologies we use as a daily part of our pro-
              fessional, community, and personal lives.

       Time to Reflect Back on Your Actual Journey

        Before moving on, take some extended time now to look through your packet of Reading
        Notes and Professional Journal Reflections. Work to write down an introductory section of a
        Summative Professional Journal Reflection as you consider your journey as part of this com-
        munity of practice.

                 · How have you changed and evolved as a tinker?
                              As a member of a community of practice?
                              As a social justice storyteller?
                              As an information scientist?

 Emergent Strategy and its Grounding of Design Justice

  In the previous chapter, we were introduced to a range of design principles and practices. Design plays
  an active role in the mutual shaping of sociotechnical products. But it is not the starting or ending
  point of sociotechnical artifacts. Rather, a range of individual, community, social, and/or technical con-
  texts first come to play in launching a design activity, as possibilities for addressing identified needs
  and opportunities are explored. And while design may include rapid prototyping, these are generally
  insufficient to address the underlying individual, community, social, and/or technical contexts which
  first inspired the design activity. Design is necessary, but rarely if ever sufficient to addressing critical
  issues impacting people, nature, and society. As Sasha Costanza-Chock notes in her chapter, "Design
  Practices: `Nothing about Us without Us'":

        Ultimately, at its best, a design justice process is a form of community organizing. Design
        justice practitioners, like community organizers, approach the question of who gets to speak
        for the community from a community asset perspective. This is rooted in the principle that
        wherever people face challenges, they are always already working to deal with those chal-
        lenges; wherever a community is oppressed, they are always already developing strategies
        to resist oppression. This principle underpins what Black feminist author adrienne maree
        brown calls emergent strategy. Emergent strategy grounds design justice practitioners' com-
        mitment to work with community-based organizations that are led by, and have strong
        accountability mechanisms to, people from marginalized communities. This contrasts with
        most other design approaches; even those that aim to involve users, citizens, or community
        members typically do so in a consultative process that ultimately is led by the professional
        designers.6

  The concept of emergence has been used to understand how many relatively simple interactions
  become the connective tissue out of which complex systems and patterns arise. The critical connec-
  tions are thus emphasized over critical mass as strategies are brought forward to build authentic
  relationships using all the senses of the body and the mind. This is something that is not just a human-
  centered and -controlled process, but also includes more-than-human individuals and ecosystems as
  well. Emergent strategy, then, is a way of noticing the small actions and connections that create
  complex systems and patterns. As adrienne maree brown notes on pages 16-17 (Kindle Edition) of her
  book Emergent Strategy:

        Nothing is wasted, or a failure. Emergence is a system that makes use of everything in the
        iterative process. It's all data.

There are a number of revisions made in the second edition of this textbook that have at their root
the principles and practices of emergent strategy to which I was introduced soon after the publica-
tion of the first edition. It serves as a complement to the Western sciences, which is in part why it
has informed the creation of the design justice principles, which themselves are rooted in large part
within Western framings of design. In so doing, brown brings a Black feminist voice into the conver-
sation, similar to the way Robin Wall-Kimmerer brings an Indigenous voice into the conversation, as
Kimmerer brings together her Western science and her evolving understanding of her forgotten roots
found in Indigenous ways of knowing together. And I believe emergent strategy resonates so strongly
with me personally. It brings together my various cultural, environmental, ecumenical, and Western
science foundations, some of which I've shared throughout this book, into a more unified understand-
ing of what I've taught, planned, written, and practiced throughout my career as a critically engaged,
community-engaged scholar with a special focus on using the discipline of community informatics.
Each of the principles of emergent strategy captures well how I seek to live, think, and work to build
a better world. And each is something I hope will also prove fruitful for others as well:

      Small is good, small is all. (The large is a reflection of the small.)
      Change is constant. (Be like water).
      There is always enough time for the right work.
      There is a conversation in the room that only these people at this moment can have. Find it.
      Never a failure, always a lesson.
      Trust the People. (If you trust the people, they become trustworthy).
      Move at the speed of trust.
      Focus on critical connections more than critical mass--build the resilience by building the
      relationships.

        Less prep, more presence.
        What you pay attention to grows.7

  After a long day of activity with others outdoors, whether canoeing, sailing, backpacking, or cross-
  country skiing, we try to ensure time at the campfire to quietly reflect on the day while watching the
  beauty of the flames constantly changing shape and form. Most nights, this leads to someone sharing
  something beautiful they saw or experienced over the course of the day--a rose moment. Or maybe it
  was an experience that hurt them or made them really struggle in some way--a thorn moment. It is to
  acknowledge that the beauty of roses also includes the risk of a prick by the thorn along their stems.
  As these experiences start coming forward, we also strive to include the hopes we have for tomor-
  row--our bud moments.

  After multiple days, we try to set aside a down day to also just sit quietly within nature for extended
  time. Finding ways to tune into one small part of the whole of nature around me helps connect to
  the small that exists within, and makes up one part of, the complex ecosystem within which we find
  ourselves to have been navigating. As I sit in quiet contemplation, I see the constant of change within
  the longer arc that is change across centuries and millennia. I do so by finding the opportunities for
  conversation with nature. But I also then find it helpful to eventually move from hearing the music
  coming from the one to hear the choir that results from the voices of the many within the ecosystem
  in which I find myself.

       Listening to the Parts, Listening to the Choir

        Take time now to reflect back on your journey and write down a second session of your
        Summative Professional Journal Reflection, beginning with those from sessions three and
        four of the Rainbow Unit. What are some of the rose, thorn, and bud moments you've
        experienced as we've worked to unpack ways that digital technologies have been designed
        and deployed in ways that have continued or even expanded the web of oppressions found
        within the social divides around us?

        Reflecting further back to the start of the Rainbow Unit, we worked to better understand the
        infrastructure of the Internet and the possibilities and challenges in broadening our applica-
        tion of internetworking into other realms than just the globalized and corporatized aspects.
        This was a long journey, but hopefully there were various rose and bud moments amongst
        the thorns as we traveled through the Rainbow Unit. In what ways did we succeed in demys-
        tifying the clouds that keep network information systems within a mist? In what ways did
        we open up a visioning of the revolution of values that are person-oriented, rather than
        thing-oriented, as King called us to do over forty years ago?

      Now look through the whole of your notes, reflections, discussions, and hands-on activities.
      As you stand nearing the end of this journey, what are your special rose moments that you
      will keep preserved as a keepsake? What thorns especially pricked you along this journey
      or are still pricking you now? What are some buds you see as potentially ready to bloom in
      the coming months?

Planning Forward

Let's return now to the Person-Centered Network Information System Adventure started in session
three of the Rainbow Unit as your pre-season training comes to an end. The chapter ended with a Wrap
Up and Comprehension Check. In what ways has your journey sufficiently advanced your sociotech-
nical skills in ways that prepare each member of our community of inquiry for a deeper, critically
engaged community inquiry during the upcoming season of your life? Such adventures will include
in different ways at different times active bottom-up participatory action research in community, with
community, and for community throughout your lifetime. We've worked to advance muscle memory
through ongoing pre-season, action-reflection, collective leadership practices, so that these methods
are an active part of your daily practices as an information science professional moving forward. To
this we could now add design skills centered within principles of design justice and emergent strategy.

It is time to join together in small groups to find that conversation that can only happen in that room
with the people there in this moment. How can you build off the work to date to imagine the work to
come next?

         · Nimbleness in action is essential, but can easily lead to the embracing of a "do-acracy" that
            comes with significant risk of unintended consequences and loss of a sustained and truly
            systemic impact. True, direct democracy, on the other hand, requires times and places to
            slow it down if we are to expose issues of power, inclusion, and equity. How is the balance
            between action and reflection within your community of practice at this time? In what
            ways, if any, do you need to work in some way to address the ever-present tension between
            process and product?

         · Over the course of the textbook, we've worked to first understand the many small compo-
            nents and structures--such as electronic circuits, microcontrollers and microcomputers,
            basic variables, statements, arrays, conditionals and logic--that make up programming
            code, and that base standards and structures that are used to do internetworking. From
            there, we've worked to understand the ways these come together to form more complex
            structures. While change is constant, understanding these underlying small aspects, which
            have remained more stable even as complex systems have changed, helps us to demystify
            these black boxes. To this, we added a range of social components, which together created a
            more complex social web within which the complex technical structures reside. Together
411 4B: Community-Centered Design: An Emergent Strategy for Community Organizing and Action

            there exists a mutual shaping of sociotechnical artifacts and systems. In what ways, if any,
            might you bring this to your future work as an information professional? How can you
            work to bring others into the more demystified and person-centered approach in the next
            community of inquiry in which you find yourself, within a thing-oriented society that uses
            the black box to grow people's dependency on corporations and their interests?

         · Women and those who are Black, Indigenous, or within other groups of people of color are
            often excluded from fail-forward and growth mindsets as they are instead called on to be
            perfect. Instead of seeing failure as something that is wrong, we need to see it as a necessity
            and as part of learning. Hearing from the voices of others, and especially the marginalized
            and oppressed, leads to critical connections, moving the data and information towards that
            which is actionable--towards knowledge and power within and with those around us to
            advance good trouble, necessary trouble. This requires trust in the people, and it requires us
            to move at the speed of trust. Together we have a more holistic lens with which we can see
            those things that are not right, not fair, not just. With this more holistic lens, we can also
            stand up, say something, do something. This requires collective leadership as we work to
            proceed from failure towards lessons that help us ask the better question. It contributes to a
            virtuous cycle of investigation, design, and creative actions combined with critical conver-
            sations that can only happen in that moment with those people. It requires us to be present
            in that space using a person-orientation, a being-mode of action-reflection praxis, rather
            than being caught up within a doing-mode in which we are locked within a thing-orienta-
            tion. In what ways, if any, might you bring this to your future work as an information pro-
            fessional? How can this help your community of inquiry get into the good trouble,
            necessary trouble to build a better world within the space you find yourselves in that
            moment?

Diving Deeper

For there to be design justice, it is important to consider all of the ways possible to bring diverse com-
munity knowledge and cultural wealth to bear in the process. Indeed, as we've seen throughout the
textbook, innovative design and redesign of technologies so often forces into hiding the expansive,
diverse works of design and creations of technology done by each human. As Costanza-Chock notes:

      Design justice as a framework recognizes the universality of design as a human activity. As
      noted in the introduction, design means to make a mark, make a plan, or problem-solve; all
      human beings thus participate in design. However, though all humans design, not every-
      one gets paid to do so. Intersectional inequality systematically structures paid professional
      design work. Professional design jobs in nearly all fields are disproportionately allocated to
      people who occupy highly privileged locations within the matrix of domination. At the same
      time, the numerous expert designers and technologists who are not wealthy and/or educa-
                                           4B: Community-Centered Design: An Emergent Strategy for Community Organizing and Action 412

        tionally privileged white cis men have often been ignored, their labor appropriated, and their
        stories erased from the history of technology.8

  As information science professionals, we are paid not to just passively and strictly follow a list of tasks
  verbatim, but to creatively innovate-in-use our designated activities in ways that meet the needs of
  our patrons. If we are to truly advance existing and emerging social justice parameters within our pro-
  fession, we first need to move from user-centered design to human-centered design as part of our daily
  practices. But from here, we need to also move from general design thinking to an essential design
  justice framing. Funding to pay community members as members of the design team is an essential
  feature to advance social justice objectives, but one too often difficult to carry out in practice. In addi-
  tion, many designers have other commitments to work, community, and family that keep them from
  daily participation. I've found at times that an effective middle ground is to embed collective leadership
  within this process through invitation (with provision of funds, transport, and food to every extent
  possible) of community members who bring essential community knowledge and cultural wealth to
  bear within the critique process itself.

       Finding the Conversation That Can Only Happen Now with the People in
       this Room

        What are some things you should put into your action plan for the days, weeks, and months
        to come, as a community of practice, as a learning cohort within your degree program or
        community workshop space, and as individuals? Return again to the comprehension check
        you developed for yourselves at the end of session three. Take some time now to add to
        this some specifics related to design. What are the specific design-centered comprehension
        checks you are seeking to ensure that you are reaching the "yet enough" point of introduc-
        tory development?

                 · Often, we make use of activities like think-pair-share or two-four-all to do creative
                    works.

                 · This time you might consider flipping the script. Perhaps start within larger groups
                    to do some initial brainstorming, using a whiteboard to map a broad action plan.
                    From there, begin considering what smaller cohorts should gather to work on spe-
                    cific aspects especially relevant to their own development as professionals moving
                    forward.

                 · Whichever path you choose, a final Summative Professional Journal Reflection will
                    be important, to bring the various thoughts that have emerged over the course of
                    the textbook and as part of this last session of the Rainbow Unit into conversation.

      However the ideas that form from this action plan brainstorming activity get jotted down, be
      sure to find a way to copy and paste them into your Summative Professional Journal Reflec-
      tion as a third component.

Wrap Up

Many technical instructions leave unconsidered the embedded social dimensions of technologies that
are continuously in tension with the limits and constraints to social justice parameters. Unconsidered,
we likely further algorithms of oppression rooted within deductive logic and positivist paradigms in
our personal and professional practices. This is also true of design processes, and is why design jus-
tice rooted within critical paradigms has been emphasized so strongly throughout session four. And as
noted in the session three Wrap Up, if you currently do not have rich diversity within your community
of practice, work to outline clearly how diversity would be brought into the collective leadership to
ensure that this is the "good trouble" to which the late John Lewis refers.

Put aside your Summative Professional Journal Reflection for a few days, but keep it relatively close.
After a short break, pick it up one last time to read it through. Don't make any edits--that's not what
journaling is about. But do feel encouraged to add a final section in which you note some reflections
on your reflections--that's the work of recodifying that which you've worked to decodify. For only
through cycles of action and reflection can the work of community inquiry take on the various situ-
ations limiting people from being fully human through good trouble, necessary trouble, overcoming
these in a strategic way.

         · A Starting List of Common Unix Terminal Commands

Most of the time, our daily work on computers is done through a graphical user interface (GUI) in
which we do some typing of text in combination with the clicking of drop-down menus and option
buttons. Those drop-downs and option buttons hide the wide range of text that is actually executed
through those mostly simpler clicks we make. But sometimes we need greater control than is pro-
vided through those menus and buttons, which have been shaped in part to simplify at the cost of
reducing flexibility. And sometimes we need to just quickly hop into a computer to do something and
then pop right back out. In these cases, and especially when done remotely from another computer,
the terminal interface is a much faster alternative. For this reason, Unix and Unix-based Operating
Systems like MacOS and Linux have always included at their core a Command Line Interface
(CLI) such as a terminal window. While for most of its existence Microsoft pushed people to ignore
their command prompt alternative and to instead strictly work within the graphical user interface,
beginning with Windows 7, Microsoft has included their PowerShell command-line shell and script-
ing language.

Listing and Creating Files and Directories

In Linux and Unix Operating Systems, commands start with the command itself, for instance:

ls

If you type in the ls command, you'll get a list of files, folders, and directories.

                                                                                 417
                                                                                                                  Introducing the Unix Command Line 418

Many commands also have options, switches, or flags. For instance, the ls command has many
options you can use, including the -a to list all files, including those that start with a period to keep
them a little more hidden.
419 Introducing the Unix Command Line

As another example, if we add not just a -a but also a -l to an ls, we can have all files listed in a
long format using option grouping.

While ls is the basic command, and ls -la is the command with options, we can also add in argu-
ments at the end, for instance, to get a listing of files, folders, and directories within a specific direc-
tory. As an example:
ls -la /
                                                                                                                  Introducing the Unix Command Line 420

This command would give us the list of files, folders, and directories within the very top of the tree
structure.

To create an empty or blank file, use the touch command, followed by the name and extension of the
new file:
touch mynewfile.txt
421 Introducing the Unix Command Line

To create a new directory, use the mkdir command, followed by the name of the new directory you
would like to create:

mkdir cstories

Copying Files

To move a file from one place to another, use the mv command. This has the effect of moving rather
than copying the file, so you end up with only one file rather than two. It can also be used to rename
a file by moving the file to the same directory but giving it a different name.

mv file1 file2

This command moves (or renames) file1 to file2.

Remove Files and Directories

To delete (remove) a file, use the rm command. As an example, we are going to create a file and then
delete it. Type the following:

$ touch tempfile.txt
$ ls
$ rm tempfile.txt
$ ls

The ls command is used first to check if it has created the file and second to check if it has deleted
the file.

You can use the rmdir command to remove a directory (make sure it is empty first). Note that Unix
will not let you remove a non-empty directory.

Create a directory called tempstuff using mkdir, then remove it using the rmdir command.

Searching the Contents of a File

Using less, you can search though a text file for a keyword (pattern). For example, to search through
a file called science.txt for the word science, type:

$ less science.txt
                                                                                                                  Introducing the Unix Command Line 422

Then, while still running less (i.e., don't press [q] to quit), type a forward slash [/] followed by the
word to search:

/science

As you can see, less finds and highlights the keyword. Type [n] to search for the next occurrence of
the word.
Another powerful search tool is grep, one of many standard Unix utilities. It searches files for speci-
fied words or patterns. First clear the screen, then type:

$ grep science science.txt

As you can see, grep has printed out each line containing the word science. Or has it? Try typing:

$ grep Science science.txt

The grep command is case sensitive; it distinguishes between Science and science.
To ignore upper/lower case distinctions, use the -i flag:

$ grep -i science science.txt

To search for a phrase or pattern, you must enclose it in single quotes (the apostrophe symbol). For
example, to search for spinning top, type:

$ grep -i 'spinning top' science.txt

Some of the other options of grep are:
         · -v display those lines that do NOT match.
         · -n precede each matching line with the line number.
         · -c print only the total count of matched lines.

Try some of them and see the different results. Don't forget, you can use more than one option at a
time, for example, the command to find the number of lines without the words science or Science is:

$ grep -ivc science science.txt

Redirection

Most processes initiated by Unix commands write to the standard output (that is, they write to the ter-
minal screen). Many take their input from the standard input (that is, they read it from the keyboard).
423 Introducing the Unix Command Line

There is also the standard error, where processes write their error messages, by default, to the terminal
screen. We have already seen one use of the cat command to write the contents of a file to the screen.
Now type cat without specifing a file to read:

$ cat

Then type a few words on the keyboard and press the [Return] key. Finally hold the [Ctrl] key down
and press [d] (written as ^D for short) to end the input. What has happened?

If you run the cat command without specifing a file to read, it reads the standard input (the keyboard),
and on receiving the'end of file' (^D), copies it to the standard output (the screen). In Unix, we can
redirect both the input and the output of commands.

Redirecting the Output

We use the > symbol to redirect the output of a command. For example, to create a file called list1,
containing a list of fruit, type:

$ cat > list1

Then type in the names of some fruit. Press [Return] after each one.

pear
banana
apple
^D (Control D to stop)

What happens is the cat command reads the standard input (the keyboard) and the > redirects the
output, which normally goes to the screen, into a file called list1.

To read the contents of the file, type:

$ cat list1

Using the above method, create another file called list2.

Add the following fruit to the file: orange, plum, mango, grapefruit.

The form >> appends additional output to a file. So to add more items to the file list1, type:

$ cat >> list1

Then type in the names of more fruit:
                                             Introducing the Unix Command Line 424

peach
grape
orange
^D (Control D to stop)

To read the contents of the file, type:

$ cat list1

You should now have two files. One contains six fruit, the other contains four fruit. We will now use
the cat command to join (concatenate) list1 and list2 into a new file called biglist. Type:

$ cat list1 list2 > biglist

What this is doing is reading the contents of list1 and list2 in turn, then outputting the text to the file
biglist.

To read the contents of the new file, type:

$ cat biglist

Redirecting the Input

We use the < symbol to redirect the input of a command. The command sort alphabetically or numer-
ically sorts a list. Type:

$ sort

Then type in the names of some vegetables. Press [Return] after each one.

carrot
beetroot
artichoke
^D (control d to stop)

The output will be:
artichoke
beetroot
carrot

Using < you can redirect the input to come from a file rather than the keyboard. For example, to sort
the list of fruit, type:
425 Introducing the Unix Command Line

$ sort < biglist

And the sorted list will be output to the screen.
To output the sorted list to a file, type:

$ sort < biglist > slist

Use cat to read the contents of the new sorted file.

Pipes

To see who is on the system with you, type:

$ who

One method to get a sorted list of names is to type:

$ who > names.txt
$ sort < names.txt

This is a bit slow and you have to remember to remove the temporary intermediary file called names
when you have finished. What you really want to do is connect the output of the who command
directly to the input of the sort command. This is exactly what pipes do. The symbol for a pipe is the
vertical bar |.
For example, type in:

$ who | sort

This will give the same result as above, but quicker and cleaner. To find out how many users are logged
on, type:

$ who | wc -l

Wildcards

The character * is called a wildcard, and will match against none or more character(s) in a file (or direc-
tory) name. For example, in your current directory, type:

$ ls list*
                                                                                                                  Introducing the Unix Command Line 426

This will list all files in the current directory starting with list. Try typing:

$ ls *list

This will list all files in the current directory ending with list.

The character ? will match exactly one character. So the command ls ?ouse will match files like
`house' and `mouse'. But it will not match `grouse'.

Try typing:

$ ls ?list

Filename Conventions

A directory is merely a special type of file. So the rules and conventions for naming files apply also to
directories. In naming files, characters with special meanings such as these should be avoided:

/ * & %

Also, avoid using spaces within names. The safest way to name a file is to use only alphanumeric char-
acters, that is, letters and numbers, together with _ (underscore) and . (dot).

File names conventionally start with a lower-case letter and may end with a dot followed by the exten-
sion, a group of letters indicating the contents of the file. For example, all files consisting of C code
may be named with the ending .c, for example, program1.c. Then, in order to list all files containing C
code in your home directory, you need only type ls *.c in that directory.

Beware: some applications give the same name to all the output files they generate. For example, some
compilers, unless given the appropriate option, produce compiled files named a.out. Should you forget
to use that option, you are advised to rename the compiled file immediately, otherwise the next such
file will overwrite it and the original file will be lost.

Getting Help

There are online manuals which give information about most commands. The manual pages tell you
which options a particular command can take, and how each option modifies the behavior of the com-
mand. Type the man command to read the manual page for a particular command.

For example, to find out more about the wc (word count) command, type:

$ man wc
427 Introducing the Unix Command Line

Alternatively, the following command gives a one-line description of the command, but omits any
information about options.

$ whatis wc

When you are not sure of the exact name of a command, the apropos command will give you the com-
mands with keyword in their manual page header.

$ apropos keyword

For example, try typing:

$ apropos copy

File System Security

In your current directory, type:

$ ls -l

The letter L stands for long listing. You will see that you now get lots of details about the contents of
your directory, similar to the example below.

Also, the command ls -lg gives additional information as to which group owns the file (beng95 in
this example):

-rwxrw-r-- 1 ee51ab beng95 2450 Sept29 11:52 file1

Each file (and directory) has associated access rights. In the left-hand column is a 10 symbol string
consisting of the symbols d, r, w, x, -, and occasionally s or S.

The first character in the line of output specifies the type: A d indicates a directory. Otherwise, the
character will be a dash (-). The 9 remaining symbols indicate the permissions, or access rights, and
are taken as three groups of 3.

         · The first character, -, notes that this is a file.
         · Next, the first group of three characters gives the file permissions for the user that owns the

            file (or directory). In the above example, rwx are the permissions for the user ee51ab.
         · The middle group of three characters gives the permissions for the group of users to whom

            the file (or directory) belongs. In the above example, rw- are the permissions for the group
            eebeng95.
         · The rightmost group of three characters gives the permissions for all others. In the above
                                                                                                                  Introducing the Unix Command Line 428

            example, r-- are the permissions for any user who does not own the file or is not in the
            group to whom the file belongs.

The symbols r, w, and - have slightly different meanings depending on whether they refer to a simple
file or to a directory.

Access rights on files are:
         · r (or -), indicates read permission (or otherwise), that is, the presence or absence of permis-
            sion to read and copy the file.
         · w (or -), indicates write permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission (or otherwise) to
            change a file.
         · x (or -), indicates execution permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission to execute a
            file, where appropriate.

Access rights on directories are:
         · r allows users to list files in the directory.
         · w means that users may delete files from the directory or move files into it.
         · x means the right to access files in the directory. This implies that you may read files in the
            directory provided you have read permission on the individual files. So, in order to read a
            file, you must have execute permission on the directory containing that file, and hence on
            any directory containing that directory as a subdirectory, and so on, up the tree.

Some examples:

A file that everyone can read, write, and execute (and delete):

-rwxrwxrwx

A file that only the owner can read and write. No one else can read or write and no one has execution
rights (e.g., your mailbox file):

-rw-------

Changing access rights

To "change a file mode," meaning to change the access rights of a file, use chmod.

Only the owner of a file can use chmod to change the permissions of a file. The options of chmod are
as follows:
429 Introducing the Unix Command Line

Symbol  Meaning
u       User
g       Group
o       Other
a       All
r       Read
w       Write (and delete)
x       Execute (and access directory)
+       Add permission
-       Take away permission

For example, to remove read, write, and execute permissions on the file biglist for the group and others,
type:

$ chmod go-rwx biglist

This will leave the other permissions unaffected. To give read and write permissions on the file biglist
to all, run:

$ chmod a+rw biglist

Processes and Jobs

A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). To see information
about your processes, with their associated PID and status, type:

$ ps

A process may be in the foreground, in the background, or be suspended. In general, the shell does
not return the Unix prompt until the current process has finished executing. Some processes take a
long time to run and hold up the terminal. Backgrounding a long process has the effect that the Unix
prompt is returned immediately, and other tasks can be carried out while the original process contin-
ues executing.

For example, the command sleep waits a given number of seconds before continuing. To wait 10
seconds, type:

$ sleep 10
                                                                                                                  Introducing the Unix Command Line 430

After 10 seconds, it will return to the command prompt. Until the command prompt is returned, you
can do nothing except wait. To background a process, type an ampersand (&) at the end of the com-
mand line. To run sleep in the background, type:

$ sleep 10 &

The & runs the job in the background and returns the prompt straight away, allowing you to run other
programs while waiting for that one to finish. The first line in the above example is typed in by the
user; the next line, indicating job number and PID, is returned by the machine. The user is notified
of a job number (numbered from 1) enclosed in square brackets, together with a PID, and is notified
when a background process is finished. Backgrounding is useful for jobs which will take a long time
to complete.

To background a current foreground process, type at the prompt:

$ sleep 100

You can suspend the process running in the foreground by holding down the [control] key and typing
[z] (written as ^Z ) Then to put it in the background, type:

$ bg

Note: do not background programs that require user interaction; e.g., pine.

Listing suspended and background processes

When a process is running, backgrounded or suspended, it will be entered onto a list along with a job
number. To examine this list, type:

$ jobs

An example of a job list could be:
         · [1] Suspended sleep 100
         · [2] Running netscape
         · [3] Running nedit

To restart (foreground) a suspended process, type:

$ fg %jobnumber

For example, to restart sleep 100, type:
431 Introducing the Unix Command Line

$ fg %1
Typing fg with no job number foregrounds the last suspended process.

Killing a process

It is sometimes necessary to kill (terminate or signal) a process, for example, when an executing pro-
gram is in an infinite loop. To kill a job running in the foreground, type ^C (control c). For example,
run:

$ sleep 100
^C

To kill a suspended or background process, type:

$ kill %jobnumber

For example, run the following, and suppose that by running jobs, you find that sleep is job number 4:

$ sleep 100 &
$ jobs
$ kill %4

To check whether this has worked, examine the job list again to see if the process has been removed.
Alternatively, processes can be killed by finding their process numbers (PIDs) and using kill PID_num-
ber. The command ps stands for process status.

$ sleep 100 &      COMMAND
$ ps               0:05 sleep 100
PID TT S TIME      0:00 netscape
20077 pts/5 S      0:25 nedit
21563 pts/5 T
21873 pts/5 S

To kill off the process sleep 100, type the following command. Then type ps again to see if it has been
removed from the list.

$ kill 20077

If a process refuses to be killed, uses the -9 option:
                                                              Introducing the Unix Command Line 432

$ kill -9 20077
Note: It is not possible to kill off other users' processes.

A Starting List of Common Terminal Commands

|
         · The pipe key | on the keyboard is used to take the output of one command and send it to
            another command. For instance, to view through the history of commands run, screen by
            screen, you would combine the history command and the less command as follows:

            history | less

apt-get     The Advanced Package Tool has been developed by the Debian GNU/Linux branch of
         ·  Linux, and is incorporated into all child Linux operating systems, like Ubuntu and Rasp-
            berry Pi OS, that use the Debian core.

                      Synchronize the list of packages available by typing:

            sudo apt-get update

             Upgrade all the software packages currently installed by typing:

            sudo apt-get upgrade

             Install new applications, for instance the Apache web server, version two, by
               adding the following to apt-get:

            sudo apt-get install apache2

cat
         · The cat command, short for concatenate, lists the content of a text file. In the case of very
            long file contents, the less command works better.

            cat science.txt

cd
         · The cd, or change directory, command helps us to move around the file hierarchy tree
            structure of Linux.
433 Introducing the Unix Command Line

/                  the root of the tree, containing all other main directories

   /bin            the essential binary executable files of the system

   /boot           the startup files for Linux

   /dev            the entry point for peripherals

   /etc            the commands and files necessary for system administration

          /etc/vnc as one example, the subdirectory for commands and files necessary to administer the
                       VNC server

   /home           personal user directories

          /home/pi as one example, the subdirectory for the base user "pi"

   /lib            shared libraries essential for the system during startup

   /mnt            mount points for temporary partitions like a USB hard drive

   /opt packages for some supplementary applications like minecraft-pi, pigpio, sonic-pi, and
                          Wolfram

   /root           directory of the root administrator

   /sbin           essential high-level binary executable files

   /tmp            temporary files

   /usr            secondary hierarchy

          /usr/bin majority of binary executable files and user commands

          /usr/    header files for the C and C++ programming language
          include

          /usr/lib shared libraries for the system

          /usr/ data pertaining to the programs installed on the local machine by the root user
          local

          /usr/sbin the binary executable files that are not essential for the system but that are reserved for
                       the system administrator

          /usr/    reserved for non-dependent data of the architecture
          share

          /usr/src code source files

   /var            variable data

clear
         · The clear command is helpful when your terminal has become cluttered with lots of output
            from commands and you want to start with a clean slate. This will clear all text and leave
            you with the $ prompt at the top of the window.

df -h
         · Use this to find out the size of your available disk spaces, how much is currently being
                                                                                                        Introducing the Unix Command Line 434

      used, and how much is available. Many are tmp, or temporary spaces, while others are for-
      mally defined /dev devices.

dig
         · Dig, the Domain Information Groper, is a tool used to search through Domain Name Sys-
            tem (DNS) servers for various DNS records. As such, it can be very useful for troubleshoot-
            ing public IP name and IP address problems. (NOTE: IP addresses in the ranges 10.0.0.0 to
            10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 are all private.
            That is, they do not need to be registered to be used on local networks, and therefore do not
            appear in the DNS system of servers.)

      · To find the public IP address for the IP name google.com:

      dig google.com

      · To find the public IP address for the IP name ischool.illinois.edu:

      dig ischool.illinois.edu

      · To find the IP name for the public IP address 216.58.192.174:

      dig -x 216.58.192.174

      · To find the IP name for the public IP address 192.17.172.3:

      dig -x 192.17.172.3

find
         · The find command is used to find files using their filename.

grep

      · The grep, or global regular expression print, command is a powerful tool to search for a
         given string in a file, or in a range of files within a directory, or even a directory and subdi-
         rectories. For fun, try running this command in the pi home directory:

      grep -r "the" *

head
         · The head command writes the first ten lines of a file to the screen. First clear the screen
            then type:

      head science.txt
435 Introducing the Unix Command Line

history     The history command will list the history of commands you've written, at least back a cer-
         ·  tain amount of time or a certain number of commands run. A sweet little trick is to use the !
            character followed by the number of a command to repeat that command, for instance, the
            137th command you ran:

!137

hostname -I
         · Shows the IP address(es) of your Raspberry Pi

ifconfig
         · Used to check the status of wired Ethernet (eth0) and wireless Ethernet (wlan0) Internet
            connections.
                      inet = the assigned Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address, if any

                      inet6 = the assigned Internet Protocol version 6 (IPV6) address, if any

                      ether = the MAC address, roughly equivalent to a serial number for that specific
                        network adapter

iwconfig
         · Indicates which WiFi network the wireless adapter is using at the moment.

iwlist      Used to get more detailed wireless information than is provided from iwconfig about a
         ·  wireless adapter interface. The most commonly used argument with iwlist is scan, giving a
            list of Access Points and Ad-Hoc cells in range at the moment.

iwlist wlan0 scan

· To narrow down the information provided, it can be useful to combine this with a grep
   command to search just for the ESSID, or Extended Service Set Identification identifying a
   specific 802.11 wireless network:

iwlist wlan0 scan | grep ESSID

kill
         · Terminate the process based on its Process ID (PID) number. By default, the kill command
            sends a request to the PID specified, officially known as a SIGTERM, asking for it to shut
            itself down:

kill 12345
                                                                                                           Introducing the Unix Command Line 436

     · To forcefully quit a PID specified, officially known as a SIGKILL, you need to add in an
        additional kill statement.

     kill -s KILL 12345

     · You can choose to kill several PIDs all at once, also.

     kill 12345 12346 543 139

     · To kill all PIDs with the same name, for instance, all PIDs running apache2 sessions, you
        run the killall command instead.

     killall apache2

less
         · The less command is considered to be a more powerful version of the older more command.
            That's right, the creators thought less is more! Instead of using the cat command to list a
            file, you can use the less command. It opens the file for viewing. From there, you can use
            the space bar to jump ahead one screen, the b character to scroll back one screen, the down
            and up arrows to go down and up one line, and many other tags to do a range of other
            movements. Hit [Q] to quit out of the file. Less is also used instead of cat for reading long
            files.

ls
         · The ls, or list, command is the most common way to get a list of files. This is often com-
            bined with the options -la and then an argument to search a specific directory.

lsusb
         · Lists the USB hardware currently connected to your Raspberry Pi.

man

     · The man, or manual, command is used to show the basic operating manual for an available
        command, including why to use it, the options available in its use, defaults, some examples,
        and the authors of the command.

mkdir       The mkdir, or make directory, command allows you to create a new directory. As an exam-
         ·  ple, let's use the cd command to make sure we're in our home directory (the easiest way to
            do that is to use the ~ argument), then use the mkdir command to make a Python subdi-
            rectory.
437 Introducing the Unix Command Line

       cd ~
       mkdir Python

mv
         · the mv, or move, command allows users to move a file to another directory, with the first
            argument indicating which file is to be moved, and the second where it is to be moved. For
            instance, if you create a new Python command in the pi home directory and later want to
            move it to a directory called Python in the pi home directory:

      mv /home/pi/somepythoncode.py /home/pi/Python

nano
         · A commonly used default text editor. For instance, to edit a file you found using ls that is
            called example.txt, type:

      nano example.txt

ping

      · A core command for testing the connection between two devices on a network, whether
         local or over a wider network (e.g., campus network, Internet). This can be done using an
         Internet Protocol address, or an IP address number. For instance, both of the following
         check the connection between your device and the same other device:

      ping illinois.edu
      ping 192.17.172.3

ps
         · The ps (processes status) command is one of the earliest native Unix/Linux utilities for
            viewing information about running processes, the operations on computer data within pro-
            grams being currently run.

         · Print all processes currently running by all users, listed by user, extended to include TTY
            commands and also internal commands:

      ps aux

      · Print all processes currently running in wide, or double wide format:

      ps auxw
      ps auxww
                                                                                                                  Introducing the Unix Command Line 438

raspi-config
         · The core configuration command for the Raspberry Pi OS as run from the terminal inter-
            face. This can also be run from the graphical user interface.

reboot
         · Use this command to do an immediate reboot of your computer.

rm
         · The rm, or remove, command only removes files. However, the -r option will recursively
            remove a directory, any subdirectories, and any files within those directories. To go even
            further, you can add in the -f option to forcefully remove items. Use this command with
            great care:

       rm -rf somedirectory

         · And do not, under any circumstances, ever do this command, as you'll put an end
            to the operating system and all files within:

       rm -rf /

rmdir
         · The rmdir, or remove directory, allows you to remove a directory and files held within that
            directory.

scp
         · Short for "secure copy." Uses the secure shell, or SSH, to copy files to and from a remote
            device. For instance, to copy the example.py Python file from your laptop to the user pi's
            home directory on the Raspberry Pi, type in the following (example uses an IP address in
            the IllinoisNet_Guest local area network domain):

       scp example.py pi@172.16.108.44:/home/pi

         · To copy the file anotherexample.py Python file from the user pi's home directory on the
            Raspberry Pi to your laptop, type in:

       scp pi@172.16.108.44:/home/pi/anotherexample.py

screen
         · The screen command detaches a terminal window, creating a separate window within
            which you can access and control the Raspberry Pi.
439 Introducing the Unix Command Line

shutdown
         · Use this command to shut down your Raspberry Pi computer.
                      Shutdown immediately by typing "sudo shutdown -h now"
                      Schedule a shutdown time, for instance 11:30 PM, by typing "sudo shutdown -h
                        23:30"

ssh
         · The secure shell, or SSH, provides remote login access to another computer. On MacOS lap-
            tops, to access your Raspberry Pi open the terminal and type the following (example uses
            an IP address in the IllinoisNet_Guest local area network domain). Before proceeding, you'll
            need to have written down the WiFi IP address of your Raspberry Pi, or determined it via
            the console using the USB to TTL cable.

         · On Windows, you can use PowerShell to SSH. You can also use PuTTY, the free and open
            source software which supports several network protocols for connecting two devices.
            Download PuTTY.

startx
         · When a Raspberry Pi or other Linux computer boots straight to a console window, you can
            prompt it to further boot to reach the GUI by typing:

sudo startx

sudo
         · Placing sudo in front of any of the above commands asserts increased authority if the user
            logged in has been granted such in the /etc/sudoers configuration file. Working in
            your home directory generally isn't a problem. But often you'll find running higher order
            control commands and editing of files in system-wide directories will require the running
            commands like ls, rm, mkdir and others with a leading sudo in front of it to exercise

  While the world originated analog, with physical data such as audio and visual signals that change
  continuously, we now also make regular use of digital signal processing to turn the continuous analog
  signals into number samples, often transmitted using binary 0/1 sets. A leading mechanism for shar-
  ing binary digital data streams of all kinds is the Internet Protocol. In this set of exercises, you'll get a
  chance to connect your Raspberry Pi to a Local Area Network (LAN) and test out performance of the
  Raspberry Pi on the Internet.

We live today in a wireless society. In some cases, even our phones no longer provide a plug-in for
our wired headsets, moving us to instead primarily use Bluetooth headsets. When our mobile phones
are located someplace in a building with limited cell service, we can make use of the building's Wi-Fi
connection to get us to that cell service. Our laptops and even many desktops today depend on Wi-Fi
Internet access. After all, it's much simpler and cleaner-looking than yet another wire.

When mobility, flexibility, and simplicity are important, wireless Ethernet connectivity is a solid
choice.

But here are some key reasons why wired Ethernet remains the better choice for networking more
often than you might think.

         · Performance: Wired Ethernet makes use of Cat5 or Cat6 cables that provide synchronous
            upload and download of data at either 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps. The 802.11a/b/g speeds are
            improving and can now provide creative forms of synchronous transfers of data at upwards
            of 54 Mbps. Wired Ethernet provides synchronous communication from a single computer
            to a switch. Meanwhile, the wireless radio waves are shared by all connected devices simul-
            taneously, thereby changing performance without notice.

         · Reliability: Cat5/6 cables are designed to limit interference, and are often installed within
            walls or ceilings to further improve reliability. While WiFi has improved over the years, it
            remains susceptible to interference from a range of fixed and dynamic factors.

         · Security: While the wireless 802.11 protocol and interconnected devices used to provide
            network access to Wi-Fi devices have improved significantly, it remains that a wired Ether-
            net connection is less susceptible to security attacks than wireless Ethernet.

When doing some home improvements many years ago, I used the opportunity to run wired Ethernet
to a few locations in each major room of the house. This helps improve performance of all devices, as
the high-demand Roku, solar panel interface, and office computer all make use of the wired Ethernet
Cat5b cables. And especially at times when many devices are making active use of the network, the
1-Gbps wired Ethernet connection has proved essential when I am teaching or collaborating online
from my home office.

When consulted on new construction and Ethernet, I strongly recommend installation of as much
wired Ethernet as possible, especially in libraries, schools, and community centers where there will be
more statically located networked devices. This both improves performance, reliability, and security
for these static devices and reduces demand for the many wireless devices within the space.

What about the Raspberry Pi? While it is capable of both wired and wireless networking, the choice
may vary by project.

For basic educational and prototyping activities, especially when close access or mobility is important
to work with breadboarding and electronic testing in a range of locations, Wi-Fi continues to be the
443 Raspberry Pi Networking 1010

preferred means of connecting to the LAN. However, when prototyping moves to the next level and
is used for ongoing data collection and distribution--for instance, as a soil and weather sensor data-
base system accessible via web server--I move the Raspberry Pi to a waterproof case and connect it to
the LAN via an outdoor Cat5 cable. When the Raspberry Pi is used as a multimedia server or a loca-
tion-based collective networking toolkit, I've found it ideal to locate the Raspberry Pi right next to the
gateway router, connected via a short Cat5 cable.

When the Raspberry Pi is running headless (without a keyboard, mouse, and monitor), Secure Shell
(SSH) is a quick and easy way to connect to and control the microcomputer. The Pi's microSD card
must be edited to enable SSH access within the Raspberry Pi Operating System, but after this, I can
connect the Raspberry Pi to a router with a wired Ethernet cable. This will automatically provide it
with an IP address that I can use to SSH into the Pi on its very first boot.

Exercise: Connect a Raspberry Pi to a Wired Ethernet Port

        1. Connect one end of an Ethernet cable to the wired Ethernet port on your Raspberry Pi.
        2. Connect the other end of the Ethernet cable to an available LAN Ethernet port. Some places

            where these may be found include:
                      An Ethernet port on the wall.
                      One of the four LAN ports commonly found on home and small office gateway
                        routers used to connect to the Internet service provider.
                      An Ethernet switch that itself connects to a wall connection or to the gateway
                        router for the LAN.

        3. Most home and small office gateway routers provide a quick guide with login and password
            information to help you connect to their web servers to determine the assigned IP address
            for connected devices.

  the IP address 10.0.0.28.

 Exercise: Connect to a Wi-Fi Network from the Raspberry Pi Desktop

  A GUI is provided for setting up wireless connections with the Raspberry Pi OS. If you are not using
  the Raspberry Pi Desktop, you can set up wireless networking from the command line in the next
  exercise.2
  Wireless connections can be made via the network icon at the right-hand side of the menu bar. If you
  are using a Pi with built-in wireless connectivity, or if a wireless dongle is plugged in, left-clicking this
  icon will bring up a list of available wireless networks, as shown below. If no networks are found, it
  will show the message "No APs found--scanning..." Wait a few seconds without closing the menu, and
  it should find your network.
  Note that on the Pi 3B+, which supports the 5G protocol, wireless networking is disabled for regula-
  tory reasons, until the country code has been set. To set the country code, open the Raspberry Pi Con-
  figuration application from the Preferences Menu, select Localisation, and set the appropriate code.

  The icons on the right show whether a network is secured or not, and give an indication of its signal
  strength. Click the network that you want to connect to. If it is secured, a dialogue box will prompt
  you to enter the network key.

  Enter the key and click OK, and then wait a couple of seconds. The network icon will flash briefly to
  show that a connection is being made. When it is ready, the icon will stop flashing and show the signal
  strength.

 Exercise: Connect to a Wi-Fi Network via the Command Line

  This method is suitable if you don't have access to the graphical user interface normally used to set
  up Wi-Fi on the Raspberry Pi. It is particularly suitable for use with a serial console cable if you don't
  have access to a screen or wired Ethernet.3

 Step 1: Get Wi-Fi network details

          1. Connect your laptop to your Raspberry Pi via serial console and begin a remote terminal
              session to scan for Wi-Fi networks.
                      1. Using a TTL to USB cable, connect the black TTL wire to a GPIO Ground pin, the
                          white TTL wire to GPIO 14 (TXD or transmit), and the green TTL wire to GPIO
                          15 (RXD or receive).
                      2. Attach the USB side of the cable to your laptop.
                      3. Adafruit provides a lesson on how to run software in the Mac, Windows, and
                          Linux operating systems to connect your computer to the Raspberry Pi from here.

          2. To scan for wireless networks, use the command:

           · sudo iwlist wlan0 scan

          3. This will list all available wireless networks, along with other useful information. Look out
              for:
                        "ESSID:"testing"" is the name of the Wi-Fi network "testing."
                        "IE: IEEE 802.11i/WPA2 Version 1" is the authentication used. In this case, it's

                        WPA2, the newer and more secure wireless standard which replaces WPA. This
                        guide should work for WPA or WPA2, but may not work for WPA2 enterprise.

                        ple on the webpage.

        4. You'll also need the password for the wireless network. For most home routers, this is
            found on a sticker on the back of the router.

Step 2: Connect to a network through raspi-config

        1. Once you know the network name (SSID) and password, the quickest way to enable wire-
            less networking is to use the command line raspi-config tool.

        2. From the Raspberry Pi terminal window, enter:

         · sudo raspi-config

        3. Select the Network Options item from the menu, and then the Wi-Fi option.
        4. On a fresh install, for regulatory purposes, you will need to specify the country in which

            the device is being used.
        5. Then set the SSID of the network, and the passphrase for the network.

Exercise: Unusual Additional Registration Requirements

Businesses, schools, libraries, and other organizations use various measures to restrict access to their
network to enhance security. This often means that a password is required to access a network,
whether wired or wireless; two-factor authentication may also be required. Sometimes, only registered
devices can access a network. And sometimes, the level of registration determines what can be done
over the network.

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, two primary wireless Ethernet networks are avail-
able for general use: IllinoisNet and IllinoisNet_Guest. For the most part, IllinoisNet_Guest is used for
easy first access to the core technical services. Visitors can use this to create a 24-hour login, while
regular users can use this to gain up to 12-month access for certain devices, such as gaming consoles,
streaming devices, and your Raspberry Pi. As one example, the following steps will help those who are
part of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign system to register their Wi-Fi nodes, such as a
Raspberry Pi, to the IllinoisNet_Guest network.

MAC Address Overview

Before we start, let us take a step back and look at how devices are differentiated. In the Orange Unit,
we learned how different integrated circuits perform different tasks in a device. For a device to connect
to a network, it requires an integrated circuit called a Network Interface Card (NIC). There is a NIC
for each type of network connection: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The Raspberry Pi 3 includes all
three NICs.
To differentiate between different NICs and different devices, each NIC is assigned a Machine Access
Control (MAC) Address. The MAC address is comprised of 6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits. Hex-
idecimals contain the numbers between 0-9, but also include the uppercase letters A-F, to give 16 pos-
sible digits. Some information about your device is contained in the MAC address, such as the vendor
or manufacturer of your device.

Register Device

The following steps will walk you through registering your device.
First, you will need to find the MAC address of your Raspberry Pi's Wi-Fi network card. To do so, open
a terminal window in your Raspberry Pi and type the following command:

$ ifconfig wlan0

This will output the data related to your wireless network interface. The first line should contain:
Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
Instead of Xs, your MAC address for your Wi-Fi NIC will be printed.
Either write this down or leave the window open, as you will need this information to register.
Next, using your laptop, navigate to http://go.illinois.edu/illinoisnetdevices and log in using your
NetID and password. Click the "Manage Devices" button.
                                                                                                                          Raspberry Pi Networking 1010 450

Click the "Create" button to create a device account.

Insert the following information for each required field:
        1. MAC Address: Copy or type the MAC address found in the steps above.
        2. Device Name: IS401-RaspberryPi
        3. AirGroup: Leave the box unchecked.

                                           Network Troubleshooting

Initial and ongoing evaluation and documentation are two strategies at the core of effective trou-
bleshooting. These can be applied to both your Local Area Network (LAN) and the interconnection of
your LAN with the Internet through your Internet Service Provider (ISP) interconnect device(s). Here
are some key techniques I use, which help me to rapidly move up the tiers of support when a problem
is encountered.

Essential Network Troubleshooting Tools

In some cases, we connect computers and other electronic devices using serial communications proto-
cols such as Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit (UART) and Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C). But
today it is very common to instead or also use the Internet Protocol (IP), whether just within a Local
Area Network (LAN), as part of a Community Network, or as part of the Internet. Below are some of
the key investigative tools we can use to assess these IP network connections.

     Link Lights

               · LED light found on wired Ethernet cards and switches.
               · When lit, indicates that the card and switch are on and working properly and the

                  Ethernet cable is plugged in and working properly.

     Network Manager

               · Operating system utility that shows network configuration.
               · An IP address of 0.0.0.0 or one that starts with 169.254 indicates you are connected

                  to the media but aren't getting a proper IP address from the address server (usually
                  the gateway router).

     Ping

               · Run from the command line or terminal application to test if you can communicate
                  with another node.

               · ping IP_ADDR or ping IP_NAME (e.g. ping google.com)
               · Times of 1 ms or less are good on a local network; 10-50 ms or less are good on the

                  Internet.

                                                                                 452
453 Network Troubleshooting

               · Hint: ping different nodes to track down faulty component.

     Traceroute

               · Run from the command line or terminal application to test the performance of
                  each router between nodes.

               · Windows: tracert IP_NAME
               · Linux: traceroute IP_NAME
               · macOS: traceroute IP_NAME
               · Smartphone apps available

      Note:
               · Asterisks (*) indicate failure or firewall
               · Hop 1 is usually your router; hop 2 is your ISP

Previously, we saw how the "data beanbag" could be passed between just two nodes, your laptop and
the Raspberry Pi. But even there, the server and client VNC (Virtual Network Computing) software
are standing in the circle along with the hardware (computers). The Ethernet cable served to carry the
data beanbag between these players.

For most of our work on computers, smartphones, and other networked devices, the beanbag needs
to pass between many more interconnect devices to get between the starting and ending node. And
when gathering information from something like a web server, the server itself may first act as a client,
dynamically collecting data from a range of other servers, again using interconnect devices, before
packaging this into a web page that it passes back to you.
                                                                                                                                Network Troubleshooting 454

Let's use some essential network troubleshooting tools to follow the data beanbag as it's passed around
the circle. Along the way, let's do a little bit of testing to make sure our networking is performing as
expected, and if not, where it might be failing. This is a great opportunity to work collaboratively.

Exercise: Identify Link Lights

The most general of tests is to see if a wired Ethernet media is making a connection between a node
and a network switch - or in the case of our Raspberry Pi/laptop connection, two nodes. Look for a
couple of little LEDs on the Raspberry Pi where it connects to the Ethernet cable. When the cable is
fully plugged in and the Raspberry Pi is turned on, you should see one or both come on (red indicates
it's connected, green indicates it's transferring data).

Look at your laptop. Can you see one or two little LEDs where the Ethernet cable is connected? Some
laptops with Ethernet ports, particularly those from Apple, no longer include the link lights, figuring
if you want to know, you can open up software to find the answer. And some laptop producers change
around the color of the LEDs, or use them for different purposes. Lastly, some laptops no longer pro-
vide Ethernet ports.

But regardless, even seeing these LED link lights on one of the nodes generally indicates you are fully
and properly connected at both sides of the Ethernet cable. If you see active link lights, you're good
to go. If you don't see a link light active, or even if you do, unplug the Ethernet cable and look again.
Has anything changed? What about if you plug it back in? If you use a dongle to connect the Ethernet
cable to your laptop, what happens if you leave the Ethernet cable plugged into the dongle but unplug
the dongle from your laptop? Take a few minutes to compare notes with others who are doing the
same but with other types of laptops.

Exercise: Explore Your Network Configuration

All computers have some form of network management software that you should be able to access
to see the network configuration. This varies considerably between computer operating systems, and
even between versions of the same operating system. And sometimes you need administrative access
to actually have significant access. All the same, try to track down how you might do this on your
computer. Pair up with someone using the same type of computer as yours and see if you can track it
down. Take some notes.

Another way to do this is from the command line or terminal window. On the Raspberry Pi or on a
Mac you would type in:
455 Network Troubleshooting

$ ifconfig
In response, you should see something like the following:

In the above ifconfig, you can see the Raspberry Pi has been assigned an eth0 (wired Ethernet) IP
address of 192.168.45.1 and a wlan0 (wireless Ethernet) IP address of 172.16.107.205.
On a Microsoft Windows command line or PowerShell terminal you would type in:
> ipconfig
In response, you should see something like the following:
                                                                                                                                Network Troubleshooting 456

In the above ipconfig, you can see the Microsoft Windows 10 laptop has been assigned a wired Ether-
net IP address of 10.0.0.33 and a wireless Ethernet IP address of 192.168.137.1.
In the Raspberry Pi terminal window, you can also type in:
$ hostname -I
The output from that command should look something like the following:

In the above example, we see the Raspberry Pi has the IP addresses we found using the ifconfig:
192.168.45.1 and 172.16.107.205. But in this case we cannot identify which are wired Ethernet and
which are wireless Ethernet. We also cannot define using hostname the new listed IP address of
169.254.206.69 (this is actually part of the private IP address range used for Automatic Private IP
Addressing, or APIPA, a failsafe used by some devices when no other IP address is assigned to a
device).
457 Network Troubleshooting

Whether you run ifconfig on a Mac, or ipconfig
on Windows, compare the outputs with those
you see on your Raspberry Pi to develop a first
picture of your LAN. Indeed, you can find a
range of apps for your smartphone to run simi-
lar commands to identify the IP addresses these are also assigned by the LAN's router or other
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Server (DHCPS).

There are a couple of other helpful Linux commands to further track down information about your
LAN, including the Local Area Network IP Address assigned to the router which then connects you to
the your Internet Service Provider (ISP), including "netstat" and "ip route":

$ netstat -nr
$ ip route | grep default

Exercise: Test the Network Node-to-Node Path

When your request for a web page is sent to a web server, and when the web server sends back that
web page, the information is broken into a bunch of much smaller "data beanbags" called packets.
While packets often take the same route along the circle between starting and ending nodes, each
packet actually might change its course around the circle, depending on how the different intercon-
nect devices it must pass through are performing at a given moment.

Let's imagine I'm on an extended vacation, traveling by bicycle, and that I'm doing this without a
physical or software-based map of any kind. I just know the name of my starting point and ending
point, and I have a general sense of direction to get there.

To start, I might go to the local bike store/club and ask for suggestions. They may give me a perfect
set of roads to get me from here to some intermediary destination that they've biked before. Great!
Off I go. On arriving at that intermediary location, I'll find the local bike store/club and get a new set
of directions. They may mention that the usual route is preferred, but that there's some construction
and so it's more of a rough ride. As a result, they recommend an alternate route. Great! Off I go again.
As I near my destination town, I need to find one more stop-off site to get directions to reach my goal
destination: Beer, Bed and Breakfast. With directions in hand, I complete the ride.

This is the way of internets. While some interconnect devices, for instance your home gateway router,
have only one way in and one way out if you are to leave one network and join another, the larger
routers that make up an Intranet or Internet can provide multiple different routes in case of decreased
or failed performance of one route at the given moment.

There are three widely used pieces of software to do network testing. Two, ping and speed test, give
you a general overview of the connection between two nodes. But the third, traceroute, will show you
each of the router hops between two nodes.

Ping

Ping started as a text-based software installed by default on all major computers. There are now some
graphical ping apps available, including ones for smartphones. First, if you've identified your gateway
router, such as the gateway of 10.0.0.1, let's use ping to test that connection. On your laptop, open a
terminal (Mac) or cmd (Windows) window and type:

$ ping 172.16.96.1

The command ping sends a ping to a destination node. If all is good, the destination node returns back
a ping. Well-functioning LANs should have times listed of less than 1 ms, and should show 0% loss.
459 Network Troubleshooting

On the Mac and Raspberry Pi computers, the default is to continue sending, and hopefully receiving,
test pings until you hit CTRL-c. On Windows computers, the default is to run four test pings, and then
to stop automatically.

Let's test ping, this time from the Raspberry Pi. Open up a terminal on the Pi and do a ping to some of
these sites (hit CTRL-c between each, or open up three terminal windows and run the three simulta-
neously):

$ ping illinois.edu
$ ping adafruit.com
$ ping raspberrypi.org

Ping sends the information from the node on which you are running it to a destination node, which
then returns a ping. You will be told where the ping is returned from if all is well. It will also return
a sequence number, and the time in milliseconds (ms) it took to go there and back again. In general,
times under 10 ms occur on LANs and ultrafast WANs. Times above 10 ms but under 100 ms are typi-
cally found on fast WANs. Times over 100 ms reflect slower WANs, or networks of all types not work-
ing at expected speeds.

Sometimes the failure to get successful pings does not represent a failure in the network, but rather
represents a security firewall that does not permit ping traffic to pass to and fro along a certain portion
of the network path.

Speedtest

Speedtest is a general descriptor for websites such as the M-Lab Speed Test, Ookla Speedtest, and
Speakeasy Speed Test, each of which are useful tools for testing a network's speed and connectivity.
When troubleshooting problems with your Internet Service Provider, they may ask you to employ
such a tool. As a default, these sites don't let you select a destination node to which you will test the
network path. But by collecting an extended set of speedtests, it becomes possible to see if the upload
and download speeds change at certain times or under certain conditions.

Speedtests generally provide the following key data points:
         · Ping, which is identical to what we get from the command line ping application;
         · Download, the speed in Mbps that describes the rate of data, measured as millions of bits (0
            or 1) passed per second, traveling from a remote destination to your own location.
         · Upload, the speed in Mbps of data traveling from you to the remote site.

The United States Federal Communications Committee (FCC) has a Lifeline program in which low-
income households are assured ways to get low-cost Internet to the home. In 2020, the minimum
download/upload speed has been set to either 25/3 or 100/10. But often promised IP speeds are much
                                                                                                                                Network Troubleshooting 460

higher than the actual speeds at which networks are currently performing. Speedtests provide a very
helpful measurement tool in which to collect baseline and current data when filing reports on real
Internet access.

Traceroute

Traceroute is another text-based software installed by default on all major computers. Depending on
operating system, the program will use one of several underlying network protocols. As a result, some
succeed more than others at going through the full set of hops, as sometimes security firewalls are set
up to stop one type of network protocol or another at some hop along the way. But while results vary
a little, overall traceroute is an essential troubleshooting tool for networking.

One key point before doing the following activities using traceroute: While on Mac and Linux comput-
ers you type in traceroute in the terminal window, on Windows computers you type in tracert
in the command line window.

To start, open two terminals on the Raspberry Pi. In one terminal, run ping 10 times and stop:

$ ping -c 10 illinois.edu

In the second terminal, run traceroute to the same location:

$ traceroute illinois.edu

Whereas ping does a general test from one node to another independent of the routers along the way,
traceroute does a test of each hop between routers between the starting node and ending node. Typi-
cally, traceroute does three tests at each hop.

         · The first hop indicates the time it took to pass from the starting node to the first, gateway
            router that moves us from the LAN to the next network between that node and the destina-
            tion node.

         · The second hop indicates the time it took between the gateway router and the second
            router in the path. For small to mid-sized LANs, this is usually the hop that takes us from
            the LAN to the ISP. For MANs and CANs, this is often the next hop in this community-
            based network.

         · Subsequent hops move us further along in a MAN, CAN, or WAN until...
         · The final hop brings us to the destination node.

When troubleshooting using traceroute, the first hop is a great indicator as to whether the problem
is somewhere on our LAN and needs our attention or the attention of our internal technical support
team. The second hop often means we need to contact either our ISP or our campus or neighborhood
461 Network Troubleshooting

technical support team. Generally, the further we go along, the more the troubleshooting moves out of
our hands.

To review, the first hop typically indicates an in-building issue, the second hop a problem with our
direct network provider, and further hops a problem outside our realm of control. But if we do a tracer-
oute test of just one destination node, it's still questionable where on the path the problem is occur-
ring.

To this end, traceroute really shines when we perform multiple traceroute tests. We can do this on one
node, say a laptop, going to a multiple different sites, some more local and some more distant. We can
take it a step further by repeating the range of traceroute tests on different nodes, say on two different
laptops. We can take it a step further still by repeating the range of traceroute tests on a node con-
nected to one network and then to another, say on a node connected to the LAN WiFi, then to your
local cellular service. (That last test could be done using a smartphone that can connect to either, or by
using the smartphone as a hotspot allowing a laptop to connect to the Internet through cellular.)

For this next test, open one terminal or cmd window on your laptop and two terminals on the Rasp-
berry Pi. As a bonus, if you can, open a traceroute app or terminal that can run traceroute on your
smartphone. Run the following traceroute tests on each device, and in the second terminal on the
Raspberry Pi, a ping to those sites. Compare and contrast the results.

$ traceroute illinois.edu
$ ping illinois.edu
$ traceroute zoom.com
$ ping zoom.com
$ traceroute adafruit.com
$ ping adafruit.com
$ traceroute raspberrypi.org
$ ping raspberrypi.org

Compare the different number of hops, the performance of hops, and even some of the possible router
location identifiers you find. For instance, below are two traceroute results, one going from my home
office to adafruit.com, the other to raspberrypi.org. In both cases, the first hop is the the home's gate-
way router with IP address of 10.0.0.1. The second hop is the ISP's router, 23.249.47.10. The next two
hops go through routers with firewalls and so do not give performance reports (I know this because it
is consistent over time and over destination).

In the adafruit.com example, the next three hops travel along the ntt.net backbone within the
Chicagoland area before getting to a destination router with IP address 104.20.38.240. This means
Adafruit Industries has a server themselves or a provider with a location in the Chicagoland area. All
                                                                                                                                Network Troubleshooting 462

Internet tests are under or just above 10 ms, indicating a high performing Internet connection at every
router interconnect device between my house and the site hosting the Adafruit.com server.

In the raspberrypi.org example, we see a journey of routers that moves from the Chicagoland area to
somewhere else, possibly VA, that is, Virginia, in the United States, before going to The Netherlands,
likely in Amsterdam, before ending up with Mythic Beasts networks, a privately owned hosting ISP.
In this case, note that once travel moves from Chicago to the East Coast of the United States, travel
speeds move from below 10 ms to 20-30 ms. Then as the route passes over the Atlantic Ocean, it jumps
up again to the lower 100 ms performance level. This is much better performance than even a few
years ago, and is an example of why it is possible to have more audio and video communications than
ever before!

But how does this compare to your own Internet service?

Key Takeaways

Using ping, speedtest, and traceroute, you will build a strong portfolio of normal and problem network
performance data for use when things go wrong on your network. Combining a continuous ping writ-
ten to a file with regular timestamps, you can have a clear picture of when and at what level network
performance is impacted. Speedtest provides a second tier of data, and is often the data ISPs want to
see themselves.

Using traceroute, some tests will only have one hop as they stay on the local network. Other tests will
have multiple hops as they leave one local area network and move to another, and perhaps yet more
local area networks until they arrive at the destination local area network. Routers serve as the go-
between, passing packets between local area networks. Intranets and the Internet are simply multiple
interconnected local area networks.

Usually, hop one in a traceroute is from your node to the interconnect device (such as a gateway) in
the building hosting your local area network. A decrease or failure in network performance in hop one
generally rests on you to troubleshoot.

Hops two and three are more variable, and may indicate a problem on your Intranet or the hop
between you and your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If the former, the troubleshooting onus may still
be yours, or that of your IT support team. If the problem is at the level of connectivity between your
network and the ISP, then it might be time to give them a call. Or, you might need to first collect data
on performance variability over time, as ISPs can often shift the burden of testing back on you.

Regardless, the expected results are that you will increase your level of success at troubleshooting.

 Overview

  "Security" holds multiple, varied meanings: Digital information security intersects with personal,
  physical, and financial security and overlaps with personal, political, and economic issues. With
  respect to digital tools and systems, security seeks to achieve confidentiality, integrity, and availability
  for all users. Security manifests within technology as a stand-alone product, such as a password man-
  ager, but more often it is embedded within everyday technologies. Security becomes especially impor-
  tant with respect to Internet-connected devices. It is a necessary consideration when connecting to
  a network and engaging in online activities, such as logging into accounts, sending email, securely
  banking, shopping online, or sharing personal information on social media.

  Privacy, according to NYC Digital Safety, is "the extent to which one's personal data is observed,
  shared, revealed, exploited, or misused in digital spaces and systems, such as the Internet and the abil-
  ity to exercise control over that personal data."1

  Through participant observation and participatory action research, Seeta Peña Gangadharan studies
  digital literacy programs at libraries and community centers serving marginalized groups. Gangad-
  haran found that new internet users, while optimistic about the potential of the internet, encounter
  a "privacy-poor, surveillance-rich experience," and come to feel a "sense of inevitability" that if they
  use the internet, they will eventually experience a breach of their privacy and security.2 At the time
  of the study (2012-2013), Gangadharan found that these programs barely covered topics of security
  and privacy, and moreover, instructors were unable to sufficiently answer the questions of program

  participants. Gangadharan warns that, through our analog social systems, marginalized communities
  have historically been "watched by default," which feeds into the experience of using the Internet.
  Gangadharan further notes that, even while being offline is rarely an option, being digitally included
  "means participation in the potentially harmful consequences arising from inappropriate and asym-
  metric flows of information."3 This highlights the tension between the necessity and the risks of digital
  participation.

  From their origins, the disciplines of information security and privacy have focused on technical solu-
  tions to such risks. This traditional approach either assumes users to be expert technologists, or iden-
  tifies them as "the weakest link" in the security chain.4 Security is implicitly designed with an "expert
  user" in mind, but that's regularly not the reality. Because security and privacy are most often attrib-
  utes of a technological product, rather than its primary purpose, they are inherently embedded into
  larger and more complex systems. This makes the topics of security and privacy nearly impossible
  to isolate; they must be carefully considered with respect to broader digital skill-building efforts and
  within the user's and community's context.

  Moreover, security and privacy awareness are not inherently linked to digital literacy: It is possible to
  use technologies in a variety of ways without accounting for the threats they present. And likewise,
  it's reasonable that non-users of a particular technology may choose this path for their own security
  or privacy-driven reasons.

  While the concepts are often abstract, security and privacy are critical facets of community-centered
  explorations of digital technologies. For a brief introduction, watch Carrie Anne Philbin's Crash
  Course Computer Science video on Cybersecurity. Below is a curated list of resources on security and
  privacy, segmented by audience.

                                                                  Glossary

"If...Then," "If...Then...Else," and "If...Then...Else If" Statements
      A Control Flow Statement that specifies the conditions under which one path or another should
      be taken.

Abstraction
      The level of abstraction is the level of complexity to which an electronic system or computer pro-
      gram is created. At the lowest level of abstraction, every individual component is identifiable. As
      the level of abstraction increases, few details related to the system can be identified. At the high-
      est level of abstraction, only the entire system is identifiable. Within programming, the ideal is to
      determine the most appropriate level of abstraction at which to incorporate the appropriate col-
      lection of blocks of code, within modules stored within libraries to facilitate more general-level
      writing of code.

Algorithm
      A procedure developed to solve a problem or accomplish a task in a strategic way. While not
      exclusive to computer programming, it is often paired with data and information processing pro-
      cedures.

Analog
      Specific to electronics, an analog signal is any continuous electric pulse of varying amplitude. If
      we view a tone playing from a speaker as a sine wave, an increase in amplitude is equivalent to
      a louder sound from the speaker. An increase in the number of waves within a certain period of
      time is equivalent to a higher-pitched tone (perhaps from a middle C note to a middle E note). In
      these graphs of two different sine waves, the left sine wave plot shows increasing amplitude of
      the same tone while, the right sine wave plot shows a stable tone held at stable amplitude.

Anode
      The positively charged electrodes conducting electric current from a cell into a device like a diode.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
      The use of computers not just to collect and store data, but to run algorithms which learn from
      data in order to make predictions and decisions about the data.

ASCII
      The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) uses 7 binary 0s and 1s (bits) to
      represent characters. The first 32 characters (00000000 to 00011111) are unprintable control codes.
      Codes 32-127 (00100000 to 01111111) are printable American English codes, including everything
      seen in this glossary term definition.

Audio/Video Interfaces
      Computers incorporate a range of audio/video interfaces, depending on vendor. Some of the most
      common interfaces currently in use include:

      High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), a proprietary audio/video interface standard, cur-
      rently at version 2.X. This is included as the display port on the Raspberry Pi Model 3 and Model
      4 microcomputers.

      DisplayPort (DP) is a VESA standard digital display interface, and is backward compatible with
      other interfaces such as HDMI. Apple computers use the Apple-designed Mini DisplayPort
      (mDP), although beginning in 2016, Apple began moving towards use of the USB-C connector.

      Thunderbolt is the brand name of an interface standard developed by Intel and Apple. The stan-
      dard allows the multiplex of individual data lanes from multiple connected devices to a single
      DisplayPort (DP), Mini DisplayPort (mDP) (Thunderbolt versions 1 and 2), or USB-C (Thunderbolt
      version 3) connector.

Basic Input Output System (BIOS)
      Software, generally stored within its own memory chip on the systems board of a computer,
      which provides initial self-diagnosis of the computer before beginning the boot loading process.
      The original BIOS framework has mostly been replaced by the newer Unified Extensible Firmware
      Interface (UEFI), although the term BIOS is still sometimes used.

Binary Notation
      Binary notation is based on the base-2 numeral system using only two symbols. The symbols used
      are the digits 0 and 1. Binary is the standard notation for Boolean true or false logic tests. This
      is in contrast to the base-10 numeral system commonly used in the English language, and which
      uses the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Boolean Logic
      A form of algebra used in mathematics, electronics, and computer hardware and software. At its
      base, all values are found to be either true or false using the Boolean operators "OR," "AND," and
      "NOT."

Breadboard
      A breadboard used to be a board (sometimes literally a board for cutting bread) with nails
      pounded into it so that you could wrap wires around them to make experimental models of elec-
      tric circuits. Today, the breadboard is a piece of plastic with holes in it. Underneath each hole
      is a metal clip. These metal clips connect together a specified set of holes ordered into a row or
      column. This way, pushing a piece of conductive material into one hole right away connects that
      material to things pushed into other holes that are joined together by that clip.
471 Glossary

      A perfboard is a thin, rigid sheet with holes but no metal clips on the other side. Instead, copper
      pads are used, to which conductors can be soldered. In some cases, as with the perma-proto
      breadboards from Adafruit, copper is further used to group together certain holes, mimicking
      the breadboard in a way that provides greater durability for prototyping work.

Bundled Software
      Applications like file managers, user managers, and software managers, and applications like web
      browsers, text editors, photo and movie editors. Device and print drivers determine which hard-
      ware is "plug and play" ready.

Cable Internet
      Redirects a cable channel to be used for Internet. Neighborhood shares bus topology. In the U.S.,
      cable internet prioritizes download speeds.

Campus Area Network (CAN)
      A version of a Metropolitan Area Network, the CAN is a network the size of a college, organiza-
      tion, or business campus. These types of networks are typically community-owned and/or -man-
      aged.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
      A style sheet language is used to format the expression of a structured document. While HTML
      itself provides a standard markup language for web page creation, alone, a web browser would
      make key decisions regarding the expression of the various tag elements within an HTML file.

      The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a modern style sheet language for use with HTML, XML, and
      other common markup languages used on the Internet today. Different relevant CSS files can be
      used to separate out content and presentation so that layout, colors, and fonts can be addressed
      independently, reducing complexity and repetition. This also allows distinct structures for differ-
      ent presentation formats such as web, e-book, and PDF displays of the same HTML or XML doc-
      ument.

Cathode
      The negatively charged electrodes conducting electric current out of a device, like a diode, and
      back to a cell.

Cell-Based Internet
      3G adds the EV-DO (Verizon, Sprint/Nextel) or HSDPA (AT&T, T-Mobile) protocol to cell voice's
      protocol. 4G adds the WiMax (Sprint) or LTE (Verizon, AT&T) standard to cell's voice protocol.
      Equivalent to bus (shared) topology. Prioritizes download speeds.

Central Processing Unit (CPU)
      The CPU is the central processor of a computer. It is built of an ever-growing number of electronic
      circuits, enabling it to carry out the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output oper-
      ation instructions for the computer. Over the decades, more electronic components have been
      placed on a single and increasingly small integrated circuit (IC) chip. Today's CPUs are actually
      multi-core processors, with one chip being constructed of two or more CPUs called "cores." It
      is on the CPU that instructions for the vast majority of programming code is actually run. The
      CPU uses three main steps: fetch, decode, and execute, after which the instruction is returned to
      a memory integrated circuit.

Circuit
      When working with electrical components, a circuit is the complete path that allows an electric
      current to flow from source voltage back to the source ground. Circuits generally include one or
      more electrical components along this path which are powered by the source.

      A closed circuit is one in which current can flow fully from its source voltage to its ground
      return uninterrupted.

      An open circuit is one in which there is an interruption in the flow of current from its source
      voltage to its ground return.

Client-Server Architecture
      A computing structure which separates the work between a resource provider, or server, and a
      resource requestor, or client. The client-server model is distinct from centralized computing, in
      which servers reside in a central location or a set of regional locations. It is true that when there
      are many simultaneous client programs initiating requests, the server computer program(s) pro-
      viding resources and services resides on centralized computer hardware called a server, specif-
      ically designed for computation, storage, and networked sharing. That is, the hardware called a
      server is just a computer specially designated to run one or more different applications designed
      to provide the server side of the client-server protocol.

Cloud Computing
      Cloud computing is a form of client-server architecture, where a distributed network of data cen-
      ters ensures the regular availability of computer storage and power, which is accessed over the
      Internet.

Cobbler
      A Cobbler, used in electronics in combination with a prototyping board such as a breadboard,
      is a plastic header to which a ribbon cable can be attached, which can then be inserted into the
      prototyping board. A T-cobbler extension is sometimes included using a printed circuit board,
      allowing the header to which the ribbon cable is attached to be separated from the male pins that
473 Glossary

      are inserted into the breadboard. Labels on all cobblers identifying each of the electrical circuits
      associated with each pin can then also be included on the printed circuit board.

Coding
      Coding is the practical work of using a system of words, letters, figures, and other symbols to
      substitute for another set of words, letters, figures, and other symbols. Coding can include the cre-
      ation of codes of practice and codes of ethics within a profession, codes of classification or iden-
      tification, and codes of information and instruction within a technology. Decoding is the work of
      moving a code back to the original system of words, letters, figures, and other symbols. This is
      compared to programming, which is the creation of a planned series of events, items, or perfor-
      mances using or guiding the creation of codes. Coding is more context-oriented, while program-
      ming is oriented towards the bigger picture. DifferenceBetween.net has a helpful page providing
      further comparisons between coding and programming.

Combinational Logic
      Boolean logic in which the output is based only on the present input.

Community Networks
      Called the "public space in cyberspace" by Doug Schuler, a community network facilitates the
      sharing of public information between residents within a geographic area online. Community
      wireless networking uses standard wireless Ethernet (Wi-Fi) outdoors; anyone can use off-the-
      shelf equipment to create. Equivalent to bus (shared) topology, with synchronous upload and
      download speeds.

Computer
      An electronic device using a program of instructions to collect, store, process, and transmit data.
      Many of our daily use devices, including automobiles, mobile phones, home routers connecting
      a building's network to the wider Internet, the growing number of "smart" internet-connected
      devices, such as watches; building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); light and
      sound systems; and our laptops and desktops, are all built using computers. While some use a
      more significant combination of integrated circuit processors and potentially multiple printed
      circuit boards, increasingly, these parts are more tightly integrated into a single printed circuit
      board and a reduced number of integrated circuits. Depending on design and use specifications
      and marketing, these may be referred to as microcomputers, microcontrollers, microproces-
      sors, or system on a chip (SoC). The Raspberry Pi is a general-purpose microcomputer with
      integrated system-on-chip central processor and other microprocessors.

Conditional
      A command that determines under which specific coding pathway should be executed based on
      the occurrence of another sequence in the program.
                                                                                                                                                     Glossary 474

Conductors
      Electrical conductivity is the capacity to transmit electricity from one place to another. There are
      many different substances, such as copper wires and other bare metal pins, that are used to build
      electronic components. Examples of conductors include breadboards, jumper wires, printed cir-
      cuit boards, and ribbon cables.

Control Flow Statement
      A control flow statement provides a choice between two or more paths, and defines the specific
      sequence in which individual statements within that path should be executed or evaluated.

Controller
      An integrated circuit that interfaces with one or more other devices on a printed circuit board.
      Besides the CPU, this can include input/output controller(s) and a graphic processing unit (GPU)
      controller. The Raspberry Pi Model 3 has two controllers, the system-on-chip (SoC) controller that
      includes the CPU and computer memory, and a controller interfacing with the wired Ethernet
      and four USB ports.

Current (A or Ampere)
      Current is a flow of electrons from relatively positive points to relatively negative points, and is
      listed in amperes, or amps. Different electronics are capable of using different maximum currents,
      so it is sometimes necessary to provide resistance to reduce the current passing through the com-
      ponent.

Daemon
      A computer program that runs in the background, providing services as needed. In this case, each
      time it is launched, the HTTP daemon starts itself based on the specifications within the config-
      uration file, and then mostly hangs out, twiddling its thumbs and waiting for a call asking for
      something. When the call comes, it gets busy doing its stuff before going back to waiting mode.
      You'll often see a running HTTP server daemon listed as httpd.

Database
      A database is a collection of organized data. A database uses a similar starting format to that of
      the rows and columns spreadsheet, this time calling them records and fields, respectively, which
      are stored within tables. But the vast majority of databases used today also add in a relational
      aspect through the use of a key which links tables together. And indeed, many of today's spread-
      sheets have implemented forms of linked cells across sheets as an elementary form of relational
      database.

      To more formally make use of relational databases on a personal desktop, it's possible to move
      from something like Microsoft Excel to Microsoft Access, which includes a Database Manage-
      ment System (DBMS). The DBMS is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and
      the database itself to capture and analyze the data. A query language is needed to allow com-
475 Glossary

      munications within the database and from outside agents into the database. A commonly used
      one is the Structured Query Language (SQL), often pronounced sequel. Together, the database,
      DBMS, and any associated applications make up a database system.

      While many databases are proprietary, non-free software, some, like MySQL, include both a
      GNU General Public License (GPL) version and a Proprietary version. When MySQL was
      acquired from the founding Swedish company by Oracle, co-founder Michael Widenius launched
      a new fork of MySQL called MariaDB, a community-developed, commercially supported fork of
      MySQL, with GPL v2 license for most of the database system and a GNU Lesser General Public
      License (LGPL) for the client libraries.

      Both MySQL and MariaDB make use of SQL and include standalone clients, allowing users to
      interact directly with the database itself. Both are highly compatible and intend to remain so. Both
      can be used as part of a Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, or Perl/PHP/Python (LAMP) base
      infrastructure to serve a range of database-driven web applications, including Drupal, Joomla, and
      WordPress, and websites including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

Desktop Environment
      The desktop environment is a collection of software that provides a predictable look and feel. This
      includes a Window Manager that controls the placement and appearance of windows, support
      icons, menus, etc. For some operating systems, such as Windows and macOS, the desktop envi-
      ronment is the branded look of the operating system and cannot be changed.

Digital
      Specific to electronics, a digital signal is a representation of a physical quantity expressed as a
      series of the digits 0 and 1, that is, binary. The range of decimal numbers representing physical
      quantities in our work, for instance 12 seconds, is converted to a binary equivalent--in this case,
      1100. In this illustration, the dots along the analog sine wave are data points collected to create
      the digital representation of the physical quantities.

Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
      Adds two channels to standard phone line for Internet. Hub and spoke (dedicated line) topology;
      full duplex. In the U.S., DSL prioritizes download speeds.

Diode
      A semiconductor that passes current from one terminal to another terminal and in which current
      can only flow in one direction, known as rectification. Some common uses of diodes include
      reverse current protection, to clip or clamp circuits, and to provide logic gates. Another common
      usage is as a source for generating light, known as a Light-Emitting Diode, or LED. Different
      LEDs work at different wavelengths (the measure of distance between the peak and the trough in
      a wave), associated with different recognized colors of light. Some LEDs are made to be especially
      bright, such as a car headlamp made to help us see the road more clearly. Others are meant to
                                                                                                                                                     Glossary 476

      be more diffuse, thereby working more as a source of information, like a car brake light or turn
      signal. Multiple light-emitting diodes can be packaged together in groups of three that include a
      red, a green, and a blue LED. These RGB LEDs can be further packaged together to create a full
      LED matrix display.

Domain Name System (DNS)
      A naming system which translates domain names to IP addresses. This ensures a consistent name
      space for information resources.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
      As part of the Internet protocol suite, DHCP is a network management protocol. DHCP servers
      dynamically or statically assign IP addresses to connected nodes on the local area network (LAN)
      so that they can communicate with other IP networks.

Embedded Device
      An integrated circuit, also known as a chip or a board, that brings together several components,
      such as a processor, memory, controllers, and input/output peripherals. It can then be embedded
      into a larger microcomputer or microcontroller system.

End-to-End Principle
      According to this principle, network features should be implemented as close to the end nodes
      of the network as possible. Everything that can be done within the client or server application
      should be done there. Only those things that interconnecting devices must do should be done
      there.

Ethernet Port
      An Ethernet port is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard connector
      for 100BASE-Tx/1000BASE-T full duplex Fast and Gigabit wired Ethernet communications, using
      twisted pair CAT-5 and CAT-6 copper cabling.

Federation of the Locals
      The principle that networks begin and end with local area networks (LANs). The other types
      of area networks, including the wide area networks that comprise the Internet, then serve as a
      bridge between the local area networks.

Fiber Optics
      Ultra-high-speed communications technology with one or more channels for Internet. Hub and
      spoke (dedicated) topology with synchronous upload and download speeds.
477 Glossary

Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH)/Fiber-to-the-Premises (FTTP)
      When fiber-optic communications infrastructure reaches from the infrastructure (such as cable
      laid underground in the street) into privately owned property to reach an ISP subscriber's home
      or workspace.

File Manager
      A file manager is a software program that helps you manage all the files on your computer. For
      example, file managers allow you to view, edit, copy, and delete the files on your computer's stor-
      age devices. It is known as the File Manager within the Windows Operating System and as the
      Finder on the Mac Operating System. The file manager makes use of the Graphical User Interface
      (GUI). The same tasks you can complete with the file manager can also be done through the Com-
      mand Line Interface (CLI) terminal.

For Loop
      A control flow statement that specifies the conditions under which a sequence of events should
      be executed.

Forever Loop
      A control flow statement used to create a function that keeps running a sequence of code infi-
      nitely.

Function
      A unit of code defined by its role within a more general code structure. To execute the function,
      it is provided one or more inputs, and produces a concrete result. This result may, but is not nec-
      essarily required to, be returned back to the caller of the function.

General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)
      A general purpose input/output, or GPIO, is a common, open-ended transmission mechanism
      used with integrated circuits on microcontrollers, microcomputers, and other printed circuit
      board electronics. Pins are provided to which female-ended wires can be connected. GPIO pins
      can be programmed as input (e.g., sensor data; ground) or output (e.g., state change; power)
      sources. GPIO pins can be preconfigured for special purposes, or can remain undefined until spec-
      ified by a user at run time. In general, GPIO provides a means to tailor pins to fit specific design
      goals within applications, as well as reusability across applications.

Ground
      In electrical engineering, ground, also called earth, provides a physical reference point in an elec-
      trical circuit from which voltage can be measured.
      For electronic circuits, electrical ground, also called common, is the return path to a power supply.
      Today, most building 120- and 240-volt outlets have power, common, and ground. Many micro-
      electronics make use of only power and common, while certain of our electronics also need earth-
      source ground in addition to power and common, or electrical ground.
                                                                                                                                                     Glossary 478

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
      The standard markup language for data, structured into documents, intended to be displayed on
      a web browser. Using a standard syntax, HTML annotates a document with a semantic structure.
      For example, wrapping a phrase in <em></em> HTML tags denotes that those words are itali-
      cized when rendered in the web browser.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
      The ever-present application layer protocol used to request and access media (such as webpages)
      from across the Internet. Website URLs begin with "http" or "https" to signify this protocol (the
      added `s' denotes the secured HTTP protocol, which is increasingly common). The Hypertext
      Transfer Protocol is part of the Internet protocol suite.

I2C
      The Inter-Integrated-Circuit serial communications bus.
      Unlike UART and SPI which provide send and receive communications to one or two attached
      devices, respectively, I2C is a bus and can work with device addresses to do serial send and receive
      communications with multiple devices.

Initialization
      The assignment of an initial value for a variable.

Input/Output Devices
      Input devices let users control the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse, touch-sensitive devices). Out-
      put devices inform the user of what is happening (e.g., monitor, printer).

Integrated Circuit
      Integrated circuits (ICs) are semiconductor wafers which contain a collection of tiny resistors,
      capacitors, and transistors. These can then be built to serve a wide range of electronic functions.
      In practice, larger-sized electronic components used to build circuits are first tested using materi-
      als like breadboards for rapid prototyping. They are then redesigned to be built into integrated cir-
      cuits and optimized for regular, more standardized use. At times, a mix of electronic components
      along with integrated circuits are themselves used on breadboards to do further rapid prototyp-
      ing of yet larger circuitry. The 5-Key Capacitive Touch Sensor included in the kit for this book
      contains a mix of integrated circuits. Examples of integrated circuits include processors, memory,
      and controllers.

Intelligent Agents/Smart Devices
      Autonomous devices with software that facilitates the device's perception of its environment and
      execution of actions that maximize chances of achieving target goals.
479 Glossary

Interconnect Device
      A device used to connect nodes together. A switch or hub is used with wired Ethernet, an access
      point is used for wireless Ethernet (WiFi), and a router or gateway builds an Internet by connect-
      ing different LANs together.

Interdevice Internetworking
      The facilitation of two or more devices working with each other.

Internet Protocol (IP)
      A key communications protocol for routing data within networks, thus enabling the Internet. This
      protocol delivers packets from a sender to the destination and requires IP addresses for routing
      these packets. Domain Name Server (DNS) services are used to associate IP names with specific
      IP addresses.

Iteration
      Repeating one step in a program multiple times.

Jumper Wires
      Wires are made of either a thicker solid metal or thinner strands of multiple wires, placed within
      a non-conductive material. The exposed ends of the wire can then be inserted into two different
      holes on the breadboard to safely conduct current from one hole to another, helping to extend the
      circuit between different electrical components. These are sometimes attached to a plastic holder
      to provide greater strength. If a solid metal wire end has been soldered into the other side of that
      plastic holder, it is known as a male end. If a metal wire can be temporarily inserted into the
      other side of that plastic holder, it is known as a female end. If a pair of metal clips attached with
      springs is provided, it is known as an alligator clip.

Kernel
      The heart of the operating system. It is the go-between from applications between input/output
      controllers, memory, the central processing unit (CPU), and storage devices.

Link Lights
      LED light found on wired Ethernet cards and switches. When lit, the lights indicate that the card
      and switch are on and working properly and that the Ethernet cable is plugged in and working
      properly.

Lists and Arrays
      Lists and arrays are two commonly used ways to store data. A list is a set of data arranged in
      some order. Lists are mutable, meaning that the order of the items within the list can change. This
      allows for sorting, shuffling, adding, and deleting items from the list. One form of lists, called an
      array, is an indexed set of related elements associating one thing with another; these are espe-
                                                                                                                                                     Glossary 480

      cially useful in control flow loops, such as button counters. However, insertion or deletion of
      items within an array's list can prove difficult.

Local Area Network (LAN)
      The simplest type of Internet-based area networks is a local area network (LAN). A LAN is a
      network with connected devices in a close geographical range. It is generally owned, managed,
      and used by people in a building. For example, connecting to a Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop
      or library would mean that your device would be a node on the coffee shop or library's publicly
      accessible LAN. Many businesses and institutions have a second, private LAN for use by staff
      only.

Machine Learning
      A branch of artificial intelligence (AI) in which algorithms include "teaching" models that contin-
      ually improve machines' predictions when fed data.

Media
      Media are used to interconnect devices on a network, and are made of four primary materials:
      coaxial copper cable, twisted pair copper cable, fiber optics cable, and radio waves.

Media Access Control (MAC)
      Media access control (MAC) addresses are unique identifiers assigned to network interface con-
      trollers (NICs) as part of the data link layer of the OSI model.

Memory
      Memory is the part of a computer in which data or programming instructions are stored and
      retrieved. Memory is constructed using high-performance integrated circuit chips to increase
      performance, as compared to storage devices such as hard drives and lower-performance but
      less expensive flash drive integrated circuit chips. Much of this type of memory is volatile ran-
      dom-access memory (RAM), in which data is lost when power to the computer is turned off.
      There are multiple types of RAM: The higher-cost but faster-performing static RAM (SRAM),
      is used with the CPU to increase CPU performance, while the less costly but slightly slower
      dynamic RAM (DRAM), or more recently double data rate synchronous dynamic RAM
      (DDR SDRAM) is the main memory of computers. The Raspberry Pi Model 3 comes with 1 GB
      (Gigabyte) of DDR, while the Raspberry Pi Model 4 is available with 1GB, 2GB, or 4GB of DDR,
      making it very similar to today's smartphones and Chromebook computers. Many laptops today
      come with 4GB to 8GB of system memory.

Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
      A collection of LANs and devices in an area the size of a city.
481 Glossary

Modem
      A portmanteau of the words Modulator-Demodulator. This device converts data provided from
      computing devices into binary zeros and ones so that it can be transmitted through a network.

Modularization
      Including blocks of code over and over into a program, or having a very long list of code in a
      single instruction set, can become confusing and hard to debug. A module is a block of code, sep-
      arated out into a manageable chunk. Functions and subroutines are examples of modularization.

Motherboard
      The printed circuit board found in a computer, which contains the principal components, along
      with ports and connectors to other devices. The term "motherboard" arose at a time when it was
      paired with one or more supporting printed circuit expansion boards, often referred to as daugh-
      terboards or expansion cards, in order to achieve the full general functioning of the computer.
      The motherboard is sometimes also referred to as the system board or the mainboard.

Network Interface Card (NIC)
      The hardware necessary for a node to connect to a network. For example, an Ethernet card (wired
      or wireless) is used for a LAN connection. A modem (cable, DSL, dialup) is used for traditional
      Internet. Optical network terminals (ONTs) are used for fiber to the home.

Network Manager
      Operating system utility that shows network configuration. An IP address of 0.0.0.0 or one that
      starts with 169.254 indicates that you are connected to the media, but aren't getting a proper IP
      address from the address server (usually the gateway router).

Node
      Any device directly connected to the network that has been assigned a unique identifier or
      address on that network, such as a MAC address (also known as the hardware, physical, or Eth-
      ernet address), the serial number for Ethernet cards, or an IP address (the address used by the
      Internet protocol).

Ohm's Law
      German scientist Georg Simon Ohm developed this simple, linear mathematical principle relating
      current (I), resistance (R), and voltage (V). There are three equations that are used in direct current
      circuits. If needed, these can help us to determine, for instance, which voltage source or which
      resistor ohms we should use to achieve a certain passage of current through our circuit.

      V = IR ... Electrical voltage equals amperes times ohms
      I = V/R ... Current amperes equals voltage divided by ohms
      R = V/I ... Resistance ohms equals voltage divided by amperes
                                                                                                                                                     Glossary 482

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model
      The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model expresses the relationship between the seven lay-
      ers of computer and telecommunications systems. These layers are:

      1. Physical: Copper & fiber cables, radio frequency & infrared wireless.
      2. Data link: Media Access Control (MAC).
      3. Network: Routing of data packets.
      4. Transport: End-to-end connections.
      5. Session: Interhost communication.
      6. Presentation: Data translation & representation.
      7. Application: What the 'end user' sees.

Operating System (OS)
      The core software bundle of a computer. The OS supports different aspects of a computer's basic
      functions, overseeing the coordination between the physical electronics of the computer and the
      many software applications that allow us to do our daily computer-based activities. While the
      physical electronic components of most personal computers support multiple different operating
      systems, only one OS can be run on a computer at a given time, since it is the central control
      system of those physical electronics. That is, the OS has the final word on how software interacts
      with hardware when the computer is turned on and functioning.

      The kernel is the heart of the OS, and for the most part remains hidden from view. On the oppo-
      site side, the graphical user interface (GUI) serves as the visual mechanism for interacting with
      a computer, whether via keyboard, mouse, and monitor, touchpad, or something else. All modern
      computers also include a command-line interface (CLI), such as a terminal window in which
      applications can be run and data is displayed using text. Indeed, for higher-level programming,
      research and development, and systems management, a combination of GUI and CLI interfaces
      used in parallel prove essential.

Packets
      When information and communications data sent is sent from the node and onto the LAN and
      often to the WAN, it is not sent as a single file, such as that we store on a hard drive or flash drive.
      Rather, it is divided into pieces, called packets. Each packet contains a header and a payload. The
      header contains information including the source IP address, the destination IP address, and an
      identification tag to order the packets. The payload is the actual information that is being trans-
      mitted, such as web page data or an email. When a packet reaches its destination, the software
      application will piece all the packets together.

Pair/Triplet Programming
      Pair programming (or triplet programming) is common in software development. Two (or three)
      programmers collaborate on design, coding, and testing, with qualitative evidence suggesting the
483 Glossary

      subsequent design is better, resulting in simpler code that is easier to extend. Further, whether
      the pair programming occurs between two novice programmers, between a novice programmer
      and a more experienced programmer, or between two experienced programmers, people learn
      significantly more about the system and about software development, as both participants bring
      unique insights. Conversation between the programming pair can occur at many levels as the dri-
      ver working at the keyboard takes charge of all changes made in the program and the navigator
      observes all the code that is entered, considers coding options, works to spot and address prob-
      lems, considers and recommends simplifications, helps with programming style, and designs and
      verifies testing.

Parallel Circuit
      A complete, closed circuit in which current divides into multiple paths to ground. A failure on
      one path does not impact electronic components passing along another path running in parallel.

Peer-to-Peer Architecture
      A computing structure in which individual devices can share information and resources directly
      without relying on a dedicated central server. Each device can perform a mix of resource provi-
      sion (e.g., computation, storage, and networked sharing) and resource requesting (e.g., web page,
      new email or social media posts) tasks. Compare to client-server architecture, in which the client
      device performs requests while a server device performs resource provision.

Personal Area Networks (PAN)
      Personal area networks (PANs) provide a simple computer network organized around a few per-
      sonal devices, allowing the transfer of files, photos, and music without the use of the Internet or
      your home's local network. Two common examples would be your Bluetooth headset or your key-
      board and mouse. Depending on the Bluetooth range selected (or chosen for you), this could span
      3 feet, 10 feet, or 100 feet. Beyond Bluetooth, other common PAN connectivity includes Infrared
      (IR), USB, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, and radio frequency (RF, including short-distance AM and FM radio).

Ping
      Run from the command line or terminal application to test if you can communicate with another
      node.

Power Adapter
      Our homes, businesses, libraries, and other community spaces typically include wall outlets from
      which we can plug in our electronics. These are usually either installed to supply 120-volt or
      240-volt alternating current (AC) power source to our devices. But many of our devices use a
      much lower-voltage direct current (DC) power source. It is for this reason that we often need a
      power adapter that has a plug-in to connect to the wall outlet, and another that has another form
      of plugging, increasingly today a micro USB connector, to your electronic device. For the kit used
                                                                                                                                                     Glossary 484

      in this book, we use a power adapter that works with 120-to-240-volt AC power on one side, and
      provides 5-volt, 2.4-amp power via a micro USB connector on the other side.

Printed Circuit Board
      A printed circuit board is a board base made of fiberglass or glass-reinforced plastic, with one or
      more layers of copper or other conductive traces placed on one or both sides of the board base. If
      you've ever tie-dyed a shirt, you've got a good starting point for considering the printing process
      of a circuit board. Individual electronic components and integrated circuits are then soldered onto
      specific trace paths to build complex electronics. A small printed circuit board was used to build
      the 5-Key Capacitive Touch Sensor used in our kit.

Program
      A program is software containing a series of coded instructions to control the operation of an
      electronic device (noun), and the activity of creating coded instructions in support of a partic-
      ular task of an electronic device (verb). Programs are created using a programming language
      that includes rules and a system of symbols. The language must conform to these rules of syntax
      and semantics, but unlike many commonly used physical electronics, they often are not created
      as part of a standards body. A programming language may be developed from scratch, but more
      often they are built within a programming family, using previous programming languages as a
      base starting point, and may rely on another programming language to effectively function on a
      machine. This book explores several popular programming languages:

      MakeCode: A web-based code editor developed by Microsoft, adapted specifically for the Circuit
      Playground Express in collaboration with Adafruit. It provides a block editor similar to the
      Scratch visual programming language developed by MIT Media Lab Lifelong Kindergarten Group.
      (Scratch is installed by default in the Raspberry Pi OS and with the available extension can be
      used with the Raspberry Pi GPIO.) The MakeCode programming language itself is TypeScript, a
      high-level programming language superset of another language, JavaScript. MakeCode is edited
      in a web browser at https://makecode.adafruit.com/ and provides a simulator of a Circuit Play-
      ground Express. Programs can be downloaded and flashed, that is, written to the read-only mem-
      ory (ROM) of the Circuit Playground Express, overwriting the previous MakeCode program on
      the physical device.

      Python: A popular general-purpose programming language with a relatively easy-to-use syntax.
      A range of integrated development environments (IDEs) are available in which code is written,
      tested, and debugged. The Raspberry Pi comes with IDLE and Thonny, two commonly used
      Python IDE bundles.

      PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor: A scripting language used with web server applications in sup-
      port of web development, as well as a general-purpose programming language.
485 Glossary

      SQL (Structured Query Language): Used within database management system servers, like the
      open-source relational database management system MySQL, which can be installed and used in
      the Raspberry Pi OS.

Programmable Circuit
      An electronic component with an undefined function, allowing it to be programmed and used in
      reconfigurable ways.

Prototype
      The first, preliminary model of a circuit or a system of circuits used when developing a product.
      Used both as a noun describing a model and as a verb describing the activity moving towards the
      creation of the model.

Request for Comments (RFC)
      RFCs are technical and organizational notes about the Internet and cover many aspects of com-
      puter networking, including protocols, procedures, programs, and concepts.

Resistance ( or Ohm)
      Electrical resistance reduces the flow of current through a circuit. Resistors are the typical elec-
      trical components used to provide resistance in a circuit, and are listed in ohms. For instance, the
      exercises in the book mainly use 470- or 560-ohm resistors, also abbreviated as 470  or 560 
      resistors.

Ribbon Cable
      When a number of insulated wires are brought together to create a flat ribbon of wires, this is
      called a ribbon cable. Ribbon cables may have a plastic box with solid metal pins extending out
      from the other side, in which case the box is known as a male header. Other times, a plastic box
      is made with holes into which metal pins can be inserted, in which case it is known as a female
      header.

Router
      A router is an interconnect device used to transfer data from one local area network (LAN) to
      another LAN connected to the router.

Schematic
      A symbolic and simplified diagram or other representation of a circuit. Throughout this book,
      schematics are used when an illustration of a circuit is needed without specifying exactly
      how these would be physically built using a breadboard or other prototyping platform. In this
      schematic illustration, we see the formal representation of the electronics used to create a com-
      plete and functioning circuit that include a 560 ohm resistor, a 5mm LED circuit, and a battery.
      In the prototype illustration, we see one example of how this circuit could be constructed using a
      tiny breadboard and a double-A battery.
                                                                                                                                                     Glossary 486

Semiconductor
      A substance that can conduct electricity under some conditions, but not under others. Many elec-
      trical components are built using such semi-conductive materials, including diodes, sensors, and
      integrated circuits.

Sensor
      Electrical sensors are devices used to detect input from the physical environment. Light sensors
      might automatically turn on the headlights of your car, while heat and chemical sensors might
      turn on a fire alarm. And motion sensors might turn up the heating or cooling in a house, or might
      count how many people have passed through a gate to and from a library. The Circuit Playground
      Express that comes with the toolkit has a range of sensor inputs within this printed circuit board,
      including:

      Analog light sensor to detect ambient light, with similar spectral response to the human eye.
      Temperature sensor calculated using the analog voltage at a given moment.
      Microphone audio sensor, which is a digital microphone that works similarly to the microphones
      built into our laptops and smartphones, but is smaller and less expensive, well-suited for this edu-
      cational microcontroller.
      Motion sensor using an accelerometer, detecting both motion and gravitational pull.
      Seven capacitive touch sensors that can sense the touch of a person, human or otherwise.

Sequence
      A particular set of events, and the specific ordering of those events, to complete one step in a pro-
      gram.

Sequential Logic
      Boolean logic in which the output depends on the present input as well as a set history of the
      input.

Series Circuit
      A complete, closed circuit in which there is one path along which current flows. When one elec-
      tronic component along the path fails or is interrupted in some way, all components enter an
      open state and stop working.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
      As part of the Internet protocol suite, SMTP is a communications protocol for email servers and
      clients. SMTP is used to send and receive email.

Sociotechnical
      Social and technical aspects of devices and systems are not two separate side-by-side items,
      but different interdependent aspects of the sociotechnical whole that have emergent properties
487 Glossary

      beyond the sum of their parts. Sociotechnical information systems include a range of hardware,
      software, and networking technical layers, as well as individual and group social layers.

Specifications
      Often called "specs," specifications are formalized practices created using accredited technical
      standards developed and adopted using an open consensus process under guidelines of a stan-
      dards body, or using de facto technical standards developed and owned by a single group or com-
      pany.

Statement
      A statement is a single instruction given to the computer based on the rules of syntax and seman-
      tics of a programming language. The statement may include both the specific command and clar-
      ifying details, such as the color all pixels should be set to.

Storage (Optical, Magnetic, and Flash)
      There are a range of different data storage devices: hard drives (HDDs) constructed using mag-
      netic charges placed on a set of spinning platters; DVDs using pits on a spinning platter read
      via laser; and flash memory integrated circuit chips, such as solid-state drives (SSDs), USB flash
      drives, and SD cards, which provide computers with long-term storage of data and software
      applications. Storage devices are relatively slow, so programming instructions need to be moved
      from storage to memory using integrated circuits to be fetched, decoded, and executed by the
      processors of the computer. The Raspberry Pi kit includes an 8 GB MicroSD card storage device,
      although 16GB, 32GB, and 128GB MicroSD cards are available and can be used with the Rasp-
      berry Pi. In addition, it is sometimes helpful to make use of USB flash drives or USB hard drives
      with the Raspberry Pi to provide even more storage.

Store-and-Forward Principle
      A telecommunications technique in which information is stored at each intermediate node on the
      path to a specified destination.

Structured Query Language (SQL)
      A language for creating, deleting, and manipulating data in a relational database. Although SQL is
      a standard language, many vendors, such as MySQL, have their own "dialect." Relational database
      management systems are often a key component within the "client-server" architecture.

Subroutine
      A unit of code defined by its role within a more general code structure. A subroutine does not
      need an input and does not provide an output, but simply executes the sequence of code within
      it.
                                                                                                                                                     Glossary 488

Switch
      Electronic switches are used to control the flow of current on a circuit. They can be used to switch
      between the closed position, in which a current continues its flow through a circuit, and the open
      position, in which the current is not passed through. A classic example of this type is a light
      switch, in which a closed position would turn on a light and an open position would turn off that
      light. Closing the switch completes the circuit. Other switches are used to control the amount of
      current that flows across the circuit. A classic example of this type is a dimmer switch for a light
      used to brighten or dim the brightness of a light.

      While the above are common mechanical switches, it is also possible to use programming code to
      switch the flow of current along a circuit. A common method for doing this is through use of a
      transistor, which uses a low current signal to one leg of the transistor provided by the program to
      determine the flow of a larger amount of current through the transistors other two legs.

Themes and Skins
      Pre-set packages containing graphical appearance details. Supported in some versions of Win-
      dows and Linux. Available as third-party applications in other cases. Supported for many appli-
      cations, like web browsers. Changes the look and feel of many features at once (e.g., background
      colors, text font and size, icons, mouse cursor, etc.).

Traceroute
      Run from the command line or terminal application to test the performance of each router
      between nodes.

Transistor
      Small electronic switches allowing control of electrical flow within a circuit without using pro-
      gramming code.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
      Together with the Internet Protocol (IP), TCP is one of the primary protocols of the Internet pro-
      tocol suite. TCP specifically defines how data intended to be sent over a network is broken into
      packets before transmission and reliably reassembled in the right order at the destination applica-
      tion. Many applications, including the web, email, and file transfer, rely on TCP as a foundation.

Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
      Also known as a web address, the URL is a commonly used form of the more general Uniform
      Resource Indicator (URI), strings of characters used to unambiguously identify a resource, such as
      "https://www.wikipedia.org." The first part of the URL states the protocol to be used. While web
      browsers support several different protocols, we almost always make use of the HTTP protocol
      or the secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTPS.
489 Glossary

Universal Asynchronous Receive and Transmit (UART)
      Pronounced "u-art," the universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter is a commonly used hard-
      ware supporting serial communication between two devices, such as between a microcomputer
      and a microcontroller. As an asynchronous device, UART data can be sent at different periods of
      time as needed. This contrasts with synchronous data communications technologies such as the
      dynamic random access memory (RAM) found in dual in-line memory modules (DIMM) of a com-
      puter, in which data is exchanged at precise intervals. "Universal" indicates the configurability of
      UART, allowing for unique code to be written supporting different data types and sizes to meet
      specific data communication needs. An independent driver circuit manages transmission levels
      (e.g., 115,200 kilobits per second speed) and methods (e.g., USB to TTL) used within a specific
      communication cable.

USB
      Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a formal industry standard with specifications for cables and con-
      nectors, and also protocols for connections, communication, and power supply between elec-
      tronic devices such as computers and peripherals. USB 1.x, 2.0, 3.x, and the upcoming 4 are
      generations of the standard and associated specifications. The USB port connector on a device is
      called the receptacle, while the connector on the cable is called the plug. There is a range of dif-
      ferent USB connectors approved within USB committee specifications, including:

      Standard format USB Type-A (common on computers, and used on the Raspberry Pi) and Type-
      B connectors (seen in a range of removable devices, such as external hard drives and printers).
      Type-A receptacles on devices are color-coded white, indicating USB version 1 or 2 compliant
      low/full/high speed ports, or blue, indicating USB version 3.x SuperSpeed compliant ports.
      Mini-A (common in cameras and some tablet computers) and Mini-B connectors.
      Micro-A and Micro-B connectors, common in many mobile devices. For USB 3.x ports, a thin but
      wider Micro-B SuperSpeed plug is used.
      USB-C is a formal connector specification, and does not necessarily implement USB 3.x stan-
      dards.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
      Used together with the Internet Protocol (IP), UDP is an alternative to TCP when speed is essen-
      tial and error-correction is not. For example, live video streaming applications use the UDP pro-
      tocol, acknowledging that video may occasionally freeze or appear jumpy for brief periods.

UTF-8
      UTF-8, the 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format encoding system, is the dominant encoding for
      the World Wide Web. It is backward compatible with ASCII, but provides support for a wide range
      of languages beyond American Standard encoding of ASCII.

Variables
      A convenient name to represent numbers that change from time to time. Look at the top of your
      smartphone, and you may see the battery percentage charge remaining. A program exists on the
      smartphone to read this variable and provide a visual representation of it. Variables are often used
      within code to evaluate changes in patterns to determine which series of code should be executed
      at a given moment.

Voltage (V or Volt)
      Voltage is a quantitative expression of the electromotive force required for a charge to pass
      between two points in an electrical field. Common household voltages include 120- and 240-volt
      circuits. Common computer and other microelectronic voltages include 12-, 5-, and 3.3-volt cir-
      cuits. Electrical components are designed for specific voltages and need power adapters if the
      supply of energy does not meet the component requirements.

Watts
      A unit of power used to quantify the rate of energy transfer.

While Loop
      A control flow statement that specifies the conditions under which a sequence of events should
      continue to be executed.

Wide Area Network (WAN)
      Covers the size of a state, country, and could even be considered to include the entire Internet.
      A WAN is comprised of many interconnected MANs and LANs. The WAN that is used to inter-
      network these is typically owned and managed by one or more Internet service providers (ISPs:
      the business that provides connections to each LAN), network service providers (NSPs: the busi-
      ness(es) that provide connections between ISPs), and backbone providers (the business(es) that
      provide the more extended connections between NSPs).

Window System
      This is the part of the graphical user interface that communicates with the kernel. Many operating
      systems allow remote interfacing with the window system, either directly or through third-party
      applications.

Acknowledgments begin through a reflection that this textbook is the latest edition of a living docu-
ment arising from my 25 years of engagement, teaching, and research at the School of Information Sci-
ences, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Ann Bishop and Greg Newby, founders of Prairienet
Community Network, both welcomed me in and challenged me bring my research and engagement
interests into the information science space. Leigh Estabrook, then dean of the School, further opened
doors by adding teaching and leadership opportunities to the participatory research of Prairienet.
Many of the other faculty and staff of the School have guided my pedagogical development and com-
munity inquiry practices, especially Chip Bruce, Ann Bishop, Jon Gant, Nicole Cooke, Manette Mes-
senger, Paul Adams, Sharon Irish, and Lisa Bievenue. But there are so many others that I feel should
be listed but worry this acknowledgment would become unwieldy and there's still more to include.

For this PressBooks edition of the living document, special thanks go out to the Center for Digital
Inclusion who provided ongoing funding, and the Publishing Without Walls project, which includes
the University of Illinois Library, School of Information Sciences, Illinois Program for Research in the
Humanities, and Department of African American Studies, and which is generously supported by the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

Moving from School to campus, there are many across the University of Illinois that I want to espe-
cially recognize. Thanks to all within the East St. Louis Action Research project with whom I have
spent rich days (and nights) traveling, discussing, and doing as part of our extended time in com-
munity, with community, for community. And much thanks also to the campus engagement scholar-
ship and the broader Outreach and Engagement Practitioners Network, CTRL-Shift, CITL, and Gadget
Garage campus/community space!

Extended thanks especially for those deeply valued hours in Prato with the Community Informatics
community, and our gatherings between conferences as well!

Colin Rhinesmith, you fit into so many of these categories that I will instead put you into a line by
yourself. ?

But real change requires community, and so I want to especially acknowledge members of the Cham-
paign-Urbana, East St. Louis, and São Tomé communities with whom I've collaborated. You have
accepted me as I am with such open arms, and have spoken truth to me in so many transformative
ways. Thanks to Sally, Joel, James, Vera, Essie, Martha, Christina and Eddie, Brad, Bill, Sister Marge,
Earl, Kaitroy, Jorge, James, Elvis - this list should go on, but I'll stop here with apologies to the so
many I've left out. I am so very different, my personal and professional engagement is so very dif-

                                                                                 511
                                                                                                                                        Acknowledgements 512

ferent, my work with community technology and networks is so very different, this book is so very
different because of you all. Thank you!

Living documents like this develop through extended works in a community of practice. At the top of
that list come the many who have spent extended hours as my research and teaching assistants dur-
ing the time the Demystifying Technology worksheets and handouts turned into Word documents and
then into HTML and PressBooks items. Thanks go out to Dinesh, Vandana, Beth, Chris, Jake, Deven,
Damon, Jeanie, Sarah, Hailley, Kim, Sarah, Travis, Samaa, Angela, Casey, Rebecca, Rachel, Dan, Bran-
don, Hila, and Stephanie. And special thanks go out for the deep commitment and extended hours that
Henry and Sara put into this work.

I continue to challenge myself to expand the popular education of Freire, and this especially re-centers
me as instructor-student, giving space to the student-instructors who have so much from their lived
experiences, unique knowledge, and community cultural wealth to bring to the table. This, too, is a
deep part of this living document. Thank you.

But the start, the end, and all between comes deeply from the closest of my community, my family.
And at the center of that is Angie.
