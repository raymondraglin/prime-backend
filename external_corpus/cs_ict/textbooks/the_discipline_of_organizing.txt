Foreword to the First Edition

Foreword

This wonderful book arrives at the right time. It is more than a
textbook--it defines and creates the field for which it is a text.
Befitting a book that lays out a discipline of organization that spans
print and digital media, this volume is carefully organized, with a
focus on future print and digital editions.

The Discipline of Organizing has a broad scope. Even more valuable
is its depth, the result of years of examining and thinking through
related concepts--often overlapping but not identical--from the
fields of library science, information science, business, and
computer science. The rare combination of breadth and depth
empowers readers by providing a new perspective and framework
for organizing subsequent experiences. The organization is
comprehensive and systematic, but it is not simple. A lot of concepts
must be assimilated. Yet thanks to the authors' thoroughness, you
can proceed confident that investing the time to master novel
concepts will pay off, that a coherent structure is being assembled,
without inconsistencies or confusions. Into this framework you can
fit your own examples, alongside the many provided by the authors.
You can identify extensions and form new associations, building on
a strong foundation.

The authors ask us to step back and adopt a general,
multidisciplinary perspective. This is unusual for a textbook. For
good reason, the world is marked by increasing specialization, the
division of labor on which complex civilization depends. First we
master a discipline; then we are encouraged to be multidisciplinary,
interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary--to balance our specialized
pursuits. But scholars thrive within single disciplines, and even in
fields created as multidisciplinary efforts, such as the neurosciences

                                                                                       Foreword | xi
or cognitive science, most researchers soon become highly
specialized. So why should a student of information undertake to
master this broad perspective?

By growing from insignificance to centrality in the century-old field
of information management in a few decades, digital technology has
forced a disciplinary merger. Library science, information science,
computer science or informatics, and information systems have
developed different terminologies and sets of abstractions. Rather
than asking each camp to learn the others' languages, the authors
ask each of us to engage with a new terminology and set of
abstractions.

The analogy of the artificial language Esperanto may come to mind,
but we are in a better position. Esperanto is only useful if you
are in a community of Esperantists. The abstractions in this book
will be useful if others share them, but any reader will benefit by
understanding the correspondences across the approaches to
information organization that we encounter today. Unlike
Esperanto, which is just another language, the concepts in this book
reveal linkages and dependencies that we would not otherwise
appreciate. The book provides a deep foundation for understanding
changes that affect our lives and will do so more in the years ahead,
a foundation that you will carry even if much of the time you
converse in the language of one or another professional tribe.

Why do I say the timing is perfect, that this effort is worthwhile
today? Have people not gotten by without it until now? The answer
has two parts. One, which is important even if you have heard it
before, is that this is a time of extraordinary change in our uses
of information. The other is that people have not always "gotten
by" very well; years have been wasted and careers damaged by
not understanding the principles in this book. The likelihood of
such wreckage is growing, as the waves of change are larger and
come at us faster. On the positive side, the waves offer tremendous
opportunity for accomplishment. The coming era of monster waves

may be risky if we surf with a narrow focus, but thrilling for those
whose view extends up and down the shoreline. I believe that if you
read this book, you will see this point and be glad you read it. Let me
know.

We are used to hearing about Moore's law and related legislation,
but familiarity lowers our guard. Human beings do not reason well
about exponential growth: our experience is linear, not exponential.
What we overlook is that exponential growth can proceed for a long
time under the radar--one grain of rice, two grains, four grains, etc.,
not adding up to much, but when it reaches the point of having
an impact, the impact comes so fast that we are unprepared for it.
Decades passed before accessible digital technology could support
high-quality photography, but when the time came, film
photography disappeared so quickly that most major companies
went bankrupt. Digital audio and video were a long time coming,
then panicked and shuttered major industries. The expanding
capacity and diminishing cost of information storage alter the
balances described in this book. Bandwidth, increasing more slowly,
is also reaching disruptive levels. This book provides the best tools
available for understanding the disruptions of today and tomorrow
in information management.

This perspective is invaluable now. It would have been useful earlier,
but it was not considered imperative for the disciplines of library
science, information science, informatics, and information systems.
Historically they prospered despite interacting less than one might
have expected. Library and information science, rooted in the
humanities, focused technology efforts primarily on administrators
and specialized users. Delivering services to the public was
secondary. In contrast, academic computer science and human-
computer interaction focused on widespread applications.

This book consciously connects fields that have focused on aspects
of information organization and management such as archiving,
records management, and curation, to information retrieval and

                                                                                     Foreword | xiii
related aspects of informatics. It explores how related issues play
out in different contexts. The authors are admirably positive. They
do not drag us through the myriad disasters that resulted when
library and information science did not understand the potential
contributions of digital technology and the equally unfortunate
disasters that resulted when technologists ignored a century of
work on information organization.

However, I will sound a cautionary note about what might go wrong
if you do not understand the principles laid out in this book. First,
for computer scientists and engineers: Major system-building
efforts foundered due to a lack of insight into the principles of
information organization. I will describe an early one, whose
protagonists, good or bad, right or wrong, are all equal now.

Although not a computer scientist or computer engineer, Vannevar
Bush had as much influence on the field as anyone through his
work on shaping government support for research after the Second
World War and his 1945 Atlantic essay As We May Think. Discussed
in Activities in Organizing Systems [and Describing Relationships and
Structures], this essay describes a hypothetical machine called the
Memex that would enable information retrieval through a complex
"associative memory" that supports links much like those found in
the World Wide Web today. Although Bush's design was based on
microfilm and optical scanning rather than silicon, his vision has
inspired countless researchers to this day.

Less well known are Bush's classified efforts from the 1930s through
early 1950s to build machines for the military and information
agencies with Memex capabilities. Meticulously detailed by
historian Colin Burke in the book Information and Secrecy: Vannevar
Bush, Ultra, and the other Memex, these projects consumed massive
funding, occupied many brilliant MIT scientists for years, and
produced nothing useful. A working machine was finally produced,
but Bush never consulted with library science scholars who
understood information organization from decades of work and

xiv | Foreword
made naïve assumptions about how information could be organized
for retrieval--the extraordinarily expensive machine was not usable
in the real world.

Computer scientists interested in information should adopt a broad
perspective, and this book is a place to begin. Several fields of
computer science garner attention today, such as machine learning,
data mining, information visualization, and design. Those centered
on information, which is most directly affected by Moore's law, are
likely to have the greatest impact.

The library and information science side of the bridge was also
severely disrupted. Pride in a century of disciplinary
accomplishment led to complacency and inertia. When silicon could
no longer be avoided, there was not enough time to react gracefully.
Major library schools closed. Today there are schools of information
and a range of "library and information science" schools, some more
forward-looking than others. Curriculum change has been relatively
ad hoc, shaped by local personnel and context. Consider
Information to be a large new volcanic cone pushing up in the midst
of other peaks. No consistent approach has emerged to navigate the
range. This book provides bridges where before there were slippery
trails.

What can you do by virtue of reading and studying this book? Most
importantly, perhaps, you can avoid confusion--when reading
something or talking with someone from a different discipline,
when asked a question in a job interview or by a colleague with a
different background. Knowing that differences in terminology and
abstractions are possible, you can ask questions and home quickly in
on understanding. I have written elsewhere that through my career,
such confusions frequently arose when I interacted with people
in diverse disciplines, such as management information systems,
software engineering, human factors, and so on. Because there was
no book like this to clarify, it took me years to comprehend the
source of many communication problems.

                                                                                      Foreword | xv
Beyond that, this book provides a foundation and framework for
organizing and thinking about your experiences. This is a textbook,
pointing to areas for research, providing ways of looking at new
developments, and revealing to the perceptive reader yet
unexplored territory in the spaces between disciplines. This is a
book to read and put on the bookshelf--or in a folder in your digital
reader--to reread in a few years' time.

Preface

  · Preface to the First Edition

  · Preface to the Second Edition

  · Preface to the Third Edition

A year ago I wrote "for a book to be republished in a third edition
barely two years after its first is highly unusual, but we were
compelled to update the book by the extremely positive reception
it has received." I also wrote that each new course that adopts the
book "ratifies the idea that multiple perspectives can reinforce a
shared focus on organizing, while at the same time highlighting the
concepts, technologies, and methods that distinguish those points
of view."

It is happening again. In the last year the idea of data science as
a new career field has led many universities to add new courses,
modify existing ones, to hire new faculty, and even to change the
names of schools or departments. Many people teaching with or
studying The Discipline of Organizing have suggested that the book
incorporate more discussion of data science concepts, and we've
done that in this 4th edition.

The new methods and tools of data science and machine learning
let us organize more information, to do it faster, and to make
predictions based on what people have clicked on, bought, or said.
Data science introduces new considerations of scale and speed
when massive computational power and new statistical techniques
are harnessed to organize and act on information.

But this is not the first time that new ideas and technologies have

                                                                                       Preface | xvii
challenged how people organized and interacted with resources,
and it won't be the last. Data science will not replace human
organizers, any more than any other science has replaced humans.

A data scientist needs to learn statistics, machine learning, and
other new methods and technologies, and this book briefly sketches
them, but does not try to teach them in any detail. However, data
scientists need to understand the fundamental concepts of
information organization, resource description, category design,
and classification that are at the heart of this book. Data scientists
need to select resources wisely and decide how best to describe
them, they need to understand that resource description and
categorization can be biased, they need to understand tradeoffs
and complements between people and computers, and they need
to understand when interpretability of features and organizing
principles are more important than a bit more classification
accuracy in a machine learning model.

The 4th edition builds a bridge between organizing and data science.
It reframes descriptive statistics as organizing techniques, expands
the treatment of classification to include computational methods,
and incorporates many new examples of data-driven resource
selection, organization, maintenance, and personalization. It
introduces a new "data science" category of discipline-specific
content, both in the chapter text and in endnotes, marked with [DS]
in editions that contain endnotes.

New sections and sidebars include:

  · New sidebar: The Distinction between Data and Information

  · New sidebar: Data Science and the Discipline of Organizing

  · New section: "The Concept of "Interaction Resource""

  · New section: "Organizing With Descriptive Statistics"

xviii | Preface
  · New section: "Exploratory Analysis to Understand Data"

  · New section: "Resource Description for Sensemaking and
      Science"

  · New sidebar: Sensemaking and Organizing

  · New sidebar: Geometric Distance Functions

  · New section: "Implementing Categories Defined by Probability
      and Similarity"

  · New figure: Figure: Rule-based Decision Tree

  · New figure: Figure: Probabilistic Decision Tree

  · New sidebar: Finding Friends and Dates: Lessons for Learning
      Categories

  · New sidebar: Statistical Bias and Variance

  · New sidebar: Bias and Variance on Dartboards

Just as with the 2nd and 3rd editions, we are publishing the 4th
edition in a "Professional Edition" that contains all of the discipline-
tagged supplemental content and endnotes, and in a simplified
"Core Concepts Edition" that omits all supplemental content. In
addition, the 4th edition is being published in an "Informatics
Edition" that includes all the new content related to data science,
but omits the discipline-specific content about library science,
museums, and document archives.

Many instructors, students, and readers identified content in
previous editions that was inaccurate, confusing, redundant, or
missing, and I thank them as a group. We have worked hard to
resolve every concern, but as prefaces often say, any remaining
flaws are our responsibility.

                                                                                        Preface | xix
However, there are some whose contributions to this 4th edition
have been so substantial that it would be thoughtless not to thank
them by name. Most of them were participants in a "book club"
seminar at Berkeley during the 2015-16 academic year that
thoroughly deconstructed a number of books to help us design,
build, and cross the bridge between organizing and data science.
These books included The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver,
Predictive Analytics by Eric Siegel, and The Master Algorithm by
Pedro Domingos. The book club participants were Pascual Arrechea,
Stacey Baradit, Dina Bseiso, Phil Braddock, Bill Chambers, Jason
Danker, Laura Desmond-Black, Paul Glenn, Daniel Griffin, Rob
Kuvinka, Molly Mahar, Emily Paul, Robyn Perry, Keshav Potluri,
Shom Sarkar, Jordan Shedlock, Vijay Velagapudi, and Emily Witt. We
learned a lot together, and the important things we learned are now
in this 4th edition.
Other Berkeley students and alums who reviewed the 4th edition

Typographic Conventions

MURRAY MALONEY

Our typographic conventions are a bit less traditional than the
overall composition of the book. Our goal is to make the reading
experience easier for you by subtly emphasizing more important
material, while de-emphasizing content that is less central, yet still
relevant. For example, we emphasize the definition of terms and
discussion of organizing principles while we de-emphasize editorial
asides and parenthetical references.

These formatting choices are intended to facilitate cognitive
uptake. Where colored text is used, we chose dark colors to
maintain contrast, while still offering subtle visual cues.

Definition of term. A sentence or paragraph in which a term is
formally defined. The subtle underline color is Silver, a CSS built-in.
Hover effect is to black underline the definition and embolden the
term.

   Editorial content: In which the authors and editors discuss the
book as a book, cross-references and way-finding, and the editorial
process; or, ruminations upon matters quite apart from the topic
of the book itself; material that won't be on the quiz; such as, for
example, this sentence, or this entire section for that matter. Hover
effect restores text opacity.

   Organizing principle. Alphabetic ordering is an organizing
principle. The text color is #004400, a dark green. Hover effect is
bold text.

   Parenthetical content: Typically used for asides, such as
references to related material. (For a broader discussion of this

   topic, see: Activities in Organizing Systems.) Hover effect restores
   text opacity.

      Statement. A topic sentence, or a richly semantic sentence or
   paragraph. Often, these are pithy sentences that might otherwise be
   overlooked, or hard to re-discover. The text color is Indigo, a CSS
   built-in. Hover effect is bold text.

 Hypertext Links

   To reduce the strain on our readers' eyes, we have chosen to tone
   down all the glaring links we normally encounter. Rather than
   employing the typical blue underlined links that scream for
   attention, our links are presented in a darker, maroon color, without
   underline. Again, we hope that this will reduce distraction and
   facilitate cognitive uptake. The link color is #840024. a maroon. The
   hover effect restores the link to blue, underlined text to assure the
   gentle reader that this is, in fact, a hypertext link.Hover over a link

Disciplines

This book attempts to represent all the disciplines that contribute
to it, without compromising the need for depth, to treat each
contributing discipline in a substantive way. Our design solution
had been a core text with disciplinary and domain-specific content
in hundreds of supplemental endnotes tagged by discipline.
Eventually, we also started tagging core paragraphs and sentences.
This design allows the book to emphasize concepts that bridge
the different organizing disciplines while satisfying the additional
topical needs of different academic programs.

   Hundreds of paragraphs, sentences, and endnotes tagged with
a lozenge-like prefix indicate that the content may be especially
relevant within the realm of that discipline. The most tagged
disciplinary paragraphs and endnotes are computing, library and
information science, business, web, and cognitive science. Data
science is closing the gap.

  · Business: Intellectual capital, human resources, access control,
      branding, decision support and strategic planning, economics.

  · Computing: Computer science, software engineering, and

Abstract

       We organize things, we organize information, we organize
       information about things, and we organize information
       about information. But even though "organizing" is a
       fundamental and ubiquitous challenge, when we compare
       these activities their contrasts are more apparent than their
       commonalities. We propose to unify many perspectives
       about organizing with the concept of an Organizing System,
       defined as an intentionally arranged collection of resources
       and the interactions they support. Every Organizing System
       involves a collection of resources, a choice of properties or
       principles used to describe and arrange resources, and ways
       of supporting interactions with resources. By comparing
       and contrasting how these activities take place in different
       contexts and domains, we can identify patterns of
       organizing. We can create a discipline of organizing in a
       disciplined way.

1. The Discipline of
Organizing

To organize is to create capabilities by intentionally imposing order
and structure.

Organizing is such a common activity that we often do it without
thinking much about it. We organize shoes in our closet, books on
our book shelves, spices in our kitchen, receipts and records in
tax preparation folders, and people on business projects and sports
teams. Quite a few of us have jobs that involve specific types of
organizing tasks. We might even have been explicitly trained to
perform them by following specialized disciplinary practices. We
might learn to do these tasks very well, but even then we often do
not reflect on the similarity of the organizing tasks we do and those
done by others, or on the similarity of those we do at work and those
we do at home. We take for granted and as givens the concepts and
methods used in the Organizing System we work with most often.

The goal of this book is to help readers become more self-conscious
about what it means to organize resources of any type and about
the principles by which the resources are organized. In particular,
this book introduces the concept of an Organizing System: an
intentionally arranged collection of resources and the interactions
they support. The book analyzes the design decisions that go into
any systematic organization of resources and the design patterns
for the interactions that make use of the resources, as follows:

   We organize physical things. Each of us organizes many kinds
of things in our lives--our books on bookshelves; printed financial
records in folders and filing cabinets; clothes in dressers and
closets; cooking and eating utensils in kitchen drawers and cabinets.
Public libraries organize printed books, periodicals, maps, CDs,
DVDs, and maybe some old record albums. Research libraries also

organize rare manuscripts, pamphlets, musical scores, and many
other kinds of printed information. Museums organize paintings,
sculptures, and other artifacts of cultural, historical, or scientific
value. Stores and suppliers organize their goods for sale to
consumers and to each other. Sports leagues organize players into
teams, and the teams organize players by position or role.

   We organize information about physical things. Each of us
organizes information about things: when we inventory the
contents of our house for insurance purposes, when we sell our
unwanted stuff on eBay, or when we rate a restaurant on Yelp.
Library card catalogs, and their online replacements, tell us what
books a library's collection contains and where to find them.
Sensors and RFID tags track the movement of goods--even library
books--through supply chains, and the movement (or lack of
movement) of cars on highways.

   We organize digital things. Each of us organizes personal digital
information--email, documents, ebooks, MP3 and video files,
appointments, contacts--on our computers, smartphone, ebook
readers, or in "the cloud," --through information services that use
Internet protocols. Large research libraries organize digital journals
and books, computer programs, government and scientific datasets,
databases, and many other kinds of digital information. Companies
organize their digital business records and customer information
in enterprise applications, content repositories, and databases.
Hospitals and medical clinics maintain and exchange electronic
health records and digital X-rays and scans.

   We organize information about digital things. Digital library
catalogs, web portals, and aggregation websites organize links to
other digital resources. Web search engines use content and link
analysis along with relevance ratings, to organize the billions of
web pages competing for our attention. Web-based services, data
feeds and other information resources can be interconnected and
choreographed to carry out information-intensive business
processes, or aggregated and analyzed to enable prediction and
personalization of information services.

30 | The Discipline of Organizing
Let us take a closer look at these four different types or contexts
of organizing. We contrasted "organizing things" with "organizing
information." At first glance it might seem that organizing physical
things like books, compact discs, machine parts, or cooking utensils
has an entirely different character than organizing intangible digital
things. We often arrange physical things according to their shapes,
sizes, material of manufacture, or other intrinsic and visible
properties: for example, we might arrange our shirts in the clothes
closet by style and color, and we might organize our music
collection by separating the old vinyl albums from the CDs. We
might arrange books on bookshelves by their sizes, putting all the
big, heavy picture books on the bottom shelf. Organization for
clothes and information artifacts in tangible formats that is based
on visible properties does not seem much like how you store and
organize digital books on your Kindle or arrange digital music on
your music player. Arranging, storing, and accessing X-rays printed
on film might appear to have little in common with these activities
when the X-rays are in digital form.

It is hardly surprising that organizing things and organizing
information sometimes do not differ much when information is
represented in a tangible way. The era of ubiquitous digital
information of the last decade or two is just a blip in time compared
with the more than ten thousand years of human experience with
information carved in stone, etched in clay, or printed with ink on
papyrus, parchment, or paper. These tangible information artifacts
have deeply embedded the notion of information as a physical thing
in culture, language, and methods of information design and
organization. This perspective toward tangible information artifacts
is especially prominent in rare book collections where books are
revered as physical objects with a focus on their distinctive binding,
calligraphy, and typesetting.

Nevertheless, at other times there are substantial differences in
how we organize things and how we organize information, even
when the latter is in physical form. We more often organize our

                                                            The Discipline of Organizing | 31
"information things" according to what they are about rather than
on the basis of their visible properties. At home we sort our CDs by
artist or genre; we keep cookbooks separate from travel books, and
fiction books apart from reference books. Libraries employ subject-
based classification schemes that have a few hundred thousand
distinct categories.

Likewise, there are times when we pay little attention to the visible
properties of tangible things when we organize them and instead
arrange them according to functional or task properties. We keep
screwdrivers, pliers, a hammer, a saw, a drill, and a level in a toolbox
or together on a workbench, even though they have few visual
properties in common. We are not organizing them because of what
we see about them, but because of what we know about to use them.
The task-based organization of the tools has some similarity to the
subject-based organization of the library.

We also contrasted "organizing things" with "organizing information
about things." This difference seems clear if we consider the
traditional library card catalog, whose printed cards describe the
books on library shelves. When the things and the information
about them are both in physical format, it is easy to see that the
former is a primary resource and the latter a surrogate or associated
resource that describes or relates to it.

          What Is Information?
          Most of the hundreds of definitions of information
       treat it as an idea that swirls around equally hard-to-
       define terms like "data," "knowledge," and
       "communication." Moreover, these intellectual and
       ideological perspectives on information coexist with
       more mundane uses of the term, as when we ask a

32 | The Discipline of Organizing
          station agent: "Can you give me some information about
          the train schedule?"

             An abstract view of information as an intangible thing
          is the intellectual foundation for both modern
          information science and the information economy and
          society. Nevertheless, the abstract view of information
          often conflicts with the much older idea that
          information is a tangible thing that naturally arose when
          information was inextricably encoded in material
          formats. We often blur the sense of "information as
          content" with the sense of "information as container,"
          and we too easily treat the number of stored bits on a
          computer or in "the cloud" as a measure of information
          content or value.

             Geoff Nunberg has eloquently explained in Farewell to
          the Information Age that information is "a collection of
          notions, rather than a single coherent concept." Michael
          Buckland's oft-cited essay Information as Thing argues
          against the notion that information is inherently
          intangible and instead defines it more broadly and
          provocatively based on function. A resource that can be
          learned from or serve as evidence is "information-as-
          thing," a definition that treats the tangible objects in
          museum or personal collections as information.1

   When it comes to "organizing information about digital things" the

  2005).

   contrast is much less clear. When you search for a book using a
   search engine, first you get the catalog description of the book, and
   often the book itself is just a click away. When the things and the
   information about them are both digital, the contrast we posed is
   not as sharp as when one or both of them is in a physical format.
   And while we used X-rays--on film or in digital format--as examples
   of things we might organize, when a physician studies an X-ray,
   is it not being used as information about the subject of the X-ray,
   namely, the patient? And when businesspeople make marketing and
   pricing decisions by analyzing digital information about what and
   when people buy, we can think of this as organizing customers into
   categories, or as organizing customer information.

   These differences and relationships between "physical things" and
   "digital things" have long been discussed and debated by
   philosophers, linguists, psychologists, and others. (See the sidebars,
   What Is Information? and The Distinction between Data and
   Information.)

   The distinctions among organizing physical things, organizing
   digital things, or organizing information about physical or digital
   things are challenging to describe because many of the words we
   might use are as overloaded with multiple meanings as
   "information" itself. For example, the library science perspective
   often uses presentation or implementation properties in definitions
   of "document," using the term to refer only to traditional physical
   forms. In contrast, the informatics or computer science perspective
   takes an abstract view of "document" to refer to any self-contained
   unit of information, separating a document's content from its
   presentation or container.2

   The most abstract definition of "document," presented in What is

2. (Glushko and McGrath 2005).

    34 | The Discipline of Organizing
   a Document? follows from Buckland's "information as thing" idea.
   Because it can be studied to provide evidence, an antelope is both
   "information as thing" and also a "document" when it is in a zoo,
   even though it is just an animal when it is running wild on the
   plains of Africa. However, in 2015 the United States Supreme Court
   rejected this expansive definition in a case that hinged on whether a
   fish could be viewed as a document.3

3. (Buckland 1997). The idea that an antelope could be a
   document was first proposed in (Briet 1951).

   A commercial fisherman in Florida was found with fish in
   his catch below the legal size limit. An inspector ordered
   him to return to port and hand the fish over to the
   authorities; when he dumped them overboard instead,
   he was charged with violating the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
   a law drafted in response to high-profile white-collar
   crimes such as the Enron scandal. The law imposes harsh
   penalties for destroying "any record, document, or
   tangible object" to impede a federal investigation. The
   fisherman argued that the law should only apply to
   written documents, but the United States government
   contended that because the fish were "tangible objects"
   whose presence on the boat served as the only
   documentation of the allegedly illegal fishing, there was
   no practical difference between a fish and a document
   in this case. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the
   fisherman, finding that "tangible object" must be
   interpreted in the context of "record" and "document"
   and, as such, only applies to an object "used to record

                                                                The Discipline of Organizing | 35
              The Distinction between Data and Information
              Astute readers might have noticed that we included
           sensor data as "information about physical things" and
           data feeds as "information about digital things." Many
           textbooks in the information science and knowledge
           management fields distinguish data and information in a
           more precise way. To them, data sits at the bottom of an
           Information Hierarchy, Knowledge Pyramid, or DIKW
           Hierarchy in which Data is transformed into
           Information, which is transformed into Knowledge,
           which is then transformed into Wisdom.

   or preserve information." The fact that a fish is tangible
   evidence in this case does not make it a document.

    36 | The Discipline of Organizing
   In this framework, data are raw or elementary
observations about properties of objects, events, and
their environment. Data becomes information when it is
aggregated, processed, analyzed, formatted, and
organized to add meaning and context so it can be used
to answer questions. This processing can include
calculation, inference, or refinement operations on the
data. For example, measurements of temperature,
precipitation, and wind speed are data. When combined
and summarized, a set of data becomes statistical
information about the weather on a particular day.
When collected over a period of months or years, these
datasets become information about the climate of the
location where they were collected.

   The Discipline of Organizing does not make this sharp
contrast between data and information in the
Hierarchy/Pyramid. People who read this book are
likely to be aspiring or practicing professionals in
information-intensive industries where information and
data are often treated as synonyms to mean the content
of a database or data-managing application. A
distinction between data and information might be
useful in theory, but not in these applied settings.

   The distinction between data and information is also
being blurred by the expansion in the scope of the
definition of data in the emerging career field of data
science. Indeed, a popular introductory text eliminates
information entirely from the Hierarchy/Pyramid with

                                                   The Discipline of Organizing | 37
           its title, Discovering knowledge in data: an introduction
           to data mining.5

   Similar definitional variation occurs with "author" or "creator."
   When we say that "Herman Melville is the author of Moby Dick"
   (Melville 1851) the meaning of "author" does not depend on whether
   we have a printed copy or an ebook in mind, but what counts
   as authorship varies a great deal across academic disciplines.
   Furthermore, different standards for describing resources disagree
   in the precision with which they identify the person(s) or
   organization(s) primarily responsible for creating the intellectual

5. The DIKW hierarchy seems to have been inspired by
   The Rock, A Pageant Play (Eliot 1934) by the poet T S
   Eliot, whose opening chorus contains these lines:
   Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?
   Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?
      Most people credit Ackoff's From Data to Wisdom
   (Ackoff 1989) as the first articulation of the hierarchy in
   an information science and systems context. The
   hierarchy is mentioned in nearly twenty textbooks, but
   their close analysis by (Rowley 2007) reveals only partial
   agreement on the definitions and relationships among
   the four key concepts. The hierarchy has been criticized
   as lacking in philosophical rigor (Fricke 2009) and for
   ignoring the context-specificity of how knowledge is
   learned and applied (Jennex 2009). (Larose 2014)

content of the resource, People who are serious about music
description rightly criticize streaming services and online stores
that have only a single "artist" field because this fails to distinguish
the composer, conductor, orchestra, and other people with distinct
roles in creating the music.

If we allow the concept of information to be anything we can
study--to be "anything that informs"--the concept becomes
unbounded. Our goal in this book is to bridge the intellectual gulf
that separates the many disciplines that share the goal of organizing
but differ in what they organize. This requires us to focus on
situations where information exists because of intentional acts to
create or organize. (See the sidebar, The Discipline of Organizing)

          The Discipline of Organizing
          A discipline is an integrated field of study in which
       there is some level of agreement about the issues and
       problems that deserve study, how they are interrelated,
       how they should be studied, and how findings or
       theories about the issues and problems should be
       evaluated. A framework is a set of concepts that provide
       the basic structure for understanding a domain,
       enabling a common vocabulary for different explanatory
       theories.
          Organizing is a fundamental issue in many disciplines,
       most notably library and information science, computer
       science, systems analysis, informatics, law, economics,
       and business. However, these disciplines have only
       limited agreement in how they approach problems of
       organizing and what they seek as their solutions. For
       example, library and information science has
       traditionally studied organizing from a public sector

                                                           The Discipline of Organizing | 39
           bibliographic perspective, paying careful attention to
           user requirements for access and preservation, and
           offering prescriptive methods and solutions.6

              In contrast, computer science and informatics tend to
           study organizing in the context of information-intensive
           business applications with a focus on process efficiency,
           system architecture, and implementation. The
           disciplines of management and industrial organization
           deal with the organization of human, material, and
           information resources in contexts shaped by
           commercial, competitive, and regulatory forces.

              This book presents a more abstract framework for

6. We can continue the debate in the previous
   paragraphs and the sidebar, What Is Information? by
   pointing out that in both common and professional
   usage, "bibliographic" activities involve describing and
   organizing information resources of the kinds that might
   be found in a library. But noted information scientist
   Patrick Wilson argued for a much broader expanse of the
   bibliographic universe, suggesting that "it includes
   manuscripts as well as printed books, bills of lading and
   street signs as well as personal letters, inscriptions on
   stone as well as phonograph recordings of speeches, and
   most notably, memorized texts in human heads and
   texts stored up in the memories of machines" (Wilson
   1968, p. 12).

    40 | The Discipline of Organizing
       issues and problems of organizing that emphasizes the
       common concepts and goals of the disciplines that
       study them. Our framework proposes that every system
       of organization involves a collection of resources, and
       we can treat physical things, digital things, and
       information about such things as resources. Every
       system of organization involves a choice of properties or
       principles used to describe and arrange the resources,
       and ways of supporting interactions with the resources.
       By comparing and contrasting how these activities take
       place in different contexts and domains, we can identify
       patterns of organizing and see that Organizing Systems
       often follow a common life cycle. We can create a
       discipline of organizing in a disciplined way.

Many of the foundational topics for a discipline of organizing have
traditionally been presented from the perspective of the library
sector and taught as "library and information science." These
include bibliographic description, classification, naming, authority
control, curation, and information standards. In recent decades
these foundations have been built on and extended by computer
science, cognitive science, informatics, and other new fields to
include more private sector and non-bibliographic contexts,
multimedia and social media, and new information-intensive
applications and service systems enabled by mobile, pervasive, and
scientific computing. The latest additions to the discipline of
organizing are coming from data science and machine learning,
introducing considerations of speed and scale that arise when
massive computational power and new statistical techniques are
harnessed to organize and act on information.

The new methods and tools of data science and machine learning

                                                            The Discipline of Organizing | 41
let us organize more information, to do it faster, and to make
predictions based on what people have clicked on, bought, or said.
But this is not the first time that new ideas and technologies have
challenged how people organized and interacted with resources.
Fifty years ago, searchable online catalogs radically changed how
people used libraries. The web, invented less than thirty years ago
so that scientists could share technical reports, is now an essential
part of many human activities. It is important not to view the latest
new thing as changing everything, because new things will continue
to come, and these technology breakthroughs still depend on and
complement the organizing work done by people. Data science will
not replace human organizers, any more than any other science has
replaced humans. (See sidebar, Data Science and the Discipline of
Organizing).

This is why we need to take a transdisciplinary view that lets us
emphasize what the different disciplines have in common and how
they fit together rather than what distinguishes them. Resource
selection, organizing, interaction design, and maintenance are
taught in every discipline, but these concepts go by different names.
A vocabulary for discussing common organizing challenges and
issues that might be otherwise obscured by narrow disciplinary
perspectives helps us understand existing systems of organizing
better while also suggesting how to invent new ones by making
different design choices.

          Data Science and the Discipline of Organizing
          Advances in computing power and statistical
       techniques are making it possible to identify patterns in
       data and extract meaningful information at a scale never
       before possible. Many books and articles about data
       science, machine learning, and predictive analytics make

42 | The Discipline of Organizing
bold predictions that these emerging fields will radically
change the world. These claims are both provocative
and promising, but at its core, data science is about how
resources are selected, described, and organized;
concepts with a long tradition in information and library
science. Instead of organizing and describing the books
in a library or the products in a warehouse, a data
scientist might organize information about books or
products into massive data tables, treating each
resource as a row and its descriptive properties as the
columns. After people might have organized books or
products into categories, machine learning techniques
might classify new books or products using those
categories, or perhaps discover new categories based on
access or purchasing behaviors. So while the techniques
of data science are new, many of the challenges are not;
data scientists need to select resources wisely and
decide how best to describe them; they need to
understand that resource description and
categorization can be biased; they need to understand
the tradeoffs and complements between people and
computers; and, they need to test the discoveries that
algorithms make with controlled experiments.

   To make sense of the discussions around data science,
one must understand the difference between kind and
degree. A hundred years ago, a car's highway travel
speed was about forty miles an hour. Today's cars travel
twice as fast, but this is just a change in degree.
However, an increase in speed to about 17,500 miles an
hour achieves an "orbital velocity" that allows us to go
into Earth orbit in space, travel that is different in kind.

                                                   The Discipline of Organizing | 43
              What about data science? Some data science involves
           collections of data that are "tall," containing many
           millions or even billions of records that each have a
           relatively small number of variables. Being able to
           analyze "tall" data more rapidly than ever before is
           primarily a change in degree compared with traditional
           database techniques. Nevertheless, for collections of
           data that are "wide," where each record might contain
           hundreds or thousands of variables, data science
           techniques might allow us to see patterns that could not
           be seen at all, or could not be seen affordably and in
           quantity. Here, data science might be yielding changes
           in kind.7

7. Siegel's Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict who
  will Click, Buy, Lie or Die" (Siegel 2013) is written for a
  non-technical audience and enthusiastically describes
  over 100 applications. The Master Algorithm (Domingos
  2015) shares Siegel's enthusiasm but is far more
  technical; the book attempts to explain and compare the
  five "tribes" of machine learning: the symbolists,
  connectionists, evolutionaries, Bayesians, and
  analogizers. The title of Chris Anderson's provocative
  article in Wired Magazine (Anderson, 2008) is self-
  explanatory: "The end of theory: The data deluge makes
  the scientific method obsolete."

     "Difference in kind or difference in degree" is an

   44 | The Discipline of Organizing
important issue in legal contexts and more generally
arises whenever there is a disagreement about whether
some difference or change is strict and categorical or
whether it is incremental. We introduce it here so that
readers can think critically about the socio-business-
technical changes that might come about as a result of
new methods and technologies for organizing and
analyzing data. We believe that data science is on its way
to becoming an important part of the organizing tool
box. But everyone needs to remember that humans own
the tool box, and that they design and build the tools.

2. The "Organizing System"
Concept

We propose to unify many perspectives about organizing and
information with the concept of an Organizing System, an
intentionally arranged collection of resources and the interactions
they support. This definition brings together several essential ideas
that we will briefly introduce in this chapter and then develop in
detail in subsequent chapters.
Figure: An Organizing System. depicts a conceptual model of an
Organizing System that shows intentionally arranged resources,
interactions (distinguished by different types of arrows), and the
human and computational agents interacting with the resources in
different contexts.

                                                                                        Concept | 47
An Organizing System is a collection of resources arranged in ways
that enable people or computational agents to interact with them.

An Organizing System is an abstract characterization of how some
collection of resources is described and arranged to enable human
or computational agents to interact with the resources. The
Organizing System is an architectural and conceptual view that
is distinct from the physical arrangement of resources that might
embody it, and also distinct from the person, enterprise, or
institution that implements and operates it. These distinctions are
sometimes hard to maintain in ordinary language; for example, we
might describe some set of resource descriptions, organizing
principles, and supported interactions as a "library" Organizing
System. However, we also need at times to refer to a "library" as the
institution in which this Organizing System operates, and of course
the idea of a "library" as a physical facility is deeply engrained in
language and culture.

Our concept of the Organizing System was in part inspired by the
concepts proposed in 2000 for bibliographic domains by Elaine
Svenonius, in The Intellectual Foundation of Information
Organization. She recognized that the traditional information
organization activities of bibliographic description and cataloging
were complemented, and partly compensated for, by automated
text processing and indexing that were usually treated as part of
a separate discipline of information retrieval. Svenonius proposed
that decisions about organizing information and decisions about
retrieving information were inherently linked by a tradeoff principle
and thus needed to be viewed as an interconnected system: "The
effectiveness of a system for accessing information is a direct function
of the intelligence put into organizing it" (p.ix). We celebrate and

48 | The "Organizing System" Concept
build upon her insights by beginning each of the sub-parts of Design
Decisions in Organizing Systems with a quote from her book.1

A systems view of information organization and information
retrieval captures and provides structure for the inherent tradeoffs
obscured by the silos of traditional disciplinary and category
perspectives: the more effort put into organizing information "on
the way in" when it is created or added to a collection, the more
effectively it can be retrieved, and the more effort put into
retrieving information "on the way out," the less it needs to be
organized first. Sometimes a collection of resources is highly
organized, but because it was organized by someone else for
different purposes that have in mind, we need to reorganize it "on
the way in." This is especially common with digital text or datasets,
where previously organized resources or their descriptions might
be sorted, translated in format or language, combined, summarized,
or otherwise transformed to fit into a new Organizing System. For
example, to understand seasonal buying patterns, a retailer might
combine shopping data with weather data and calendar data about
commonly-watched sporting events (because bad weather and
broadcast sports cause people to stay home), and all three datasets
would need to describe "time" and "location" in the same way.

A systems view no longer contrasts information organization as
a human activity and information retrieval as a machine activity,
or information organization as a topic for library and information
science and information retrieval as one for computer science.
Instead, we readily see that computers now assist people in
organizing and that people contribute much of the information used
when computers analyze and organize resources. For example,

1. (Svenonius 2000).

                      The "Organizing System" Concept | 49
many algorithms for computational classification use supervised
learning approaches that start with items classified by people.
Finally, a systems view can be applied to Organizing Systems with
any kind of resource, enabling more nuanced discussion of how
economic, social, and cognitive costs and benefits of organizing are
allocated among different stakeholders. Every Organizing System
is biased by the perspectives and experiences of the people who
create it. Some of these biases are inescapable, a kind of automatic
organizing, because they reflect innate human perceptual and
cognitive capabilities. Our minds impose structure and find
patterns, even when there aren't any, and we are not capable of
acting perfectly rationally, so we simplify without realizing it. People
are also not very good at thinking about future possibilities and
revising their expectations given new evidence, and this mental
inertia makes us preserve resources and interactions in Organizing
Systems that are no longer needed. Other biases in Organizing
Systems reflect more intentional choices that implicitly or explicitly
create winners or losers, treat some interactions as preferred while
deprecating others, or otherwise impose or overlay a set of values
on the stakeholders of the system. For example, many Organizing
Systems arrange people in groups or queues to make interactions
more efficient, but when an airline gives boarding priority to
customers who paid more for their tickets it might not seem fair to
you if are in the last boarding group.

50 | The "Organizing System" Concept
 3. The Concept of "Resource"

   Resource has an ordinary sense of anything of value that can support
   goal-oriented activity. This definition means that a resource can be
   a physical thing, a non-physical thing, information about physical
   things, information about non-physical things, or anything you want
   to organize. Other words that aim for this broad scope are entity,
   object, item, and instance. Document is often used for an information
   resource in either digital or physical format; artifact refers to
   resources created by people, and asset for resources with economic
   value.

   Resource has specialized meaning in Internet architecture. It is
   conventional to describe web pages, images, videos, and so on as
   resources, and the protocol for accessing them, Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol(HTTP), uses the Uniform Resource Identifier(URI).1

1. The URI identifies a resource as an abstract entity that
  can have "multiple representations," which are the
  "things" that are actually exposed through applications
  or user interfaces. The HTTP protocol can transfer the
  representation that best satisfies the content properties
  specified by a web client, most often a browser. This
  means that interactions with web resources are always
  with their representations rather than directly with the
  resource per se. The representation of the resource might
  seem to be implied by the URI (as when it ends in .htm
  or .html to suggest text in Hypertext Markup
  Language(HTML) format), but the URI is not required to

                                                                  The Concept of "Resource" | 51
          Concert Tickets

indicate anything about the "representation." A web
resource can be a static web page, but it can also be
dynamic content generated at the time of access by a
program or service associated with the URI. Some
resources like geolocations have "no representations at
all;" the resource is simply some point or space and the
interaction is "show me how to get there." The browser
and web server can engage in "content negotiation" to
determine which "representation" to retrieve, and this is
particularly important when that format further requires
an external application or "plug-in" in order for it to be
rendered properly, as it does when the server returns a
Power Point file or an other file format that is not built
into the browser.

Internet architecture's definition of resource as a
conceptual entity that is never directly interacted with is
difficult for most people to apply when those resources
are physical or tangible objects, because then it surely
seems like we are interacting with something real. So we
will most often talk about interactions with resources,
and will mention "resource representations" only when it
is necessary to align precisely with the narrower Internet
architecture sense.

52 | The Concept of "Resource"
   Tickets are physical artifacts that convey event-
related metadata: including time, place, and seat
number; price and terms of admission; and featured
performers. For concert goers, tickets offer the promise
of all that, and a memory of the ineffable quality of
more.

                                                     The Concept of "Resource" | 53
          (Photo by Murray Maloney.)

          What IS a Concert Ticket?
          A concert ticket is a vehicle for conveying a package
       of assertions about an event, so it is a description
       resource, like a card in a library card catalog. A concert
       ticket is also a resource in its own right, with intrinsic
       value; it can be bought and sold, sometimes for a greater
       price than its resource description specifies. A ticket is a
       license to use a seat in a venue for a specified purpose
       at a specified time; after the event, the ticket loses its
       intrinsic value, but might acquire extrinsic value as an
       artifact in a collection like this one.

Treating as a primary resource anything that can be identified is an
important generalization of the concept because it enables web-
based services, data feeds, objects with RFID tags, sensors or other
smart devices, or computational agents to be part of Organizing
Systems.

Instead of emphasizing the differences between tangible and
intangible resources, we consider it essential to determine whether
the tangible resource has information content--whether it needs to
be treated as being "about" or representing some other resource
rather than being treated as a thing in itself. Whether a book is
printed or digital, we focus on its information content, what it is
about; its tangible properties become secondary. In contrast, the
hangars in our closet and the measuring cups in our kitchen are not
about anything more than their obvious utilitarian features, which

54 | The Concept of "Resource"
makes their tangible properties most important. (Of course, there is
no sharp boundary here; you can buy "fashion hangers" that make
a style statement, and the old measuring cup could be a family
memento because it belonged to Grandma).

Many of the resources in Organizing Systems are description
resources or surrogate resources that describe the primary resources;
library catalog entries or the list of results in web search engines are
familiar examples. In museums, information about the production,
discovery, or history of ownership of a resource can be more
important than the resource; a few shards of pottery are of little
value without these associated information resources. Similarly,
business or scientific data often cannot be understood or analyzed
without additional information about the manner in which they
were collected. Most web-based businesses exploit data about how
users interact with resources, such as the log files that record every
web search you make, every link you click, and every web page you
visit.

Resources that describe, or are associated with other resources are
sometimes called metadata. However, when we look more broadly
at Organizing Systems, it is often difficult to distinguish between
the resource being described and any description of it or associated
with it. One challenge is that when descriptions are embedded in
resources, as metadata often is--in the title page of a book, the
masthead of a newspaper, or the source of web pages--deciding
which resources are primary is often arbitrary.

A second challenge is that what serves as metadata for one person
or process can function as a primary resource or data for another
one. Rather than being an inherent distinction, the difference
between primary and associated resources is often just a decision
about which resource we are focusing on in some situation. An
animal specimen in a natural history museum might be a primary
resource for museum visitors and scientists interested in anatomy,

                                                              The Concept of "Resource" | 55
   but information about where the specimen was collected is the
   primary resource for scientists interested in ecology or migration.

   Organizing Systems can refer to people as resources, and we often
   use that term to avoid specifying the gender or specific role of an
   employee or worker, as in the management concept of the "human
   resources" department in a workplace. A business is defined by
   its intentional arrangement of human resources, and there is both
   variety and regularity in these arrangements (see the sidebar,
   Business Structures in "The Structural Perspective"). 2

   Human resources in Organizing Systems can be understood much
   the same way as inanimate physical or digital resources: they are
   selected, organized, and managed, and can create value individually
   or through their interactions with others inside and outside of the
   system.3

2. In addition, groups of people have come together to form
   "intentional communities" for thousands of years in
   monasteries, communes, artist colonies, cooperative
   houses, and religious or ethnic enclaves so they can live
   with people who share their values and beliefs. A
   directory of intentional communities organized by type
   and location is managed by the Fellowship of Intentional
   Communities.

3. The shift from a manufacturing to an information and
   services economy in the last few decades has resulted in
   greater emphasis on intellectual resources represented
   in skills and knowledge rather than on the natural
   resources of production materials and physical goods.

    56 | The Concept of "Resource"
However, human beings are uniquely complicated resources, and
any Organizing System that uses them must take into account their
rights, motivations, and relationships. (See the sidebar, People as
Resources.)

The intellectual resources of a firm are embodied in a
firm's people, systems, management techniques, history
of strategy and design decisions, customer relationships,
and intellectual property like patents, copyrights,
trademarks, and brands. Some of this knowledge is
explicit, tangible, and traceable in the form of
documents, databases, organization charts, and policy
and procedure manuals. But much of it is tacit: informal
and not systematized in tangible form because it is held
in the minds and experiences of people; a synonym is
"know-how." A more modern term is Intellectual Capital,
a concept originated in a 1997 book with that title
(Stewart 1997).

                                                              The Concept of "Resource" | 57
4. The Concept of
"Collection"

A collection is a group of resources that have been selected for some
purpose. Similar terms are set (mathematics), aggregation (data
modeling), dataset (science and business), and corpus (linguistics
and literary analysis).

We prefer collection because it has fewer specialized meanings.
Collection is typically used to describe personal sets of physical
resources (my stamp or record album collection) as well as digital
ones (my collection of digital music). We distinguish law libraries
from software libraries, knowledge management systems from data
warehouses, and personal stamp collections from coin collections
primarily because they contain different kinds of resources.
Similarly, we distinguish document collections by resource type,
contrasting narrative document types like novels and biographies
with transactional ones like catalogs and invoices, with hybrid forms
like textbooks and encyclopedias in between.

A collection can contain identifiers for resources along with or
instead of the resources themselves, which enables a resource to be
part of more than one collection, like songs in playlists.

A collection itself is also a resource. Like other resources, a collection
can have description resources associated with it. An index is a
description resource that contains information about the locations
and frequencies of terms in a document collection to enable it to be
searched efficiently.

Because collections are an important and frequently used kind of
resource, it is important to distinguish them as a separate concept.
In particular, the concept of collection has deep roots in libraries,
museums and other institutions that select, assemble, arrange, and

58 | The Concept of "Collection"
maintain resources. Organizing Systems in these domains can often
be described as collections of collections that are variously
organized according to resource type, author, creator, or collector
of the resources in the collection, or any number of other principles
or properties. In business contexts, the use of "collection" to
describe a set of resources is much less common, but businesses
organize many types of resources, including their employees,
suppliers, customers, products, and the tangible and intangible
assets used to create the products and run the business. Indeed, a
business itself can sometimes be abstractly described as a collection
of resources, especially when the resources are software
components or services. (See endnote1.)

A type of resource and its conventional Organizing System are often
the focal point of a discipline. Category labels such as library,
museum, zoo, and data repository have core meanings and many
associated experiences and practices. Specialized concepts and
vocabularies often evolve to describe these. The richness that
follows from this complex social and cultural construction makes it
difficult to define category boundaries precisely.

Libraries can be defined as institutions that "select, collect,
organize, conserve, preserve, and provide access to information
on behalf of a community of users." Many Organizing Systems are
described as libraries, although they differ from traditional libraries
in important respects. (See the sidebar, What Is a Library?)

          What Is a Library?
          Most birds fly, but not all of them do. What

1. [link to footnote]

                       The Concept of "Collection" | 59
       characteristics are most important to us when we
       classify something as a bird? What characteristics are
       most important when we think of something as a
       library?

          We might treat circulation, borrowing and returning
       the same item, as one of the interactions with resources
       that defines a library. In that case, an institution that
       lends items in its collection with the hope that the
       borrowers return something else that is better hardly
       seems like a library. But if the resources are the seeds of
       heirloom plants and the borrowers are expected to
       return seeds from the plants they grew from the
       borrowed seeds, perhaps "seed library" is an apt name
       for this novel Organizing System. Similarly, even though
       the resources in its collection are encyclopedia articles
       rather than living species, the Wikipedia open-source
       encyclopedia resembles the Seed Library by
       encouraging its users to "return" articles that are
       improvements of the current ones.

          The photo-sharing website Flickr functions for most
       of its users as a personal photo archiving site. Flickr's
       billions of user-uploaded photos and the choice of many
       users to share them publicly transform it into a
       searchable shared collection, and many people also
       think of Flickr as a photo library. But Flickr lacks the
       authoritative description and standard classification
       that typify a library.

60 | The Concept of "Collection"
              A similar categorization challenge arises with the
           Google Books digitization project. 2

2. In 2004, Google began digitizing millions of books
   from several major research libraries with the goal of
   making them available through its search engine (Brin
   2009). But many millions of these books are still in
   copyright, and in 2005 Google was sued for copyright
   infringement by several publishers and an author's
   organization. In 2011 a US District Court judge rejected
   the proposed settlement the parties had negotiated in
   2008 because many others objected to it, including the
   US Justice Department, several foreign governments,
   and numerous individuals (Samuelson 2011).
      The major reason for the rejection was that the
   settlement was a "bridge too far" that went beyond the
   claims made against Google to address issues that were
   not in litigation. In particular, the judge objected to the
   treatment of the so-called "orphan works" that were still
   under copyright but out of print because money they
   generated went to the parties in the settlement and not
   to the rights holders who could not be located (why the
   books are "orphans") or to defray the costs of
   subscriptions to the digital book collection. The judge
   also was concerned that the settlement did not

                                                                 The Concept of "Collection" | 61
We can always create new categories by stretching the conventional
definitions of "library" or other familiar Organizing Systems and
adding modifiers, as when Flickr is described as a web-based photo-
sharing library. But whenever we define an Organizing System with
respect to a familiar category, the typical or mainstream instances
and characteristics of that category that are deeply embedded in

adequately address the concerns of academic
authors--who wrote most of the books scanned from
research libraries--who might prefer to make their
books freely available rather than seek to maximize
profits from them. Other concerns were that the
settlement would have entrenched Google's monopoly in
the search market and that there were inadequate
controls for protecting the privacy of readers.

   Google's plan would have dramatically increased
access to out of print books, and the rejection of the
proposed settlement has heightened calls for an open
public digital library (Darnton 2011). A good start toward
such a library was the digital copies that the research
libraries received in return for giving Google books to
scan, which were collected and organized by the Hathi
Trust (See the sidebar, The Hathi Trust Digital Library).
In 2010, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation provided funding
to launch the Digital Public Library of America(DPLA):
http://dp.la/. This non-proprietary goal might induce
the US Congress and other governments to pass
legislation that fixes the copyright problems for orphan
works.

language and culture are reinforced, and those that are atypical are
marginalized. In the Flickr case, this means we suggest features that
are not there (like authoritative classification) or omit the features
that are distinctive (like tagging by users).
More generally, a categorical view of Organizing Systems makes
it matter greatly which category is used to anchor definitions or
comparisons. The Google Books project makes out-of-print and
scholarly works vastly more accessible, but when Google co-
founder Sergei Brin described it as "a library to last forever" it
upset many people with a more traditional sense of what the library
category implies. We can readily identify design choices in Google
Books that are more characteristic of the Organizing Systems in
business domains, and the project might have been perceived more
favorably had it been described as an online bookstore that offered
many beneficial services for free.

5. The Concept of

"Intentional Arrangement"

Intentional arrangement emphasizes explicit or implicit acts of
organization by people, or by computational processes acting as
proxies for, or as implementations of, human intentionality.
Intentional arrangement is easiest to see in Organizing Systems
created by individual people who can make all the necessary
decisions about organizing their own resources. It is also easy to
see in Organizing Systems created by institutions like libraries,
museums, businesses, and governments where the responsibility
and authority to organize is centralized and explicit in policies, laws,
or regulations.

However, top-down intentionality is not always necessary to create
an Organizing system. Organization can emerge over time via
collective behavior in situations without central control when
decisions made by individuals, each acting intentionally, create
traces, records, or other information that accumulates over time.
Organizing systems that use bottom-up rather than top-down
mechanisms are sometimes called self-organizing, because they
emerge from the aggregated interactions of actors with resources
or with each other. Self-organizing systems can change their
internal structure or their function in response to feedback or
changed circumstances.

This definition is broad enough to include business and biological
ecosystems, traffic patterns, and open-source software projects.
Another good example of emergent organization involves path
systems, where people (as well as ants and other animals) can follow
and thereby reinforce the paths taken by their predecessors. When
highly orderly and optimal arrangements emerge from local
interactions among ants, bees, birds, fish, and other animal species,

64 | The Concept of "Intentional
Arrangement"
it is often called "swarm intelligence." When this happens with
human ratings for news stories, YouTube videos, restaurants, and
other types of digital and physical resources we call it
"crowdsourcing." What the animal and human situations have in
common is that information is being communicated between
individuals. Sometimes this communication is direct, as when
Amazon shows you the average rating for a book or what books have
been bought by people like you. At other times the communication
is indirect, achieved when the agents modify their environment (as
they do when they create paths) and others can respond to these
modifications. Adam Smith's "invisible hand" is another example
where individuals collectively generate an outcome they did not
directly intend but that arose from their separate self-interested
actions as they respond to price signals in the marketplace.
Likewise, even though there is no top-down organization, the web
as a whole, with its more than a trillion unique pages, is a self-

1. Self-organizing is also used to describe phenomena like
  climate, neural networks, and phase transitions and
  equilibrium states in physics and chemistry. But when
  systems involve collections of inanimate resources that
  are very large and open, with complex interactions
  among the resources, it seems less sensible to attribute
  intentional arrangement to the outcomes. The resource
  arrangements that emerge cannot always be interpreted
  as the result of intentional or deterministic principles
  and instead are more often described in probabilistic or
  statistical terms. And even though it involves animate
  resources, Charles Darwin's "natural selection" in
  evolutionary biology is a self-organizing mechanism
  where intentionality is hard to pinpoint or absent
  entirely.

  The rules governing these local interactions can be
  simple and yet produce highly complex structures. For
  example, in flocks of birds or schools of fish the rules are:
  (1) follow things like you, (2) do not bump into each other,
  but stay close, and (3) move in the same direction as the
  rest of the group. With just these three rules computer
  models can create complex three-dimensional
  arrangements that can make abrupt changes in shape
  and density while moving rapidly, just as live things do.

   The term "Crowdsourcing" was invented by Jeff Howe in
   a June 2006 article in Wired magazine, and the concept
   was developed further in a book published two years
   later (Howe 2006, 2008). "Folksonomy" was coined by
   Thomas Van der Wal at about the same time in 2004; see

   organizing phenomena in animal swarms and human
   crowds in terms of information exchange among
   individuals.

    68 | The Concept of "Intentional Arrangement"
              The Web as an Organizing System
              Today's web barely resembles the system for
           distributing scientific and technical reports it was
           designed to be when physicist and computer scientist
           Tim Berners-Lee devised it in 1990 at the European
           Organization for Nuclear Research(CERN) lab near
           Geneva. However, as an Organizing System the web still
           follows the principles that Berners-Lee defined at its
           creation. These include standard data formats and
           interaction protocols; no need for centralized control of
           page creation or linking; remote access over the
           network from anywhere; and the ability to run on a
           large variety of computers and operating systems. This
           architecture makes the web open and extensible, but
           gives it no built-in mechanisms for authority or trust.4

   constructed from heterogeneous blocks of content that
   could have been organized as separate pages.
4. The "plain web" (Wilde 2008a), whose evolution is
   managed by the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C), is
   rigorously standardized, but unfortunately the larger
   ecosystem of technologies and formats in which the web
   exists is becoming less so. Web-based Organizing
   Systems often contain proprietary media formats and
   players (like Flash) or are implemented as closed
   environments that are intentionally isolated from the

                                            The Concept of "Intentional Arrangement" | 69
          Because the web works without any central authority
       or authorship control, any person or organization can
       add to it. As a result, even though the web as a whole
       does not exhibit the centralized intentional
       arrangement of resources that characterizes many
       Organizing Systems, we can view it as consisting of
       millions of Organizing Systems that each embody a
       separate intentional arrangement of web pages. In
       addition, we most often interact with the web indirectly
       by using a search engine, which meets the definition of
       Organizing System because its indexing and retrieval
       algorithms are principled.

          A great many Organizing Systems are implemented as
       collections of web pages. Some of these collections are
       created on the web as new pages, some are created by
       transforming existing collections of resources, and some
       combine new and existing resources.

The requirement for intentional arrangement excludes naturally
occurring patterns created by physical or geological processes from
being thought of as Organizing Systems. There is information in
the piles of debris left after a tornado or tsunami and the strata of
the Grand Canyon. But they are not Organizing Systems because
the patterns of arrangement were created by deterministic natural
forces rather than by agents following one or more organizing
principles. On the other hand, collections of geological data like the
measurements of chemical composition from different strata and

rest of the web (like Facebook or Apple's iTunes and
other smart phone "app stores").

70 | The Concept of "Intentional Arrangement"
locations in the Grand Canyon are Organizing Systems. Decisions
about what to measure, how to combine and analyze the
measurements, and any theories that are tested or created, reflect
intentional arrangement of the data by the geologist.
Other patterns of resource arrangements are illusions or
perceptions that require a particular vantage point. The best
examples are patterns of stars as they appear to an observer on
Earth. The three precisely aligned stars, often described as "Orion's
belt," are hundreds of light years from Earth, and also from each
other. The perceived arrangement of the stars is undeniable, but the
stars are not aligned in the universe. Astronomical constellations
like Orion are intentional arrangements imposed on our perceived
locations of the stars, and these perceived arrangements and the
explanations for them that constellations provide, form an
Organizing System that is deeply embedded in human culture and
in the practice of celestial navigation over the seas.

          Not an Intentional Arrangement

          The composition and arrangement of the rock layers
       ("strata") in the Grand Canyon in the Southwest United
       States have been studied extensively by geologists. The
       composition of rock suggests the environment in which
       it was formed, and the absolute and relative
       arrangement of the rock layers reveals the timing of
       important geological events.

Taken together, the intentional arrangements of resources in an
Organizing System are the result of decisions about what is
organized, why it is organized, how much it is organized, when it
is organized, and how or by whom it is organized (each of these
will be discussed in greater detail in Design Decisions in Organizing
Systems). An Organizing System is defined by the composite impact
of the choices made on these design dimensions. Because these
questions are interrelated their answers come together in an
integrated way to define an Organizing System.

72 | The Concept of "Intentional Arrangement"
6. The Concept of
"Organizing Principle"

The arrangements of resources in an Organizing System follow or
embody one or more organizing principles that enable the
Organizing System to achieve its purposes. Organizing principles
are directives for the design or arrangement of a collection of
resources that are ideally expressed in a way that does not assume
any particular implementation or realization. We call this design
philosophy "Architectural Thinking" ("Architectural Thinking".)

          Organizing Spices By Cuisine

          An alternative to organizing spices alphabetically is to
       organize them according to cuisines or flavor profiles,

                                                                   The Concept of "Organizing
                                                                                      Principle" | 73
       which can be defined in terms of ingredients and spices
       that tend to be used together. Patricia Glushko
       organizes her spices into three groups: Indian (includes
       cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, turmeric),
       Mediterranean / Middle Eastern (includes basil, dill,
       oregano, paprika, thyme), and seeds. Each group of
       spices is in a separate large container, which makes it
       convenient when cooking.

          (Photo by R. Glushko.)

When we organize a bookshelf, home office, kitchen, or the MP3
files on our music player, the resources themselves might be new
and modern but many of the principles that govern their
organization are those that have influenced the design of
Organizing Systems for thousands of years. For example, we
organize many collections of resources using the properties that are
easiest to perceive, or whose values vary the most among the items
in the collection, because these principles make it easy to locate a
particular resource. We also group together resources that we often
use together, we make resources that we use often more accessible
than those we use infrequently, and we put rare or unique resources
where we can protect them. Very general and abstract organizing
principles are sometimes called design heuristics (e.g., "make things
easier to find"). More specific and commonly used organizing
principles include alphabetical ordering (arranging resources
according to their names) and chronological ordering (arranging
resources according to the date of their creation or other important
event in the lifetime of the resource). Some organizing principles
sort resources into pre-defined categories and other organizing
principles rely on novel combinations of resource properties to
create new categories.

74 | The Concept of "Organizing Principle"
   Because this book was motivated by the goal of broadening the
   study of information organization beyond its roots in library and
   information science, it emphasizes organizing principles with a
   specific functional purpose like identifying, selecting, retrieving, or
   preserving resources. However, for thousands of years people have
   systematically collected things, information about those things, and
   observations of all kinds, organizing them in an effort to understand
   how their world works; the Babylonians created inventories and
   star charts; ancient Egyptians tracked the annual Nile floods; and,
   Mesoamericans created astronomical calendars. The term
   sensemaking is often used to describe this generic and less specific
   purpose of organizing to derive meaning from experience by fitting
   new events or observations into what they already know.1

   Expressing organizing principles in a way that separates design and
   implementation aligns well with the three-tier architecture familiar
   to software architects and designers: user interface
   (implementation of interactions), business logic (intentional
   arrangement), and data (resources). (See the sidebar, The Three
   Tiers of Organizing Systems.)

   The logical separation between organizing principles and their
   implementation is easy to see with digital resources. In a digital
   library it does not matter to a user if the resources are stored locally
   or retrieved over a network. The essence of a library Organizing
   System emerges from the resources that it organizes and the
   interactions with the resources that it enables. Users typically care
   a lot about the interactions they can perform, like the kinds of
   searching and sorting allowed by the online library catalog. How the
   resources and interactions are implemented are typically of little
   concern.

1. (Weick et al , 2005 p. 410).

                                                  The Concept of "Organizing Principle" | 75
The separation of organizing principles and their implementation
is harder to recognize in an Organizing System that only contains
physical resources, such as your kitchen or clothes closet, where
you appear to have unmediated interactions with resources rather
than accessing them through some kind of user interface or
"presentation tier" that supports the principles specified in the
"middle tier" and realized in the "storage tier." As a result, people
can easily get distracted by presentation-tier concerns. Too often
we waste time color-coding file folders and putting labels on
storage containers, when it would have better to think more
carefully about the logical organization of the folder and container
contents. It does not help to use colors and labels to make the
logical organization more salient if that is not well designed first.

One place where you can easily appreciate these different tiers
for physical resources is in the organization of spices in a kitchen.
Different kitchens might all embody an alphabetic order organizing
principle for arranging a collection of spices, but the exact locations
and arrangement of the spices in any particular kitchen depends
on the configuration of shelves and drawers, whether a spice rack
or rotating tray is used, and other storage-tier considerations.
Similarly, spices could be logically organized by cuisine, with Indian
spices separated from Mexican spices, but this organizing principle
does not imply anything about where they can be found in the
kitchen.

          The Three Tiers of Organizing Systems
          Software architects and designers agree that it is
       desirable to build applications that separate the storage
       of data, the business logic or functions that use the data,
       and the user interface or presentation components
       through which users or other applications interact with

76 | The Concept of "Organizing Principle"
       the data. This modular architecture allows each of the
       three tiers to be upgraded or reimplemented
       independently to satisfy changed requirements or to
       take advantage of new technologies. An analogous
       distinction is that between an algorithm as a logical
       description of a method for solving a computational
       problem and its implementation in a particular
       programming language like Java or Python.

          These architectural distinctions are equally important
       to librarians and information scientists. Our new way of
       looking at Organizing Systems emphasizes the
       importance of identifying the desired interactions with
       resources, determining which organizing principles can
       enable the interactions, and then deciding how to store
       and manage the resources according to those
       principles. Applying architectural thinking to Organizing
       Systems makes it easier to compare and contrast
       existing ones and design new ones. Separating the
       organizing principles in the "middle tier" from their
       implications in the "data" and "presentation" tiers often
       makes it possible to implement the same logical
       Organizing System in different environments that
       support the same or equivalent interactions with the
       resources. For example, a new requirement to support
       searching through a library catalog on a smart phone
       would only affect the presentation tier.

Figure: Presentation, Logic and Storage Tiers. illustrates the
separation of the presentation, logic, and storage tiers for four
different types of library Organizing Systems and for Google Books.
No two of them are the same in every tier. Note how a library that

                                              The Concept of "Organizing Principle" | 77
uses inventory robots to manage the storage of books does not
reveal this in its higher tiers. (See the sidebar, Library Robot.)
Presentation, Logic and Storage Tiers

It is highly desirable when the design and implementation of an
Organizing System separates the storage of the resources from
the logic of their arrangement and the methods for interacting
with them. This three-tier architecture is familiar to designers of
computerized Organizing Systems but it is also useful to think about
78 | The Concept of "Organizing Principle"
   Organizing Systems in this way even when it involves physical
   resources.

   Because tangible things can only be in one place at a time, many
   Organizing Systems, like those in the modern library with online
   catalogs and physical collections, resolve this constraint by creating
   digital proxies or surrogates to organize their tangible resources, or
   create parallel digital resources (e.g., digitized books).2

   The implications for arranging, finding, using and reusing resources
   in any Organizing System directly reflect the mix of these two
   embodiments of information; in this way we can think of the
   modern library as a digital Organizing System that primarily relies
   on digital resources to organize a mixture of physical and digital
   ones.

   The Organizing System for a small collection can sometimes use
   only the minimal or default organizing principle of
   colocation--putting all the resources in the same location: in the
   same container, on the same shelf, or in the same email in-box. If
   you do not cook much and have only a small number of spices in
   your kitchen, you do not need to alphabetize them because it is easy
   to find the one you want.3

2. Instead of thinking of a digital book as a "parallel
   resource" to a printed book, we could consider both of
   them as alternate representations of the same abstract
   resource that are linked together by an "alternative"
   relationship, just as we can use the HTML ALT tag to
   associate text with an image so its content and function
   can be understood by text-only readers.

3. For collections of non-trivial size the choice of searching

          From Implementation

or sorting algorithm in computer programs is a critical
design decision because they differ greatly in the time
they take to complete and the storage space they require.
For example, if the collection is arranged in an
unorganized or random manner (as a "pile") and every
resource must be examined, the time to find a particular
item increases linearly with the collection size. If the
collection is maintained in an ordered manner, a binary
search algorithm can locate any item in a time
proportional to the logarithm of the number of items.
Analysis of algorithms is a fundamental topic in computer
science; a popular textbook is Introduction to Algorithms
by (Cormen et al. 2009).

80 | The Concept of "Organizing Principle"
          Whether spices are organized alphabetically by their
       names, by cuisines, by season, by frequency of use, or
       any other principle, this decision is logically distinct
       from the physical arrangement of the spices. There are
       many types of spice racks, shelves, circular "lazy
       susans," and other devices designed for arranging
       spices.

          (Photo collage created by R. Glushko from various web
       catalogs.)

Some organization emerges implicitly through a frequency of use
principle. In your kitchen or clothes closet, the resources you use
most often migrate to the front because that is the easiest place to
return them after using them. But as a collection grows in size, the
time to arrange, locate, and retrieve a particular resource becomes
more important. The collection must be explicitly organized to
make these interactions efficient, and the organization must be
preserved after the interaction takes place; i.e., resources are put
back in the place they were found. As a result, most Organizing
Systems employ organizing principles that make use of properties
of the resources being organized (e.g., name, color, shape, date of
creation, semantic or biological category), and multiple properties
are often used simultaneously. For example, in your kitchen you
might arrange your cooking pots and pans by size and shape so
you can nest them and store them compactly, but you might also
arrange things by cuisine or style and separate your grilling
equipment from the wok and other items you use for making
Chinese food.

Unlike those for physical resources, the most useful organizing
properties for information resources are those that reflect their

                                              The Concept of "Organizing Principle" | 81
content and meaning, and these are not directly apparent when
you look at a book, document, or collection of data. Significant
intellectual effort or statistical computation is necessary to reveal
these properties when assigning subject terms, creating an index, or
using them as input features for machine learning and data analysis
programs.
The most effective Organizing Systems for information resources
often are based on statistical properties that emerge from analyzing
the collection as a whole. For example, the relevance of documents
to a search query is higher when they contain a higher than average
frequency of the query terms compared to other documents in the
collection, or when they are linked to relevant documents. Likewise,
algorithms for classifying email messages continuously recalculate
the probability that words like "beneficiary" or "Viagra" indicate
whether a message is "spam" or "not spam" in the collection of
messages processed.

82 | The Concept of "Organizing Principle"
7. The Concept of "Agent"

Many disciplines have specialized job titles to distinguish among the
people who organize resources (for example: cataloger, archivist,
indexer, curator, collections manager...).1

We use the more general word, agent, for any entity capable of
autonomous and intentional organizing effort, because it treats
organizing work done by people and organizing work done by
computers as having common goals, despite obvious differences in
methods.

We can analyze agents in Organizing Systems to understand how
human and computational efforts to arrange resources complement
and substitute for each other. We can determine the economic,
social, and technological contexts in which each type of agent can
best be employed. We can determine how the Organizing System
allocates effort and costs among its creators, users, maintainers and
other stakeholders.

A group of people can be an organizing agent, as when a group of
people come together in a service club or standards body technical
committee in which the members of the group subordinate their
own individual agency to achieve a collective good.

We also use the term agent when we discuss interactions with

The Concept of "Agent" | 83
Organizing Systems. The entities that most typically access the
contents of libraries, museums, or other collections of physical
resources are human agents--that is, people. In other Organizing
Systems, such as business information systems or data repositories,
interactions with resources are carried out by computational
processes, robotic devices, or other entities that act autonomously
on behalf of a person or group.
In some Organizing Systems, the resources themselves are capable
of initiating interactions with other resources or with external
agents. This is most obvious with human or other living resources,
where a critical part of the design of any Organizing System with
them is determining what kinds of interactions they should be
encouraged or allowed to initiate. We will return to this issue after
we discuss the design of interactions with ordinary resources that
are passive, the situation in most Organizing Systems that involve
physical resources.
Other resources that can initiate interactions are resources
augmented with sensory, computational or communication
capabilities that enable them to obtain information from their
environment and then do something useful with it. You are probably
familiar with RFID tags, which enable the precise identification and
location of physical resources as they move through supply chains
and stores, and with "smart" devices like Nest thermostats that
learn how to program themselves.

84 | The Concept of "Agent"
 8. The Concept of
 "Interactions"

   An interaction is an action, function, service, or capability that
   makes use of the resources in a collection or the collection as a
   whole. The interaction of access is fundamental in any collection
   of resources, but many Organizing Systems provide additional
   functions to make access more efficient and to support additional
   interactions with the accessed resources. For example, libraries and
   similar Organizing Systems implement catalogs to enable
   interactions for finding a known resource, identifying any resource
   in the collection, and discriminating or selecting among similar
   resources.1

   Some of the interactions with resources in an Organizing System
   are inherently determined by the characteristics of the resource.
   Because many museum resources are unique or extremely valuable,
   visitors are allowed to view them but cannot borrow them, in
   contrast with most of the resources in libraries. A library might
   have multiple printed copies of Moby Dick but can never lend more

  proposed in 1997 by the International Federation of
  Library Associations and Institutions(IFLA). The first
  statement of the objectives for a bibliographic system
  was made by (Cutter 1876), which (Svenonius 2000) says it
  is likely the most cited text in the bibliographic literature.
  Cutter called his three objectives "finding," "co-locating,"
  and "choice."

   of them than it possesses. After a printed book is checked out
   from the library, there are many types of interactions that might
   take place--reading, translating, summarizing, annotating, and so
   on--but these are not directly supported by the library Organizing
   System and are invisible to it.

   For works not in the public domain, copyright law gives the
   copyright holder the right to prevent some uses, but at the same
   time "fair use" and similar copyright doctrines enable certain
   limited uses even for copyrighted works.2

   Digital resources enable a greater range of interactions than
   physical ones. Any number of people or processes can request a
   weather forecast from a web-based weather service because the
   forecast is not used up by the request and the marginal cost of
   allowing another access is nearly zero. Furthermore, with digital
   resources many new kinds of interactions can be enabled through
   application software, web services, or application program
   interfaces (APIs) in the Organizing System. In particular, translation,
   summarization, annotation, and keyword suggestion are highly
   useful services that are commonly supported by web search engines
   and other web applications. Similarly, an Organizing System with
   digital resources can implement a "keep everything up to date"
   interaction that automatically pushes current content to your
   browser.

2. Copyright law, license or contract agreements, terms of
   use and so on that shape interactions with resources are
   part of the Organizing System, but compliance with them
   might not be directly implemented as part of the system.
   With digital resources, digital rights management (DRM),
   passwords, and other security mechanisms can be built
   into the Organizing System to enforce compliance.

    86 | The Concept of "Interactions"
   But just as technology can enable interactions, it can prevent or
   constrain them. If your collection of digital resources (ebooks or
   music, for example) is not stored on your own computer or device,
   a continuous Internet connection is a requirement for access. In
   addition, access control policies and digital rights management
   (DRM) technology can limit the devices that can access the
   collection and prevent copying, annotation and other actions that
   might otherwise be enabled by the fair use doctrine.

   Interaction design is especially crucial for managing resources that
   have the capability to initiate interactions with each other or with
   external agents. Consider the vast differences in how workers
   behave in businesses organized according to principles of scientific
   management and those that embody the Kaizen principles of
   continuous improvement. In the former, work is highly standardized
   and bureaucratic, giving workers little autonomy. In the latter, work
   is also standardized, but workers are motivated to analyze and
   improve work processes whenever possible, and they are given
   great discretion in how to do that.3

3. Frederick Taylor developed "scientific management" to
   improve industrial efficiency and conducted detailed
   time and motion studies to devise what he thought were
   optimal ways to perform work tasks (Taylor 1914). The
   Kaizen principles of continuous improvement were
   introduced to Western audiences by Imai Masaaki and
   by numerous books about their application in the Toyota
   production system (Masaaki 1986).

   Scientific management views a business as a machine,
   while Kaizen principles treat it as a brain that learns.
   These metaphors for business organization are among

in an abstract or logical way that does not assume an
implementation because it can encourage innovative designs for

those described by (Morgan 1997) in a classic business
textbook. Other metaphors discussed include organisms,
cultures, political systems, and psychic prisons.

88 | The Concept of "Interactions"
9. The Concept of

"Interaction Resource"

Interactions with physical resources sometimes leave traces or
other evidence. Many of these traces are unintentional, like
fingerprints, a coffee cup stain on a newspaper, or the erosion
on a shortcut path across a lawn. Fans of Sherlock Holmes and
CSI know that clever forensic investigators can use these residues
of interactions to identify or vindicate suspects. Other interaction
traces are intentional, like a student's yellow highlighting or notes
in a textbook or spray-painted graffiti on a building. But not every
interaction leaves a trace, traces fade over time, and different traces
associated with the same resource lack consistency. This means
that most traces are not of much use.

However, when Organizing Systems contain digital resources, or
physical resources that have sensing, recording, or communication
capabilities, interaction traces can be made predictable, persistent,
and consistent. Each record of a user choice in accessing, browsing,
buying, highlighting, linking, and other interactions then becomes
an "interaction resource" that can be analyzed to reorganize the
resource collection or otherwise influence subsequent interactions
with the primary resources.

Interaction resources are often essential pieces of information that
make Organizing Systems function. Most human toll-takers have
been replaced by smart "toll tags" that broadcast their identity when
the car they are in passes a radio receiver at a tolling location. Each
interaction resource created identifies an account and credit card
with which to pay the toll; taken together, the collection of these
interaction resources can be used as the primary resources in other
Organizing Systems that manage traffic congestion, or that support
road design. Similarly, interaction resources created by search

                                                                   The Concept of "Interaction
                                                                                     Resource" | 89
engines can be used to adjust the order of search hits, select ads, or
personalize the content of web pages.

10. Organizing This Book

Devising concepts, methods, and technologies for describing and
organizing resources have been essential human activities for
millennia, evolving both in response to human needs and to enable
new ones. Organizing Systems enabled the development of
civilization, from agriculture and commerce to government and
warfare. Today Organizing Systems are embedded in every domain
of purposeful activity, including research, education, law, medicine,
business, science, institutional memory, sociocultural memory,
governance, public accountability, as well as in the ordinary acts of
daily living.

With the World Wide Web and ubiquitous digital information, along
with effectively unlimited processing, storage and communication
capability, millions of people create and browse websites, blog, tag,
tweet, and upload and download content of all media types without
thinking "I am organizing now" or "I am retrieving now." Writing
a book used to mean a long period of isolated work by an author
followed by the publishing of a completed artifact, but today some
books are continuously and iteratively written and published
through the online interactions of authors and readers. When
people use their smart phones to search the web or run
applications, location information transmitted from their phone is
used to filter and reorganize the information they retrieve.
Arranging results to make them fit the user's location is a kind
of computational curation, but because it takes place quickly and
automatically we hardly notice it.

Likewise, almost every application that once seemed predominantly
about information retrieval is now increasingly combined with
activities and functions that most would consider to be information
organization. Google, Microsoft, and other search engine operators
have deployed millions of computers to analyze billions of web

                                                                      Organizing This Book | 91
pages and millions of books and documents to enable the almost
instantaneous retrieval of published or archival information.
However, these firms increasingly augment this retrieval capability
with information services that organize information in close to real-
time. Further, the selection and presentation of search results,
advertisements, and other information can be tailored for the
person searching for information using his implicit or explicit
preferences, location, or other contextual information.

Taken together, these innovations in technology and its application
mean that the distinction between information organization and
information retrieval that is often manifested in academic
disciplines and curricula is much less important than it once was.

This book has few sharp divisions between information organization
(IO) and information retrieval (IR) topics. Instead, it explains the
key concepts and challenges in the design and deployment of
Organizing Systems in a way that continuously emphasizes the
relationships and tradeoffs between IO and IR. The concept of the
Organizing System highlights the design dimensions and decisions
that collectively determine the extent and nature of resource
organization and the capabilities of the processes that compare,
combine, transform and interact with the organized resources.

Navigating The Discipline of Organizing

Design Decisions in Organizing Systems

      This chapter introduces six broad design questions or
      dimensions whose intertwined answers define an Organizing
      System: What, why, how much, when, how, and where. This
      framework for describing and comparing Organizing Systems
      overcomes the biases and conservatism built into familiar
      categories like libraries and museums while enabling us to

92 | Organizing This Book
      describe them as design patterns. We can then use these
      patterns to support inter-disciplinary work that cuts across
      categories and applies knowledge about familiar domains to
      unfamiliar ones.

Activities in Organizing Systems

      Developing a view that brings together how we organize as
      individuals with how libraries, museums, governments,
      research institutions, and businesses create Organizing
      Systems requires that we generalize the organizing concepts
      and methods from these different domains. Activities in
      Organizing Systems surveys a wide variety of Organizing
      Systems and describes four activities or functions shared by all
      of them: selecting resources, organizing resources, designing
      resource-based interactions and services, and maintaining
      resources over time.

Resources in Organizing Systems

      The design of an Organizing System is strongly shaped by what
      is being organized, the first of the six design decisions we
      introduced earlier in "What Is Being Organized?". To enable a
      broad perspective on this fundamental issue we use resource
      to refer to anything being organized, an abstraction that we
      can apply to physical things, digital things, information about
      either of them, or web-based services or objects. Resources
      in Organizing Systems discusses the challenges and methods
      for identifying the resources in an Organizing System in great
      detail and emphasizes how these decisions reflect the goals
      and interactions that must be supported--the "why" design
      decisions introduced in "Why Is It Being Organized?".

Resource Description and Metadata

      The principles by which resources are organized and the kinds
      of services and interactions that can be supported for them

                                                                     Organizing This Book | 93
      largely depend on the nature and explicitness of the resource
      descriptions. This "how much description" design question was
      introduced in "How Much Is It Being Organized?"; Resource
      Description and Metadata presents a systematic process for
      creating effective descriptions and analyzes how this general
      approach can be adapted for different types of Organizing
      Systems.

Describing Relationships and Structures

      An important aspect of organizing a collection of resources
      is describing the relationships between them. Describing
      Relationships and Structures introduces the specialized
      vocabulary used to describe semantic relationships between
      resources and between the concepts and words used in
      resource descriptions. It also discusses the structural
      relationships within multipart resources and between
      resources, like those expressed as citations or hypertext links.

Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

      Groups or sets of resources with similar or identical
      descriptions can be treated as equivalent, making them
      members of an equivalence class or category. Identifying and
      using categories are essential human activities that take place
      automatically for perceptual categories like "red things" or
      "round things." Categorization is deeply ingrained in language
      and culture, and we use linguistic and cultural categories
      without realizing it, but categorization can also be a deeply
      analytic and cognitive process. Categorization: Describing
      Resource Classes and Types reviews theories of categorization
      from the point of view of how categories are created and used
      in Organizing Systems.

Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories

      The terms categorization and classification are often used

94 | Organizing This Book
      interchangeably but they are not the same. Classification is
      applied categorization--the assignment of resources to a
      system of categories, called classes, using a predetermined set
      of principles. Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories
      discusses the broad range of how classifications are used in
      Organizing Systems. These include enumerative classification,
      faceted classification, activity-based classification, and
      computational classification. Because classification and
      standardization are closely related, the chapter also analyzes
      standards and standards-making as they apply to Organizing
      Systems.

The Forms of Resource Descriptions

      The Forms of Resource Descriptions complements the
      conceptual and methodological perspective on the creation of
      resource descriptions with an implementation perspective. The
      Forms of Resource Descriptions reviews a range of metamodels
      for structuring descriptions, with particular emphasis on XML,
      JSON, and RDF. It concludes by comparing and contrasting
      three "worlds of description" --document processing, the web,
      and the Semantic Web--where each of these three metamodels
      is most appropriate.

Interactions with Resources

      When Organizing Systems overlap, intersect, or are combined
      (temporarily or permanently), differences in resource
      descriptions can make it difficult or impossible to locate
      resources, access them, or otherwise impair their use.
      Interactions with Resources reviews some of the great variety
      of concepts and techniques that different domains use when
      interacting with resources in Organizing Systems--integration,
      interoperability, data mapping, crosswalks, mash-ups, and so
      on. Interactions are characterized by the layers of resource
      properties they use: instance, collection-based, derived, or

                                                                     Organizing This Book | 95
      properties combined from different resources. Interactions
      with Resources extends the idea of an information
      organization--information retrieval continuum, and describes
      information retrieval interactions (and others) in terms of
      information organization (i.e., resource description)
      requirements.
The Organizing System Roadmap
      The Organizing System Roadmap complements the descriptive
      perspective of chapters 2-10 with a more prescriptive one that
      analyzes the design choices and tradeoffs that must be made in
      different phases in an Organizing System's life cycle. System life
      cycle models exhibit great variety, but we use a generic four-
      phase model that distinguishes a domain identification and
      scoping phase, a requirements phase, a design and
      implementation phase, and an operational phase.
Case Studies
      In Case Studies we use the model described in The Organizing
      System Roadmap to guide the analysis of studies that span the
      range of Organizing Systems, and make reference to the
      principles, guidelines, vocabulary, and models discussed in the
      preceding chapters.

DESIGN DECISIONS IN
ORGANIZING SYSTEMS

11. Introduction (II)

A set of resources is transformed by an organizing system when
the resources are described or arranged to enable interactions with
them. Explicitly or by default, this requires many interdependent
decisions about the identities of resources; their names,
descriptions and other properties; the classes, relations, structures
and collections in which they participate; and the people or
technologies interacting with them.

One important contribution of the idea of the organizing system is
that it moves beyond the debate about the definitions of "things,"
"documents," and "information," with the unifying concept of
"resource" while acknowledging that "what is being organized" is
just one of the questions or dimensions that need to be considered.
These decisions are deeply intertwined, but it is easier to introduce
them as if they were independent.

We introduce six groups of design questions, itemizing the most
important dimensions in each group:

  · What is being organized? What is the scope and scale of the
      domain? What is the mixture of physical things, digital things,
      and information about things in the organizing system? Is the
      organizing system being designed to create a new resource
      collection, catalog an existing and closed resource collection, or
      manage a collection in which resources are continually added
      or deleted? Are the resources unique, or are they
      interchangeable members of a category? Do they follow a
      predictable "life cycle" with a "useful life"? Does the organizing
      system use the interaction resources created through its use,
      or are these interaction resources extracted and aggregated for
      use by another organizing system? ("What Is Being Organized?")

  · Why is it being organized? What interactions or services will

                                                                             Introduction (II) | 99
      be supported, and for whom? Are the uses and users known
      or unknown? Are the users primarily people or computational
      processes? Does the organizing system need to satisfy personal,
      social, or institutional goals? ("Why Is It Being Organized?")

  · How much is it being organized? What is the extent,
      granularity, or explicitness of description, classification, or
      relational structure being imposed? What organizing principles
      guide the organization? Are all resources organized to the same
      degree, or is the organization sparse and non-uniform? ("How
      Much Is It Being Organized?")

  · When is it being organized? Is the organization imposed on
      resources when they are created, when they become part of the
      collection, when interactions occur with them, just in case, just
      in time, all the time? Is any of this organizing mandated by law
      or shaped by industry practices or cultural tradition? ("When Is
      It Being Organized?")

  · How or by whom, or by what computational processes, is
      it being organized? Is the organization being performed by
      individuals, by informal groups, by formal groups, by
      professionals, by automated methods? Are the organizers also
      the users? Are there rules or roles that govern the organizing
      activities of different individuals or groups? ("How (or by
      Whom) Is It Organized?")

  · Where is it being organized? Is the resource location
      constrained by design or by regulation? Are the resources
      positioned in a static location? Are the resources in transit or in
      motion? Does their location depend on other parameters, such
      as time? ("Where is it being Organized?")

How well these decisions coalesce in an organizing system depends
on the requirements and goals of its human and computational
users, and on understanding the constraints and tradeoffs that any

100 | Introduction (II)
set of requirements and goals impose. How and when these
constraints and tradeoffs are handled can depend on the legal,
business, and technological contexts in which the organizing
system is designed and deployed; on the relationship between the
designers and users of the organizing system (who may be the same
people or different ones); on the economic or emotional or societal
purpose of the organizing system; and on numerous other design,
deployment, and use factors.

Classifying organizing systems according to the kind of resources
they contain is the most obvious and traditional approach. We can
also classify organizing systems by their dominant purposes, by
their intended user community, or other ways. No single fixed set
of categories is sufficient by itself to capture the commonalities and
contrasts between organizing systems.

We can augment the categorical view of organizing systems by
thinking of them as existing in a multi-faceted or multi-dimensional
design space in which we can consider many types of collections at
the same time.

This framework for describing and comparing organizing systems
overcomes some of the biases and conservatism built into familiar
categories like libraries, museums, and archives, while enabling us
to describe them as design patterns that embody characteristic
configurations of design choices. We can then use these patterns
to support inter-disciplinary work that cuts across categories and
applies knowledge about familiar domains to unfamiliar ones. A
dimensional perspective makes it easier to translate between
category- and discipline-specific vocabularies so that people from
different disciplines can have mutually intelligible discussions about
their organizing activities. They might realize that they have much
in common, and they might be working on similar or even the same
problems.

A faceted or dimensional perspective acknowledges the diversity of
instances of collection types and provides a generative, forward-

                                                                            Introduction (II) | 101
   looking framework for describing hybrid types that do not cleanly
   fit into the familiar categories. Even though it might differ from the
   conventional categories on some dimensions, an organizing system
   can be designed and understood by its family resemblance on the
   basis of its similarities on other dimensions to a familiar type of
   resource collection.
   Thinking of organizing systems as points or regions in a design
   space makes it easier to invent new or more specialized types of
   collections and their associated interactions. If we think
   metaphorically of this design space as a map of organizing systems,
   the empty regions or "white space" between the densely-populated
   centers of the traditional categories represent organizing systems
   that do not yet exist. We can consider the properties of an
   organizing system that could occupy that white space and analyze
   the technology, process, or policy innovations that might be
   required to let us build it there. We can reason by analogy to identify
   and apply the principles used in one organizing system to
   understand or design others. 1

1. Depending on which characteristics of Google Books and
  libraries you think about, you might complete this
  analogy with an animal theme park like Sea World
  (http://www.seaworld.com/) or a private hunting reserve
  that creates personalized "big game" hunts. Or maybe
  you can invent something completely new.

   102 | Introduction (II)
12. What Is Being Organized?

               "What is difficult to identify is difficult to describe
               and therefore difficult to organize."
               (Svenonius 2000, p. 13)

Before we can begin to organize any resource we often need to
identify it. It might seem straightforward to devise an organizing
system around tangible resources, but we must be careful not to
assume what a resource is. In different situations, the same "thing"
can be treated as a unique item, one of many equivalent members
of a broad category, or a component of an item rather than as an
item on its own. For example, in a museum collection, a handmade,
carved chess piece might be a separately identified item, identified
as part of a set of carved chess pieces, or treated as one of the
33 unidentified components of an item identified as a chess set
(including the board). When merchants assign a stock-keeping unit
(SKU) to identify the things they sell, that SKU can be associated
with a unique item, sets of items treated as equivalent for inventory
or billing purposes, or intangible things like warranties.

You probably do not have explicit labels on the cabinets and drawers
in your kitchen or clothes closet, but department stores and
warehouses have signs in the aisles and on the shelves because
of the larger number of things a store needs to organize. As a
collection of resources grows, it often becomes necessary to
identify each one explicitly; to create surrogates like bibliographic
records or descriptions that distinguish one resource from another;
and to create additional organizational mechanisms like shelf labels,
store directories, library card catalogs and indexes that facilitate
understanding the collection and locating the resources it contains.
These organizational mechanisms often suggest or parallel the
organizing principles used to organize the collection itself.

Organization mechanisms like aisle signs, store directories and

                                                              What Is Being Organized? | 103
   library card catalogs are embedded in the same physical
   environment as the resources being organized. But when these
   mechanisms or surrogates are digitized, the new capabilities that
   they enable create design challenges. This is because a digital
   organizing system can be designed and operated according to more
   abstract and less constraining principles than an organizing system
   that only contains physical resources. A single physical resource
   can only be in one place at a time, and interactions with it are
   constrained by its size, location, and other properties. In contrast,
   digital copies and surrogates can exist in many places at once and
   enable searching, sorting, and other interactions with an efficiency
   and scale impossible for tangible things.

   When the resources being organized consist of information content,
   deciding on the unit of organization is challenging because it might
   be necessary to look beyond physical properties and consider
   conceptual or intellectual equivalence. A high school student told
   to study Shakespeare's play Macbeth might treat any printed copy
   or web version as equivalent, and might even try to outwit the
   teacher by watching a film adaptation of the play. To the student,
   all versions of Macbeth seem to be the same resource, but librarians
   and scholars make much finer distinctions.1

1. Organizing systems that follow the rules set forth in the
  Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records(FRBR)
  (Tillett 2005) treat all instances of Macbeth as the same
  "work." However, they also enforce a hierarchical set of
  distinctions for finer-grained organization. FRBR views
  books and movies as different "expressions," different
  print editions as "manifestations," and each distinct
  physical thing in a collection as an "item." This organizing
  system thus encodes the degree of intellectual

   104 | What Is Being Organized?
   Archival organizing systems implement a distinctive answer to the
   question of what is being organized. Archives are a type of collection
   that focuses on resources created by a particular person,
   organization, or institution, often during a particular time period.
   This means that archives have themselves been previously
   organized as a result of the processes that created and used them.
   The "original order" of the resources in an archive embodies the
   implicit or explicit organizing system of the person or entity that
   created the documents; it is treated as an essential part of the
   meaning of the collection. As a result, the unit of organization for
   archival collections is the fonds--the original arrangement or
   grouping, preserving any hierarchy of boxes, folders, envelopes,
   and individual documents--and thus they are not re-organized
   according to other (perhaps more systematic) classifications.2

   equivalence while enabling separate identities where the
   physical form is important, which is often the case for
   scholars.

2. Typical examples of archives might be national or
   government document collections or the specialized Julia
   Morgan archive at the University of California, Berkeley
   (http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/
   tf7b69n9k9/), which houses documents by the famous
   architect who designed many of the university's most
   notable buildings as well as the famous Hearst Castle
   along the central California coast. The "original order"
   organizing principle of archival organizing systems was
   first defined by 19th-century French archivists and is
   often described as "respect pour les fonds."

                                                                  What Is Being Organized? | 105
Some organizing systems contain legal, business or scientific
documents or data that are the digital descendants of paper reports
or records of transactions or observations. These organizing
systems might need to deal with legacy information that still exists
in paper form or in electronic formats like image scans that are
different from the structural digital format in which more recent
information is likely to be preserved. When legacy conversions from
printed information artifacts are complete or unnecessary, an
organizing system no longer deals with any of the traditional
tangible artifacts. Digital libraries dispense with these artifacts,
replacing them with the capability to print copies if needed. This
enables libraries of digital documents or data collections to be vastly
larger and more accessible across space and time than any library
that stores tangible, physical items could ever be.

An increasing number of organizing systems handle resources that
are born digital. Ideally, digital texts can be encoded with explicit
markup that captures structural boundaries and content
distinctions, which can be used to facilitate organization, retrieval,
or both. In practice the digital representations of texts are often just
image scans that do not support much processing or interaction.

The William Ashburner collection of historical photos
from an 1867-1869 surveying expedition in the Western
United States is kept in the University of California,
Berkeley's Bancroft Library in the order in which
Ashburner, a member of the survey party, had arranged
it when he donated it to the library decades later. The
arrangement roughly follows a chronological and
geographical progression, with some photos obviously
out of order and some whose locations cannot be
determined.

A similar situation exists for the digital representations of music,
photographs, videos, and other non-text content like sensor data,
where the digital formats are structurally and semantically opaque.

          Computational Descriptions of People
          Each of us is associated with a great many
       computational descriptions, some of which are used
       almost every day to make predictions about our
       behavior using a variety of statistical techniques that are
       collectively called "predictive analytics." Whenever you
       use a credit card, fraud detection algorithms use a
       model derived from your purchase history to decide, in
       fractions of a second, whether the transaction is being
       initiated by you, or by someone who has stolen your
       card. When you want to buy something expensive on
       credit, the seller consults your credit score--based on
       what you owe, your payment history, how long you have
       had credit, the kinds of credit you have, and other
       factors--to predict whether you are a good credit risk,
       and your credit score then gets adjusted if the seller
       decides to give you credit. Then, after you have bought
       that expensive item, the seller's predictive model can
       use that information to suggest other things you might
       want to buy.

          Philosophers have long debated the extent to which
       observations of a person's behavior can yield an
       understanding of their true and unobservable nature.
       But whether or not computational descriptions capture
       a person's essence, there is no escaping them. If you
       want to get life or car insurance or a mortgage, models
       determine what you have to pay. Predictive models are
       being used to admit people to college, to hire them, to

                                                              What Is Being Organized? | 107
       draft or trade them in professional sports, and to decide
       whether to monitor them closely because they might be
       planning a terrorist act. Some companies use "people
       analytics" software that analyzes every email, calendar
       item, and document created by employees to build a
       model of what they know, what they do, when they do it,
       and who they work with--the goal being to improve
       communication and collaboration within the firm and
       with customers.

This book does not emphasize systems that organize people, but
it would be remiss not to mention them. Businesses organize their
employees, schools organize their faculties and students, sports
leagues and teams organize their players, and governments
organize their citizens and residents to enable them to vote, drive,
attend schools, and receive medical care and ancillary benefits.

  Data scientists in all of these fields increasingly predict how
employees, students, athletes, voters, drivers - and other categories
of people defined by intrinsic or derived characteristics - will
behave, decide, live, or die. Once people die, it is no longer
necessary to predict anything about them, but nonetheless
cemeteries are highly organized.

We often think and talk about time as a resource, and time fits the
definition of "anything of value that supports goal-oriented activity"
from "The Concept of "Resource"". Furthermore, we could think
of the calendar and clock as organizing systems that define time
at different levels of granularity to support different kinds of
interactions. However, it is probably more useful to think of time as
a constraint that influences how and how much to organize.

If you're sorting your own mail, you can question whether the time
you spend on sorting is worth the time you save on searching. But at

108 | What Is Being Organized?
scale--imagine 10 million books in a library--the considerable effort
required to organize resources saves vastly more time for the many
users of the system over its lifetime. Note the inherent tradeoff
between time spent on organizing versus retrieval; this will be a
recurring theme throughout this book. In a personal context the
tradeoff is a matter of individual need or preference, but in social or
institutional contexts organization and retrieval are generally done
by different people, and their time is likely valued in different ways
by the system owner.

 13. Why Is It Being
 Organized?

                  "The central purpose of systems for organizing
                  information [is] bringing like things together and
                  differentiating among them."
                  (Svenonius 2000 p. xi)

   Almost by definition, the essential purpose of any organizing system
   is to describe or arrange resources so they can be located and
   accessed later. The organizing principles needed to achieve this goal
   depend on the types of resources or domains being organized, and
   in the personal, social, or institutional setting in which organization
   takes place.

   Organizing systems can be distinguished by their dominant
   purposes or the priority of their common purposes. Libraries,
   museums, and archives are often classified as memory institutions
   to emphasize their primary emphasis on resource preservation. In
   contrast, "management information systems" or "business systems"
   are categories that include the great variety of software applications
   that implement the organizing systems needed to carry out day-to-
   day business operations.

   "Bringing like things together" is an informal organizing principle
   for many organizing systems. Almost as soon as libraries were
   invented over two thousand years ago, the earliest librarians saw
   the need to develop systematic methods for arranging and
   inventorying their collections.1 The invention of mechanized

   110 | Why Is It Being Organized?
printing in the fifteenth century, which radically increased the
number of books and periodicals, forced libraries to begin
progressively more refined efforts to state the functional
requirements for their organizing systems and to be explicit about
how they met those requirements.

Today, any information-driven enterprise must have systematic
processes and technologies in place that govern information
creation or capture and then manage its entire life cycle.
Commercial firms need processes for transacting with customers or
other firms to carry out business operations, to support research
and innovation, marketing, and to develop business strategy and
tactics in compliance with laws and regulations for accounting,
taxes, human resources, data retention, and so on. In large firms
these functions are so highly specialized and complex that the
different types of organizing systems have distinct names:
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Enterprise Content Management
(ECM), Enterprise Data Management (EDM) Supply Chain
Management (SCM), Records Management, Customer Relationship
Management (CRM), Business Intelligence (BI), Knowledge
Management (KM), and so on. And even though the most important
functions in the organizing systems of large enterprises are those
that manage the information resources needed for its business
operation, these firms might also need to maintain corporate
libraries and archives.

Preserving documents in their physical or original form is the
primary purpose of archives and similar organizing systems that
contain culturally, historically, or economically significant
documents that have value as long-term evidence. Preservation is
also an important motivation for the organizing systems of
information- and knowledge-intensive firms, where information is
primarily in digital formats. Businesses and governmental agencies
are usually required by law to keep records of financial transactions,
decision-making, personnel matters, and other information
essential to business continuity, compliance with regulations and

                                                             Why Is It Being Organized? | 111
legal procedures, and transparency. As with archives, it is
sometimes critical that these business knowledge or records
management systems can retrieve the original documents, although
digital copies that can be authenticated are increasingly being
accepted as legally equivalent.

This discussion of the requirements for organizing resources in
memory institutions and businesses might convey the impression
that storing and retrieving resources efficiently are paramount
goals, and indeed they are in many contexts. But there are many
other reasons for organizing resources, as is easily seen when we
look at personal organizing systems. And there are many other ways
to compare organizing systems than just how efficiently they enable
storing and retrieval functions.

An overarching goal when people are organizing their personal
resources is to minimize the effort needed to find the resources.
But unlike the finding task in institutional organizing systems, which
is generally facilitated with external resource descriptions, finding
aids, classifications, search engines, and orientation and navigation
mechanisms, the finding task in personal organizing systems is
primarily a cognitive one: you need to remember where the
resources are and how they are arranged. Because each person
has unique experiences and preferences, it is not surprising that
people often organize the same types of resources in different ways
to make the organization easier to perceive and remember. The
resulting resource arrangements often emphasize aesthetic or
emotional goals, as when books or clothes are arranged by color
or preference, or behavioral goals, as when most frequently used
condiments and spices are kept on the kitchen counter rather than
stored in a pantry.

When individuals manage their papers, books, documents, record
albums, compact discs, DVDs, and other information resources,
their organizing systems can vary greatly. This is in part because the
content of the resources being organized becomes a consideration.

112 | Why Is It Being Organized?
   Furthermore, many of the organizing systems used by individuals
   are implemented by web applications, and this makes them more
   accessible than physical resources.2

   Put another way, an information resource inherently has more
   potential uses than resources like forks or frying pans, so it is not
   surprising that the organizing systems in offices are even more
   diverse than those in kitchens.

   When the scale of the collection or the number of intended users
   increases, two things can happen. The first is that if the system
   can turn its interaction traces into interaction resources, additional
   value can be created by analyzing these resources to enhance the
   interactions, to suggest new ones, or make predictions about how
   individual users or groups of them will behave. Every business that

2. For example, many people manage their digital photos
   with Flickr, their home libraries with Library Thing, and
   their preferences for dining and shopping with Yelp. It is
   possible to use these "tagging" sites solely in support of
   individual goals, as tags like "my family," "to read," or "buy
   this" clearly demonstrate. But maintaining a personal
   organizing system with these web applications
   potentially augments the individual's purpose with social
   goals like conveying information to others, developing
   a community, or promoting a reputation. Furthermore,
   because these community or collaborative applications
   aggregate and share the tags applied by individuals, they
   shape the individual organizing systems embedded
   within them when they suggest the most frequent tags
   for a particular resource.

                                                                 Why Is It Being Organized? | 113
   has a high volume of customer transactions does this; for example,
   a fast-food restaurant would analyze time-stamped sales data, and
   might introduce a quick pickup line for items that sell the most, or
   create product bundles that increase sales while optimizing kitchen
   and counter work. Amazon.com and other retailers that can capture
   detailed browsing traces can augment the sales data they collect by
   treating items that were looked at but not purchased as potential
   transactions, making them additional inputs to their sophisticated
   pricing and recommendation systems.

   A second likely outcome of increased scale or use is that not
   everyone is likely to share the same goals and design preferences for
   the organizing system. If you share a kitchen with housemates, you
   might have to negotiate and compromise on some of the decisions
   about how the kitchen is organized so you can all get along. In
   more formal or institutional organizing systems conflicts between
   stakeholders can be much more severe, and the organizing
   principles and policies or permissions for the kinds of interactions
   available to different users might even be specified in commercial
   contracts or governed by laws or standards. For example, Bowker
   and Star note that physicians view the creation of patient records
   as central to diagnosis and treatment, insurance companies think
   of them as evidence needed for payment and reimbursement, and
   researchers think of them as primary data. These groups do not
   agree on the priority and quality requirements they assign to
   different information in the patient record, and physicians
   understandably resist doing work that has no direct benefit for
   them. Not surprisingly, policy making and regulations about patient
   records are highly contentious.3

   Once we acknowledge that stakeholders might not share the same

    114 | Why Is It Being Organized?
goals, it is clear that efficiency is too narrow a measure for
evaluating organizing systems. The ways that resources are
organized and interacted with embody the priorities and values of
those designing the organizing system, yielding arrangements and
interactions designed to control or change the behaviors of the
users. Put more bluntly, resources are always organized in ways that
are designed to allocate value for some people (e.g., the owners
of the resources, or the most frequent users of them) and not for
others. From the perspective of the other types of user trying to
interact with the system, this organization will likely seem unfair. In
this way, organizing resources can often be seen as creating winners
and losers, providing benefits to the former and imposing costs
or constraints on the latter. For example, search engines analyze
interaction resources to adjust search results and choose an ad
that is related to your latest query. These are considered improved
interactions from the perspective of the search engine, but you
might consider it a violation of your privacy and a bit creepy to have
the targeted ad follow you around the web until you click on it.

The emerging field of applied behavioral economics, popularized in
books like Freakonomics and Nudge, explains how subtle differences
in resource arrangement, the number and framing of choices, and
default values can have substantial effects on the decisions people
make. Consider the arrangement of salads, pasta dishes, bread, fish,
meat, desserts and other types of food in a self-serve cafeteria
buffet. In a school setting, the food might be organized and
presented to encourage healthier eating, perhaps by making the
fatty french fries and high-calorie desserts hard to reach or by
providing smaller trays and plates. The same foods would likely be
organized differently in an all-you-can-eat restaurant, where the
goal is to minimize food costs, with less expensive items like salads
at the front of the line to ensure that trays and plates will already be

                                                             Why Is It Being Organized? | 115
   full when the customer gets to the more expensive items at the end
   of the line.4

   The organization of cafeteria buffets to shape user behavior might
   not seem sinister. However, organizing systems can control
   behavior in ways that create or perpetuate inequities among their
   users. This unfairness is a matter of degree: a person who does
   not own a computer who goes to the public library to check out
   a popular book loses out when the library enables patrons with
   computer access to check out books online and assumes that
   everyone has an equal shot at accessing books via the Internet.

   Looking to a much more insidious organizing system, when the
   South African government adopted Apartheid policies to classify
   and segregate people by race, it systematized economic and
   political discrimination and great suffering for the nonwhite
   population. (See the sidebar, Power and Politics in Organizing.)

              Power and Politics in Organizing
              It is tempting to think of organizing systems and the
           technologies used to implement them as neutral or
           objective in their goals and impacts, but it is impossible
           to argue that the use of racial classification in apartheid
           South Africa was not a conscious manifestation of
           prejudice. And even if making it hard for school kids to
           find the junk food in the cafeteria buffet has health
           benefits, it nevertheless reflects a paternalistic point of
           view that restricts individual choices.

    116 | Why Is It Being Organized?
   Organizing systems and technology are not developed
in a vacuum, unencumbered by politics or social
context. As Langdon Winner underscores in Do Artifacts
Have Politics?, systems and technologies can be
conscious manifestations of the personal (and often
political) biases of their creators. Because all people
have different experiences and biases, even when they
are not conscious of them they influence the design and
implementation of organizing systems in ways that can
create or perpetuate inequalities.5

   Technology innovators whose expressed goals are to
make something faster, smaller, or cheaper are ignoring
the potential for their innovations and automation to
render certain types of work less viable and discriminate
against people who lack the technology or skills to use
it. For example, Winner describes the inadvertent social
and political consequences of the introduction of
mechanical tomato harvesters in California agriculture
in the 1960s. Their industry-wide adoption favored
larger farms with more resources to buy the expensive
machines, resulting in the disappearance of small
tomato farms and large-scale changes to many rural
communities whose economies had relied on them.

   Some may argue that the mechanical tomato
harvester created massive benefits by increasing
productivity, but the determination that more efficient
tomato production is worth its consequences could be

       debated. In any case, the debate cannot be answered
       with a definite yes or no, just as it cannot be with
       whether the Internet is bad because it has eroded the
       need for librarians, or whether Uber`s clever
       technologies for matching drivers and riders unfairly
       avoid the regulations imposed on the taxi industry.
       Affirming the introduction of the mechanical tomato
       harvester, search engines, and Uber in the name of
       productivity, progress, and efficiency is a political point
       of view.

14. How Much Is It Being
Organized?

               "It is a general bibliographic truth that not all
               documents should be accorded the same degree of
               organization."
               (Svenonius 2000, p. 24)

Not all resources should be accorded the same degree of
organization. In this section we will briefly unpack this notion of
degree of organization into three important and related dimensions:
the amount of description detail or organization applied to each
resource, the amount of organization of resources into classes or
categories, and the overall extent to which interactions in and
between organizing systems are shaped by resource description
and arrangement.

It is important to note that this section is not asking the question
"how much stuff is being organized?" but rather to what degree is
the stuff being organized. Another way to ask the same question
is "how many organizing principles are at work?" in this organizing
system. Your closet might be arranged only by body part covered
and season; an online music store will organize resources by genre,
artist name, band name, album name, popularity, date released,
and maybe others. So we would say that the online music store
is organized much more than the closet, because more organizing
principles are at work.

(Resource Description and Metadata and Categorization: Describing
Resource Classes and Types, more thoroughly address these
questions about the nature and extent of description in organizing
systems.)

Not all resources in a collection require the same degree of

                                                                            How Much Is It Being
                                                                                   Organized? | 119
description for the simple reason we discussed in "Why Is It Being
Organized?": Organizing systems exist for different purposes and to
support different kinds of interactions or functions. Let us contrast
two ends of the "degree of description" continuum. Many people
use "current events awareness" or "news feed" applications that
select news stories whose titles or abstracts contain one or more
keywords (Google Alert is a good example). This exact match
algorithm is easy to implement, but its all-or-none and one-item-
at-a-time comparison misses any stories that use synonyms of the
keyword, that are written in languages different from that of the
keyword, or that are otherwise relevant but do not contain the
exact keyword in the limited part of the document that is scanned.
However, users with current events awareness goals do not need
to see every news story about some event, and this limited amount
of description for each story and the simple method of comparing
descriptions are sufficient.

On the other hand, this simple organizing system is inadequate
for the purpose of comprehensive retrieval of all documents that
relate to some concept, event, or problem. This is a critical task
for scholars, scientists, inventors, physicians, attorneys and similar
professionals who might need to discover every relevant document
in some domain. Instead, this type of organizing system needs rich
bibliographic and semantic description of each document, most
likely assigned by professional catalogers, and probably using terms
from a controlled vocabulary to enforce consistency in what
descriptions mean.

Similarly, different merchants or firms might make different
decisions about the extent or granularity of description when they
assign SKUs because of differences in suppliers, targeted
customers, or other business strategies. If you take your car to the
repair shop because windshield wiper fluid is leaking, you might be
dismayed to find that the broken rubber seal that is causing the
leak cannot be ordered separately and you have to pay to replace
the "wiper fluid reservoir" for which the seal is a minor but vital

120 | How Much Is It Being Organized?
   part. Likewise, when two business applications try to exchange and
   merge customer information, integration problems arise if one
   describes a customer as a single "NAME" component while the other
   separates the customer's name into "TITLE," "FIRSTNAME," and
   "LASTNAME."

   Even when faced with the same collection of resources, people
   differ in how much organization they prefer or how much
   disorganization they can tolerate. A classic study by Tom Malone of
   how people organize their office workspaces and desks contrasted
   the strategies and methods of "filers" and "pilers." Filers maintain
   clean desktops and systematically organize their papers into
   categories, while pilers have messy work areas and make few
   attempts at organization. This contrast has analogues in other
   organizing systems and we can easily imagine what happens if a
   "neat freak" and "slob" become roommates.1

   An equally wide range, from a little organization to a lot, can be seen
   in the organizing systems for businesses, armies, governments, or
   any other institutional organizing systems for people. Organizations
   with broad scope and many people usually have deep hierarchies
   and explicit reporting relationships with the CEO, general, or
   president at the top with numerous layers of vice presidents,
   directors, department heads, and managers (or colonels, majors,
   captains, lieutenants, and sergeants). Smaller organizations are
   more varied, with some embodying multi-layered management, and
   some embracing a flatter arrangement with fewer management
   levels, wider spans of authority, and more autonomy for individual

1. (Malone 1983) is the seminal research study, but
  individual differences in organizing preferences were the
  basis of Neil Simon's Broadway play The Odd Couple in
  1965, which then spawned numerous films and TV series.

                                                       How Much Is It Being Organized? | 121
   workers. Many start-up firms try to grow without any management
   structure at all in the belief that it makes them more innovative
   and nimble, but evidence suggests that when no one is responsible
   for making decisions, the lack of accountability results in poor
   decisions, or in no decisions at all even when some were sorely
   needed.2

   In any case, when people have to do it, describing and organizing
   resources is work. Stakeholders in an organizing system often have
   disagreements among about how much organization is necessary
   because of the implications for who performs the work and who
   derives the benefits, especially the economic ones. Physicians
   prefer narrative descriptions and broad classification systems
   because they make it easier to create patient notes. In contrast,
   insurance companies and researchers want fine-grained "form-
   filling" descriptions and detailed classifications that would make the
   physician's work more onerous.3

   The cost-effectiveness of creating systematic and comprehensive
   descriptions of the resources in an information collection has been
   debated for nearly two centuries, beginning in 1841 when Sir
   Anthony Panizzi proposed rules for cataloguing the British Library.
   In the last half century, the scope of the debate grew to consider the
   role of computer-generated resource descriptions.4

    122 | How Much Is It Being Organized?
   The amount of resource description is always shaped by the
   currently available technology for capturing, storing, and making
   use of it. Nineteenth century geologists and paleontologists
   typically recorded only general information about the depth and
   surrounding geological features when they found fossils because
   they had no technology for making more precise measurements and
   everything they noted they had to record by hand. Today, vastly
   more detailed information is recorded by instruments and exploited
   by sophisticated techniques for carbon dating and 3D
   reconstruction.5

   Automatically generated descriptions are increasingly an alternative
   or complement to those created by people. "Smart" resources use
   sensors to capture information about themselves and their
   environments (see "Identity and Active Resources"). Our own
   computers and phones record information about our keystrokes,
   clicks, communications, and locations. Business and government
   computers analyze and index most of the text and speech content
   that flows through and between our personal phones and

   91 cataloging rules for the British Library that defined
   authoritative forms for titles and author names, but the
   complexity of the rules and the resulting resource
   descriptions were widely criticized. For example, the
   famous author and historian Thomas Carlyle argued that
   a library catalog should be nothing more than a list of
   the names of the books in it. Standards for bibliographic
   description are essential if resources are to be shared
   between libraries. See (Denton 2007), (Anderson and
   Perez-Carballo 2001a, 2001b).

computers. These indexes typically assign weights to the terms
according to calculations that consider the frequency and
distribution of the terms in both individual documents and in the
collection as a whole to create a description of what the documents
are about. These descriptions of the documents in the collection
are more consistent than those created by human organizers. They
allow for more complex query processing and comparison
operations by the retrieval functions in the organizing system. For
example, query expansion mechanisms can automatically add
synonyms and related terms to the search. Additionally, retrieved
documents can be arranged by relevance, while "citing" and "cited-
by" links can be analyzed to find related relevant documents.

It is important to recognize the potential downside to automated
resource description. A detailed description produced by sensors or
computers can seem more accurate or authoritative than a simpler
one created by a human observer, even if the latter would be more
useful for the intended purposes. Moreover, the more detailed the
description, the greater the opportunity to use it for new purposes.
This might be desirable, as when a company realizes that it can
cross- and up-sell because it has been tracking every click in a
web store to create a collection of interaction resources. But it
could be undesirable, because detailed transaction data can be used
to violate privacy and civil rights. It depends on who controls the
collected information and their incentives for using it or not using
it.

A second constraint on the degree of organization comes from the
size of the collection within the scope of the organizing system.
Organizing more resources requires more descriptions to
distinguish any particular resource from the rest, and more
constraining organizing principles. Similar resources need to be
grouped or classified to emphasize the most important distinctions
among the complete set of resources in the collection. A small
neighborhood restaurant might have a short wine list with just ten
wines, arranged in two categories for "red" and "white" and

124 | How Much Is It Being Organized?
   described only by the wine's name and price. In contrast, a gourmet
   restaurant might have hundreds of wines in its wine list, which
   would subdivide its "red" and "white" high-level categories into
   subcategories for country, region of origin, and grape varietal. The
   description for each wine might in addition include a specific
   vineyard from which the grapes were sourced, the vintage year,
   ratings of the wine, and tasting notes.

              Using "Information Theory"
              to Quantify Organization
              We often hear news stories hyping "how much
           information" there is in the information society with
           breathless exuberance about the creation of peta-, exa-,
           whatever-bytes of content. A much more important and
           intellectually deeper question than absolute size in
           bytes is measuring how much information is encoded in
           the structure or organization of a system. For this we
           can turn to "Information Theory," a formal approach to
           understanding the theoretical maximum amount of
           information that can be carried by a communications
           system by using efficient coding, data compression, and
           error correction. It was developed by Claude Shannon, a
           researcher at Bell Laboratories, and first published as "a
           mathematical theory of communication" in 1948. We can
           apply it in the discipline of organizing to compare the
           amount of structure in different ways of organizing the
           same resources.6

6. Information theory was developed to attack the
   technical problem of packing the maximum amount of

                                                        How Much Is It Being Organized? | 125
          Information theory quantifies the amount of
       organization in terms of the number of bits, binary
       decisions, or rules needed to describe some structure or
       pattern: the more complex or arbitrary a structure is,
       the more information it takes to describe it. For
       example, the organization of a company with a four-
       level hierarchy and a highly regular reporting structure
       where everyone supervises five people, can be
       described quite succinctly. In contrast, a company in
       which the number of direct reports at any management
       level is highly variable requires many more rules to
       describe.

          Using measures from information theory to assess the
       amount of organization yields the somewhat counter-
       intuitive result that there is less information in the
       organization of a highly structured system than in a less
       structured one. It might help to flip this around and
       describe the amount of organization in terms of the
       reciprocal of the information measure. A system that is
       "highly organized" can be modeled or codified with

data into the signal carrying telephone calls, but it
quickly provided an essential statistical foundation in
language analysis and computational linguistics.
(Shannon 1948). Company organization and other
examples applying information theory to the analysis of
organizing systems can be found in (Levitin 2014,
Chapter 7).

       relatively few rules or organizing principles, compared
       to a less organized system with many exceptions, corner
       cases, or one-off rules.

          The "entropy" measure is often used to create
       predictive models of the "decision tree" variety, which is
       an algorithm that classifies or predicts by making a
       sequence of logical tests. Each test divides a collection
       of data into sets with less entropy (more predictability).
       (See "Implementing Categories")

At some point a collection grows so large that it is not economically
feasible for people to create bibliographic descriptions or to classify
each separate resource, unless there are so many users of the
collection that their aggregated effort is comparably large; this is
organizing by "crowdsourcing." This leaves two approaches that can
be done separately or in tandem.

  · The simpler approach is to describe sets of resources or
      documents as a set or group, which is especially sensible for
      archives with its emphasis on the fonds (see "What Is Being
      Organized?").

  · The second approach is to rely on automated and more
      general-purpose organizing technologies that organize
      resources through computational means. Search engines are
      familiar examples of computational organizing technology, and
      "Computational Classification" describes other common
      techniques in machine learning, clustering, and discriminant
      analysis that can be used to create a system of categories and
      to assign resources to them.

Finally, we must acknowledge the ways in which information

                                                    How Much Is It Being Organized? | 127
   processing and telecommunications technologies have transformed
   and will continue to transform organizing systems in every sphere
   of economic and intellectual activity. A century ago, when the
   telegraph and telephone enabled rapid communication and
   business coordination across large distances, these new
   technologies enabled the creation of massive vertically integrated
   industrial firms. In the 1920s, the Ford Motor Company owned coal
   and iron mines, rubber plantations, railroads, and steel mills so it
   could manage every resource needed in automobile production and
   reduce the costs and uncertainties of finding suppliers, negotiating
   with them, and ensuring their contractual compliance. Adam's
   Smith's invisible hand of the market as an organizing mechanism
   had been replaced by the visible hand of hierarchical management
   to control what Ronald Coase in 1937 termed "transaction costs" in
   The Nature of the Firm.

   In recent decades, a new set of information and computing
   technologies enabled by Moore's law--unlimited computing power,
   effectively free bandwidth, and the Internet--have turned Coase
   upside down, leading to entirely new forms of industrial
   organization made possible as transaction costs plummet. When
   computation and coordination costs drop dramatically, it becomes
   possible for small firms and networks of services (provided by
   people or by computational processes) to out-compete large
   corporations through more efficient use of information resources
   and services, and through more effective information exchange
   with suppliers and customers, much of it automated. Herbert
   Simon, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, decision making, and
   human-computer interaction, recognized the similarities between
   the design of computing systems and human organizations and
   developed principles and mechanisms applicable to both.7

work on transaction costs, which he first published as
a graduate student (Coase 1937). Berkeley business
professor Oliver Williamson received the prize in 2009
for work that extended Coase's framework to explain the
shift from the hierarchical firm to the network firm
(Williamson 1975, 1998). The notion of the "visible hand"
comes from (Chandler 1977). Simon won the Nobel Prize
in economics in 1978, but if there were Nobel Prizes in
computer science or management theory he surely
would have won them as well. Simon was the author or
co-author of four books that have each been cited over
10,000 times, including (Simon 1997, 1996) and (Newell
and Simon 1972).

15. When Is It Being
Organized?

               "Because bibliographic description, when manually
               performed, is
               expensive, it seems likely that the `pre' organizing of
               information will continue to shift incrementally
               toward `post' organizing."
               (Svenonius 2000, p. 194-195)

The organizing system framework recasts the traditional tradeoff
between information organization and information retrieval as the
decision about when the organization is imposed. We can contrast
organization imposed on resources "on the way in" when they are
created or made part of a collection with "on the way out"
organization imposed when an interaction with resources takes
place.

When an author writes a document, he or she gives it some internal
organization via title, section headings, typographic conventions,
page numbers, and other mechanisms that identify its parts and
relationship to each other. The document could also have some
external organization implied by the context of its publication, such
as the name of its author and publisher, its web address, and
citations or links to other documents or web pages.

Digital photos, videos, and documents are generally organized to
some minimal degree when they are created because some
descriptions, notably time and location, are assigned automatically
to these types of resources by the technology used to create them.
At a minimum, these descriptions include the resource's creation
time, storage format, and chronologically ordered, auto-assigned

130 | When Is It Being Organized?
   filename (IMG00001.JPG, IMG00002.JPG, etc.), but often are much
   more detailed.1

   Digital resources created by automated processes generally exhibit
   a high degree of organization and structure because they are
   generated automatically in conformance with data or document
   schemas. These schemas implement the business rules and
   information models for the orders, invoices, payments, and the
   numerous other document types created and managed in business
   organizing systems.

   Before a resource becomes part of a library collection, its author-
   created organization is often supplemented by additional
   information supplied by the publisher or other human
   intermediaries, such as an International Standard Book
   Number(ISBN) or Library of Congress Call Number(LOC-CN) or
   Library of Congress Subject Headings(LOC-SH).

   In contrast, Google and other search engines apply massive
   computational power to analyze the contents and associated
   structures (like links between web pages) to impose organization
   on resources that have already been published or made available
   so that they can be retrieved in response to a user's query "on
   the way out." Google makes use of existing organization within and
   between information resources when it can, but its unparalleled
   technological capabilities and scale yield competitive advantage in
   imposing organization on information that was not previously

1. Most digital cameras annotate each photo with detailed
  information about the camera and its settings in the
  Exchangeable Image File Format(EXIF), and many mobile
  phones can associate their location along with any digital
  object they create.

   organized digitally.2 One reaction to the poor quality of some
   computational description has been the call for libraries to put
   their authoritative bibliographic resources on the open web, which
   would enable reuse of reliable information about books, authors,
   publishers, places, and subject classifications. This "linked data"
   movement is slowly gathering momentum.3

   Google makes almost all of its money through personalized ad
   placement, so much of the selection and ranking of search results
   is determined "on the way out" in the fraction of a second after
   the user submits a query by using information about the user's
   search history and current context. Of course, this "on the way
   out" organization is only possible because of the more generic
   organization that Google's algorithms have imposed "on the way in."

2. Indeed, Geoff Nunberg criticized Google for ignoring or
   undervaluing the descriptive metadata and classifications
   previously assigned by people and replacing them with
   algorithmically assigned descriptors, many of which are
   incorrect or inappropriate. Calling Google's Book Search
   a "disaster for scholars" and a "metadata train wreck,"
   he lists scores of errors in titles, publication dates, and
   classifications. For example, he reports that a search on
   "Internet" in books published before 1950 yields 527
   results. The first 10 hits for Whitman's Leaves of Grass are
   variously classified as Poetry, Juvenile Nonfiction, Fiction,
   Literary Criticism, Biography & Autobiography, and
   Counterfeits and Counterfeiting. (Nunberg 2009)

    132 | When Is It Being Organized?
In many organizing systems the nature and extent of organization
changes over time as the resources are used. The arrangement of
resources in a kitchen or office changes incrementally as frequently
used things end up in the front of the pantry, drawer, shelf or
filing cabinet or on the top of a pile of papers. Printed books or
documents acquire margin notes, underlining, turned down pages
or coffee cup stains that differentiate the most important or most
frequently used parts. Digital documents do not take on coffee cup
stains, but when they are edited, their new revision dates put them
at the top of directory listings.

The scale of emergent organization of websites, photos on Flickr,
blog posts, and other resources that can be accessed and used
online dwarfs the incremental evolution of individual organizing
systems. This organization is clearly visible in the pattern of links,
tags, or ratings that are explicitly associated with these resources,
but search engines and advertisers also exploit the less visible
organization created over time by analyzing interaction resources,
the recorded information about which resources were viewed and
which links were followed.

The sort of organic or emergent change in organizing systems that
takes place over time contrasts with the planned and systematic
maintenance of organizing systems described as curation or
governance, two related but distinct activities. Curation usually
refers to the methods or systems that add value to and preserve
resources, while the concept of governance more often emphasizes
the institutions or organizations that carry out those activities. The
former is most often used for libraries, museums, or archives and
the latter for enterprise or inter-enterprise contexts. (For more
discussion, see "Governance")

The organizing systems for businesses and industries often change
because of the development of de facto or de jure standards, or
because of regulations, court decisions, or other events or
mandates.

We should always consider the extent to which people or
technology in an organizing system are able to adapt when new
resources, data, or people enter the picture. When and how much
an organizing system can be changed depends on the extent of
architectural thinking that went into its design (see The Three Tiers
of Organizing Systems), because it should be possible to make a
change to a component without having to rethink the system
entirely.
Sometimes what prevents adaptation are physical or technological
constraints in the implementation of an organizing system, as with a
desk or closet with fixed "pigeon holes," unmovable shelves, or with
a music player with limited allowable formats and/or fixed storage
capacity.
Machine learning algorithms use different techniques from those of
human organizers; one of the important differences is that they're
designed to adapt to new inputs--which is why they're known to
be "learning." In contrast, humans differ in how willing we are to
re-organize to accommodate a different number or a different mix
of resources. Without procedures in place to support or trigger
adaptation, it may be quite difficult for us to change how we think
or how we organize when our world changes, or even to realize that
it has changed.

 16. How (or by Whom) Is It
 Organized?

                  "The rise of the Internet is affecting the actual work of
                  organizing information by shifting it from a relatively
                  few professional indexers and catalogers to the
                  populace at large. An important question today is
                  whether the bibliographic universe can be organized
                  both intelligently (that is, to meet the traditional
                  bibliographic objectives) and automatically."
                  (Svenonius 2000, p. 26)

   In the preceding quote, Svenonius identifies three different ways
   for the "work of organizing information" to be performed: by
   professional indexers and catalogers, by the populace at large, and
   by automated (computerized) processes. Our notion of the
   organizing system is broader than her "bibliographic universe,"
   making it necessary to extend her taxonomy. Authors are
   increasingly organizing the content they create, and it is important
   to distinguish users in informal and formal or institutional contexts.
   We have also introduced the concept of an organizing agent ("The
   Concept of "Organizing Principle"") to unify organizing done by
   people and by computer algorithms.

   Professional indexers and catalogers undergo extensive training to
   learn the concepts, controlled descriptive vocabularies, and
   standard classifications in the particular domains in which they
   work. Their goal is not only to describe individual resources, but to
   position them in the larger collection in which they reside.1

1. This is an important distinction in library science

                                                                              How (or by Whom) Is It
                                                                                      Organized? | 135
   They can create and maintain organizing systems with consistent
   high quality, but their work often requires additional research,
   which is costly.

   The class of professional organizers also includes the employees
   of commercial information services like Westlaw and LexisNexis,
   who add controlled and, often, proprietary metadata to legal and
   government documents and other news sources. Scientists and
   scholars with deep expertise in a domain often function as the
   professional organizers for data collections, scholarly publications
   and proceedings, and other specialized information resources in
   their respective disciplines. The National Association of Professional
   Organizers(NAPO) claims several thousand members who will
   organize your media collection, kitchen, closet, garage or entire
   house or help you downsize to a smaller living space.2

   education and library practice. Individual resources are
   described ("formal" cataloging) using "bibliographic
   languages" and their classification in the larger collection
   is done using "subject languages" (Svenonius 2000, Ch.
   4 and Ch. 8, respectively). These two practices are
   generally taught in different library school courses
   because they use different languages, methods and rules
   and are generally carried out by different people in the
   library. In other organizations, the resource description
   (both formal and subject) is created in the same step and
   by the same person.

2. NAPO: http://www.napo.net The name and scope of this
   organization seems a bit odd given how much
   professional organizing takes place in business, science,

    136 | How (or by Whom) Is It Organized?
Many of today's content creators are unlikely to be professional
organizers, but presumably the author best understands why
something was created and the purposes for which it can be used.
To the extent that authors want to help others find a resource,
they will assign descriptions or classifications that they expect will
be useful to those users. But unlike professional organizers, most
authors are unfamiliar with controlled vocabularies and standard
classifications, and as a result their descriptions will be more
subjective and less consistent.

Similarly, most of us do not hire professionals to organize the
resources we collect and use in our personal lives, and thus our
organizing systems reflect our individual preferences and
idiosyncrasies.

Non-author users in the "populace at large" are most often creating
organization for their own benefit. These ordinary users are unlikely
to use standard descriptors and classifications, and the organization
they impose sometimes so closely reflects their own perspective
and goals that it is not useful for others. Fortunately most users
of "Web 2.0" or "community content" applications at least partly
recognize that the organization of resources emerges from the
aggregated contributions of all users, which provides incentive to
use less egocentric descriptors and classifications. The staggering
number of users and resources on the most popular applications
inevitably leads to "tag convergence" simply because of the statistics
of large sample sizes.

Finally, the vast size of the web and the even greater size of the
"deep" or invisible web, composed of the information stores of

government, medicine, education, and other domains
where closets and garages are not the most important
focus.

                                                 How (or by Whom) Is It Organized? | 137
   business and proprietary information services, makes it impossible
   to imagine today that it could be organized by anything other than
   the massive computational power of search engine providers like
   Google and Microsoft. Likewise, data mining, predictive analytics,
   recommendation systems, and many other application areas that
   involve computational modeling and classification simply could not
   be done any other way.3
   Nevertheless, in the earliest days of the web, significant human
   effort was applied to organize it. Most notable is Yahoo!, founded by
   Jerry Yang and David Filo in 1994 as a directory of favorite websites.
   For many years the Yahoo! homepage was the best way to find
   relevant websites by browsing the extensive system of classification.
   Today's Yahoo! homepage emphasizes a search engine that makes it
   appear more like Google or Microsoft Bing, but the Yahoo! directory
   can still be found if you search for it.

3. (He et al. 2007) estimate that there are hundreds of
   thousands of websites and databases whose content is
   accessible only through query forms and web services,
   and there are over a million of those. The amount of
   content in this hidden web is many hundreds of times
   larger than that accessible in the surface or visible web.

   See http://www.worldwidewebsize.com/ for estimates of
   the size of the visible web calculated from comparisons
   of results from search engines.

    138 | How (or by Whom) Is It Organized?
17. Where is it being
Organized?

               "Bibliographic control requires fixing a document in
               the
               bibliographic universe by its space-time coordinates."
               (Svenonius 2000, p. 120)

Having identified the resources, reasoned about our motivations,
limited the scope and scale, and determined when and by whom the
organization will occur, we come finally to the question of where the
resources are being organized.

In ordinary use, "Where" refers to a physical location. But the
answer to "where?" often depends on whether we are asking about
the current location, a past location, or an intended destination
for resources that are in transit or in process. The answer to the
question "where?" can take a lot of different forms. We can talk
about an abstract space like "a library shelf" or we can talk about
"the hidden compartment in Section XY at the Library of Congress,"
as depicted in the 2004 movie "National Treasure." We can answer
"where?" with a description of a set of environmental conditions
that best suit a class of wildlife, or a tire, or a sleeping bag. We
can answer "where?" with "Renaissance Europe" or "Colonial
Williamsburg." "Where?" can be a place in a mental construct, or
even a place in an imagined location.

In the architectural design of an organizing system, its physical
location is usually not a primary concern. In most organizing
systems, the matter of where the organizing system and the
resources are located can be abstracted away. So, in practice,
resource location often is not as important as the other questions
here. Physical constraints of the storage location should generally

                                                         Where is it being Organized? | 139
be relegated to an implementation concern rather than an
architectural one. The construction of a special display structure
for a valuable resource is not an independent design dimension;
it is just the implementation of the user interface. (See "The
Implementation Perspective ")

Physical resources are often stored where it is convenient and
efficient to do so, whether in ordinary warehouses, offices,
storerooms, shelves, cabinets, and closets. It can be necessary to
adapt an organizing system to characteristics of its physical
environment, but this could undermine architectural thinking and
make it harder to maintain the organization over time, as the
collection evolves in scope and scale. (See "Organizing Physical
Resources")

Digital resources, on the other hand, are increasingly organized
and stored "in the cloud" and their actual locations are invisible,
indeterminate, and generally irrelevant, except in situations where
the servers and the information they hold may be subject to laws
or practices of their physical location. For example, a controversy
arose in Canada in 2013 when researchers discovered that Internet
service providers were, for various technical and business reasons,
routinely routing trans-Canada web traffic through the United
States. Because Canada has no jurisdiction over data traveling
through cables and servers in another country, there was
considerable outcry among Canadians who were concerned that
their personal information was being subjected to the privacy laws
and practices of another country without their knowledge or
consent.

Sometimes location functions as an organizing principle in its own
right, which in practice essentially collapses many of these
architectural distinctions. This is frequently the case in our personal
organizing systems, where we may exploit the innate human
capability for spatial memory by always putting specific things like
keys, eyeglasses, and cell phones in the same place, which makes

140 | Where is it being Organized?
them easy to find. But we can also see this happening in systems as
complex and varied as: real estate information systems; wayfinding
systems, such as road signage or mile markers; standardized
international customs forms with position-specific data fields;
geographic information systems; air, ground, sea, and space traffic
control systems; and historic landmark preservation.

In "Organizing Places" we consider the organization of the land,
built environments, and wayfinding systems. "The Structural
Perspective" discusses the structural perspective on resource
relationships, and in some systems, it may be very significant where
resources are located in relation to one another. In The Barnes
Collection, for example, works of art are physically grouped to
enunciate common characteristics. Conversely, zoos do not mix the
kangaroos with the wild dogs, and the military does not mix the
ingredients for chemical weapons (at least, not until they plan to
use them). There are also circumstances where resources can only
exist in (or are particularly suited to) particular environments, such
as the conditions required to grow wine grapes or mushrooms, or
store spent nuclear fuel. UPS advises companies on where to put
their warehouses and shipment centers. These are more substantial
than questions of presentation, but it is debatable whether it falls
under the storage or logic tier (you could have the principle of
"keep the mushrooms somewhere moist" while not dictating where
particularly).

Sometimes the location of an organizing system seems particularly
salient, as in the design of cities where the street plan can be
essential for orientation and navigation, and is embodied in zoning,
voting, and other explicit organization, as well as in informal
organization like neighborhood identity. But even here, it is really
the people who live in the city who are being organized and whose
interactions with the city and with each other are being encouraged
or discouraged, not the physical location on which they live.

Indeed, in designing an organizing system you will often find that

                                                          Where is it being Organized? | 141
questions about location tumble naturally out of the other five
design dimensions. For instance, questions about "when," "what,"
and "where" are often inseparable, particularly when an organizing
system is subject to outside regulations, which tend to have
geographical jurisdictions. "Where" is also commonly bound up with
"who" and "why," when locational challenges or opportunities faced
by a system's creators or users necessitate special design
consideration. (See "Effectivity")
Location can be critically important to an organizing system--too
important, in fact, to be considered alone. The question of "where?"
is best considered in context of the other five design dimensions as
a whole; a narrow focus on where the resources are being organized
too often privileges past convention over architectural thinking and
perpetuates legacy issues and poorly organized systems.

  · How does a "design questions" or "dimensional" perspective on
      the design of organizing systems complement the familiar use
      of categories like library and museum?

      A dimensional perspective makes it easier to translate between
      category- and discipline-specific vocabularies so that people
      from different disciplines can have mutually intelligible
      discussions about their organizing activities.

      (See "Introduction")

  · Why is the question "What is a thing?" so fundamental and
      challenging?

      In different situations, the same "thing" can be treated as a
      unique item, one of many equivalent members of a broad
      category, or a component of an item rather than as an item on
      its own.

      (See "What Is Being Organized?")

  · How are organizing systems for physical resources and those
      for digital resources fundamentally different?

      A single physical resource can only be in one place at a time,
      and interactions with it are constrained by its size, location, and
      other properties. In contrast, digital copies and surrogates can
      exist in many places at once and enable searching, sorting, and
      other interactions with an efficiency and scale impossible for
      tangible things.

      (See "What Is Being Organized?")

  · Why is it challenging to decide on the unit of organization for
      information content?

      When the resources being organized consist of information
      content, deciding on the unit of organization is challenging
      because it might be necessary to look beyond physical
      properties and consider conceptual or intellectual equivalence.

      (See "What Is Being Organized?")

  · What is the essential purpose of any organizing system?

      Almost by definition, the essential purpose of any organizing
      system is to describe or arrange resources so they can be
      located and accessed later. The organizing principles needed to
      achieve this goal depend on the types of resources or domains
      being organized, and in the personal, social, or institutional
      setting in which organization takes place.

      (See "Why Is It Being Organized?")

  · What are the primary purposes for the organizing systems in
      libraries, museums, and archives?

      Libraries, museums, and archives are often classified as memory
      institutions to emphasize their primary emphasis on resource
      preservation.

      (See "Why Is It Being Organized?")

  · What kinds of documents are businesses and governmental
      agencies required to keep?

      Businesses and governmental agencies are usually required by
      law to keep records of financial transactions, decision-making,
      personnel matters, and other information essential to business
      continuity, compliance with regulations and legal procedures,
      and transparency.

144 | Key Points in Chapter Two
   (See "Why Is It Being Organized?")

· What is the value created if interaction traces can be turned
   into interaction resources?

   If a system can turn its interaction traces into interaction
   resources, additional value can be created by analyzing these
   resources to enhance the interactions, to suggest new ones, or
   make predictions about how individual users or groups of them
   will behave.

   (See "Why Is It Being Organized?")

· Why is efficiency too narrow a measure for evaluating
   organizing systems?

   Resources are always organized in ways that are designed to
   allocate value for some people (e.g., the owners of the
   resources, or the most frequent users of them) and not for
   others.

   (See "Why Is It Being Organized?")

· What lessons from applied behavioral economics about how
   people make decisions have implications for the design of
   organizing systems?

   Subtle differences in resource arrangement, the number and
   framing of choices, and default values can have substantial
   effects on the decisions people make.

   (See "Why Is It Being Organized?")

· Why might merchants or firms differ in the extent or
   granularity of their product descriptions?

   Different merchants or firms might make different decisions
   about the extent or granularity of description when they assign

                                                          Key Points in Chapter Two | 145
      SKUs because of differences in suppliers, targeted customers,
      or other business strategies.

      (See "How Much Is It Being Organized?")

  · What are some of the potential downsides to automated
      resource description?

      A detailed description produced by sensors or computers can
      seem more accurate or authoritative than a simpler one created
      by a human observer, even if the latter would be more useful for
      the intended purposes. Detailed transaction data can be used to
      violate privacy and civil rights.

      (See "How Much Is It Being Organized?")

  · How does the number of resources in a collection affect the
      amount of resource description and organization required?

      Organizing more resources requires more descriptions to
      distinguish any particular resource from the rest, and more
      constraining organizing principles. Similar resources need to
      be grouped or classified to emphasize the most important
      distinctions among the complete set of resources in the
      collection.

      (See "How Much Is It Being Organized?")

  · How is organizing "on the way in" different from organizing "on
      the way out"?

      We can contrast organization imposed on resources "on the
      way in" when they are created or made part of a collection with
      "on the way out" organization imposed when an interaction
      with resources takes place.

      (See "When Is It Being Organized?")

146 | Key Points in Chapter Two
· Why do digital resources created by automated processes
   exhibit a high degree of organization and structure?
   Digital resources created by automated processes generally
   exhibit a high degree of organization and structure because
   they are generated automatically in conformance with data or
   document schemas.
   (See "When Is It Being Organized?")

· What kinds of organizing systems would be impossible to create
   without the use of massive computational power?
   The vast size of the web and the even greater size of the "deep"
   or invisible web makes it impossible to imagine today that it
   could be organized by anything other than the massive
   computational power of search engine providers like Google
   and Microsoft. Likewise, data mining, predictive analytics,
   recommendation systems, and many other application areas
   that involve computational modeling and classification simply
   could not be done any other way.

19. Introduction (III)

There are four activities that occur naturally in every organizing
system; how explicit they are depend on the scope, the breadth or
variety of the resources, and the scale, the number of resources that
the organizing system encompasses. Consider the routine, everyday
task of managing your wardrobe. When you organize your clothes
closet, you are unlikely to write a formal selection policy that
specifies what things go in the closet. You do not consciously
itemize and prioritize the ways you expect to search for and locate
things, and you are unlikely to consider explicitly the organizing
principles that you use to arrange them. From time to time you will
put things back in order and discard things you no longer wear,
but you probably will not schedule this as a regular activity on your
calendar.

Your clothes closet is an organizing system; defined as "an
intentionally arranged collection of resources and the interactions
they support." As such, it exposes these four highly interrelated and
iterative activities:

Selecting

      Determining the scope of the organizing system by specifying
      which resources should be included. (Should I hang up my
      sweaters in the clothes closet or put them in a dresser drawer in
      the bedroom?)

Organizing

      Specifying the principles or rules that will be followed to
      arrange the resources. (Should I sort my shirts by color, sleeve
      type, or season?)

                                                                           Introduction (III) | 151
Designing resource-based interactions

      Designing and implementing the actions, functions or services
      that make use of the resources. (Do I need storage places for
      clothes to be laundered? Should I have separate baskets for white
      and colors? Dry cleaning?)

Maintaining

      Managing and adapting the resources and the organization
      imposed on them as needed to support the interactions. (When
      is it time to straighten up the closet? What about mending?
      Should I toss out clothes based on wear and tear, how long I have
      owned them, or whether I am tired of them? What about excess
      hangers?)

These activities are not entirely separable or sequential, and they
can be informal for your clothes closet because its scope and scale
are limited. In institutional organizing systems the activities and the
inter-dependencies and iterations among them are more carefully
managed and often highly formal.

For example, a data warehouse combines data from different
sources like orders, sales, customers, inventory, and finance.
Business analysts explore combinations and subsets of the data
to find important patterns and relationships. The most important
questions in the design and operation of the data warehouse can be
arranged using the same activities as the clothes closet.

Selecting

      Which data sources should be included? How is their quality
      assessed? How much of the data is sampled? How are queries
      composed?

Organizing

      Which data formats and schemas will enable effective

152 | Introduction (III)
      processing? Are needed transformations made at load time or
      query time?
Designing resource-based interactions
      What are the most important and frequent queries that need to
      be pre-configured?
Maintaining
      What governance policies and procedures are needed to satisfy
      retention, compliance, security, and privacy requirements?
Figure: Four Activities in all Organizing Systems. illustrates these
four activities in all organizing systems, framing the depiction of
the organizing and interaction design activities shown in Figure: An
Organizing System. with the selection and maintenance activities
that necessarily precede and follow them.
Four Activities in all Organizing Systems

                                                                           Introduction (III) | 153
Four activities take place in all organizing systems: selection of
resources for a collection; intentional organization of the resources;
design and implementation of interactions with individual resources
or with the collection, and; maintenance of the resources and the
interactions over time.

These activities are deeply ingrained in academic curricula and
professional practices, with domain-specific terms for their
methods and results. Libraries and museums usually make their
selection principles explicit in collection development policies.
Adding a resource to a library collection is called acquisition, but
adding to a museum collection is called accessioning. Documenting
the contents of library and museum collections to organize them
is called cataloging. Circulation is a central interaction in libraries,
but because museum resources do not circulate the primary
interactions for museum users are viewing or visiting the collection.

154 | Introduction (III)
Maintenance activities are usually described as preservation or
curation.

In business information systems, selection of resources can involve
data generation, capture, sampling, or extraction. Adding resources
could involve loading, integration, or insertion. Schema development
and data transformation are important organizing activities.
Supported interactions could include querying, reporting, analysis,
or visualization. Maintenance activities are often described as
deletion, purging, data cleansing, governance, or compliance.

          What about "Creating" Resources?
          Our definition of organizing system as an intentionally
       arranged collection of resources might seem to imply
       that resources must exist before they are organized.
       This is often the case when we organize physical
       resources because the need for principled organization
       only arises when the collection gets too big for us to see
       everything in the collection at once. Similarly, many data
       analytics projects begin by bringing together data
       collected by others.
          However, organizing systems for digital resources are
       often put in place as a prerequisite for creating them.
       This is always necessary when the resources are created
       by automated processes or data entry in business
       systems, and usually the case with professional writers
       in a technical publications context. We can think of
       database or document schemas (at the implementation
       tier) or data entry forms or word processor templates
       (in the user interface tier) as embodiments of the
       organizing principles in the data records or documents
       that are then created in conformance with them.

                                                                           Introduction (III) | 155
Domain-specific methods and vocabularies evolve over time to
capture the complex and distinctive sets of experiences and
practices of their respective disciplines. We can identify
correspondences and overlapping meanings, but they are not
synonyms or substitutes for each other. We propose more general
terms like selection and maintenance, not as lowest common
denominator replacements for these more specialized ones, but
to facilitate communication and cooperation across the numerous
disciplines that are concerned with organizing.
It might sound odd to describe the animals in a zoo as resources,
to think of viewing a painting in a museum as an interaction, or to
say that destroying information to comply with privacy regulations
is maintenance. Taking a broader perspective on the activities in
organizing systems so that we can identify best practices and
patterns enables people with different backgrounds and working in
different domains to understand and learn from each other.
Part of what a database administrator can learn from a museum
curator follows from the rich associations the curator has
accumulated around the concept of curation that are not available
around the more general concept of maintenance. Without the
shared concept of maintenance to bridge their disciplines, this
learning could not take place.

156 | Introduction (III)
 Navigating this chapter

   In "The Concept of "Resource"" and "What Is Being
Organized?" we briefly discussed the fundamental
concept of a resource. In this chapter, we describe the
four primary activities with resources, using examples
from many different kinds of organizing systems.

    "Selecting Resources"
    "Organizing Resources"
    "Designing Resource-based Interactions"
    "Maintaining Resources"

   We emphasize the activities of organizing and of
designing resource-based interactions that make use of
the organization imposed on the resources. We discuss
selection and maintenance to create the context for the
organizing activities and to highlight the
interdependencies of organizing and these other
activities. This broad survey enables us to compare and
contrast the activities in different resource domains,
setting the stage for a more thorough discussion of
resources and resource description in Resources in

                                                                  Introduction (III) | 157
       Organizing Systems and Resource Description and
       Metadata.

158 | Introduction (III)
20. Selecting Resources

When we talk about organizing systems, we often do so in terms
of the contents of their collections. This implies that the most
fundamental decision for an organizing system is determining its
resource domain, the group or type of resources that are being
organized. This decision is usually a constraint, not a choice; we
acquire or encounter some resources that we need to interact with
over time, and we need to organize them so we can do that
effectively.

Selecting is the process by which resources are identified, evaluated,
and then added to a collection in an organizing system. Selection is
first shaped by the domain and then by the scope of the organizing
system, which can be analyzed through six interrelated aspects:

 1. the number and nature of users

2. the time span or lifetime over which the organizing system is
      expected
      to operate

3. the size of the collection

4. the expected changes to the collection

5. the physical or technological environment in which the
      organizing system is situated or implemented

6. the relationship of the organizing system to other ones that
      overlap with it in domain or scope.

(In The Organizing System Roadmap, we discuss these six aspects in
more detail.)

                                                                      Selecting Resources | 159
Selection Criteria

Selection must be an intentional process because, by definition,
an organizing system contains resources whose selection and
arrangement was determined by human or computational agents,
not by natural processes. And given the broad definition of resource
as "anything of value that can support goal-oriented activity" it
follows that resources should be selected by an implicit or explicit
assessment to determine whether they can be used to achieve those
goals. So even though particular selection methods and criteria vary
across resource domains, their common purpose is to determine
how well the resource satisfies the specifications for the properties
or capabilities that enable a person or nonhuman agent to perform
the intended activities. "Fitness for use" is a common and concise
way to summarize this idea, and while it highlights the need to have
activities in mind before resources are selected to enable them, it
also explains why precise selection criteria are harder to define for
organizing systems that have diverse sets of stakeholders or users
with different goals, like those in public libraries.

Many resources are evaluated and selected one-at-a-time. This
makes it impossible to specify in advance every property or
criterion that might be considered in making a selection decision,
especially for unique or rare resources like those being considered
by a museum or private collector. In general, when resources are
treated as instances, organizing activities typically occur after
selection takes place, as in the closet organizing system with which
we began this chapter.

When the resources being considered for a collection are more
homogeneous and predictable, it is possible to treat them as a class
or set, which enables selection criteria and organizing principles to
be specified in advance. This makes selection and organizing into
concurrent activities. This would be the case in the data warehouse
organizing system, the other example at the beginning of this

160 | Selecting Resources
   chapter, because each data source can be described by a schema
   whose structure is reflected in the organization of the data
   warehouse. Put another way, as long as subsequent datasets from a
   specific source do not differ in structure, only in temporal attributes
   like their creation or acquisition dates, the organization imposed on
   the initial dataset can be replicated for each subsequent one.

   Well-run companies and organizations in every industry are highly
   systematic in selecting the resources that must be managed and the
   information needed to manage them. "Selecting the right resource
   for the job" is a clichéd way of saying this, but this slogan
   nonetheless applies broadly to raw materials, functional equipment,
   information resources and datasets, and to people, who are often
   called "human resources" in corporate-speak.

   For some types of resources, the specifications that guide selection
   can be precise and measurable. Precise specifications are especially
   important when an organizing system will contain or make use of all
   resources of a particular type, or if all the resources produced from
   a particular source become part of the organizing system on some
   regular schedule. Selection specifications can also be shaped by
   laws, regulations or policies that require or prohibit the collection
   of certain kinds of objects or types of information.1

1. Some governments attempt to preserve and prevent
  misappropriation of cultural property by enforcing
  import or export controls on antiquities that might be
  stolen from archaeological sites (Merryman 2006). For
  digital resources, privacy laws prohibit the collection or
  misuse of personally identifiable information about
  healthcare, education, telecommunications, video rental,

                                                                          Selecting Resources | 161
   For example, when a manufacturer of physical goods selects the
   materials or components that are transformed into its products,
   it carefully evaluates the candidate resources and their suppliers
   before making them part of its supply chain. The manufacturer
   would test the resources against required values of measurable
   characteristics like chemical purity, strength, capacity, and
   reliability. A business looking for transactional or demographic data
   to guide a business expansion strategy would specify different
   measurable characteristics; data files must be valid with respect
   to a schema, must contain no duplicates or personally identifiable
   information, and must be less than one month old when they are
   delivered. Similarly, employee selection has become highly data-
   intensive; employers hire people after assessing the match between
   their competencies and capabilities (expressed verbally or in a
   resume, or demonstrated in some qualification test) and what is
   needed to do the required activities.2

   and might soon restrict the information collected during
   web browsing.

2. The popular LinkedIn site, which has hundreds of
   millions of resumes that it data mines to find statistically
   superior job candidates, is literally a gold mine for the
   company because it makes money by referring those
   candidates to potential employers. Data-intensive hiring
   practices in baseball are entertainingly presented in the
   book entitled Moneyball book (Lewis 2003) or the 2011
   movie starring Brad Pitt. Pro football teams have begun
   to assess college football players by comparing them
   statistically with the best pro players (Robbins, 2016).

    162 | Selecting Resources
   Selection is an essential activity in creating organizing systems
   whose purpose is to combine separate web services or resources to
   create a composite service or application according to the business
   design philosophy of Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).3 When an
   information-intensive enterprise or application combines its

   Many examples of business strategies that required
   significant investment to acquire data assets with no
   current value are reported in (Provost and Fawcett 2013).

3. See (Cherbakov et al. 2005), (Erl 2005a). The essence of
   SOA is to treat business services or functions as
   components that can be combined as needed. An SOA
   enables a business to quickly and cost-effectively change
   how it does business and whom it does business with
   (suppliers, business partners, or customers). SOA is
   generally implemented using web services that exchange
   Extensible Markup Language(XML) documents in real-
   time information flows to interconnect the business
   service components. If the business service components
   are described abstractly it can be possible for one service
   provider to be transparently substituted for another--a
   kind of real-time resource selection--to maintain the
   desired quality of service. For example, a web retailer
   might send a Shipping Request to many delivery services,
   one of which is selected to provide the service. It
   probably does not matter to the customer which delivery
   service handles his package, and it might not even matter
   to the retailer.

                                                                          Selecting Resources | 163
   internal services with ones provided by others via Application
   Programming Interfaces (APIs), the resources are selected to create
   a combined collection of services according to the "core
   competency" principle: resources are selected and combined to
   exploit the first party's internal capabilities and those of its service
   partners better than any other combination of services could. For
   example, instead of writing millions of lines of code and collecting
   detailed maps to build an interactive map in an application, you can
   get access to the Google Maps organizing system with just a few
   lines of code.4 (See the sidebar, Selection of Web-based Resources)

              Selection of Web-based Resources
              The nature and scale of the web changes how we
           collect resources and fundamentally challenges how we
           think of resources in the first place. Web-based
           resources cannot be selected for a collection by

4. The idea that a firm's long term success can depend on
   just a handful of critical capabilities that cut across
   current technologies and organizational boundaries
   makes a firm's core competency a very abstract
   conceptual model of how it is organized. This concept
   was first proposed by (Pralahad and Hamel 1990), and
   since then there have been literally hundreds of business
   books that all say essentially the same thing: you cannot
   be good at everything; choose what you need to be good
   at and focus on getting better at them; let someone else
   do things that you do not need to be good at doing.

    164 | Selecting Resources
           consulting a centralized authoritative directory, catalog,
           or index because one does not exist. ProgrammableWeb
           and other directories organize thousands of web-
           accessible APIs, and the dominant resource-organizing
           firms Amazon, Salesforce, Facebook, and Twitter offer
           hundreds of APIs to access massive amounts of
           information about products, people, and posts, but APIs
           enable access to only a fraction of the web's content.
           And although your favorite web search engine consults
           an index or directory of web resources when you enter
           a search query, you do not know where that index or
           directory came from or how it was assembled.56

5. See (Borgman 2000) on digitization and libraries. But
   while shared collections benefit users and reduce
   acquisition costs, if a library has defined itself as a
   physical place and emphasizes its holdings-- the
   resources it directly controls--it might resist anything
   that reduces the importance of its physical reification,
   the size of its holdings, or the control it has over
   resources (Sandler 2006). A challenge facing
   conventional libraries today is to make the transition
   from emphasizing creation and preservation of physical
   collections to facilitating the use and creation of
   knowledge regardless of its medium and the location
   from which it is accessed.

6. (Arasu et al. 2001), (Manning et al. 2008). The web is a

                                                                          Selecting Resources | 165
              However, the web has universal scope and global
           reach, making most of the web irrelevant to most people
           most of the time. Researchers have attacked this
           problem by treating the web as a combination of a very
           large number of topic-based or domain-specific
           collections of resources, and then developing
           techniques for extracting these collections as digital
           libraries targeted for particular users and uses.7

  graph, so all web crawlers use graph traversal algorithms
  to find URIs of web resources and then add any
  hyperlink they find to the list of URIs they visit. The
  sheer size of the web makes crawling its pages a
  bandwidth- and computation intensive process, and
  since some pages change frequently and others not at
  all, an effective crawler must be smart at how it
  prioritizes the pages it collects and how it re-crawls
  pages. A web crawler for a search engine can determine
  the most relevant, popular, and credible pages from
  query logs and visit them more often. For other sites, a
  crawler adjusts its "revisit frequency" based on the
  "change frequency" (Cho and Garcia-Molina 2000).
7. Web resources are typically discovered by
  computerized "web crawlers" that find them by following
  links in a methodical automated manner. Web crawlers
  can be used to create topic-based or domain-specific

Scientific and business data are ideally selected after assessments
of their quality and their relevance to answering specific questions.
But this is easy to say and hard to do. It is essential to assess
the quality of individual data items to find data entry problems
such as misspellings and duplicate records, or data values that are
illegal, statistical outliers, or otherwise suspicious. It is also essential
to assess the quality of data as a collection to determine if there
are problems in what data was collected, by whom or how it was
collected and managed, the format and precision in which it is
stored, whether the schema governing each instance is rigorous
enough, and whether the collection is complete. In addition,
copyright, licensing, consumer protection laws, competitive
considerations, or simply the lack of incentives to share resources

collections of web resources by changing the "breadth-
first" policy of generic crawlers to a "best-first"
approach. Such "focused crawlers" only visit pages that
have a high probability of being relevant to the topic or
domain, which can be estimated by analyzing the
similarity of the text of the linking and linked pages,
terms in the linked page's URI, or locating explicit
semantic annotation that describes their content or
their interfaces if they are invokable services (Bergmark
et al. 2002), (Ding et al. 2004).

                                                                      Selecting Resources | 167
   make it difficult to obtain the best or most appropriate resources.8
   (See the sidebar, Assessing and Addressing Data Quality)

   In some domains, the nature of the resources or the goals they are
   intended to satisfy imply selection criteria that are inherently less
   quantifiable and more subjective. This is easy to see in personal
   collections, where selection criteria can be unconventional,
   idiosyncratic, or otherwise biased by the subjective perspective and
   experience of the collector. Most of the clothes and shoes you own
   have a reason for being in your closet, but could anyone else explain
   the contents of your closet and its organizing system, and why you
   bought that crazy-looking dress or shirt?

   Both libraries and museums typically formalize their selection
   principles in collection development policies that establish priorities
   for acquiring resources that reflect the people they serve and the
   services they provide to them. The diversity of user types in public
   libraries and many museums implies that narrowly-targeted criteria
   would produce a collection of resources that would fail to satisfy
   many of the users. As a result, libraries typically select resources
   on the basis of broader criteria like their utility and relevance to
   their user populations, and try to choose resources that add the
   most value to their existing collections, given the cost constraints
   that most libraries are currently facing. Museums often emphasize

   consumer data collected for one purpose cannot be used
   for other purposes without the consumer's consent.

    168 | Selecting Resources
   intrinsic value, scarcity, or uniqueness as selection criteria, even if
   the resources lack any contemporary use.9

   Even when selection criteria can be measured and evaluated in
   isolation, they are often incompatible or difficult to satisfy in

9. Large research libraries have historically viewed their
   collections as their intellectual capital and have policies
   that specify the subjects and sources that they intend
   to emphasize as they build their collections. See (Evans
   2000). Museums are often wary of accepting items that
   might not have been legally acquired or that have claims
   on them from donor heirs or descendant groups; in the
   USA, much controversy exists because museums contain
   many human skeletal remains and artifacts that Native
   American groups want to be repatriated.

   Adding a resource to a museum implies an obligation to
   preserve it forever, so many museums follow rigorous
   accessioning procedures before accepting it. Likewise,
   archives usually perform an additional appraisal step to
   determine the quality and value of materials offered to
   them.

   In archives, common appraisal criteria include
   uniqueness, the credibility of the source, the extent of
   documentation, and the rights and potential for reuse.
   To oversimplify: libraries decide what to keep, museums
   decide what to accept, and archives decide what to throw
   away.

                                                                          Selecting Resources | 169
combination. It would be desirable for data to be timely, accurate,
complete, and consistent, but these criteria trade off against one
other, and any prioritization that values one criterion over another
is somewhat subjective. In addition, explicitly subjective perceptions
of resource quality are hard to ignore; people are inclined to choose
resources that come in attractive packages or that are sold and
supported by attractive and friendly people.

Many of the examples in this section have involved selection
principles whose purpose was to create a collection of desirable,
rare, skilled, or otherwise distinctive resources. After all, no one
would visit a museum whose artifacts were ordinary, and no one
would watch a sports team made up of randomly chosen athletes
because it could never win. However, choosing resources by
randomly sampling from a large population is essential if your goal is
to make inferences about it without having to study all its instances.
Sampling is especially necessary with very large populations when
timely decisions are required. A good sample for statistical purposes
is one in which the selected resources are not different in any
important way from the ones that were not selected.

Sampling is also important when large numbers of resources need
to be selected to satisfy functional requirements. A manufacturer
cannot test every part arriving at the factory, but might randomly
test some of them from different shipments to ensure that parts
satisfy their acceptance criteria.

Looking "Upstream" and "Downstream" to Select
Resources

As we have seen, selection principles and activities differ across
resource domains, and there is another important difference in
selection that considers resources from the perspective of their
history or the future.

170 | Selecting Resources
In "Selection Criteria" we discussed the activity of selecting
resources by assessing their conformance with specifications for
required properties or capabilities. However, if you can determine
where the resources come from, you can make better selection
decisions by evaluating the people, processes, and organizing
systems that create them. Using the analogy of a river, we can
follow a resource "upstream" from us until we find the "headwaters."
Physical resources might have their headwaters in a factory, farm,
or artist's studio. Digital resources might have headwaters in a
government agency, a scientist's laboratory, or a web-based
commerce site.

When interaction resources ("The Concept of "Interaction
Resource"") are incorporated into the organizing system that
creates them, as when records of a person's choices and behaviors
are used to personalize subsequent information, the headwaters
are obviously easy to find. However, even though finding the
headwaters where resources come from is often not easy and
sometimes not possible, that is where you are most likely to find
the people best able to answer the questions, described in Design
Decisions in Organizing Systems, that define any organizing system.
The resource creators or producers will know the assumptions and
tradeoffs they made that influence whether the resources will
satisfy your requirements, and you can assess what they (or their
documents that describe the resources) tell you and the credibility
they have in telling it. You should also try to evaluate the processes
or algorithms that produce the resources, and then decide if they
are capable of yielding resources of acceptable quality.

The best outcome is to find a credible supplier of good quality
resources. However, if an otherwise desirable supplier does not
currently produce resources of sufficient quality, it is worth trying
to improve the quality by changing the process using instruction
or incentives. Advocates for open government have succeeded in
getting numerous US government entities to publish data for free in
machine-readable formats, but it was partly as a result of somewhat

                                                                       Selecting Resources | 171
subversive demonstration projects and shaming that the
government finally created data.gov in 2009. A clear lesson from
the "quality movement" and statistical process control is that
interventions that fix quality problems at their source are almost
always a better investment than repeated work to fix problems
that were preventable (see endnote10). But if you cannot find the
headwaters or you are not able to address quality problems at their
source, you can sometimes transform the resources to give them
the characteristics or quality they need.11 (See the sidebar, Assessing
and Addressing Data Quality, and "Transforming Resources for
Interactions".)

          Assessing and Addressing Data Quality
          If an organizing system uses data acquired from some
       external source, it is essential to assess its quality as an
       "intake" process. Ideally, the data comes with a schema
       that explicitly specifies what is expected, including legal
       structures, data types, and values (See "Structuring

10. [link to footnote]

11. See (Tauberer 2014) for a history of the "civic hacking"
   and the open data movement.

(https://www.codeforamerica.org/) are good sources for

Descriptions"). This intake process runs tests that find
problems and then runs processes to fix the problems.

   There are a great many techniques for finding
problems in numeric and string data. Some problems
like missing data, duplicate records, spelling mistakes,
and extreme or "outlier" values are easy to detect. A
credit card charge for $10,000,000 is obviously a bad
piece of data in a college student's account. Detecting
anomalous and duplicate data is especially important
because including them can produce misleading
statistics and predictions, as well as creating the
nuisance for consumers of receiving multiple copies of
product catalogs, each with a different misspelling in a
name or address.

   Sometimes a dataset is valid with respect to its own
specification but becomes problematical when it is
combined with another dataset that has a different
specification. Entities in the two datasets might not be
described using the same units at the same point in
time. So instead of analyzing and repairing resource
instances, data cleaning must now be applied to every
resource in a dataset, as when every "Zip Code" in a
United States mailing directory is given the more
universal "Postal Code" label, or when datasets using
DD/MM/YY and MM/DD/YY formats for dates are
combined.

   Other data quality problems are harder to detect
because they are contextual; a data value might be valid
in some contexts but the same value might be invalid in
others. For example, if you live in San Francisco and
your credit card is used for transactions in Barcelona or

                                                              Selecting Resources | 173
            Berlin, it could be fraud, or maybe you are on vacation.
            Similarly, high or low ratings for business
            establishments on sites like Yelp might be appropriate
            responses to excellent or poor service, but might also
            reflect "pay for rating" manipulation in the former case,
            and efforts by competitors to undermine rival
            businesses in the latter.12

     When you cannot obtain resources directly from their source, even
     if you have confidence in their quality at that point, it is important to
     analyze any evidence or records of their use or interactions as they
     flow downstream. (See "Resources over Time") Physical resources
     are often associated with printed or digital documents that make
     claims about their origin and authenticity, and often have bar codes,
     RFID tags, or other technological mechanisms that enable them
     to be tracked from their headwaters to the places where they are
     used. Tracking is very important for data resources because they
     can often be added to, derived from, or otherwise changed without

leaving visible traces. Just as the water from melted mountain snow
becomes less pure as its flows downstream, a data resource can
become "dirty" or "noisy" over time, reducing its quality from the
perspective of another person or computational agent further
downstream. Data often gets dirty when it is combined with other
datasets that contain duplicate or seemingly-duplicate information.
Data can also become dirty when the hardware or software that
stores it changes. Subtle differences in representation formats,
transaction management, enforcement of integrity constraints, and
calculations of derived values can change the original data.

In addition, a data resource can become inaccurate or obsolete
simply because the world that the data describes has changed with
the passage of time. People move, change jobs, get married or
divorced, or die. Likewise, companies move, merge, get spun off, or
go out of business. A poll taken a year before an election is often not
a good predictor of the ultimate winner.13

Other selection processes look "downstream" to select resources
on the basis of predicted rather than current properties, capability,
or suitability. Sports teams often sign promising athletes for their
minor league teams, and businesses hire interns, train their
employees, and run executive development programs to prepare
promising low-level managers for executive roles. Businesses
sometimes conduct experiments with variable product offers and
pricing to collect data they will need in the future to power
predictive models that will repay the investment in data acquisition
many times over.

 21. Organizing Resources

   Organizing systems arrange resources according to many different
   principles. In libraries, museums, businesses, government agencies
   and other long-lived institutions, organizing principles are typically
   documented as cataloging rules, information management policies,
   or other explicit and systematic procedures so that different people
   can apply them consistently over time. In contrast, the principles for
   arranging resources in personal or small-scale organizing systems
   are usually informal and often inconsistent or conflicting.

             Property
             In this book we use property in a generic and ordinary
          sense as a synonym for feature or "characteristic." Many
          cognitive and computer scientists are more precise in
          defining these terms and reserve property for binary
          predicates (e.g., something is red or not, round or not). If
          multiple values are possible, the property is called an
          attribute, "dimension," or "variable." Feature is used in
          data science and machine learning contexts for both
          "raw" or observable variables and "latent" ones,
          extracted or constructed from the original set.1

   For most types of resources, any number of principles could be

1. See (Barsalou and Hale 1983) for a rigorous contrast
  between feature lists and other representational
  formalisms in models of human categories.

                                                                        Organizing Resources | 177
   used as the basis for their organization depending on the answers
   to the "why?" ("Why Is It Being Organized?"), "how much?" ("How
   Much Is It Being Organized?"), and "how?" ("How (or by Whom) Is
   It Organized?") questions posed in Design Decisions in Organizing
   Systems.

   A simple principle for organizing resources is colocation --putting all
   the resources in the same location: in the same container, on the same
   shelf, or in the same email in-box. However, most organizing systems
   use principles that are based on specific resource properties or
   properties derived from the collection as a whole. What properties
   are significant and how to think about them depends on the number
   of resources being organized, the purposes for which they are being
   organized, and on the experiences and implicit or explicit biases of
   the intended users of the organizing system. The implementation of
   the organizing system also shapes the need for, and the nature of,
   the resource properties.2

              Classification Biases
              Libraries and bookstores use different classification

2. For example, a personal or small organizing system would
   typically use properties that are easy to identify and
   understand. In contrast, an organizing system for very
   large collections of resources, or data about them, would
   choose properties that are statistically optimal, even if
   they are not interpretable by people, because of the
   greater need for operational efficiency and predictive
   accuracy.

    178 | Organizing Resources
           systems. The kitchen in a restaurant is not organized
           like a home kitchen because professional cooks think of
           cooking differently than ordinary people do. Scientists
           use the Latin or binomial (genus + species) scheme for
           identifying and classifying living things to avoid the
           ambiguities and inconsistencies of common names,
           which differ across languages and often within different
           regions in a single language community.

   Many resource collections acquire resources one at a time or in
   sets of related resources that can initially be treated the same way.
   Therefore, it is natural to arrange resources based on properties
   that can be assessed and interpreted when the resource becomes
   part of the collection.

   "Subject matter" organization involves the use of a classification
   system that provides categories and descriptive terms for indicating
   what a resource is about. Because they use aboutness properties
   that are not directly perceived, methods for assigning subject
   classifications are intellectually-intensive and in many cases require
   rigorous training to be performed consistently and appropriately.3

   Nevertheless, the cost and time required for this human effort
   motivates the use of computational techniques for organizing
   resources.

   As computing power steadily increases, the bias toward
   computational organization gets even stronger. However, an
   important concern arises when computational methods for
   organizing resources use so-called "black box" methods that create
   resource descriptions and organizing principles that are not
   inspectable or interpretable by people. In some applications more
   efficient information retrieval or question answering, more accurate
   predictions, or more personalized recommendations justify making
   the tradeoff. But comprehensibility is critical in many medical,
   military, financial, or scientific applications, where trusting a
   prediction can have life or death implications or cause substantial
   time or money to be spent.4

  Organizing Physical Resources

   When the resources being arranged are physical or tangible
   things--such as books, paintings, animals, or cooking pots--any
   resource can be in only one place at a time in libraries, museums,
   zoos, or kitchens. Similarly, when organizing involves recording
   information in a physical medium--carving in stone, imprinting in
   clay, applying ink to paper by hand or with a printing press--how

   which differ across languages and often within different
   regions in a single language community.

4. (Freitas 2014) and (Burrell 2015).

    180 | Organizing Resources
   this information can be organized is subject to the intrinsic
   properties and constraints of physical things.

   The inescapable tangibility of physical resources means that their
   organizing systems are often strongly influenced by the material
   or medium in which the resources are presented or represented.
   For example, museums generally collect original artifacts and their
   collections are commonly organized according to the type of thing
   being collected. There are art museums, sculpture museums, craft
   museums, toy museums, science museums, and so on.

   Similarly, because they have different material manifestations, we
   usually organize our printed books in a different location than our
   record albums, which might be near but remain separate from our
   CDs and DVDs. This is partly because the storage environments for
   physical resources (shelves, cabinets, closets, and so on) have co-
   evolved with the physical resources they store.5

   The resource collections of organizing systems in physical
   environments often grow to fit the size of the environment or place
   in which they are maintained--the bookshelf, closet, warehouse,
   library or museum building. Their scale can be large: the
   Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., the world's largest
   museum and research complex, consists of 19 museums, 9 research
   facilities, a zoo and a library with 1.5 million books. However, at
   some point, any physical space gets too crowded, and it is difficult
   and expensive to add new floors or galleries to an existing library or
   museum.

5. Many of the ancient libraries in Greece and Rome have
   been identified by archaeologists by characteristic
   architectural features (Casson 2002). See also (Battles
   2003).

                                                                        Organizing Resources | 181
          Organizing People into Businesses
          How people are organized into businesses is the
       essence of the discipline of management, and different
       aspects are taught in industrial organization and
       behavior, operations, entrepreneurship, and other
       courses. Organizing people in a business is often called
       "human resource management," and many of the
       principles for organizing physical resources and
       information resources apply to organizing people.
          In addition, economics, strategy, and business culture
       are important considerations. There are a huge number
       of ways to organize people that differ in the extent of
       hierarchical structure, the flow of information up and
       down the hierarchy, the span of control for managers,
       and the discretion people have to deviate or innovate
       with respect to the work they have been assigned to do.
       For example, we can contrast law firms with a hierarchy
       of partners, associates, and paralegals with the self-
       management "holacracy" that companies like Zappos
       have experimented with, in which authority and
       decision-making are highly distributed among the
       employees.
          Regardless of how the firm is organized, we can
       analyze it using economist Ronald Coase's idea of
       "transaction costs," which a business incurs in searching
       for and negotiating with suppliers, business partners,
       and customers, and in particular we can consider how
       new information and computing technologies reduce

182 | Organizing Resources
           these costs to make the firm more efficient while
           remaining flexible.6

  Organizing with Properties of Physical Resources

   Physical resources are often organized according to intrinsic
   physical properties like their size, color, or shape, because the
   human visual system automatically pays a lot of attention to them.
   This inescapable aspect of visual perception was first formalized
   by German psychologists starting a century ago as the Gestalt
   principles (see the sidebar, Gestalt Principles). Likewise, because
   people have limited attentional capacity, we ignore a lot of the
   ongoing complexity of visual (and auditory) stimulation, making us
   perceive our sensory world as simpler than it really is. Taken
   together, these two ideas explain why we automatically or "pre-
   attentively" organize separate things we see as groups or patterns
   based on their proximity and similarity. They also explain why
   arranging physical resources using these quickly perceived
   attributes can seem more aesthetic or satisfying than organizing
   them using properties that take more time to understand. Look
   at the cover of this book; the most organized arrangement of the
   colors and shapes just jumps out at you more than the others.

              Gestalt Principles
              Psychologists Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Kohler, and
           Kurt Koffka proposed several principles--proximity,
           similarity, continuity, connection, enclosure, and
           closure--that explain how our visual system imposes
           order on what it sees. There are always multiple
           interpretations of the sensory stimuli gathered by our
           visual system, but the mind imposes the simplest ones:
           things near each other are grouped, complex shapes are
           viewed as simple shapes that are overlapping, missing
           information needed to see separate visual patterns as
           continuous or whole is filled in, and ambiguous figure-
           ground illusions are given one interpretation at a time.
              Koffka's pithy way of explaining the core idea of all the
           principles was that "The whole is other than the sum of
           the parts," which has been distorted over time to the
           cliché that "the whole is more than the sum of the
           parts."7
              Designers of graphics and information visualizations
           rely on Gestalt rules because the automatic

7. The Gestalt principles are a staple in every
  introductory psychology textbook, but the classic text
  (Koffka 1935) has recently been reprinted. A group of
  distinguished contemporary researchers in visual
  perception (Wagemans et al, 2012) recently reviewed the
  history and impact of Gestalt psychology on their
  hundredth birthday.

   184 | Organizing Resources
           interpretations created by the human visual system
           enable their designs to be understood more quickly.
           This of course implies that designs that violate the
           Gestalt rules will be harder to understand.
           Camouflage--the use of disruptive coloration, colors and
           patterns that resemble backgrounds, countershading,
           shadow elimination, and similar techniques that make it
           difficult for the visual system to detect objects and
           edges--proves the power of Gestalt processing.8

              Gestalt Similarity in Action

              This simple example of
           a list of files illustrates
           the Gestalt similarity

       distinguish files from folders, and file types from each
       other. These interpretations do not require you to be
       able to read the labels, although the visual similarity of
       the names suggests some similarity of content.

Physical resources are also commonly organized using intrinsically
associated properties such as the place and time they were created
or discovered. The shirts in your clothes closet might be arranged
by color, by fabric, or style. We can view dress shirts, T-shirts,
Hawaiian shirts and other styles as configurations of shirt
properties that are so frequent and familiar that they have become
linguistic and cultural categories. Other people might think about
these same properties or categories differently, using a greater or
lesser number of colors or ordering them differently, sorting the
shirts by style first and then by color, or vice versa.

In addition to, or instead of, physical properties of your shirts,
you might employ behavioral or usage-based properties to arrange
them. You might separate your party and Hawaiian shirts from those
you wear to the office. You might put the shirts you wear most often
in the front of the closet so they are easy to locate. Unlike intrinsic
properties of resources, which do not change, behavioral or usage-
based properties are dynamic. You might move to Hawaii, where you
can wear Hawaiian shirts to the office, or you could get tired of what
were once your favorite shirts and stop wearing them as often as
you used to.

Some arrangements of physical resources are constrained or
precluded by resource properties that might cause problems for
other resources or for their users. Hazardous or flammable
materials should not be stored where they might spill or ignite;
lions and antelopes should not share the same zoo habitat or the

former will eat the latter; adult books and movies should not be
kept in a library where children might accidentally find them; and
people who are confrontational, passive aggressive, or arrogant do
not make good team members when tough decisions need to be
made. For almost any resource, it seems possible to imagine a
combination with another resource that might have unfortunate
consequences. We have no shortage of professional certifications,
building codes, MPAA movie ratings, and other types of laws and
regulations designed to keep us safe from potentially dangerous
resources.

Organizing with Descriptions of Physical Resources

To overcome the inherent constraints with organizing physical
resources, organizing systems often use additional physical
resources that describe the primary physical ones, with the library
card catalog being the classic example. A specific physical resource
might be in a particular place, but multiple description resources for
it can be in many different places at the same time.

          Library catalogs were managed as collections of
       printed cards for much of the 20th century, and the
       wooden cabinets that contained them were ubiquitous
       functional furniture in every library. Today such
       cabinets are often considered "retro" or antique
       treasures.

       Library and Information Studies at the University of
       California, Berkeley. The card describes a book about
       the monastic libraries of Wales, which like the library in
       which this card came from are no longer in existence.

          (Photo by R. Glushko.)

When the description resources are themselves digital, as when a
printed library card catalog is put online, the additional layer of
abstraction created enables additional organizing possibilities that
can ignore physical properties of resources and many of the details
about how they are stored.

In organizing systems that use additional resources to identify or
describe primary ones, "adding to a collection" is a logical act that
need not require any actual movement, copying, or reorganization
of the primary resources. This virtual addition allows the same
resources to be part of many collections at the same time; the same
book can be listed in many bibliographies, the same web page can
be in many lists of web bookmarks and have incoming links from
many different pages, and a publisher's digital article repository can
be licensed to any number of libraries.

                                                                   Organizing Resources | 189
Organizing Places

Places are physical resources, but unlike the previous two
subsections where we treat the environment as given (the library or
museum building, the card catalog or bookshelf) and discuss how
we organize resources like books in that environment, we can take
an alternative perspective and discuss how we design that physical
environment. These environments could be any of the following:

  · The land itself, as when we lay out city plans when organizing
      how people live together and interact in cities.

  · A "built environment," a human-made space, particular
      building, or a set of connected spaces and buildings. A built
      environment could be a museum, airport, hospital, casino,
      department store, farm, road system, or any kind of building or
      space where resources are arranged and people interact with
      them.

  · The orientation and navigation aids that enable users to
      understand and interact in built environments. These are
      resource descriptions that support the interaction
      requirements of the users.

These are not entirely separable contexts, but they are easier to
discuss as if they are considered as such.

Organizing the Land

Cities naturally emerge in places that can support life and
commerce. Almost all major cities are built on coasts or rivers
because water provides sustenance, transportation and commercial
links, and power to enable industry. Many very old cities have
crowded and convoluted street plans that do not seem intentionally

190 | Organizing Resources
   organized, but grid plans in cities also have a very long history.
   Cities in the Middle East were laid out in rough grids as far back as
   2000+ BCE. Using long axes was a way to create an impression of
   importance and power.

   Because the United States, and especially the American West, was
   not heavily settled until much more recently compared to most of
   Europe and Asia, it was a place for people to experiment with new
   ideas in urban design. The natural human tendency to impose order
   on habitation location had ample room to do just that. The easiest
   and most efficient way to organize space is using a coordinate
   grid, with streets intersecting at perpendicular angles. Salt Lake
   City, Albuquerque, Phoenix, and Seattle are notable examples of
   grid cities. An interesting hybrid structure exists in Washington DC,
   which has radiating diagonal avenues overlaid on a grid.9

9. Salt Lake City takes the use of a grid to an extreme
   because the central area is extremely flat. Streets are
   named by numbers and letters, so you might find yourself
   at the intersection of "North A Street" and "3rd Avenue
   N," or at the intersection of "W 100 S" and "S 200 W."
   It is a little creepy to think that your street address is a
   pinpoint location in the big grid.

   In contrast, Seattle imposes the grid in an abstract way,
   ignoring the fact that there are many lakes, rivers, and
   hills that break up the grid. Streets keep the same names
   even though they are not connected, and the grid
   stretches for many miles out from its origin in Seattle.
   You can be up in the mountains at the corner of "294th
   Avenue SE" and "472nd Street SE," giving you precise

                                                                        Organizing Resources | 191
Organizing Built Environments

Built environments influence the expectations, behaviors, and
experiences of everyone who enters the space--employees, visitors,
customers, and inhabitants are all subject to the design of the
spaces they occupy. These environments can be designed to
encourage or discourage interactions between people, to create a
sense of freedom or confinement, to reward exploration or enforce
efficiency, and of course, much much more. The arrangement of

information about your location and nearly 50 mile
distance from downtown Seattle.

(See also Pierre Charles L'Enfant's plan for DC at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Pierre_Charles_L%27Enfant)

This is not to say that imposing arbitrary grids on top
of a physical environment to create a simple and easily
understood organization is always desirable. It is
essential that any organization imposed on a region be
sensitive to any social, cultural, linguistic, ethnic, or
religious organizing systems already in place. Much of
the recent conflict and instability in the Middle East can
be attributed to the implausibly straight line borders
drawn by the French and British to carve up the defeated
Ottoman Empire a century ago. Because the newly-
created countries of Syria and Iraq lacked ethnic and
religious cohesion, they could only be held together by
dictatorships. (Trofimov 2015)

192 | Organizing Resources
the resources in a built environment also encourages or discourages
interactions, and sometimes the built environment is designed with
a specific collection of resources in mind to enable and reinforce
some particular interaction goals or policies.

If we contrast the built environments of museums, airports, and
casinos, and the way in which each of them facilitates or constrains
interactions are more obvious. Museums are often housed in
buildings designed as architectural monuments that over time
become symbols of national, civic, or cultural identity. Many old art
museums mimic classical architecture, with grand stairs flanked by
tall columns. They have large and dramatic entry halls that invite
visitors inside. Modern museums are decidedly less traditional, and
some people complain that the architecture of modern art
museums can overshadow the art collection contained within
because people are induced to pay more attention to the building
than to its contents.

Some recently built airports have been designed with architectural
flair, but airport design is more concerned with efficiency,
walkability (maybe with the aid of moving walkways), navigability,
and basic comfort for travelers getting in and out the airport. Wide
walkways, multiple staircases, and people movers whose doors open
in one direction at a time, all encourage people to move in certain
directions, sometimes without the people even realizing they are
being directed.

If you have ever been lost in a casino or had trouble finding the exit
you can be sure you experienced a casino that achieved its main
design goals: keeping people inside and making it easy for them to
lose track of time because they lack both windows and clocks. As
American architect Robert Venturi points out, "The intricate maze
under the low ceiling never connects with outside light or outside

                                                                   Organizing Resources | 193
     space...This disorients the occupant in space and time... He loses
     track of where he is and when it is."10

     If one accepts the premise that values and bias are at work in
     decisions about organizing systems, it is difficult not to see it in
     built environments. Consider queue design in banks, supermarkets,
     or boarding airplanes. Assuming that it is desirable to organize
     people efficiently to minimize wait times and crowding, how should
     the queue be designed? How many categories of people should
     there be? What is the basis for the categories?

     It may be uncontroversial to include several express lanes in a
     supermarket checkout, because people can choose to buy fewer
     items if they do not want to wait. Similarly, it seems essential for
     hospital emergency rooms to have a triage policy that selects
     patients from the emergency room queue based on their likely
     benefit from immediate medical attention.

     However, consider the dynamic created by queue design at
     Disneyland to give priority to people with physical limitations and
     disabilities. This seemingly socially respectful decision was
     exploited by a devious collaboration between disabled people and
     wealthy non-disabled people who hired them to pose as family
     members, enabling the entire "family" to cut ahead of everyone else.
     In response, Disney modified the policy favoring disabled patrons,
     causing numerous complaints about Disney's insensitivity to their
     concerns.11

    (Venturi 1972)

11. The number of queues, their locations and their layout
    (if spatial) is referred to as the "queue configuration."

      194 | Organizing Resources
     There are many other examples of how values and biases become
     part of built environments. In the mid-20th century the road
     systems of Long Island in New York were designed with low
     overpasses, which prevented public buses from passing under them,
     effectively segregating the beaches. The trend in college campus
     design after the student protests of the 1960s and 1970s was to
     create layouts that would prevent or frustrate large
     demonstrations.12

    The "queue discipline" is the policy for selecting the next
    customer from the queue Most common discipline is
    "First come, first served." Frequent, higher-paying, or
    some other customer segment might have their own
    queue with FCFS applied within it.

12. The designer of the road system, Robert Moses, heralded
    as the master builder of mid-20th century New York City,
    built roads to enforce his idea of who should frequent
    Long Island (affluent whites). The overpasses were
    intentionally designed with clearances (often around nine
    feet) that were too low for public buses. Consequently,
    low-income bus riders (largely people of color) had no
    way to get to beaches. See (Winner 1980).

                                                                         Organizing Resources | 195
   Orientation and Wayfinding Mechanisms

     It is easy to move through an environment and stay oriented if the
     design is simple and consistent, but most built environments must
     include additional features or descriptions to assist people in these
     tasks. Distinctive architectural elements can create landmarks for
     orientation, and spaces can be differentiated with color, lighting,
     furnishings, or other means. More ubiquitous mechanisms include
     signs, room numbers, or directional arrows highlighting the way and
     distance to important destinations.
     In airports, for example, there are many orientation signs and
     display terminals that help passengers find their departure gates,
     baggage, or ground transportation services. In contrast, casinos
     provide little orientation and navigation support because increased
     confusion leads to lengthier visits, and more gambling on the part of
     the casino's visitors.
     A recent innovation in wayfinding and orientation mechanisms is
     to give them sensing and communication capabilities so they can
     identify people by their smartphones and then provide personalized
     directions or information. These so-called "beacon" systems have
     been deployed at numerous airports, including London's Gatwick,
     San Francisco, and Miami. 13

   Organizing Digital Resources

     Organizing systems that arrange digital resources like digital
     documents or information services have some important
     differences from those that organize physical resources. Because
     digital resources can be easily copied or interlinked, they are free
     from the "one place at a time" limitation.14 The actual storage
     locations for digital resources are no longer visible or very
     important. It hardly matters if a digital document or video resides
     on a computer in Berkeley or Bangalore if it can be located and
     accessed efficiently.15

14. In principle, it is easy to make perfect copies of digital
    resources. In practice, however, many industries employ
    a wide range of technologies including digital rights
    management, watermarking, and license servers to
    prevent copying of documents, music or video files, and
    other digital resources. The degree of copying allowed
    in digital organizing systems is a design choice that is
    shaped by law.

15. Web-based or "cloud" services are invoked through URIs,
    and good design practice makes them permanent even
    if the implementation or location of the resource they
    identify changes (Berners-Lee 1998). Digital resources
    are often replicated in content delivery networks to
    improve performance, reliability, scalability, and security
    (Pathan et al. 2008); the web pages served by a busy site

                                                                         Organizing Resources | 197
     Moreover, because the functions and capabilities of digital
     resources are not directly manifested as physical properties, the
     constraints imposed on all material objects do not matter to digital
     content in many circumstances.16

    might actually be delivered from different parts of the
    world, depending on where the accessing user is located.

16. Whether a digital resource seems intangible or tangible
    depends on the scale of the digital collection and
    whether we focus on individual resources or the entire
    collection. An email message is an identified digital
    resource in a standard format, RFC 2822 (Resnick 2001).
    We can compare different email systems according to the
    kinds of interactions they support and how easy it is to
    carry them out, but how email resources are represented
    does not matter to us and they surely seem intangible.
    Similarly, the organizing system we use to manage email
    might employ a complex hierarchy of folders or just a
    single searchable in-box, but whether that organization
    is implemented in the computer or smart phone we use
    for email or exists somewhere "in the cloud" for web-
    based email does not much matter to us either. An email
    message is tangible when we print it on paper, but all
    that matters then is that there is well-defined mapping
    between the different representations of the abstract
    email resource.

    On the other hand, at the scale at which Google and

               Materiality
               An emerging issue in the field of digital humanities is
            the requirement to recognize the materiality of the
            environment that enables people to create and interact
            with digital resources Even if the resources themselves
            are intangible, it can be necessary to study and preserve
            the technological and social context in which they exist
            to fully understand them.17

    An organizing system for digital resources can also use digital

    Microsoft handle billions of email messages in their Gmail
    and Hotmail services the implementation of the email
    organizing system is extremely relevant and involves
    many tangible considerations. The location and design of
    data centers, the configuration of processors and storage
    devices, the network capacity for delivering messages,
    whether messages and folder structures are server or
    client based, and numerous other considerations
    contribute to the quality of service that we experience
    when we interact with the email organizing system.
17. (Schreibman, Siemens, and Unsworth 2005) and
    (Leonardi 2010). For example, a "Born-Digital Archives"
    program at Emory University is preserving a collection
    of the author Salman Rushdie's work that includes his
    four personal computers and an external hard drive.
    (Kirschenbaum 2008), and (Kirschenbaum et al. 2009).

                                                                         Organizing Resources | 199
     description resources that are associated with them. Since the
     incremental costs of adding processing and storage capacity to
     digital organizing systems are small, collections of both primary
     digital resources and description resources can be arbitrarily large.
     Digital organizing systems can support collections and interactions
     at a scale that is impossible in organizing systems that are entirely
     physical, and they can implement services and functions that exploit
     the exponentially growing processing, storage and communication
     capabilities available today. This all sounds good, unless you are
     the small local business with limited onsite inventory that cannot
     compete with global web retailers that offer many more choices
     from a network of warehouses.18

     There are inherently more arrangements of digital resources than
     there are for physical ones, but this difference emerges because
     of multiple implementation platforms for the organizing system as
     much as in the nature of the resources. Nevertheless, the organizing
     systems for digital books, music and video collections often

18. For example, a car dealer might be able to keep track of
    a few dozen new and used cars on his lot even without
    a computerized inventory system, but web-based
    AutoTrader.com offered more than 2,000,000 cars in
    2012. The cars are physical resources where they are
    located in the world, but they are represented in the
    AutoTrader.com organizing system as digital resources,
    and cars can be searched for using any combination of
    the many resource properties in the car listings: price,
    body style, make, model, year, mileage, color, location,
    and even specific car features like sunroofs or heated
    seats.

     200 | Organizing Resources
     maintain the distinctions embodied in the organizing system for
     physical resources because it enables their co-existence or simply
     because of legacy inertia. As a result, the organizing systems for
     collections of digital resources tend to be coarsely distinguished by
     media type (e.g., document management, digital music collection,
     digital video collection, digital photo collection, etc.).

     Information resources in either physical or digital form are typically
     organized using intrinsic properties like author names, creation
     dates, publisher, or the set of words that they contain. Information
     resources can also be organized using assigned properties like
     subject classifications, names, or identifiers. Information resources
     can also be organized using behavioral or transactional properties
     collected about individuals or about groups of people with similar
     interaction histories. For example, Amazon and Netflix use browsing
     and purchasing behavior to make book and movie
     recommendations.19

19. Even when organizing principles such as alphabetical,
    chronological, or numerical ordering do not explicitly
    consider physical properties, how the resources are
    arranged in the "storage tier" of the organizing system
    can still be constrained by their physical properties and
    by the physical characteristics of the environments in
    which they are arranged. Books can only be stacked so
    high whether they are arranged alphabetically or by
    frequency of use, and large picture books often end up
    on the taller bottom shelf of bookcases because that is
    the only shelf they fit. Nevertheless, it is important to
    treat these idiosyncratic outcomes in physical storage as

                                                                         Organizing Resources | 201
Complex organization and interactions are possible when
organizing systems with digital resources are based on the data
type or data model of the digital content (e.g., text, numeric,
multimedia, statistical, geospatial, logical, scientific, personnel, and
so on).

Interactions with numeric data can be further distinguished
according to the levels of measurement embodied in the number,
which determine how much quantitative processing makes sense:

  · Nominal level data uses a number as an identifier for an
      instance or a category to distinguish it from other ones.
      Products in a catalog might have numbers associated with
      them, but the products have no intrinsic order, so no
      measurements using the numbers are meaningful other than
      the frequency with which they occur in the dataset. The most
      frequently occurring value is called the mode.

  · Ordinal level data indicates a direction or ranking on some
      naturally ordered scale. We know that the first place finisher
      in a race came in ahead of the second place one, who finished
      ahead of the third place finisher, but this result conveys no
      information about the spacing among the racers at the finish
      line. The middle value in a sorted list is the median.

  · Interval level data conveys order information, but in addition,
      the values that subdivide the scale are equally spaced. This
      makes it meaningful to calculate the distance between values,
      the mean or average value (the value for which the sum of its
      absolute distances to each other value is zero), the standard
      deviation, and other descriptive statistics about the data.

exceptions and not let them distort the choice of the
organizing principles in the "logic tier."

202 | Organizing Resources
  · Ratio level data is interval data with a fixed zero point, which
      makes assertions about proportions meaningful. $10,000 is
      twice as much as $5,000.

These distinctions are data type and levels of measurement are
often strongly identifiable with business functions: operational,
transactional, process control, and predictive analytics activities
require the most fine-grained data and quantitative measurement
scales, while strategic functions might rely on more qualitative
analyses represented in narrative text formats.

Just as there are many laws and regulations that restrict the
organization of physical resources, there are laws and regulations
that constrain the arrangements of digital ones. Many information
systems that generate or collect transactional data are prohibited
from sharing any records that identify specific people. Banking,
accounting, and legal organizing systems are made more
homogeneous by compliance and reporting standards and rules.

          Organizing Mental Resources
          Memories can be viewed either as physical (because at
       some level they are represented in the brain) or as
       digital (because they are retrieved as electrical
       impulses), but memory techniques like the method of
       loci and memory palaces reify this duality in an
       interesting way.
          While physical resources must be stored in physical
       locations, our powerful spatial memory provides an
       opportunity for us to, in a sense, store mental resources
       in physical locations. Our hippocampus, the brain
       component dedicated to memory, is highly developed
       for storing and recalling memories of physical locations.

                                                                   Organizing Resources | 203
             The ancient Greeks relied on this capability and devised
             a mnemonic system--the method of loci--which
             involved attaching things to remember, the key ideas in
             a speech perhaps, to well-known physical locations.
             While giving the speech, then, all one must do is
             imagine walking through that physical location from
             idea to idea. Today, champion memorizers use this
             technique to associate items with places in vividly
             imagined "memory palaces." While you may not be
             interested in memorizing the order of a deck of cards,
             recognizing the power of our spatial memory may be
             worth considering when designing your organizing
             system or when analyzing the successes or failures of a
             system.20

20. (Spence 1985) This memory technique has continued
     to be used since, and in addition to being found in tips
     for studying and public speaking, is applied in
     memorization competitions. For example, journalist and
     author Joshua Foer, in his book on memory and his
     journey from beginner to winning the 2006 U.S. Memory
     Championship (Foer 2011), wrote that Scott Hagwood, a
     four-time winner of the same competition, used
     locations in Architectural Digest to place his memories.

   Organizing Web-based Resources

     The Domain Name System(DNS) is the most inherent scheme for
     organizing web resources. Top-level domains for countries (.us, .jp,
     .cn, etc.) and generic resource categories (.com, .edu. .org, gov, etc.)
     provide some clues about the resources organized by a website.
     These clues are most reliable for large established enterprises and
     publishers; we know what to expect at ibm.com, Berkeley.edu,
     and sfgov.org.21

     The network of hyperlinks among web resources challenges the
     notion of a collection, because it makes it impractical to define a
     precise boundary around any collection smaller than the complete
     web.22

21. The Domain Name System(DNS) (Mockapetris 1987) is the
    hierarchical naming system that enables the assignment
    of meaningful domain names to groups of Internet
    resources. The responsibility for assigning names is
    delegated in a distributed way by the Internet
    Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers(ICANN)
    (http://www.icann.org). DNS is an essential part of the
    Web's organizing system but predates it by almost twenty
    years.

22. HTML5 defines a "manifest" mechanism for making the
    boundary around a collection of web resources explicit
    even if somewhat arbitrary to support an "offline" mode
    of interaction in which all needed resources are
    continually downloaded (http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/

                                                                         Organizing Resources | 205
     Furthermore, authors are increasingly using "web-native"
     publication models, creating networks of articles that blur the
     notions of articles and journals. For example, scientific authors are
     interconnecting scientific findings with their underlying research
     data, to discipline-specific data repositories, or to software for
     analyzing, visualizing, simulation, or otherwise interacting with the
     information.23

     The conventional library is both a collection of books and the
     physical space in which the collection is managed. On the web,
     rich hyper linking and the fact that the actual storage location of
     web resources is unimportant to the end users fundamentally
     undermine the idea that organizing systems must collect resources
     and then arrange them under local control to be effective. The
     spectacular rise during the 1990s of the AOL "walled garden,"
     created on the assumption that the open web was unreliable,
     insecure, and pernicious, was for a time a striking historical
     reminder and warning to designers of closed resource collections
     until its equally spectacular collapse in the following decade.24 But
     Facebook so far is succeeding by following a walled garden strategy.

    "Information Architecture" and Organizing Systems

     The discipline known as information architecture can be viewed as
     a specialized approach for designing the information models and

    browsers.html#offline), but many people consider it
    unreliable and subject to strange side effects.

     their systematic manifestations in user experiences on websites
     and in other information-intensive organizing systems.25 Abstract
     patterns of information content or organization are sometimes
     called architectures, so it is straightforward from the perspective
     of the discipline of organizing to define the activity of information
     architecture as designing an abstract and effective organization of
     information and then exposing that organization to facilitate
     navigation and information use. Note how the first part of this
     definition refers to intentional arrangement of resources, and the
     second to the interactions enabled by that arrangement.

     Our definition of information architecture implies a methodology
     for the design of user interfaces and interactions that puts
     conceptual modeling at the foundation. Best practices in
     information architecture emphasize the use of systematic principles
     or design patterns for organizing the resources and interactions in
     user interfaces. The logical design is then translated into a graphical
     design that arranges windows, panes, menus, and other user
     interface components. The logical and graphical organization of a
     user interface together affect how people interact with it and the
     actions they take (or do not take).

25. This definition of information architecture combines
    those in a Wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/
    wiki/Information_architecture) and in a popular book
    with the words in its title (Morville and Rosenfield 2006).
    Given the abstract elegance of "information" and
    "architecture" any definition of "information
    architecture" can seem a little feeble.

    See (Resmini and Rosati 2011) for a history of information
    architecture.

                                                                         Organizing Resources | 207
          The Activities of Information Architecture
          IA is a relatively new field, but the ubiquity of the web
       and information-intensive applications that must
       implement many types of user interactions has inspired
       many conceptual and methodological innovations. Here
       are some of them.

          Selecting Resources: To make good choices about
       what content to include in an information system or
       service, methods and tools for creating and organizing
       the information that is potentially available are
       important. Glushko and McGrath's method for creating
       a "Document Inventory" and Halvorson and Rach's
       "Information Inventory" both use a matrix or grid format
       to list information sources and various associated
       properties. Once the inventory is completed, the
       information must be evaluated with respect to the user
       and information requirements. This usually requires a
       more fine-grained analysis to choose the most reliable
       or reusable source when there are alternatives. This
       process is usually called content auditing, and tools or
       templates for organizing the work are easy to find on
       the web.

          Organizing Resources: Tidwell proposes a set of
       design patterns for input forms, text and graphic
       editors, information graphics, calendars, and other
       common types of web applications that organize
       resources. Morville and Rosenfield classify design
       patterns as "organization schemes" and "organization
       structures," reinforcing the idea that information
       architecture is a sub-specialty of the discipline of
       organizing.

                Designing Interactions: Kalbach presents design
             patterns and implementations for navigation
             interactions. Resmini and Rosati discuss architectures
             and examples for information architectures that
             interconnect physical and digital channels. Marcotte
             introduces techniques for adapting user interfaces to
             the size and capabilities of different devices, collectively
             called responsive web design.

                Information architects use a variety of tools for
             representing information and process models. Common
             ones include site maps, workflow and dataflow
             diagrams, and wireframe models. Brown's
             Communicating Design and Abel and Baillie's The
             Language of Content Strategy are concise sources.26

     Some information design conventions have become design patterns.
     Documents use headings, boxes, white space, and horizontal rules
     to organize information by type and category. Large type signifies
     more important content than small type, red type indicates an
     advisory or warning, and italics or bold says "pay attention."

     Some patterns are general and apply to an entire website, page,
     or interface genre such as a government site, e-commerce site,
     blog, social network site, home page, "about us" page, and so on.
     Other patterns are more specific and affect a part of a site or a

26. See (Halvorson and Rach 2012), (Tidwell 2008),
    (Morville and Rosenfield 2006), (Kalbach 2007), (Resmini
    and Rosati 2011), (Marcotte 2011), (Brown 2010), (Abel and
    Baillie 2014)

                                                                         Organizing Resources | 209
     single component of a page (e.g., autocompletion of a text field,
     breadcrumb menu, slideshow).

     In websites, different categories of content or interactions are
     typically arranged in different menus. The choices within each
     menu are then arranged to reflect typical workflows or ordered
     according to some commonly used property like size, percentage,
     or price.

     All design patterns reflect and reinforce the user's past experiences
     with content and interface components, and this familiarity reduces
     the cognitive complexity of user interface interaction, requiring
     users to pay less attention.27

     However, interface designers can take advantage of this familiarity
     and employ design patterns in a less beneficial way to manipulate
     users, control their behaviors, or trick them into taking actions they
     do not intend. Patterns used this way are sometimes called Dark
     Patterns.

                Dark Patterns
                Some websites and applications employ Dark
             Patterns, which rely on user familiarity with good design
             patterns to induce users to take actions or fail to take
             actions in ways counter to their best interests. For
             example, a website may exploit familiar patterns to
             induce users to click on an ad disguised as a news item,

27. Some popular collections of design patterns are (Van
    Duyne et. al, 2006), (Tidwell 2010), and http://ui-

             sign up for unwanted e-mails, disclose personal
             information, or ignore important terms and conditions
             because they are buried in tiny text or in unusual
             locations.

                Darkpatterns.org collects and classifies dark patterns.
             The largest categories are "bait and switch" (suggest one
             action but cause another), "trick questions" (misleading
             phrasing of an option), and "misdirection" (focusing
             attention on one thing to distract from another). The
             website has numerous examples of interfaces that try to
             get users to install additional software or change their
             defaults to a company's product during installation.
             Other examples are from commerce sites that conceal
             the cheapest options, add additional fees at the very end
             of the purchase process, or make it difficult to
             accurately compare costs.

                These practices are enough of a concern that some
             governments have begun to regulate the information
             that must be provided to consumers when purchasing
             digital products. The Directive on Consumer Rights
             published by the European Commission in June 2014
             contains instructions about design choices that should
             be avoided, such as allowing additional purchases and
             payments without the consumer's consent. The
             Directive even includes a model set of patterns to help
             designers comply with it.28

28. The Directives can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/

                                                                           Organizing Resources | 211
          Dark patterns can be used to manipulate interactions
       with physical resources too. Gas pumps with three or
       four grades of gasoline invariably arrange the pumps in
       order of price, with the cheapest gas at the left and the
       most expensive on the right. Some gas stations put the
       cheapest gas in the middle, which causes inattentive
       customers who are relying on the usual pattern to buy
       more expensive gas than they intended.

Many organizing systems need to support interactions to find,
identify, and select resources. Some of these systems contain both
physical and digital resources, as in a bookstore with both web and
physical channels, and many interactions are implemented across
more than one device. Both the cross-channel and multiple-device
situations create user expectations that interactions will be
consistent across these different contexts. Starting with a
conceptual model and separating content and structure from
presentation, as we discussed in "The Concept of "Organizing
Principle"", gives organizing systems more implementation
alternatives and makes them more robust in the face of technology
diversity and change.

A model-based foundation is also essential in information
visualization applications, which depict the structure and
relationships in large data collections using spatial and graphical
conventions to enable user interactions for exploration and analysis.

     properties that are more directly perceptible, information
     visualization applications enable people to obtain more information
     than they can from text displays.29

     Some designers of information systems put less emphasis on
     conceptual modeling as an "inside-out" foundation for interaction
     design and more emphasis on an "outside-in" approach that
     highlights layout and other presentation-tier considerations with
     the goal of making interactions easy and enjoyable. This focus is
     typically called user experience design, and information
     architecture methods remain an important part of it, but not
     beginning with explicit organizing principles implies more heuristic
     methods and yields less predictable results.

   Organizing With Descriptive Statistics

     Descriptive statistics, about a collection or dataset, summarize it
     concisely and can identify the properties that might be most useful
     as organizing principles. The simplest statistical description of a
     collection is how big it is; how many resources or observations does
     it contain?

     Descriptive statistics summarize a collection of resources or dataset
     with two types of measures:

       · Measures of central tendency: Mean, median, and mode; which
           measure is appropriate depends on the level of measurement
           represented in the numbers being described (these measures

29. The classic text about information visualization is The
    Visual Display of Quantitative Information (Tufte 1983).
    More recent texts include (Few 2012) and (Yau 2011).

                                                                          Organizing Resources | 213
      and the concept of levels of measurements are defined in
      "Organizing Digital Resources").

  · Measures of variability: Range (the difference between the
      maximum and minimum values), and standard deviation (a
      measure of the spread of values around the mean).

Statistical descriptions can be created for any resource property,
with the simplest being the number of resources that have the
property or some particular value of it, such as the number of times
a particular word occurs in a document or the number of copies
a book has sold. Comparing summary statistics about a collection
with the values for individual resources helps you understand how
typical or representative that resource is. If you can compare your
height of 6 feet, ½ inch with that of the average adult male, which
is 5 feet, 10 inches, the difference is two and a half inches, but what
does this mean? It is more informative to make this comparison
using the standard deviation, which is three inches, because this
tells you that 68% of adult men have heights between 5 feet, 7 inches
and 6 feet, 1 inch. When measurements are normally distributed
in the familiar bell-shaped curve around the mean, the standard
deviation makes it easy to identify statistical outliers.

No matter how measurements are distributed, it can be useful to
employ descriptive statistics to organize resources or observations
into categories or quantiles that have the same number of them.
Quartiles (4 categories), deciles (10), and percentiles (100) are
commonly used partitions.

Alternatively, resources or observations can be organized by
visualizing them in a histogram, which divides the range of values
into units with equal intervals. Because values tend to vary around
some central tendency, the intervals are unlikely to contain the
same number of observations. Descriptive statistics and associated
visualizations can suggest which properties make good organizing
principles because they exhibit enough variation to distinguish

214 | Organizing Resources
resources in their most useful interactions. For example, it probably
isn't useful to organize books according to their weight because
almost all books weigh between ½ and 2 pounds, unless you are in
the business of shipping books and paying according to how much
they weigh.

Exploratory Analysis to Understand Data

Many experts recommend that data analysts should undertake
some exploratory analysis with descriptive statistics and simple
information visualizations to understand their data before applying
sophisticated computational techniques to the dataset. In
particular, because the human visual system quickly perceives
shapes and patterns, analyzing and graphing the values of data
attributes and other resource descriptions can suggest which
properties might be useful and comprehensible organizing
principles. In addition, data visualization makes it easy to recognize
values that are typical or that are outliers. Some of this analysis
might form part of data quality assessment during resource
selection, but if not done then, it should be done as part of the
organizing process.

A dataset whose fields or attributes lack information about data
types and units of measure has little use because the data lacks
meaning. When some, but not all parts of the data are named or
annotated, avoid over-interpreting these descriptions' meanings.
(See "Naming Resources".)

We will do some exploratory analysis to understand what an
example dataset contains and how we might use it. For our example,
we consider a collection of a few hundred records from a healthcare
study, whose first eight records and first five data fields in each
record are shown in Figure: Example Dataset.

                                                                   Organizing Resources | 215

The "ID" column contains numeric data, but every value is a
different integer, and the values are contiguous. The field label "ID"
suggests that this is the resource identifier for the participants in
the healthcare study. Further examination of other tables will reveal
that this is a key value that points into a different dataset containing
the resource names.

The "Sex" column is also numeric, but there are only two different
values, 0 and 1, and in the complete dataset they are approximately
equal in frequency. This attribute seems to be categorical or
Boolean data. This makes sense for a "Sex" categorization, and it is
likely to prove useful in understanding the dataset.

216 | Organizing Resources
          Histogram
          A histogram is the simplest visualization of one-
       dimensional data. It is a bar graph that takes the full
       range of values, organizes them into a set of intervals of
       equal size on one axis, and then counts the number of
       values in each interval on the other axis.

The "Temp" column contains several hundred different numeric
values in the complete dataset, ranging from 96.8 to 100.6, with a
mean of 98.6. These values are sensible if the label "Temp" means
the under-the-tongue body temperature in degrees Fahrenheit of
the study participant when the other measures were obtained. This
type of data is usefully viewed as a histogram to get a sense of the
spread and shape, shown in Figure: Temperature.

The data values of the "Temp" column follow the familiar normal
or bell-shaped distribution, for which simple and useful descriptive
statistics are the mean and the standard deviation. The mean (or

                                                                    Organizing Resources | 217
      average) is at the center of the distribution, and the standard
      deviation captures the width of the bell shape. In this dataset, the
      very narrow range of data values here suggests that this attribute is
      not useful as an organizing principle, since it does not distinguish
      the resources in any significant way. In a larger sample, however,
      there might be a few very low or very high temperatures, and it
      would be useful to investigate these "hypothermic" or
      "hyperthermic" outliers.

                Median versus Average
                If ten people are in a bar, all of whom make $50,000 a
             year, when a movie star who made $25,000,000 this
             year walks in, the average income is now $2.3 million.
             The median income is still $50,000.
                The End of Average tells the story of how the U.S.
             military designed aircraft cockpits beginning in 1926 on
             the basis of the average dimensions of a 1926 pilot. In
             1950, researchers measured over four thousand pilots
             only to discover that no actual pilot had average values
             on all the measures, and recommended adjustable seats
             and controls in cockpit design.30

      The data values of the "Age" column range from 18 to 97, and are
      spread broadly across the entire range; this is the age, in years, of
      the study participants. When a distribution is very broad and flat,
      or highly skewed with many values at one end or another, the mean
      value is less useful as a descriptive statistic. Instead of the mean, it is

30. (Rose 2016)

better to use the median or middle value as a summary of the data;
the median value for "Age" in the complete dataset is 39.
Age

The "Weight" column has about 220 different numeric values, from
82 to 300, and judging from this range we can infer that the weights
are measured in pounds. The data follows an uneven distribution
with peaks around 160 and 200, and a small peak at 300. This odd
shape appears in the histogram of Figure: Weight. The two peaks
in this so-called multi-modal histogram suggest that this measure
is mixing two different kinds of resources, and indeed it is because
weights of men and women follow different distributions. It would
thus be useful to use the categorical "Sex" data to separate these
populations, and Figure: Sex and Weight: Female shows how
analyzing weight for women and men as different populations is
much more informative as an organizing principle than combining
them.
What about the odd peak in the distribution at 300? End of range

system that created the data. In this case, the weight scale must
have an upper limit of 300 pounds, so the peak represents the
people whose weight is 300 or greater.

Detecting Errors and Fraud in Data

There are numerous techniques for evaluating individual data items
                                                                    Organizing Resources | 221
or datasets to ensure that they have not been changed or corrupted
during transmission, storage, or copying. These include parity bits,
check digits, check sums, and cryptographic hash functions. They
share the idea that a calculation will yield some particular value or
match a stored result when the original data has not been changed.
Another basic technique for detecting errors is to look for data
values that are different or anomalous because they do not fall into
expected ranges or categories.

More interesting challenges arise when the data might have been
changed by intentional actions to commit fraud, launder money,
or carry out some other crime. In these situations, the person
tampering with data or creating fake data will try to make the data
look normal or expected.

Forensic accountants and statisticians use many techniques for
detecting possibly fraudulent data in these adversarial contexts.
Some are quite simple:

  · If expenses are reimbursed up to some maximum allowed value,
      look for data items with that exact value.

  · When any value exceeding some threshold triggers more
      careful analysis, look for other data items just below that
      threshold.

  · When invoices or claims are paid on receipt, and only a sample
      are subsequently audited, look for duplicate submissions.

  · Calculate the ratio of the maximum to the minimum value for
      purchases in some category (such as the unit price paid for
      items from suppliers); items with large ratios might indicate
      fraud where the supplier "kicks back" some of the money to the
      purchaser.

Benford's Law, the observation that the leading digits in data sets
are distributed in a non-uniform manner, is an effective technique

222 | Organizing Resources
     for detecting fraudulent data because it is based on a counter-
     intuitive fact not known to most fraudsters, who often make up data
     to look random. You might think that the number 1 would occur
     11% of the time as the first digit (since there are 9 possibilities), but
     for data sets whose values span several orders of magnitude, the
     number 1 is the first digit about 30% of the time, and 7, 8, and 9
     occur around 5%.

     Because of the very high transaction rate and the relatively small
     probability of fraud, credit card fraud is detected using machine
     learning algorithms. The classifier is trained with known good and
     bad transactions using properties like average amount, frequency,
     and location to develop a model of each cardholder's "data behavior"
     so that a transaction can quickly be assigned a probability that it is
     fraudulent. (More about this kind of computational classification in
     Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types.)31

   Organizing with Multiple Resource Properties

     Multiple properties of the resources, the person organizing or
     intending to use them, and the social and technological
     environment in which they are being organized can collectively
     shape their organization. For example, the way you organize your
     home kitchen is influenced by the physical layout of counters,
     cabinets, and drawers; the dishes you cook most often; your skills as
     a cook, which may influence the number of cookbooks, specialized

31. See https://chapters.theiia.org/ottawa/Documents/
    Digital_Analysis.pdf for a short introduction to data
    analysis for fraud detection. See (Durtschi et al 2004) for
    the use of Benford's Law in forensic accounting.

                                                                         Organizing Resources | 223
appliances and tools you own and how you use them; the sizes and
shapes of the packages in the pantry and refrigerator; and even your
height.

If multiple resource properties are considered in a fixed order, the
resulting arrangement forms a logical hierarchy. The top level
categories of resources are created based on the values of the
property evaluated first, and then each category is further
subdivided using other properties until each resource is classified in
only a single category. Consider the hierarchical system of folders
used by a professor to arrange the digital resources on his
computer; the first level distinguishes personal documents from
work-related documents; work is then subdivided into teaching and
research, teaching is subdivided by year, and year divided by course.

For physical resources, mapping categories to physical locations
is another required step; for example, resources in the "kitchen
utensils" category might all be arranged in drawers near a
workspace, with "silverware" arranged more precisely to separate
knives, forks, and spoons.

An alternative to hierarchical organization that is often used in
digital organizing systems is faceted classification, in which the
different properties for the resources can be evaluated in any order.
For example, you can select wines from the wine.com store catalog
by type of grape, cost, or region and consider these property facets
in any order. Three people might each end up choosing the same
moderately-priced Kendall Jackson California Chardonnay, but one
of them might have started the search based on price, one based
on the grape varietal, and the third with the region. This kind of
interaction in effect generates a different logical hierarchy for every
different combination of property values, and each user made his
final selection from a different set of wines.

Faceted classification allows a collection of description resources to
be dynamically re-organized into as many categories as there are
combinations of values on the descriptive facets, depending on the

224 | Organizing Resources
priority or point of view the user applies to the facets. Of course this
only works because the physical resources are not themselves being
rearranged, only their digital descriptions.
Applications that organize large collections of digital information,
including those for search, natural language processing, image
classification, personalized recommendation, and other
computationally intensive domains, often use huge numbers of
resource properties (which are often called "features" or
"dimensions"). For example, in document collections each unique
word might initially be treated as a feature by machine learning
algorithms, so there might be tens of thousands of features.
Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories explains principles
and methods for hierarchical and faceted classification in more
detail.

                                                                   Organizing Resources | 225
22. Designing Resource-based

Interactions

We need to focus on the interactions that are enabled because of
the intentional acts of description or arrangement that transform
a collection of resources into an organizing system. With physical
resources, it is easy to distinguish the interactions that are designed
into and directly supported by an organizing system because of
intentional acts of description or arrangement from those that can
take place with resources after they have been accessed. For
example, when a book is checked out of a library it might be read,
translated, summarized, criticized, or otherwise used--but none of
these interactions would be considered a capability of the book
that had been designed into the library. Some physical resources
can initiate interactions, as surely "human resources" and "smart"
objects with sensors and other capabilities can, but most physical
resources are passive. We will discuss this idea of resource agency
in "Resource Agency".

In contrast, in organizing systems that contain digital resources
the logical boundary between the resources and their interactions
is less clear because what you can do with a digital resource is
often not apparent. Furthermore, some of the interactions that are
outside of the boundary with physical resources can be inside of it
with digital ones. For example, when you check a printed book out
of the library, it is no longer in the library when you translate it. But
a digital book in the Google Books library is not removed when you
start reading it, and a language translation service runs "inside" of
it.

Additional issues in the design of interactions with resources are
whether users have direct or mediated access to the resources,
and whether they interact with the resources themselves or only

226 | Designing Resource-based
Interactions
   with copies or descriptions of them. For example, users have direct
   access to original resources in a collection when they browse
   through library stacks or wander in museum galleries.1 Users have
   mediated or indirect access when they use catalogs or search
   engines. Because digital resources can be easily reproduced, it can
   be difficult to distinguish a copy from the original, which raises
   questions of authenticity we will discuss in "Authenticity".

  Affordance and Capability

   The concept of affordance, introduced by J. J. Gibson, then extended
   and popularized by Donald Norman, captures the idea that physical
   resources and their environments have inherent actionable
   properties that determine, in conjunction with an actor's
   capabilities and cognition, what can be done with the resource.2

1. Except when the resources on display are replicas of the
   originals, which is more common than you might suspect.
   Many nineteenth-century museums in the United States
   largely contained copies of pieces from European
   museums. Today, museums sometimes display replicas
   when the originals are too fragile or valuable to risk
   damage (Wallach 1998). Whether the "resource-based
   interaction" is identical for the replica and original is
   subjective and depends on how well the replica is
   implemented.

2. (Gibson 1977), (Norman 1988). See also (Norman 1999) for

                                               Designing Resource-based Interactions | 227
Including capabilities and cognition brings accessibility
considerations into the definition of affordance. A resource is only
accessible when it supports interactions, and it is ineffective design
to implement interactions with resources that some people are
unable to perform. A person who cannot see text cannot read it, or
if they are confined to a wheelchair they cannot select a book from
a tall library shelf. Describing or transforming resources to ensure
their accessibility is discussed in greater detail in "Accessibility".

When organizing resources involves arranging physical resources
using boxes, bins, cabinets, or shelves, the affordances and the
implications for access and use can be easily perceived. Resources
of a certain size and weight can be picked up and carried away.
Books on the lower shelves of bookcases are easy to reach, but those
stored ten feet from the ground cannot be easily accessed.

We can analyze the organizing systems with physical resources to
identify the affordances and the possible interactions they imply.
We can compare the affordances or overall interaction capability
enabled by different organizing systems for some type of physical
resources, and we often do this without thinking about it. The
tradeoffs between the amount of work that goes into organizing a
collection of resources and the amount of work required to find and
use them are inescapable when the resources are physical objects
or information resources are in physical form. We can immediately
see that storing information on scrolls does not enable the random
access capability that is possible with books.

What and how to count to compare the capabilities of organizing
systems becomes more challenging the further we get from
collections of static physical resources, like books or shoes, where it

a short and simple explanation of Norman's (re-
)interpretation of Gibson.

228 | Designing Resource-based Interactions
   is usually easy to perceive and understand the possible interactions.
   With computers, information systems, and digital resources in
   general, considerations about affordances and capabilities are not
   as straightforward.

   First, the affordances we can perceive might not be tied to any
   useful interaction. Donald Norman joked that every computer
   screen within reaching distance affords touching, but unless the
   display is touch-sensitive, this affordance only benefits companies
   that sell screen-cleaning materials.3

   Second, most of the interactions that are supported by digital
   resources are not apparent when you encounter them. You cannot
   tell from their names, but you probably know from past experience
   what interactions are possible with files of types ".doc" and ".pdf."
   You probably do not know what interactions take place with ".xpi"
   and ".mobi" files.4

   A similar difficulty exists when we look at resource descriptions

3. (Norman 1999, p. 39).

4. The ".xpi" file type is used for Mozilla/Firefox browser
   extensions, small computer programs that can be
   installed in the browser to provide some additional user
   interface functionality or interaction. The ".mobi" file
   type was originally developed to enable better document
   display and interactions on devices with small screens.
   Today its primary use is as the base ebook format for the
   Amazon Kindle, except that the Kindle version is more
   highly compressed and locked down with digital rights
   management.

                                               Designing Resource-based Interactions | 229
   and data collections, where we often cannot tell just by examining
   their values what kinds of interactions and operations with them
   are sensible. Think of all the different kinds of information that
   might be associated with a collection of people like the students in
   a university. A database might contain student names, student IDs,
   gender, birth dates, addresses, a numeric code for academic major,
   course units completed, grade point average, and other information.
   These pieces of information differ in their data type; some are
   integers, some are real numbers, some are Boolean, and some are
   just text strings. The numeric data also differs in the level of
   measurement it represents. Student IDs and the academic major
   codes are nominal data, the house or apartment number in the
   address is ordinal data, and the course units and grade point
   average are interval data. Data type and level of measurement
   influence the kind of interactions that are meaningful; we can create
   an alphabetical list of students using their last names, count up the
   number of students with the same academic major, and calculate
   the average GPA or units completed. But it makes no sense to use
   the numeric codes for academic major to compute an average major.

   Once you have discovered it, the capability of digital resources
   and information systems can be assessed by counting the number
   of functions, services, or application program interfaces. However,
   this very coarse measure does not take into account differences in
   the capability or generality of a particular interaction. For example,
   two organizing systems might both have a search function, but
   differences in the operators they allow, the sophistication of pre-
   processing of the content to create index terms, or their usability
   can make them vastly differ in power, precision, and effectiveness.5

   An analogous measure of functional capability for a system with

5. See (Hearst 2009), (Buettcher et al. 2010).

    230 | Designing Resource-based Interactions
   dynamic or living resources is the behavioral repertoire, the number
   of different activities, or range of actions, that can be initiated.

   We should not assume that supporting more types of interactions
   necessarily makes a system better or more capable; what matters
   is how much value is created or invoked in each interaction. A
   smartphone cluttered with features and apps you never use enables
   a great many interactions, but most of them add little value. Doors
   that open automatically when their sensors detect an approaching
   person do not need handles or require explicit interactions.
   Organizing systems can use stored or computed information about
   user preferences or past interactions to anticipate user needs or
   personalize recommendations. This has the effect of substituting
   information for interaction to make interactions unnecessary or
   simpler.

   For example, a "smart travel agent" service can use a user's
   appointment calendar, past travel history, and information sources
   like airline and hotel reservation services to transform a minimal
   interaction like "book a business trip to New York for next week's
   meeting" into numerous hidden queries that would have otherwise
   required separate interactions. These queries are interconnected by
   logical or causal dependencies that are represented by information
   that overlaps between them. For example, all travel-related services
   (airlines, hotels, ground transportation) need the traveler's identity
   and the time and location of his travel. A New York trip might involve
   all of these services, and they need to fit together in time and
   location for the trip to make sense. The hotel reservation needs to
   begin the day the flight arrives in the destination city, the limousine
   service needs to meet the traveler shortly after the plane lands,
   and the restaurant reservation should be convenient in time and
   location to the hotel.6

  Interaction and Value Creation

   A useful way to distinguish types of interactions with resources
   is according to the way in which they create value, using a
   classification proposed by Apte and Mason. They noted that
   interactions differ not just in their overall intensity but in the
   absolute and relative amounts of physical manipulation,
   interpersonal or empathetic contact, and symbolic manipulation or
   information exchange involved in the interaction.

   Furthermore, Apte and Mason recognized that the proportions of
   these three types of value creating activities can be treated as
   design parameters, especially where the value created by retrieving
   or computing information could be completely separated from the
   value created by physical actions and person-to-person encounters.
   This configuration of value creation enables automated self-service,
   in which the human service provider can be replaced by technology,
   and outsourcing, in which the human provider is separated in space
   or time from the customer.7

  Value Creation with Physical Resources

   Physical manipulation is often the intrinsic type of interaction with
   collections of physical resources. The resource might have to be
   handled or directly perceived in order to interact with it, and often
   the experience of interacting with the resource is satisfying or
   entertaining, making it a goal in its own right. People often visit
   museums, galleries, zoos, animal theme parks or other institutions

7. (Apte and Mason 1995) introduced this framework to
  analyze services rather than interactions per se.

   232 | Designing Resource-based Interactions
   that contain physical resources because they value the direct,
   perceptual, or otherwise unmediated interaction that these
   organizing systems support.

   Physical manipulation and interpersonal contact might be required
   to interact with information resources in physical form like the
   printed books in libraries.

   A large university library contains millions of books and academic
   journals, and access to those resources can require a long walk deep
   into the library stacks after a consultation with a reference librarian
   or a search in a library catalog. For decades library users searched
   through description resources--first printed library cards, and then
   online catalogs and databases of bibliographic citations--to locate
   the primary resources they wanted to access. The surrogate
   descriptions of the resources needed to be detailed so that users
   could assess the relevance of the resource without expending the
   significant effort of obtaining and examining the primary resource.8

   However, for most people the primary purpose of interacting with a
   library is to access the information contained in its resources. Many
   people prefer accessing digital documents or books to accessing
   the original physical resource because the incidental physical and
   interpersonal interactions are unnecessary. In addition, many
   library searches are for known items, which is easily supported by
   digital search.9

8. Furthermore, many of the resources might not be
   available in the user's own library and could only be
   obtained through inter-library loan, which could take
   days or weeks.

9. In contrast, far fewer interactions in museum collections

                                               Designing Resource-based Interactions | 233
     In some organizing systems robotic devices, computational
     processes, or other entities that can act autonomously with no need
     for a human agent carry out interactions with physical resources.
     Robots have profoundly increased efficiency in materials
     management, "picking and packing" in warehouse fulfillment, office
     mail delivery, and in many other domains where human agents
     once located, retrieved, and delivered physical resources. A "library
     robot" system that can locate books and grasp them from the
     shelves can manage seven times as many books in the same space
     used by conventional open stacks.10

    are searches for known items, and serendipitous
    interactions with previously unknown resources are
    often the goal of museum visitors. As a result, few
    museum visitors would prefer an online visit to
    experiencing an original painting, sculpture, or other
    physical artifact. However, it is precisely because of the
    unique character of museum resources that museums
    allow access to them but do not allow visitors to borrow
    them, in clear contrast to libraries.

      234 | Designing Resource-based Interactions
Interactions with physical resources often have highly tangible
results; in the preceding examples of fulfillment and delivery
interactions, resources move from one location to another.
However, an abstract or architectural perspective on interaction
design and value creation can create more flexibility in carrying
out the interactions while still producing the expected value for
the user. In general, more abstract descriptions of interactions and
services allow for transparent substitution of the implementation,
potentially enabling a computational process to be a substitute for
one carried out by a person, or vice versa.
For example, a user buying from an internet-based store need not
know and probably does not care which service delivers the package
from the warehouse. Presenting the interaction to the shopper as
the "delivery service" rather than as a "FedEx" or "UPS" service
allows the retailer to choose the best service provider for each
delivery. Going even further, if you need printed documents at a
conference, sales meeting, or anywhere other than your current
location, the interaction you desire is "provide me with documents"
and not "deliver my documents." It does not matter that FedEx will
print your documents at their destination rather than shipping them
there.

          An automated robot library system at San Francisco
       State University.

          The automated robot library system installed by the
       Dematic Group stores books in bins stacked on three-
       story-tall metal racks in five long aisles. Instead of using
       a library classification scheme, books are stored
       according to their sizes in one-foot deep metal bins,
       which contain about one hundred books each. Given an
       online catalog request for a book, the system looks up
       the bin where it was last stored, and then directs a robot
       to bring that bin to the circulation desk. Human
       librarians then find the requested book in the bin and
       scan its barcode, which notifies the requester that the
       book can be picked up. To store a book, the librarian
       scans its barcode, and it is then stored in the closest bin
       with available space.

236 | Designing Resource-based Interactions
   Value Creation with Digital Resources

     With digital resources, neither physical manipulation nor
     interpersonal contact is required, and the essence of the interaction
     is information exchange or symbolic manipulation of the
     information contained in the resource.11 Put another way, by
     replacing interactions that involve people and physical resources
     with symbolic ones, organizing systems can lower costs without
     reducing user satisfaction. This is why so many businesses have
     automated their information-intensive processes with self-service
     technology.

     Similarly, web search engines eliminate the physical effort required
     to visit a library and enable users to consult more readily accessible
     digital resources. A search engine returns a list of the page titles
     of resources that can be directly accessed with just another click,
     so it takes little effort to go from the query results to the primary
     resource. This reduces the need for the rich surrogate descriptions
     that libraries have always been known for because it enables rapid
     evaluation and iterative query refinement.12

11. Providing access to knowledge is a core mission of
    libraries, and it is worth pointing out that library users
    obtain knowledge both from the primary resources in the
    library collection and from the organizing system that
    manages the collection.

12. It also erodes the authority and privilege that apply to
    resources because they are inside the library when a
    web search engine can search the "holdings" of the web

               Stop and Think: Browsing for Books
               How does the experience of browsing for books in a
            library or bookstore compare with browsing using a
            search engine? What aspects are the same or similar?
            What aspects are different?

     The ease of use and speed of search engines in finding web
     resources creates the expectation that any resource worth looking
     at can be found on the web. This is certainly false, or Google would
     never have begun its ambitious and audacious project to digitize
     millions of books from research libraries. While research libraries
     strive to provide access to authoritative and specialized resources,
     the web is undeniably good enough for answering most of the
     questions ordinary users put to search engines, which largely deal
     with everyday life, popular culture, personalities, and news of the
     day.

     Libraries recognize that they need to do a better job integrating
     their collections into the "web spaces" and web-based activities
     of their users if they hope to change the provably suboptimal
     strategies of "information foraging" most people have adopted that
     rely too much on the web and too little on the library.13 Some
     libraries are experimenting with Semantic Web and "Linked Data"

    faster and more comprehensively than you can search a
    library's collection through its online catalog.

     technologies that would integrate their extensive bibliographic
     resources with resources on the open web.14

     Museums have aggressively embraced the web to provide access to
     their collections. While few museum visitors would prefer viewing
     a digital image over experiencing an original painting, sculpture, or
     other physical artifact, the alternative is often no access at all. Most
     museum collections are far larger than the space available to display
     them, so the web makes it possible to provide access to otherwise
     hidden resources.15

     The variety and functions of interactions with digital resources are
     determined by the amount of structure and semantics represented
     in their digital encoding, in the descriptions associated with the

14. (Byrne and Goddard 2010).

15. See (Simon 2010). An exemplary project to enhance
    museum access is Delphi (Schmitz and Black 2008), the
    collections browser for the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of
    Anthropology at University of California, Berkeley. Delphi
    very cleverly uses natural language processing
    techniques to build an easy-to-use faceted browsing user
    interface that lets users view over 600,000 items stored
    in museum warehouses. Delphi is being integrated into
    Collection Space (http://www.collectionspace.org/), an
    open source web collections management system for

resources, or by the intelligence of the computational processes
applied to them. Digital resources can support enhanced
interactions of searching, copying, zooming, and other
transformations. Digital or "ebooks" demonstrate how access to
content can be enhanced once it is no longer tied to the container
of the printed book, but ebook readers vary substantially in their
interaction repertoires; the baseline they all share is "page turning,"
resizing, and full-text search.

To augment digital resources with text structures, multimedia,
animation, interactive 3-D graphics, mathematical functions, and
other richer content types requires much more sophisticated
representation formats that tend to require a great deal of "hand-
crafting." An alternative to hand-crafted resource description is
sophisticated computer processing guided by human inputs. For
example, Facebook and many web-based photo organizing systems
implement face recognition analysis that detects faces in photos,
compares features of detected faces to features of previously
identified faces, and encourages people to tag photos to make the
recognition more accurate. Some online services use similar image
classification techniques to bring together shoes, jewelry, or other
items that look alike.

Richer interactions with digital text resources are possible when
they are encoded in an application or presentation-independent
format. Automated content reuse and "single-source publishing" is
most efficiently accomplished when text is encoded in XML, but
much of this XML is produced by transforming text originally
created in word processing formats. Once it is in XML, digital
information can be distributed, processed, reused, transformed,
mixed, remixed, and recombined into different formats for different
purposes, applications, devices, or users in ways that are almost
impossible to imagine when it is represented in a tangible (and

240 | Designing Resource-based Interactions
therefore static) medium like a book on a shelf or a box full of paper
files.16

Businesses that create or own their information resources can
readily take advantage of the enhanced interactions that digital
formats enable. For libraries, however, copyright is often a barrier to
digitization, both as a matter of law and because digitization enables
copyright enforcement to a degree not possible with physical
resources.

As a result, digital books are somewhat controversial and
problematic for libraries, whose access models were created based
on the economics of print publication and the social contract of the
copyright first sale doctrine that allowed libraries to lend printed
books.17

16. Even sophisticated text representation formats such as
    XML have inherent limitations: one important problem
    that arises in complex management scenarios,
    humanities scholarship, and bioinformatics is that XML
    markup cannot easily represent overlapping
    substructures in the same resource (Schmidt 2009).

17. Digital books change the economics and first sale is not

as well-established for digital works, which are licensed

rather than sold (Aufderheide and Jaszi 2011). To protect

their business models, many publishers are limiting the

number of times ebooks can be lent before they "self-

destruct." Some librarians have called for boycotts of

publishers  in                      response

(http://boycottharpercollins.com).

            Designing Resource-based Interactions | 241
     Software-based agents do analogous work to robots in "moving
     information around" after accessing digital resources such as web
     services or physical resources with sensors attached that produce
     digital information. Agents can control or choreograph a set of
     interactions with digital resources to carry out complex business
     processes.

   Accessibility

     The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with
     Disabilities recognizes accessibility to information and
     communications technologies as a basic human right. There is also
     a strong business case for accessibility: studies show that accessible
     websites are used more often, are easier to maintain, and produce
     better search results.18

    In contrast to these new access restrictions imposed by
    publishers on digital works, many governments as well
    as some progressive information providers and scientific
    researchers have begun to encourage the reuse and
    reorganization of their content by making geospatial,
    demographic, environmental, economic, and other
    datasets available in open formats, as web services, or
    as data feeds rather than as "fixed" publications (Bizer
    2009a), (Robinson et al. 2008). And we have made this
    book available as an open content repository so that it
    can be collaboratively maintained and customized.

18. We cannot explain this any better than the UN does:
    "The Convention follows decades of work by the United

     242 | Designing Resource-based Interactions
     Many of the techniques for making a resource accessible involve
     transforming the resource or its description into a different form so
     someone who could not perceive it or interact with it in its original
     form can now do so. The most common operating systems all come
     with general-purpose accessibility features such as reading text
     aloud, recognizing speech, magnifying text, increasing cursor size,
     signaling with flashing lights instead of with sounds, lights to signal
     keyboard shortcuts for selecting and navigating, and connecting to
     devices for displaying Braille. Google Translate converts text in one
     language to another, and many people use it to create a rough draft
     that is finished by a human translator.19

     Other techniques are not generic and automatic, and instead
     require investment by authors or designers to make information
     accessible. Websites are more accessible when images or other
     non-text content types have straightforward titles, captions, and
     "alt text" that describes what they are about. Consistent placement
     and appearance of navigation controls and interaction widgets is

    Nations to change attitudes and approaches to persons
    with disabilities. It takes to a new height the movement
    from viewing persons with disabilities as `objects' of
    charity, medical treatment and social protection towards
    viewing persons with disabilities as `subjects' with rights,
    who are capable of claiming those rights and making
    decisions for their lives based on their free and informed
    consent as well as being active members of society." See

     essential; for example, in a shopping site "My Cart" might always be
     found at the top right corner of the page.20

     If authors apply semantic and structural markup to the text and
     use formats that distinguish it from presentation instructions, page
     outlines and summaries can be generated to enhance navigation,
     and search can be made more precise by limiting it to particular
     sections or content types. As the "Information IQ" of the source
     format increases, more can be done to make it more accessible (see
     "Resource Format" and Figure: Information IQ.).21

     The Smithsonian Museum in Washington, DC invites visitors to
     record audio descriptions on mobile devices of the nearly 137 million
     objects in its collection, and then makes these available to everyone.
     This is just a small part of its efforts to make its exhibits more
     accessible. A company called D-Scriptive enables blind people to
     enjoy Broadway shows more by recording hundreds of audio
     descriptions that are synchronized with dialog spoken by the
     actors.22

     Because not every performance of a Broadway is exactly
     the same, the D-Scriptive audio snippets are tied to
     particular bits of dialog. The theater's stage manager
     triggers the D-Scriptive system to broadcast the
     corresponding visual explanations to audience members

      244 | Designing Resource-based Interactions
Transforming recorded spoken language to text to make it
accessible and searchable is called transcription. At times
transcription is necessary to comply with accessibility
requirements, but is often done simply to add organization to
content, as when a script is created to separate the multiple voices
in a radio or television interview or story.

Transcriptions created by skilled people are highly accurate but
labor-intensive to produce, so speech-to-text software is
increasingly being used to transcribe speech using pre-trained
acoustic and language models. Training these models is
computationally intensive, and there are many clever techniques
to acquire the "labeled" inputs. However, most of them are
conceptually simple; they take the huge amount of data collected by
voice search applications and analyze what the searcher does with
the results to assess the accuracy of the transcription. Transcription
accuracy can be improved when models can be specialized by
industry or application. For example, speech-to-text software for
doctors is trained to recognize medical terminology, while software
for use by generic voice recognition services like Apple's is trained
to understand dictation and commands or questions one would ask
of a smartphone.

Since text transcripts are machine-readable, unlike audio or video

listening on earpieces. For example, in the Lion King a
snippet might explain that "on the left are two giraffes
and a cheetah." (Giridharadas 2014)

In 2015 Netflix began a similar audio description service
to accompany some of its original series. See

http://blog.netflix.com/2015/04/netflix-begins-
audio-description-for.html

                                          Designing Resource-based Interactions | 245
     files, adding text transcripts makes it possible for search engines to
     index audio and video in ways that were previously impossible. Pop
     Up Archive, an audio search company in Oakland, California, works
     with speech-to-text software specially trained for news media and
     spoken word content to make radio, podcasts, and archival audio
     searchable. A challenge for audio search is that even though a
     transcription with a few mistakes works just fine for search engines,
     people often expect transcriptions to be perfect.23

     When the speech is in a language that is not understood, it needs
     to be translated as well. Perhaps you have watched a movie on
     an international flight and were able to choose from subtitles in
     many different languages. Creating subtitles for a foreign film is an
     asynchronous task that is substantially easier task than doing a real-
     time translation, and the demand for skilled translators for speeches
     and other synchronous situations (and interpreters, who translate
     speech to sign language for people with hearing disabilities) remains
     high.

   Access Policies

     Different levels of interactions or access can apply to different

     resources in a collection or to different categories of users. For
     example, library collections can range from completely open and
     public, to allowing limited access, to wholly private and restricted.

     The library stacks might be open to anyone, but rare documents in
     a special collection are only accessible to authorized researchers.
     The same is true of museums, which typically have only a fraction of
     their collections on public display.

     Because of their commercial and competitive purposes, organizing
     systems in business domains are more likely to enforce a granular
     level of access control that distinguishes people according to their
     roles and the nature of their interactions with resources. For
     example, administrative assistants in a company's Human Resources
     department are not allowed to see salaries; HR employees in a
     benefits administration role can see salaries but not change them;
     management-level employees in HR can change the salaries. Some
     firms limit access to specific times from authorized computers or IP
     addresses.24

24. These access controls to the organizing system or its
    host computer are enforced using passwords and more
    sophisticated software and hardware techniques. Some
    access control policies are mandated by regulations to
    ensure privacy of personal data, and policies differ from
    industry to industry and from country to country. Access
    controls can improve the credibility of information by
    identifying who created or changed it, especially
    important when traceability is required (e.g., financial
    accounting).

    An important difference between interactions with

                                                 Designing Resource-based Interactions | 247
A noteworthy situation arises when the person accessing the
organizing system is the one who designed and implemented it.
In this case, the person will have qualitatively better knowledge of
the resources and the supported interactions. This situation most
often arises in the organizing systems in kitchens, home closets, and
other highly personal domains but can also occur in knowledge-
intensive business and professional domains like consulting,
customer relationship management, and scientific research.

Many of the organizing systems used by individuals are embedded
in physical contexts where access controls are applied in a coarse

physical resources and those with digital resources is
how they use resource descriptions for access control.
Resources sometimes have associated security
classifications like "Top Secret" that restrict who can
learn about their existence or obtain them. Nonetheless,
if you get your hands on a top secret printed document,
nothing can prevent you from reading it. Similarly,
printed resources often have "All rights reserved"
copyright notices that say that you cannot copy them,
but nothing can prevent you from making copies with
a copy machine. On the other hand, learning of the
existence of a digital resource might be of little value
if copyright or licensing restrictions prevent you from
obtaining it. Moreover, obtaining a digital resource might
be of no value if its content is only available using a
password, decryption key, or other resource description
that enforces access control directly rather than
indirectly like the security classifications.

248 | Designing Resource-based Interactions
manner. We need a key to get into the house, but we do not need
additional permissions or passwords to enter our closets or to take
a book from a bookshelf. In our online lives, however, we readily
accept and impose more granular access controls. For example, we
might allow or block individual "friend" requests on Facebook or
mark photos on Flickr as public, private, or viewable only by named
groups or individuals.

We can further contrast access policies based on their origins or
motivations.

Designed resource access policies are established by the designer
or operator of an organizing system to satisfy internally generated
requirements. Examples of designed access policies are:

  · giving more access to "inside" users (e.g., residents of a
      community, students or faculty members at a university, or
      employees of a company) than to anonymous or "outside" users;

  · giving more access to paying users than to users who do not
      pay;

  · giving more access to users with capabilities or competencies
      that can add value to the organizing system (e.g., material
      culture researchers like archaeologists or anthropologists, who
      often work with resources in museum collections that are not
      on display).

Imposed Policies are mandated by an external entity and the
organizing system must comply with them. For example, an
organizing system might have to follow information privacy,
security, or other regulations that restrict access to resources or
the interactions that can be made with them.

University libraries typically complement or replace parts of their
print collections with networked access to digital content licensed
from publishers. Typical licensing terms then require them to

                                          Designing Resource-based Interactions | 249
     restrict access to users that are associated with the university,
     either by being on campus or by using virtual private network (VPN)
     software that controls remote access to the library network.25
     Copyright law limits the uses of a substantial majority of the books
     in the collections of major libraries, prohibiting them from being
     made fully available in digital formats. Museums often prohibit
     photography because they do not own the rights to modern works
     they display.
     Whether an access policy is designed or imposed is not always clear.
     Policies that were originally designed for a particular organizing
     system may over time become best practices or industry standards,
     which regulators or industry groups not satisfied with "self-
     regulation" later impose. Museums might aggressively enforce a
     ban on photography not just to comply with copyright law, but
     also to enhance the revenue they get from selling posters and
     reproductions.

25. In response to this trend, however, many libraries are
    supporting "open access" initiatives that strive to make
    scholarly publications available without restriction
    (Bailey 2007). Libraries and ebook vendors are engaged
    in a tussle about the extent to which the "first sale" rule
    that allows libraries to lend physical books without
    restrictions also applies to ebooks (Howard 2011).

      250 | Designing Resource-based Interactions
23. Maintaining Resources

Maintaining resources is an important activity in every organizing
system because resources must be available at the time they are
needed. Beyond these basic shared motivations are substantial
differences in maintenance goals and methods depending on the
domain of the organizing system.

However, different domains sometimes use the same terms to
describe different maintenance activities and different terms for
similar activities. Common maintenance activities are storage,
preservation, curation, and governance. Storage is most often used
when referring to physical or technological aspects of maintaining
resources; backup (for short-term storage), archiving (for long-term
storage), and migration (moving stored resources from one storage
device to another) are similar in this respect. The other three terms
generally refer to activities or methods that more closely overlap
in meaning; we will distinguish them in "Preservation" through
"Governance".

Selection and maintenance are interdependent. Selection is based
on an initial set of rules that determine which resources enter the
organizing system. Maintenance includes the work to preserve the
resources, the processes for evaluating and revising the original
selection criteria, and the removal of resources from the system
when they no longer need to be preserved. More stringent rules
for selecting resources generally imply a maintenance plan that
carefully enforces the same constraints that limit selection. This
is just common sense whether the resource is a piece of art, an
automobile, a software package, or a star basketball player; if you
worked hard to find or paid a lot to acquire a resource, you are going
to take care of it and will not soon be buying another one.

Ideally, maintenance requirements for resources should be

                                                                  Maintaining Resources | 251
   anticipated when organizing principles are defined and
   implemented. Resource descriptions to support preservation of
   digital resources are especially important.1

  Motivations for Maintaining Resources

   The concept of memory institution broadly applies to a great many
   organizing systems that share the goal of preserving knowledge and
   cultural heritage.2 The primary resources in libraries, museums,
   data archives or other memory institutions are fixed cultural,
   historic, or scientific artifacts that are maintained because they
   are unique and original items with future value. This is why the
   Musée du Louvre preserves the portrait of the Mona Lisa and the
   United States National Archives preserves the Declaration of
   Independence.3

1. (Guenther and Wolfe 2009).

2. This is the historical and dominant conception of the
   research library, but libraries are now fighting to prove
   that they are much more than just repositories because
   many of their users place greater value "on-the-fly
   access" of current materials. See (Teper 2005) for a
   sobering analysis of this dilemma.

3. Today the United States National Archives displays the
   Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, and the U.S.
   Constitution in sealed titanium cases filled with inert
   argon gas. Unfortunately, for over a century these
   documents were barely preserved at all; the Declaration

    252 | Maintaining Resources
   In contrast, in businesses organizing systems, many of the
   resources that are collected and managed have limited intrinsic
   value. The motivation for preservation and maintenance is
   economic; resources are maintained because they are essential in
   running the business. For example, businesses collect and preserve
   information about employees, inventory, orders, invoices, etc.,
   because it ensures internal goals of efficiency, revenue generation,
   and competitive advantage. The same resources (e.g., customer
   information) are often used by more than one part of the business.4
   Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of changing resources is
   a major challenge in business organizing systems.5

   Many business organizing systems preserve information needed to
   satisfy externally imposed regulatory or compliance policies and
   serve largely to avoid possible catastrophic costs from penalties and
   lawsuits. In all these cases, resources are maintained as one of the

   hung on the wall at the United States Patent Office in
   direct sunlight for about 40 years.

4. Customer information drives day-to-day operations, but
   is also used in decision support and strategic planning.

5. For businesses "in the world," a "customer" is usually
   an actual person whose identity was learned in a
   transaction, but for many web-based businesses and
   search engines a customer is a computational model
   extracted from browser access and click logs that is a
   kind of "theoretical customer" whose actual identity is
   often unknown. These computational customers are the
   targets of the computational advertising in search
   engines.

                                                                      Maintaining Resources | 253
   means employed to preserve the business as an ongoing enterprise,
   not as an end in itself.

   Unlike libraries, archives, and museums, indefinite preservation is
   not the central goal of most business organizing systems. These
   organizing systems mostly manage information needed to carry out
   day-to-day operations or relatively recent historical information
   used in decision support and strategic planning. In addition to these
   internal mandates, businesses have to conform to securities,
   taxation, and compliance regulations that impose requirements for
   long-term information preservation.6

   Of course, libraries, museums, and archives also confront economic
   issues as they seek to preserve and maintain their collections and

6. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States and similar
   legislation in other countries require firms to preserve
   transactional and accounting records and any document
   that relates to "internal controls," which arguably
   includes any information in any format created by any
   employee (Langevoort 2006). Civil procedure rules that
   permit discovery of evidence in lawsuits have long
   required firms to retain documents, and the proliferation
   of digital document types like email, voice mail, shared
   calendars and instant messages imposes new storage
   requirements and challenges (Levy and Casey 2006).
   However, if a company has a data retention policy that
   includes the systematic deletion of documents when they
   are no longer needed, courts have noted that this is not
   willful destruction of evidence.

    254 | Maintaining Resources
   themselves as memory institutions.7 They view their collections as
   intrinsically valuable in ways that firms generally do not. Because
   of this, extensive energy goes into preservation, protection, and
   storage of resources in memory institutions, and it is more rare that
   resources may be discarded or de-accessioned. Art galleries are an
   interesting hybrid because they organize and preserve collections
   that are valuable, but if they do not manage to sell some things, they
   will not stay in business.

   In between these contrasting purposes of preservation and
   maintenance are the motives in personal collections, which
   occasionally are created because of the inherent value of the items
   but more typically because of their value in supporting personal
   activities. Some people treasure old photos or collectibles that
   belonged to their parents or grandparents and imagine their own
   children or grandchildren enjoying them, but many old collections
   seem to end up as offerings on eBay. In addition, many personal
   organizing systems are task-oriented, so their contents need not be
   preserved after the task is completed.8

7. Libraries are increasingly faced with the choice of
   providing access to digital resources through renewable
   licensing agreements, "pay per view" arrangements, or
   not at all. To some librarians, however, the failure to
   obtain permanent access rights "offends the traditional
   ideal of libraries" as memory institution (Carr 2010).

8. For example. students writing a term paper usually
   organize the printed and digital resources they rely on;
   the former are probably kept in folders or in piles on
   the desk, and the latter in a computer file system. This
   organizing system is not likely to be preserved after the

                                                                      Maintaining Resources | 255
Preservation

At the most basic level, preservation of resources means maintaining
them in conditions that protect them from physical damage or
deterioration. Libraries, museums, and archives aim for stable
temperatures and low humidity. Permanently or temporarily out-
of-service aircraft are parked in deserts where dry conditions
reduce corrosion. Risk-aware businesses create continuity plans
that involve off-site storage of the data and documents needed
to stay in business in the event of a natural disaster or other
disruption.
When the goal is indefinite preservation, other maintenance issues
arise if resources deteriorate or are damaged. How much of an
artifact's worth is locked in with the medium used to express it?
How much restoration should be attempted? How much of an
artifact's essence is retained when digitized?

term paper is finished. An exception that proves the rule
is the task of paying income taxes for which (in the USA)
taxpayers are legally required to keep evidence for up to
seven years after filing a tax return (http://www.irs.gov/

Digitization and Preserving Resources

Preservation is often a key motive for digitization, but digitization
                                                                  Maintaining Resources | 257
     alone is not preservation. Digitization creates preservation
     challenges because technological obsolescence of computer
     software and hardware require ongoing efforts to ensure the
     digitized resources can be accessed.

     Technological obsolescence is the major challenge in maintaining
     digital resources. The most visible one is a result of the relentless
     evolution of the physical media and environments used to store
     digital information in both institutional or business and personal
     organizing systems. Computer data began to be stored on magnetic
     tape and hard disk drives six decades ago, on floppy disks four
     decades ago, on CDs three decades ago, on DVDs two decades ago,
     on solid-state drives half a decade ago, and in "cloud-based" or
     "virtual" storage environments in the last decade. As the capacity
     of storage technologies grows, economic and efficiency
     considerations often make the case to adopt new technology to
     store newly acquired digital resources and raise questions about
     what to do with the existing ones.9

     The second challenge might seem paradoxical. Even though digital
     storage capacity increases at a staggering pace, the expected useful
     lifetimes of the physical storage media are measured in years or at
     best in decades. Colloquial terms for this problem are data rot or
     "bit rot." In contrast, books printed on acid-free paper can last for
     centuries. The contrast is striking; books on library shelves do not
     disappear if no one uses them, but digital data can be lost if no one
     wants access to it within a year or two after its creation.10

     However, limits to the physical lifetime of digital storage media
     are much less significant than the third challenge, the fact that

      258 | Maintaining Resources
    the software and its associated computing environment used to
    parse and interpret the resource at the time of preservation might
    no longer be available when the resource needs to be accessed.
    Twenty-five years ago most digital documents were created using
    the Word Perfect word processor, but today the vast majority is
    created using Microsoft Word and few people use Word Perfect
    today. Software and services that convert documents from old
    formats to new ones are widely available, but they are only useful if
    the old file can be read from its legacy storage medium.11

11. Many of those Word Perfect documents were stored on
   floppy disks because floppy disk drives were built into
   almost every personal computer for decades, but it would
   be hard to find such disk drives today. And even if
   someone with a collection of word processor documents
   stored of floppy disks in 1995 had copied those files to
   newer storage technologies, it is unlikely that the current
   version of the word processor would be able to read
   them. Software application vendors usually preserve
   "backwards compatibility" for a few years with earlier
   versions to give users time to update their software, but
   few would support older versions indefinitely because to
   do so can make it difficult to implement new features.

   Digital resources can be encoded using non-proprietary
   and standardized data formats to ensure "forward
   compatibility" in any software application that
   implements the version of the standard. However, if the
   ebook reader, web browser, or other software used to
   access the resource has capabilities that rely on later

                                                                       Maintaining Resources | 259
Because almost every digital device has storage associated with it,
problems posed by multiple storage environments can arise at all
scales of organizing systems. Only a few years ago people often
struggled with migrating files from their old computer, music player
or phone when they got new ones. Web-based email and
applications and web-based storage services like Dropbox, Amazon
Cloud Drive, and Apple iCloud eliminate some data storage and
migration problems by making them someone else's responsibility,
but in doing so introduce privacy and reliability concerns.

It is easy to say that the solutions to the problems of digital
preservation are regular recopying of the digital resources onto
new storage media and then migrating them to new formats when
significantly better ones come along. In practice, however, how
libraries, businesses, government agencies or other enterprises deal
with these problems depends on their budgets and on their
technical sophistication. In addition, not every resource should or
can always be migrated, and the co-existence of multiple storage
technologies makes an organizing system more complex because
different storage formats and devices can be collectively
incompatible.

          The Hathi Trust Digital Library
          The Hathi Trust is a worldwide partnership of several
       dozen major research institutions and libraries
       dedicated to "collecting, organizing, preserving,
       communicating, and sharing the record of human

versions of the standards the "old data" will not have
taken advantage of them.

       knowledge." The Hathi Trust was established in 2008 to
       coordinate the efforts of libraries in managing the
       digital copies of the books they received in return for
       providing books to Google for its book digitization
       projects. Since then the Hathi Trust has broadened its
       scope to include the public domain books collected by
       the Internet Archive and numerous other digital
       collections, and today its digital library has over ten
       million volumes. The costs of running the Hathi Trust
       and its digital library are shared in a transparent
       manner by the institutions that contributed digital
       collections or that want access to them, which reduces
       the costs for everyone compared to a "go it alone"
       strategy. The Hathi Trust Digital Library has separate
       modes for catalog search and full-text search of the
       library contents, unlike commercial search engines that
       do not distinguish them. A second important difference
       between the Hathi Trust Digital Library and commercial
       search engines is the absence of display advertising and
       "sponsored search" results.

Preserving the Web

Preservation of web resources is inherently problematic. Unlike
libraries, museums, archives, and many other kinds of organizing
systems that contain collections of unchanging resources,
organizing systems on the web often contain resources that are

                                                                  Maintaining Resources | 261
     highly dynamic. Some websites change by adding content, and
     others change by editing or removing it.12

     Longitudinal studies have shown that hundreds of millions of web
     pages change at least once a week, even though most web pages
     never change or change infrequently.13 Nevertheless, the continued

12. This is tautologically true for sites that publish news,
    weather, product catalogs with inventory information,
    stock prices, and similar continually updated content
    because many of their pages are automatically revised
    when events happen or as information arrives from other
    sources. It is also true for blogs, wikis, Facebook, Flickr,
    YouTube, Yelp and the great many other "Web 2.0" sites
    whose content changes as they incorporate a steady
    stream of user-generated content.

    In some cases changes to web pages are attempts to
    rewrite history and prevent preservation by removing
    all traces of information that later turned out to be
    embarrassing, contradictory, or politically incorrect.
    When pages cannot be changed, like the archives of
    newspapers published on the web, only the search engine
    can remove them from search results, and in 2014 the
    European Court ruled that people could ask Google to do
    that.

13. (Fetterly et al. 2003).

    Most people understand that web pages can change, but

     262 | Maintaining Resources
     existence of a particular web page is hardly sufficient to preserve it
     if it is not popular and relevant enough to show up in the first few
     pages of search results. Persistent access requires preservation, but
     preservation is not meaningful if there is no realistic probability of
     future access.

     Comprehensive web search engines like Google and Bing use
     crawlers to continually update their indexed collections of web
     pages and their search results link to the current version, so
     preservation of older versions is explicitly not a goal. Furthermore,
     search engines do not reveal any details about how frequently they
     update their collections of indexed pages.14

               The Internet Archive and the
               "Wayback Machine"
               The Internet Archive (Archive.org), founded by
            Brewster Kahle, makes preservation of the web its first
            and foremost activity, and when you enter a URI into its
            "Wayback Machine" you can see what a site looked like
            at different moments in time. For example,

    most changed web pages do not highlight the changes.
    A "diff" tool from Microsoft reveals them.
    http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/DiffIE/
    default.aspx

14. However, when a website disappears its first page can
    often be found in the search engine's index "cache" rather
    than by following what would be a broken link.

                                                                       Maintaining Resources | 263

            between October 1996 and January 2013, including
            about twice a week on average during all of 2012. Even
            so, since a large site like berkeley.edu often changes
            many times a day, the Wayback Machine's preservation
            of berkeley.edu is incomplete, and it only preserves a
            fraction of the web's sites. Since 2006 the Internet
            Archive has hosted the "Archive-It" service to enable
            hundreds of schools, libraries, historical societies, and
            other institutions to archive collections of digital
            resources.15

15. Brewster Kahle has been described as a computer
    engineer, Internet entrepreneur, Internet activist,
    advocate of universal access to knowledge, and digital
    librarian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Brewster_Kahle). In addition to websites, the Internet
    Archive preserves several million books, over a million
    pieces of video, 400,000 news programs from broadcast
    TV, over a million audio recordings, and over 100,000
    live music concerts.

       The Memento project has proposed a specification for
    using HTTP headers to perform "datetime negotiation"
    with the Wayback Machine and other archives of web
    pages, making it unnecessary for Memento to save
    anything on its own. Memento is implemented as a
    browser plug-in to "browse backwards in time"

     264 | Maintaining Resources
Preserving Resource Instances

A focus on preserving particular resource instances is most clear in
museums and archives, where collections typically consist of unique
and original items. There are many copies and derivative works of
the Mona Lisa, but if the original Mona Lisa were destroyed none of
them would be acceptable as a replacement.16

Archivists and historians argue that it is essential to preserve
original documents because they convey more information than just
their textual content. Paul Duguid recounts how a medical historian
used faint smells of vinegar in 18th-century letters to investigate
a cholera epidemic because disinfecting letters with vinegar was
thought to prevent the spread of the disease. Obviously, the vinegar
smell would not have been part of a digitized letter.17

Zoos often give a distinctive or attractive animal a name and then
market it as a special or unique instance. For example, the Berlin
Zoo successfully marketed a polar bear named Knut to become
a world famous celebrity, and the zoo made millions of dollars a
year through increased visits and sales of branded merchandise.
Merchandise sales have continued even though Knut died

whenever older versions of pages are available from
archives that use its specification. (VandeSompel 2010).

16. People might still enjoy the many Mona Lisa parodies
    and recreations. See http://www.megamonalisa.com,

     unexpectedly in March 2011, which suggests that the zoo was less
     interested in preserving that particular polar bear than in
     preserving the revenue stream based on that resource.18

     Most business organizing systems, especially those that "run the
     business" by supporting day-to-day operations, are designed to
     preserve instances. These include systems for order management,
     customer relationship management, inventory management, digital
     asset management, record management, email archiving, and more
     general-purpose document management. In all of these domains,
     it is often necessary to retrieve specific information resources to
     serve customers or to meet compliance or traceability goals.

     Recent developments in sensor technology enable very extensive
     data collection about the state and performance of machines,
     engines, equipment, and other types of physical resources,
     including human ones. (Are you wearing an activity tracker right
     now?) When combined with historical information about
     maintenance activity, predictive analytics techniques can use this
     data to determine normal operating ranges and indicators of
     coming performance degradation or failures. Predictive
     maintenance can maximize resource lifetimes while minimizing
     maintenance and inventory costs. These techniques have recently
     been used to predict when professional basketball players are at
     risk of an injury, potentially enabling NBA teams to identify the best
     time to rest their star players without impairing their competitive
     strategy.19

Some business organizing systems are designed to preserve types
or classes of resources rather than resource instances. In particular,
systems for content management typically organize a repository
of reusable or "source" information resources from which specific
"product" resources are then generated. For example, content
management systems might contain modular information about a
company's products that are assembled and delivered in sales or

                                                                  Maintaining Resources | 267
     product catalogs, installation guides, operating guides, or repair
     manuals.20

     Businesses strive to preserve the collective knowledge embodied
     in the company's people, systems, management techniques, past
     decisions, customer relationships, and intellectual property. Much
     of this knowledge is "know how"--knowing how to get things done
     or knowing how things work--that is tacit or informal. Knowledge
     management systems(KMS) are a type of business organizing system
     whose goal is to capture and systematize these information
     resources.21 As with content management, the focus of knowledge
     management is the reuse of "knowledge as type," putting the focus
     on the knowledge rather than the specifics of how it found its way
     into the organizing system.

     Libraries have a similar emphasis on preserving resource types
     rather than instances. The bulk of most library collections,
     especially public libraries, is made up of books that have many
     equivalent copies in other collections. When a library has a copy
     of Moby Dick it is preserving the abstract work rather than the

20. The set of content modules and their assembly structure
     for each kind of generated document conforms to a
     template or pattern that is called the document type
     model when it is expressed in XML.

21. Company intranets, wikis, and blogs are often used as
     knowledge management technologies; Lotus Notes and
     Microsoft SharePoint are popular commercial systems.
     (See the case study in "Knowledge Management for a
     Small Consulting Firm".)

      268 | Maintaining Resources
     particular physical instance--unless the copy of Moby Dick is a rare
     first edition signed by Melville.

     Even when zoos give their popular animals individual names, it
     seems logical that the zoo's goal is to preserve animal species rather
     than instances because any particular animal has a finite lifespan
     and cannot be preserved forever.22

   Preserving Resource Collections

     In some organizing systems any specific resource might be of little
     interest or importance in its own right but is valuable because of
     its membership in a collection of essentially identical items. This is
     the situation in the data warehouses used by businesses to identify
     trends in customer or transaction data or in the huge data
     collections created by scientists. These collections are typically
     analyzed as complete sets. A scientist does not borrow a single
     data point when she accesses a data collection; she borrows the
     complete dataset consisting of millions or billions of data points.
     This requirement raises difficult questions about what additional

22. In addition, the line between "preserving species" and
    "preserving marketing brands" is a fine one for zoos with
    celebrity animals, and in animal theme parks like Sea
    World, it seems to have been crossed. "Shamu" was the
    first killer whale (orca) to survive long in captivity and
    performed for several years at SeaWorld San Diego.
    Shamu died in 1971 but over forty years later all three
    US-based SeaWorld parks have Shamu shows and Shamu
    webcams.

                                                                        Maintaining Resources | 269
     software or equipment need to be preserved in an organizing
     system along with the data to ensure that it can be reanalyzed.23

     Sometimes, specific items in a collection might have some value or
     interest on their own, but they acquire even greater significance and
     enhanced meaning because of the context created by other items
     in the collection that are related in some essential way. The odd
     collection of "things people swallow that they should not" at the
     Mütter Museum is a perfect example.24

23. (Manyika et al. 2011).

24. The College of Physicians of Philadelphia's Mütter
    Museum houses a novel collection of artifacts meant to
    "educate future doctors about anatomy and human
    medical anomalies." No museum in the world is like it;
    it contains display cases full of human skulls, abnormal
    fetuses in jars, preserved human bodies, a garden of
    medicinal herbs, and many other unique collections of
    resources.

    However, one sub-collection best reflects the distinctive
    and idiosyncratic selection and arrangement of resources
    in the museum. Chevalier Jackson, a distinguished
    laryngologist, collected over 2,000 objects extracted
    from the throats of patients. Because of the peculiar
    focus and educational focus of this collection, and
    because there are few shared characteristics of "things
    people swallow that they should not," the characteristics
    and principles used to organize and describe the
    collection would be of little use in another organizing

   Curation

     For almost a century curation has referred to the processes by
     which a resource in a collection is maintained over time, which may
     include actions to improve access or to restore or transform its
     representation or presentation.25

     Furthermore, especially in cultural heritage collections, curation
     also includes research to identify, describe, and authenticate
     resources in a collection. Resource descriptions are often updated
     to reflect new knowledge or interpretations about the primary
     resources.26

    system. What other collection would include toys, bones,
    sewing needles, coins, shells, and dental material? It is
    hard to imagine that any other collection that would
    include all of these items plus fully annotated record of
    sex and approximate age of patient, the amount of time
    the extraction procedure took, the tool used, and
    whether or not the patient survived.

25. Curation is a very old concept whose Medieval meaning
    focused on the "preservation and cure of souls" by a
    pastor, priest, or "curate" (Simpson and Weiner 1989). A
    set of related and systematized curation practices for
    some class of resources is often called a curation system,
    especially when they are embodied in technology.

26. Information about which resources are most often

                                                                         Maintaining Resources | 271
Curation takes place in all organizing systems--at a personal scale
when we rearrange a bookshelf to accommodate new books or
create new file folders for this year's health insurance claims, at
an institutional scale when a museum designs a new exhibit or a
zoo creates a new habitat, and at web scale when people select
photos to upload to Flickr or Facebook and then tag or "Like" those
uploaded by others.

An individual, company, or any other creator of a website can make
decisions and employ technology that maintains the contents,
quality and character of the site over time. In that respect website
curation and governance practices are little different than those
for the organizing systems in memory institutions or business
enterprises. The key to curation is having clear policies for
collecting resources and maintaining them over time that enable
people and automated processes to ensure that resource
descriptions or data are authoritative, accurate, complete,
consistent, and non-redundant.

Institutional Curation

Curation is most necessary and explicit in institutional organizing
systems where the large number of resources or their heterogeneity
requires choices to be made about which ones should be most
accessible, how they should be organized to ensure this access,
and which ones need most to be preserved to ensure continued
accessibility over time. Curation might be thought of as an ongoing
or deferred selection activity because curation decisions must often
be made on an item-by-item basis.

interacted with in scientific or archival collections is
essential in understanding resource value and quality.

272 | Maintaining Resources
     Curation in these institutional contexts requires extensive
     professional training. The institutional authority empowers
     individuals or groups to make curation decisions. No one questions
     whether a museum curator or a compliance manager should be
     doing what they do.27
     Institutional curation may be supported by automated methods. An
     "approval plan" is often implemented for the acquisition of new
     books by libraries that involves an initial selection of certain criteria
     (such as "published by an American university press; costs less than
     $100; not a reissue of an earlier edition; classed within a particular
     Library of Congress range") that enable libraries to automatically
     purchase all books meeting the criteria. While the approval plan
     can certainly be considered a selection activity, we cite it in
     maintenance as an example of a strategy to maintain the currency
     and relevancy of a given collection.

   Individual Curation

                The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up

27. In memory institutions, the most common job titles
    include "curator" or "conservator." In for-profit contexts
    where "governance" is more common than "curation" job
    titles reflect that difference. In addition to "governance,"
    job titles often include "recordkeeping," "compliance," or
    "regulatory" prefixes to "officer," "accountant," or
    "analyst" job classifications.

                                                                        Maintaining Resources | 273
          Many of the ever growing number of self-help books
       about organizing seem to approach it as an intellectual
       contest to devise more elaborate and optimized storage
       strategies. Marie Kondo's wildly popular 2014 book The
       Life-changing Magic of Tidying Up, an international
       best-seller, has upended the conversation with an
       unapologetic dogma of removal that promises to yield a
       happier--and much more minimalist--life for individuals
       with their at-home organizing systems..

          Kondo's method mandates that only what brings one
       joy may be kept. Everything else must be tossed --
       unused gifts, books kept only for reference but never
       referenced, unworn clothing, and anything else that
       does not bring its owner joy. Kondo's approach is
       designed for personal organizing systems, and would be
       difficult to implement in systems in systems used by
       multiple individuals, much less institutions. However,
       Kondo's rejection of the concept that things should be
       saved for a rainy day might benefit organizations by
       making them more attentive to the costs of maintaining
       resources with no current use.

          While people must make up their own minds about
       how they manage their possessions, there is compelling
       evidence from cognitive science and behavioral
       economics that decision-making throughout the day
       can be mentally exhausting. Kondo's approach implicitly
       recognizes this limitation by requiring cognitive energy
       up front to reduce the total number of resources to the
       bare minimum necessary (by one's own "joy standards").
       This philosophy has people spend decision-making

             energy where it counts the most and makes it easier to
             make maintenance decisions over time.

     Curation by individuals has been studied a great deal in the research
     discipline of Personal Information Management (PIM).28 Much of
     this work has been influenced for decades by a seminal article
     written by Vannevar Bush titled As We May Think. Bush envisioned
     the Memex, "a device in which an individual stores all his books,
     records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that
     it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility." Bush's
     most influential idea was his proposal for organizing sets of related
     resources as "trails" connected by associative links, the ancestor of
     the hypertext links that define today's web.29

28. Because personal collections are strongly biased by the
    experiences and goals of the organizer, they are highly
    idiosyncratic, but still often embody well-thought-out
    and carefully executed curation activities (Kirsh 2000),
    (Jones 2007), (Marshall 2007),(Marshall 2008).

29. (Bush 1945). Bush imagined that Memex users could share
    these packages of trails and that a profession of
    trailbuilders would emerge. However, he did not envision
    that the Memexes themselves could be interconnected,
    nor did he imagine that their contents could be searched
    computationally.

                                                                         Maintaining Resources | 275
    Social and Web Curation

      Many individuals spend a great amount of time curating their own
      websites, but when a site can attract large numbers of users, it often
      allows users to annotate, "tag," "like," "+1," and otherwise evaluate
      its resources. The concept of curation has recently been adapted
      to refer to these volunteer efforts of individuals to create, maintain,
      and evaluate web resources.30 The massive scale of these bottom-
      up and distributed activities is curation by "crowdsourcing," the
      continuously aggregated actions and contributions of users.31

      The informal and organic "folksonomies" that result from their
      aggregated effort create organization and authority through
      network effects.32 This undermines traditional centralized
      mechanisms of organization and governance and threatens any
      business model in publishing, education, and entertainment that

30. (Howe 2008).

31. The most salient example of this so called "community
     curation" activity is the work to maintain the Wikipedia
     open-source encyclopedia according to a curation
     system of roles and functions that governs how and
     under what conditions contributors can add, revise, or
     delete articles; receive notifications of changes to
     articles; and resolve editing disputes (Lovink and Tkacz
     2011). Some museums and scientific data repositories also
     encourage voluntary curation to analyze and classify
     specimens or photographs (Wright 2010).

32. (Trant 2009).

      276 | Maintaining Resources
     has relied on top-down control and professional curation.33
     Professional curators are not pleased to have the ad hoc work of
     untrained people working on websites described as curation.

     Most websites are not curated in a systematic way, and the
     decentralized nature of the web and its easy extensibility means
     that the web as a whole defies curation. It is easy to find many
     copies of the same document, image, music file, or video and not
     easy to determine which is the original, authoritative or authorized
     version. Broken links return "Error 404 Not Found" messages.34

     Problems that result from lazy or careless webmastering are minor
     compared to those that result from deliberate misclassification,
     falsification, or malice. An entirely new vocabulary has emerged to
     describe these web resources with bad intent: "spam," "phishing,"
     "malware," "fakeware," "spyware," "keyword stuffing," "spamdexing,"
     "META tag abuse," "link farms," "cybersquatters," "phantom sites,"
     and many more.35 Internet service providers, security software

33. Some popular "community content" sites like Yelp where
    people rate local businesses have been criticized for
    allowing positive rating manipulation. Yelp has also been
    criticized for allowing negative manipulation of ratings
    when competitors slam their rivals.

34. The resource might have been put someplace else when
    the site was reorganized or a new web server was
    installed. It is no longer the same resource because it will
    have another URI, even if its content did not change.

35. All of these terms refer to types of web resources or
    techniques whose purpose is to mislead people into

                                                                         Maintaining Resources | 277
     firms, email services, and search engines are engaged in a constant
     war against these kinds of malicious resources and techniques.36

     Since we cannot prevent these deceptions by controlling what web
     resources are created in the first place, we have to defend ourselves
     from them after the fact. "Defensive curation" techniques include
     filters and firewalls that block access to particular sites or resource
     types, but whether this is curation or censorship is often debated,

    doing things or letting things be done to their computers
    that will cost them their money, time, privacy, reputation,
    or worse. We know too well what spam is. Phishing is
    a type of spam that directs recipients to a fake website
    designed to look like a legitimate one to trick them into
    entering account numbers, passwords, or other sensitive
    personal information. Malware, fakeware, or spyware
    sites offer tempting downloadable content that installs
    software designed to steal information from or take
    control of the visiting computer. Keyword stuffing,
    spamdexing, and META tag abuse are techniques that
    try to mislead search engines about the content of a
    resource by annotating it with false descriptions. Link
    farms or scraper sites contain little useful or original
    content and exist solely for the purpose of manipulating
    search engine rankings to increase advertising revenue.
    Similarly, cybersquatters register domain names with the
    hope of profiting from the goodwill of a trademark they
    do not own.

36. (Brown 2009).

      278 | Maintaining Resources
and from the perspective of the government or organization doing
the censorship it is certainly curation. Nevertheless, the
decentralized nature of the web and its open protocols can
sometimes enable these controls to be bypassed.

Computational Curation

Search engines continuously curate the web because the algorithms
they use for determining relevance and ranking determine what
resources people are likely to access. At a smaller scale, there are
many kinds of tools for managing the quality of a website, such as
ensuring that HTML content is valid, that links work, and that the
site is being crawled completely. Another familiar example is the
spam and content filtering that takes place in our email systems
that automatically classifies incoming messages and sorts them into
appropriate folders.

One might think that computational curation is always more reliable
than any curation carried out by people. Certainly, it seems that we
should always be able to trust any assertion created by context-
aware resources like temperature or location sensors. But can we
trust the accuracy of web content? Search engines use the
popularity of web pages and the structure of links between them
to compute relevance. But popularity and relevance do not always
ensure accuracy. We can easily find popular pages that prove the
existence of UFOs or claim to validate wacky conspiracy theories.

Computational curation is more predictable than curation done by
people, but search engines have long been accused of bias built
into their algorithms. For example, Google's search engine has been
criticized for giving too much credibility to websites with .edu
domain names, to sites that have been around for a long time, or

                                                                  Maintaining Resources | 279
     that are owned by or that partner with the company, like Google
     Maps or YouTube.37

     In organizing systems that contain data, there are numerous tools
     for name matching, the task of determining when two different
     text strings denote the same person, object, or other named entity.
     This problem of eliminating duplicates and establishing a controlled
     or authoritative version of the data item arises in numerous
     application areas but familiar ones include law-enforcement and
     counter-terrorism. Done incorrectly, it might mean that you end up
     on a "watch list" and experience difficulties every time you want to
     fly commercially.

     An extremely promising new approach to computational curation
     involves using scientific measuring equipment to analyze damaged
     physical resources and then building software models of the
     resources that can be manipulated to restore the resources or
     otherwise improve access to their content. For example, the first
     sound recordings were made using rotating wax cylinders; sounds
     caused a diaphragm to vibrate, the pattern of vibration was
     transferred into a connected stylus, which then cut a groove into
     the wax. When the cylinder was rotated past a passive stylus, it
     would vibrate according to the groove pattern, and the amplified
     vibrations could be heard as the replayed sound. Unfortunately,
     wax cylinders from the 19th century are now so fragile that they
     would fall apart if they were played. This dilemma was resolved
     by Carl Haber, an experimental physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley
     Laboratory. Haber used image processing techniques to convert
     microscope-detailed scans of the grooves in the wax cylinders.

37. (Diaz 2005), (Grimmelmann 2009).

      280 | Maintaining Resources
     Measurements of the grooves could then be transformed to
     reproduce the sounds captured in the grooves.38

     A second example of computational curation applied to digital
     preservation is work done by a research team led by Melissa Terras
     and Tim Weyrich at University College London to build a
     3-dimensional model of a 17th-century "Great Parchment Book"
     damaged in an 18th-century fire. The parchment was singed,
     shriveled, creased, folded, and nearly impossible to read (see
     website). After traditional document restoration techniques (e.g.,
     illustrated in photos in "Preservation") went as far as they could, the
     researchers used digital image capture and modeling techniques to
     create a software model of the parchment that could stretch and
     flatten the digital document to discover text hidden by the damage.

    Discarding, Removing, and Not Keeping

     So far, we have discussed maintenance as activities involved in
     preserving and protecting resources in an organizing system over
     time. An essential part of maintenance is the phasing out of
     resources that are damaged or unusable, expired or past their
     effectivity dates, or no longer relevant to any interaction.

     Many organizations admit to a distinct lack of strategy in the
     removal aspect of maintenance. A firm with outdated storage
     technology might have to discard older data simply to make room

38. See video of Haber explaining how this works, Haber
    has recently been able to build a version of his scanning
    and image processing technology for use outside the
    laboratory that he calls Irene (Image, Reconstruct, Erase
    Noise, Etc.). (Cowen 2015) and (Wilkinson 2014)

                                                                         Maintaining Resources | 281
     for new data, and might do so without considering that keeping
     some summary statistics would be valuable for historical analysis.
     Other firms might be biased towards keeping information just
     because they went to the trouble of collecting or acquiring it. Some
     amount of "intelligent" removal is an essential ingredient in any
     maintenance regime, and a popular book argues forcefully for
     continually discarding resources from personal organizing systems
     as a method of focusing on the resources that really matter. (See the
     sidebar, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.)

     In memory institutions, common terms for getting rid of resources
     include discarding, de-accession, de-selection, and weeding.

     Efforts by libraries to automate the discarding of books that have
     not circulated for several years might seem like the obvious
     counterpart to their automated acquisition, but such efforts often
     produce passionate complaints from library patrons.39

     Other domains have other mechanisms and terms for removing

39. For an explanation of automated acquisition see Eva
    Guggemos, Professional archivist and academic librarian

     https://www.quora.com/How-do-libraries-decide-which-
     books-to-purchase-and-which-books-to-remove-from-

    circulation.

    For a cogent discussion of when and for what reasons
    weeding must take place in university libraries, see

     https://mrlibrarydude.wordpress.com/2014/03/12/why-

    we-weed-book-deselection-in-academic-libraries/.

    A typical reaction when libraries discard books is
    described in (Jackman 2015)

      282 | Maintaining Resources
resources. Employess are removed by firing, layoff, or retirement .
Athletes are cut or waived or sent down from a sports team if their
performance deteriorates.

Keeping an organizing system current often involves some amount
of elimination of older resources in order to make space for the
new: in fashion retail, the floor is constantly restocked with the
latest styles. Software development teams will halt active support
and documentation efforts of legacy versions.

Information resources are often discarded to comply with laws
about retaining sensitive data. Governments and office holders
sometimes destroy documents that might prove damaging or
embarrassing if they are discovered through Freedom of
Information requests or by opposing political parties.

More positively, the "right to be forgotten" movement and
intentional destruction of information records about prior
bankruptcy, credit problems, or juvenile arrests after a certain
period of time has passed can be seen as a policy of "social
forgetfulness" that gives people a chance to get on with their
lives.40

It is worth noting that the ability to discard without having to reuse
is relatively recent. Historically, the urge and need to discard has
clashed with the availability of resources. In the Middle Ages,
liturgical texts or music would be phased out, perhaps when the
music had gone out of style or when entire sections of the liturgy
were phased out by decree. When this happened, they would reuse
the parchment or vellum, either by scraping it down or by flipping
it over, pasting it in a book, and using the other side. The former
of these solutions often created a palimpsest, a document or other

40. (Blanchette and Johnson 2002)

                                   Maintaining Resources | 283
     resource in which the remnants of older content remain visible
     under the new.

     Some people have difficulty in discarding things, regardless of their
     actual value. This behavior is called hoarding, and is now regarded
     as a kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder that requires treatment
     because it can cause emotional, physical, social, and even legal
     problems for the hoarder and family members. It seems
     unsympathetic that many TV shows and stories have been produced
     about especially compulsive hoarding. A famous example is that of
     the Collyer brothers in New York, who shut themselves off from the
     world for years, and when they were found dead inside their home
     in 1947 it contained 140 tons of collected items, including 25,000
     books, fourteen pianos, thousands of bottles and tin cans, hundreds
     of yards of fabrics, and even a Model T car chassis.41

   Governance

     Governance overlaps with curation in meaning, but typically has
     more of policy focus (what should be done), rather than a process
     focus (how to do it). Governance is also more frequently used to
     describe curation in business and scientific organizing systems
     rather than in libraries, archives, and museums. Governance has
     a broader scope than curation because it extends beyond the
     resources in a collection and also applies to the software,
     computing, and networking environments needed to use them. This
     broader scope also means that governance must specify the rights
     and responsibilities for the people who might interact with the

41. (Neziroglu 2014) and (Lidz 2003).

     284 | Maintaining Resources
     resources, the circumstances under which that might take place,
     and the methods they would be allowed to use.

     Corporate governance is a common term applied to the ongoing
     maintenance and management of the relationship between
     operating practices and long-term strategic goals.42

     Data governance policies are often shaped by laws, regulations or
     policies that prohibit the collection of certain kinds of objects or
     types of information. Privacy laws prohibit the collection or misuse
     of personally identifiable information about healthcare, education,
     telecommunications, video rental, and in some countries restrict
     the information collected during web browsing.43

    Governance in Business Organizing Systems

     Governance is essential to deal with the frequent changes in

42. Libraries and museums must also deal with long-term
    strategy, but the lesser visibility of library governance
    and museum governance might simply reflect the greater
    concerns about fraud and malfeasance in for-profit
    business contexts than in non-profit contexts and the
    greater number of standards or "best practices" for
    corporate governance. (Kim, Nofsinger, and Mohr 2009).

43. Data governance decisions are also often shaped by the
    need to conform to information or process model
    standards, or to standards for IT service management like
    the Information Technology Infrastructure Library(ITIL).
    See http://www.itil-officialsite.com/.

                                                                        Maintaining Resources | 285
     business organizing systems and the associated activities of data
     quality management, access control to ensure security and privacy,
     compliance, deletion, and archiving. For many of these activities,
     effective governance involves the design and implementation of
     standard services to ensure that the activities are performed in an
     effective and consistent manner.44

                Stop and Think: Business Data Governance
                Ebay, Target, and other large companies have had
             tens of millions of passwords, credit card numbers, and
             other sensitive personal information breached by
             hackers or security lapses. Consider a data breach you
             have heard of or experienced. What secure information
             was leaked? How might the business's governance
             policies and practices have affected the severity of the
             breach? What changes could the businesses make to
             protect people's data better?

     Today's information-intensive businesses capture and create large
     amounts of digital data. The concept of "business intelligence"

44. In this context, these management and maintenance
    activities are often described as "IT governance" (Weill
    and Ross 2004). Data classification is an essential IT
    governance activity because the confidentiality,
    competitive value, or currency of information are factors
    that determine who has access to it, how long it should
    be preserved, and where it should be stored at different
    points in its lifecycle.

      286 | Maintaining Resources
     emphasizes the value of data in identifying strategic directions and
     the tactics to implement them in marketing, customer relationship
     management, supply chain management and other information-
     intensive parts of the business.45 A management aspect of
     governance in this domain is determining which resources and
     information will potentially provide economic or competitive
     advantages and determining which will not. A conceptual and
     technological aspect of governance is determining how best to
     organize the useful resources and information in business
     operations and information systems to secure the potential
     advantages.

     Business intelligence is only as good as the data it is based on, which
     makes business data governance a critical concern that has rapidly
     developed its own specialized techniques and vocabulary. The most
     fundamental governance activity in information-driven businesses
     is identifying the "master data" about customers, employees,
     materials, products, suppliers, etc., that is reused by different
     business functions and is thus central to business operations.46

45. (Turban et al. 2010).

46. This master data must be continually "cleansed" to
    remove errors or inconsistencies, and "de-duplication"
    techniques are applied to ensure an authoritative source
    of data and to prevent the redundant storage of many
    copies of the same resource. Redundant storage can
    result in wasted time searching for the most recent or
    authoritative version, cause problems if an outdated
    version is used, and increase the risk of important data
    being lost or stolen. (Loshin 2008).

                                                                        Maintaining Resources | 287
     Because digital data can be easily copied, data governance policies
     might require that all sensitive data be anonymized or encrypted
     to reduce the risk of privacy breaches. To identify the source of a
     data breach or to facilitate the assertion of a copyright infringement
     claim a digital watermark can be embedded in digital resources.47

    Governance in Scientific Organizing Systems

     Scientific data poses special governance problems because of its
     enormous scale, which dwarfs the datasets managed in most
     business organizing systems. A scientific data collection might
     contain tens of millions of files and many petabytes of data.
     Furthermore, because scientific data is often created using
     specialized equipment or computers and undergoes complex
     workflows, it can be necessary to curate the technology and
     processing context along with data in order to preserve it. An
     additional barrier to effective scientific data curation is the lack of
     incentives in scientific culture and publication norms to invest in
     data retention for reuse by others. 48

47. (Cox et al. 2007).

48. Recently imposed requirements by the National Science
    Foundation(NSF), National Institute of Health(NIH) and
    other research granting agencies for researchers to
    submit "data management plans" as part of their
    proposals should make digital data curation a much more
    important concern (Borgman 2011). (NSF Data
    Management Plan Requirements: http://www.nsf.gov/
    eng/general/dmp.jsp).

      288 | Maintaining Resources
   The Long Tail of Dark Data
   Almost all scientists admit that they are holding "dark
data," data that has never been made available to the
rest of the scientific community. There may only be a
few scientists worldwide that would want to see a
particular dataset, but there are many thousands of
these datasets. Other dark data comes from research
that fails to find effects; because these negative findings
are less likely to be published, literature reviews can be
skewed by their omission. Just as Netflix makes the long
tail of movies available, perhaps dark data would
become more accessible if it could be could easily
uploaded to a Netflix for Science. (Heidorn 2008)

24. Key Points in Chapter
Three

  · Which activities are common to all organizing systems?

      Selection, organizing, interaction design, and maintenance
      activities occur in every organizing system.

      (See "Introduction")

  · Are selection, organizing, interaction design, and maintenance
      the same activities in every organizing systems?

      These activities are not identical in every domain, but the
      general terms enable communication and learning about
      domain-specific methods and vocabularies.

      (See "Introduction")

  · What is the first decision to be made when creating an
      organizing system?

      The most fundamental decision for an organizing system is
      determining its resource domain, the group or type of
      resources that are being organized.

      (See "Selecting Resources")

  · Why does selection by memory institutions differ from
      sampling in scientific research?

      Memory institutions select rare and distinctive resources, but
      in scientific research, a sample must contain representative
      instances.

      (See "Selecting Resources")

290 | Key Points in Chapter Three
· Does making selection principles clear and consistent ensure
   that they are good ones?

   Even when the selection principles behind a collection are clear
   and consistent, they can be unconventional, idiosyncratic, or
   otherwise biased.

   (See "Selection Criteria")

· How does "looking upstream" support better resource
   selection?

   If you can determine where the resources come from, you can
   make better selection decisions by evaluating the people,
   processes, and organizing systems that create them.

   (See "Looking "Upstream" and "Downstream" to Select
   Resources")

· What is a resource property?

   In this book we use property in a generic and ordinary sense as
   a synonym for feature or "characteristic." Many cognitive and
   computer scientists are more precise in defining these terms
   and reserve property for binary predicates (e.g., something is
   red or not, round or not). If multiple values are possible, the
   property is called an attribute, "dimension," or "variable."

   (See "Organizing Resources")

· What is the relationship between resource properties and
   organizing principles?

   Most organizing systems use principles that are based on
   specific resource properties or properties derived from the
   collection as a whole.

   (See "Organizing Resources")

                                                        Key Points in Chapter Three | 291
  · How do businesses differ in the ways they organize people?

      There are a huge number of ways to organize people that differ
      in the extent of hierarchical structure, the flow of information
      up and down the hierarchy, the span of control for managers,
      and the discretion people have to deviate or innovate with
      respect to the work they have been assigned to do.

      (See the sidebar, Organizing People into Businesses)

  · What problems can arise when arranging physical resources?

      Some arrangements of physical resources are constrained or
      precluded by resource properties that might cause problems
      for other resources or for their users.

      (See "Organizing with Properties of Physical Resources")

  · What are some of the ways in which the mind follows Gestalt
      principles and imposes simpler interpretations on visual
      sensations?

      There are always multiple interpretations of the sensory stimuli
      gathered by our visual system, but the mind imposes the
      simplest ones: things near each other are grouped, complex
      shapes are viewed as simple shapes that are overlapping,
      missing information needed to see separate visual patterns as
      continuous or whole is filled in, and ambiguous figure-ground
      illusions are given one interpretation at a time.

      (See the sidebar, Gestalt Principles)

  · How can built environments influence the expectations,
      behaviors, and experiences of everyone who enters the space?

      Built environments can be designed to encourage or discourage
      interactions between people, to create a sense of freedom or
      confinement, to reward exploration or enforce efficiency.

292 | Key Points in Chapter Three
   (See "Organizing Built Environments")

· How can we define the activity of "Information Architecture"
   using the language of the discipline of organizing?

   It is straightforward from the perspective of the discipline of
   organizing to define the activity of information architecture as

   and then exposing that organization to facilitate navigation and
   information use.

· What is materiality?

   An emerging issue in the field of digital humanities is the
   requirement to recognize the materiality of the environment
   that enables people to create and interact with digital resources

· Why is the level of measurement important when organizing
   numeric data?

   The level of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio)
   of data determines how much quantitative organization of your
   data will be sensible.

   (See "Organizing With Descriptive Statistics")

· How can statistics help organize a set of resources?

   Statistical descriptions summarize a set of resources, and reveal
   other details that enable comparison of instances with the
   collection as a whole (such as identifying outliers).

      Multiple properties of the resources, the person organizing or
      intending to use them, and the social and technological
      environment in which they are being organized can collectively
      shape their organization.

  · What is the fundamental tradeoff faced when organizing
      physical resources?

      The tradeoff between the amount of work that goes into
      organizing a collection of resources and the amount of work
      required to find and use them is inescapable when the
      resources are physical objects or information resources are in
      physical form.

      (See "Affordance and Capability")

  · What are affordance and capability?

      The concept of affordance, introduced by J. J. Gibson, then
      extended and popularized by Donald Norman, captures the idea
      that physical resources and their environments have inherent
      actionable properties that determine, in conjunction with an
      actor's capabilities and cognition, what can be done with the
      resource.

      (See "Affordance and Capability")

  · Does supporting more interactions mean that an organizing
      system has more capability?

      We should not assume that supporting more types of
      interactions necessarily makes a system better or more
      capable; what matters is how much value is created or invoked
      in each interaction.

      (See "Affordance and Capability")

294 | Key Points in Chapter Three
· What does it mean for a resource to be accessible?

   A resource is only accessible when it supports interactions, and
   it is ineffective design to implement interactions with resources
   that some people are unable to perform.

   (See "Affordance and Capability")

· Why are techniques for transforming the format of a resource
   or its description important in achieving accessibility?

   Many of the techniques for making a resource accessible
   involve transforming the resource or its description into a
   different form so someone who could not perceive it or interact
   with it in its original form can now do so.

   (See "Affordance and Capability")

· What is the basis of value creation when interacting with a
   digital resource?

   With digital resources, the essence of the interaction is
   information exchange or symbolic manipulation of the
   information contained in the resource.

   (See "Value Creation with Digital Resources")

· What factors improve the usability of digital resources?

   The variety and functions of interactions with digital resources
   are determined by the amount of structure and semantics
   represented in their digital encoding, in the descriptions
   associated with the resources, or by the intelligence of the
   computational processes applied to them.

   (See "Value Creation with Digital Resources")

· What is preservation?

   Preservation of resources means maintaining them in

      conditions that protect them from physical damage or
      deterioration.

      (See "Preservation")

  · What is the relationship between digitization and preservation?

      Preservation is often a key motive for digitization, but
      digitization alone is not preservation.

      (See "Digitization and Preserving Resources")

  · What are curation and governance?

      The essence of curation and governance is having clear policies
      for collecting resources and maintaining them over time that
      enable people and automated processes to ensure that
      resource descriptions or data are authoritative, accurate,
      complete, consistent, and non-redundant.

      (See "Curation" and "Governance")

  · In what ways can computation improve the maintenance of
      resources?

      Data cleaning algorithms can eliminate duplicate data, search
      engines can improve the relevance of results using selection
      and navigation behavior, and sensor data can predict when
      machines need servicing.

      (See "Computational Curation")

  · For what reasons is discarding resources an essential
      maintenance activity?

      An essential part of maintenance is the phasing out of resources
      that are damaged or unusable, expired or past their effectivity

25. Introduction (IV)

This chapter builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in
Foundations for Organizing Systems to explain more carefully what
we mean by resource. In particular, we focus on the issue of
identity--what will be treated as a separate resource--and discuss
the issues and principles we need to consider when we give each
resource a name or identifier.

        Navigating This
            Chapter

          In "Four Distinctions about Resources" we introduce
       four distinctions we can make when we discuss
       resources: domain, format, agency, and focus. In
       "Resource Identity" we apply these distinctions as we
       discuss how resource identity is determined for physical
       resources, bibliographic resources, resources in
       information systems, as well as for active resources and
       smart things. "Naming Resources" then tackles the
       problems and principles for naming: once we have

                                                                          Introduction (IV) | 301
       identified resources, how do we name and distinguish
       them? Finally, "Resources over Time" considers issues
       that emerge with respect to resources over time.

What Is a Resource?

Resources are what we organize.

We introduced the concept of resource in "The Concept of
"Resource"" with its ordinary sense of "anything of value that can
support goal-oriented activity" and emphasized that a group of
resources can be treated as a collection in an organizing system. And
what do we mean by "anything of value," exactly? It might seem that
the question of identity, of what a single resource is, should not be
hard to answer. After all, we live in a world of resources, and finding,
selecting, describing, arranging, and referring to them are everyday
activities. And while human resources are not a primary focus of this
book, it would be remiss not to explain why it makes sense to think
of people that way. See the sidebar, People as Resources.

Nevertheless, even when the resources we are dealing with are
tangible things, how we go about organizing them is not always
obvious, or at least not obvious to each of us in the same way at all
times. Not everyone thinks of them in the same way. Recognizing
something in the sense of perceiving it as a tangible thing is only
the first step toward being able to organize it and other resources
like it. Which properties garner our attention, and which we use in
organizing depends on our experiences, purposes, and context.

We add information to a resource when we name it or describe it;
it then becomes more than "it." We can describe the same resource

302 | Introduction (IV)
in many different ways. At various times we can consider any given
resource to be one of many members of a broad category, as one of
the few members of a narrow category, or as a unique instance of a
category with only one member. For example, we might recognize
something as a piece of clothing, as a sock, or as the specific dirty
sock with the hole worn in the heel from yesterday's long hike.

However, even after we categorize something, we might not be
careful how we talk about it; we often refer to two objects as "the
same thing" when what we mean is that they are "the same type of
thing." Indeed, we could debate whether a category with only one
possible member is really a category, because it blurs an important
distinction between particular items or instances and the class or
type to which they belong.

The issues that matter and the decisions we need to make about
resource instances and resource classes and types are not
completely separable. Nevertheless, we will strive to focus on the
former ones in this chapter and the latter ones in Categorization:
Describing Resource Classes and Types.

Resources with Parts

As tricky as it can be to decide what a resource is when you are
dealing with single objects, it is even more challenging when the
resources are objects or systems composed of other parts. In these
cases, we must focus on the entirety of the object or system and
treat it as a resource, treat its constituent parts as resources, and
deal with the relationships between the parts and the whole, as we
do with engineering drawings and assembly procedures.

                                                                          Introduction (IV) | 303
          A chess set exemplifies
       the many different ways
       to decide what to count
       as a separate resource. Is
       this a chess set, two sets
       of chess pieces, six types
       of chess pieces (1 king, 1
       queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 8 pawns for each
       side), or 33 separate things (the 32 pieces and a board on
       which to play the game)?

How many things is a car? If you are imagining the car being
assembled you might think of several dozen large parts like the
frame, suspension, drive train, gas tank, brakes, engine, exhaust
system, passenger compartment, doors, and other pre-assembled
components. Of course, each of those components is itself made
up of many parts--think of the engine, or even just the radio. Some
sources have counted ten or fifteen thousand parts in the average
car, but even at that precise granularity a lot of parts are still
complex things. There are screws and wires and fasteners and on
and on; really too many to count.

Ambiguity about the number of parts in the whole holds for
information resources too; a newspaper can be considered a single
resource but it might also consist of multiple sections, each of
which contains separate stories, each of which has many
paragraphs, and so on. Similarly, while a web page can be treated
as a single resource, it can also be considered as a collection of
more granular parts, each of which can be separately identified

304 | Introduction (IV)
as the source or anchor of a link. Likewise, a bank's credit card
application might ask about outstanding loans, payment history,
current income, and other information, or the bank might just look
up your credit score, which is a statistical index that combines this
financial information into a single number.

Bibliographic Resources, Information Components, and
"Smart Things" as
Resources

Information resources generally pose additional challenges in their
identification and description because their most important
property is usually their content, which is not easily and
consistently recognizable. Organizing systems for information
resources in physical form, like those for libraries, have to juggle
the duality of their tangible embodiment with what is inherently
an abstract information resource; that is, the printed book versus
the knowledge the book contains. Here, the organizing system
emphasizes description resources or surrogates, like bibliographic
records that describe the information content, rather than their
physical properties.

Another question about resource that is especially critical in
libraries is: What set of resources should be treated as the same
work because they contain essentially similar intellectual or artistic
content? We may talk about Shakespeare's play Macbeth, but what is
this thing we call "Macbeth"? Is it a particular string of words, saved
in a computer file or handwritten upon a folio? Is it the collection of
words printed with some predetermined font and pagination? Are
all the editions and printings of these words the same Macbeth? How
should we organize the numerous live and recorded performances
of plays and movies that share the Macbeth name? What about
creations based on or inspired by Macbeth that do not share the title
"Macbeth," like the Kurosawa film "Kumonosu-jo" (Throne of Blood)

                                                                          Introduction (IV) | 305
   that transposes the plot to feudal Japan? Patrick Wilson proposed a
   genealogical analogy, characterizing a work as "a group or family of
   texts," with the idea that a creation like Shakespeare's Macbeth is the
   "ancestor of later members of the family."1

   Information system designers and architects face analogous design
   challenges when they describe the information components in
   business or scientific organizing systems. Information content is
   intrinsically merged or confounded with structure and presentation
   whenever it is used in a specific instance and context. From a logical
   perspective, an order form contains information components for
   ITEM, CUSTOMER NAME, ADDRESS, and PAYMENT INFORMATION,
   but the arrangement of these components, their type font and size,
   and other non-semantic properties can vary a great deal in different
   order forms and even across a single information system that re-
   purposes these components for letters, delivery notices, mailing
   labels, and database entries.2

1. (Shakespeare 1623), (Kurosawa 1957), and (Wilson 1968, p.
   9).

2. Separating information content from its structure and
   presentation is essential to re-purposing it for different
   scenarios, applications, devices, or users. The global
   information economy is increasingly driven by
   automated information exchange between business
   processes. When information flows efficiently from one
   type of document to another in this chain of related
   documents, the overlapping content components act as
   the "glue" that connects the information systems or web

    306 | Introduction (IV)
Similar questions about resource identity are posed by the
emergence of ubiquitous or pervasive computing, in which
information processing capability and connectivity are embedded
into physical objects, in devices like smart phones, and in the
surrounding environment. Equipped with sensors, radio-frequency
identification (RFID) tags, GPS data, and user-contributed metadata,
these smart things create a jumbled torrent of information about
location and other properties that must be sorted into identified
streams and then matched or associated with the original resource.

"Resource Identity" discusses the issues and methods for
determining "what is a resource?" for physical resources, as well as
for the bibliographic resources, information components and smart
things discussed here, in "Resources with Parts".

Identity, Identifiers, and Names

The answer to the question posed in "What Is a Resource?" has two
parts.

  · The first part is identity: what thing are we treating as the
      resource?

  · The second part is identification: differentiating between this
      single resource and other resources like it.

These problems are closely related. Once you have decided what
to treat as a resource, you create a name or an identifier so that
you can refer to it reliably. A name is a label for a resource that

services that produce and consume the documents.
(Glushko and McGrath 2005).

                                                                          Introduction (IV) | 307
   is used to distinguish one from another. An identifier is a special
   kind of name assigned in a controlled manner and governed by rules
   that define possible values and naming conventions. For a digital
   resource, its identifier serves as the input to the system or function
   that determines its location so it can be retrieved, a process called
   resolving the identifier or resolution.

   Choosing names and identifiers--be it for a person, a service, a
   place, a trend, a work, a document, a concept, etc.--is often
   challenging and highly contentious. Naming is made difficult by
   countless factors, including the audience that will need to access,
   share, and use the names, the limitations of language, institutional
   politics, and personal and cultural biases.

   A common complication arises when a resource has more than one
   name or identifier. When something has more than one name each
   of the multiple names is a synonym or alias. A particular physical
   instance of a book might be called a hardcover or paperback or
   simply a text. George Furnas and his research collaborators called
   this issue of multiple names for the same resource or concept the
   vocabulary problem.3

   Whether we call it a book or a text, the resource will usually have
   a Library of Congress catalog number as well as an ISBN as an
   identifier. When the book is in a carton of books being shipped
   from the publisher to a bookstore or library, that carton will have
   a bar-coded tracking number assigned by the delivery service, and
   a manifest or receipt document created by the publisher whose
   identifier associates the shipment with the customer. Each of these
   identifiers is unique with respect to some established scope or
   context.

3. (Furnas, Landauer, Gomez, and Dumais 1987).

    308 | Introduction (IV)
A partial solution to the vocabulary problem is to use a controlled
vocabulary. We can impose rules that standardize the way in which
names and labels for resources are assigned in the first place.
Alternatively, we can define mappings from terms used in our
natural language to the authoritative or controlled terms. However,
vocabulary control cannot remove all ambiguity. Even if a passport
or national identity system requires authoritative full names rather
than nicknames, there could easily be more than one Robert John
Smith in the system.
Controlling the language used for a particular purpose raises other
questions: Who writes and enforces these rules? What happens
when organizing systems that follow different rules get compared,
combined, or otherwise brought together in contexts different from
those for which they were originally intended?

                                                                          Introduction (IV) | 309
26. Four Distinctions about
Resources

The nature of the resource is critical for the creation and
maintenance of quality organizing systems. There are four
distinctions we make in discussing resources: domain, format,
agency, and focus. Figure: Resource Domain, Format, Focus and
Agency. depicts these four distinctions, perspectives or points of
view on resources; because they are not independent, we cannot
portray these distinctions as categories of resources.
Resource Domain, Format, Focus and Agency

Four distinctions we can make when discussing resources concern
their domain (their type of matter or content), format (physical
or digital), agency (active or passive), and focus (primary or
description).

                                                                         Four Distinctions about
                                                                                    Resources | 311
 Resource Domain

   Resource domain is an intuitive notion that groups resources
   according to the set of natural or intuitive characteristics that
   distinguishes them from other resources. It contrasts with the idea
   of ad hoc or arbitrary groupings of resources that happen to be in
   the same place at some time.

   For physical resources, domains can be coarsely distinguished
   according to the type of matter they are made of using easily
   perceived properties. The top-level classification of all things into
   the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms by Carl Linnaeus in
   1735 is deeply embedded in most languages and cultures to create
   a hierarchical system of domain categories. 1 Many aspects of this
   system of domain categories are determined by natural constraints
   on category membership that exist as patterns of shared and
   correlated properties; a resource identified as a member of one
   category must also be a member of another with which it shares
   some but not all properties. For example, a marble statue in a
   museum must also be a kind of material, and a fish in an aquarium
   must also be a kind of animal.

1. (Linnaeus 1735). Linnaeus is sometimes called the father
  of modern taxonomy (which is unfair to Aristotle) but
  he certainly deserves enormous credit for the systematic
  approach to biological classification that he proposed in
  Systema Naturae, published in 1735. This seminal work
  contains the familiar kingdom, class, order, family, genus,
  species hierarchy.

   312 | Four Distinctions about Resources
          The Document Type Spectrum
          Different domains or types of documents can be
       distinguished according to the extent to which their
       content is semantically prescribed, by the amount of
       internal structure, and by the correlations of their
       presentation and formatting to their content and
       structure. These three characteristics of content,
       structure, and presentation vary systematically from
       narrative document types like novels to transactional
       document types like invoices.

          Narrative types are authored by people and are
       heterogeneous in structure and content, and their
       content is usually just prose and graphic elements. Their
       presentational characteristics carefully reinforce their
       structure and semantics; for example, the text of titles
       or major headings is large because the content is
       important, in contrast to the small text of footnotes.
       Transactional document types are usually created
       mechanically and, as a result, are homogeneous in
       structure and content; their content is largely "data"
       --strongly typed content with precise semantics that
       can be processed by computers.

          In the middle of the spectrum are hybrid document
       types like textbooks, encyclopedias, and technical
       manuals that contain a mixture of narrative text and
       structured content in figures, data tables, code
       examples, and so on.

For information resources, easily perceived properties like a book's
color or size are less reliably correlated with resource domain, so
we more often distinguish domains based on semantic properties;

                                                  Four Distinctions about Resources | 313
   the definitions of the "encyclopedia," "novel," and "invoice" resource
   types distinguish them according to their typical subject matter, or
   the type of content, rather than according to the great variety of
   physical forms in which we might encounter them. Arranging books
   by color or size might be sensible for very small collections, or in a
   photo studio, but organizing according to physical properties would
   make it extremely impractical to find books in a large library.
   We can arrange types of information resources in a hierarchy.
   However, because the category boundaries are not sharp it is more
   useful to view domains of information resources on a continuum
   from weakly-structured narrative content to highly structured
   transactional content. This framework, called the Document Type
   Spectrum by Glushko and McGrath, captures the idea that the
   boundaries between resource domains, like those between colors in
   the rainbow, are easy to see for colors far apart in the spectrum but
   hard to see for adjacent ones.2 (See the sidebar, The Document Type
   Spectrum, and its corresponding depiction as Figure: Document
   Type Spectrum.)

   Document Type Spectrum

   The Document Type Spectrum is a continuum of document types
   from narrative ones that are mostly text, like novels, to transactional
   ones with highly-structured information, like invoices. In between

    314 | Four Distinctions about Resources
are hybrid types that contain both narrative and transactional
content, like dictionaries and encyclopedias.

Resource Format

Information resources can exist in numerous formats with the most
basic distinction between physical and digital ones. This distinction
is most important in the implementation of a resource storage or
preservation system because that is where physical properties are
usually considerations, and very possibly constraints. This
distinction is less important at the logical level when we design
interactions with resources because digital surrogates for the
physical resources can overcome the constraints posed by physical
properties. When we search for cars or appliances in an online store
it does not matter where the actual cars or appliances are located
or how they are organized. (See the sidebar, The Three Tiers of
Organizing Systems).

Many digital representations can be associated with either physical
or digital resources, but it is important to know which one is the
original or primary resource, especially for unique or valuable ones.

Today many resources in organizing systems are born digital,
created in word processors, digital cameras, audio and video
recorders. Other digital resources are by sensors in "smart things"
and by the systems that create digital resources when they interact
with barcodes, QR codes, RFID tags, or other mechanisms for
tracking identity and location.3

Other digital resources are created by digitization, the process for

3. (Kuniavsky 2010).

                      Four Distinctions about Resources | 315
   transforming an artifact whose original format is physical so it can
   be stored and manipulated by a computer. We digitize the printed
   word, photographs, blueprints, and record albums. Printed text, for
   example, can be digitized by scanning pages and using character
   recognition software or simply re-typing it.4

   There are a vast number of digital formats that differ in many ways,
   but we can coarsely compare them on two dimensions: the degree
   to which they distinguish information content from presentation
   or rendering, and the explicitness with which content distinctions
   are represented. Taken together, these two dimensions allow us

4. Project Gutenberg, begun in 1971, was the first large-scale
   effort to digitize books; its thousands of volunteers have
   created about 40,000 digital versions of classic printed
   works. Systematic research in digital libraries began in
   the 1990s when the US National Science Foundation(NSF),
   the Advanced Research Projects Agency(ARPA), and NASA
   launched a Digital Library Initiative that emphasized the
   enabling technologies and infrastructure. At about the
   same time numerous pragmatic efforts to digitize library
   collections began, characterized by some as a race
   against time as old books in libraries were literally
   disintegrating and turning into dust. The Internet
   Archive, started in 1996, now has a collection of over 3
   million texts and has estimated the cost of digitizing to
   be about $30 for the average book. Multiply this by the
   scores of millions of books held in the world's research
   libraries and it is easy to why many libraries endorsed
   Google's offer to digitize their collections.

    316 | Four Distinctions about Resources
   to compare formats on their overall "Information IQ" --with the
   overarching principle being that "smarter" formats contain more
   computer-processable information, as illustrated in Figure:
   Information IQ.
   Simple digital formats for "plain text" documents contain only the
   characters that you see on your computer keyboard. ASCII is the
   most commonly used simple format, but ASCII is inadequate for
   most languages, which have larger character sets, and it also cannot
   handle mathematical characters.5 The Unicode standard was

5. The ASCII scheme was standardized in the 1960s when
   computer memory was expensive and most computing
   was in English-speaking countries, so it is minimal and
   distinguishes only 128 characters. (Cerf1969) American
   Standard Code for Information Interchange(ASCII) is an
   ANSI specification. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   ASCII.)

   designed to overcome these limitations.6 (ASCII and Unicode are
   discussed in great detail in "Notations".)

   Most document formats also explicitly encode a hierarchy of
   structural components, such as chapters, sections or semantic
   components like descriptions or procedural steps, and sometimes
   the appearance of the rendered or printed form.7 Another

6. Unicode 6.0 (http://www.unicode.org/) has room to
   encode 109,449 characters for all the writing systems in
   the world, so a single standard can represent the
   characters of every existing language, even "dead" ones
   like Sumerian and Hittite. Unicode encodes the scripts
   used in languages, rather than languages per se, so there
   only needs to one representation of the Latin, Cyrillic,
   Arabic, etc scripts that are used for writing multiple
   language. Unicode also distinguishes characters from
   glyphs, the different forms for the same
   character--enabling different fonts to be identified as the
   same character.

7. Encoding of structure in documents is valuable because
   titles, sections, links and other structural elements can
   be leveraged to enhance the user interface and
   navigational interactions with the digital document and
   enable more precise information retrieval. Some uses of
   documents require formats that preserve their printed
   appearance. "Presentational fidelity" is essential if we
   imagine a banker or customs inspector carefully

    318 | Four Distinctions about Resources
   important distinction to note is whether the information is encoded
   as a sequence of text characters so that it is human readable as
   well as computer readable. Encoding character content with XML,
   for example, allows for layering of intentional coding or markup
   interwoven with the "plain text" content. Because XML processors
   are required to support Unicode, any character can appear in an
   XML document. The most complex digital formats are those for
   multimedia resources and multidimensional data, where the data
   format is highly optimized for specialized analysis or applications.8

   Digitization of non-text resources such as film photography,
   drawings, and analog audio and visual recordings raises a
   complicated set of choices about pixel density, color depth,
   sampling rate, frequency filtering, compression, and numerous
   other technical issues that determine the digital representation.9

   There may be multiple intended uses and devices for a digitized
   resource that could require different digitization approaches and
   formats. Downstream users of digitized resources need to know the
   format in which a digital artifact has been created, so they can reuse
   it as is, or process it in other ways.

   Some digital formats support interactions that are qualitatively
   different and more powerful than those possible with physical
   resources. Museums are using virtual world technology to create
   interactive exhibits in which visitors can fly through the solar

   comparing a printed document with a computer-
   generated one to ensure they are identical.

     system, scan their own bodies, and change gravity so they can
     bounce off walls. Sophisticated digital document formats can enable
     interactions with annotated digital images or video, 3-D graphics or
     embedded datasets. The Google Art Project contains extremely high
     resolution photographs of famous paintings that make it possible
     to see details that are undetectable under the normal viewing
     conditions in museums.10

     Nevertheless, digital representations of physical resources can also
     lose important information and capabilities. The distinctive sounds
     of hip hop music produced by "scratching" vinyl records on
     turntables cannot be produced from digital MP3 music files.11

10. The ambitious use of virtual world technology to create
    novel forms of interaction described by (Rothfarb and
    Doherty 2007) reflects the highly interactive character
    of its host museum, the Exploratorium in San Francisco
    (http://www.exploratorium.edu/). Similarly, the Google
    Art Project (http://googleartproject.com) is notable for
    its goal of complementing and extending, rather than
    merely imitating, the museum visitor's encounter with
    artwork (Proctor 2011). A feature that let people create a
    "personal art collection" is very popular, enabling a fan of
    Vincent Van Gogh to bring together paintings that hang
    in different museums.

    phone or tablet app called djay. See

      320 | Four Distinctions about Resources
The notion of Information IQ captures the idea that document
formats differ on two dimensions: the explicitness of content
representation, and the separation of content and presentation. A
scanned document is just a picture of a document with neither of
these distinctions, so it is low on both dimensions. A database or
XML document distinguishes explicitly between types of content
and presentation is separately assigned, so they are high on both
dimensions and have the highest Information IQ. An HTML
document's content distinctions are usually presentational and,
thus, it has lower IQ. Formats with high Information IQ facilitate
computer processing.

Copyright often presents a barrier to digitization, both as a matter
of law and because digitization itself enables copyright enforcement
to a degree not possible prior to the advent of digitization, by
eliminating common forms of access and interactions that are

                                                  Four Distinctions about Resources | 321
inherently possible with physical printed books like the ability to
give or sell them to someone else.12

Resource Agency

          People as Resources
          Earlier editions of this book sidestepped the question
       of people as resources to avoid complicating the
       Discipline of Organizing. People organize themselves in
       innumerable ways to coexist, share knowledge, and
       accomplish more than they could as individuals, and

12. As a result, digital books are somewhat controversial and

problematic for libraries, whose access models were

created based on the economics of print publication and

the social contract of the copyright first sale doctrine

that allowed libraries to lend printed books. Digital books

change the economics and first sale is not as well-

established for digital works, which are licensed rather

than sold (Aufderheide and Jaszi 2011). To protect their

business models, many publishers are limiting the

number of times ebooks can be lent before they "self-

destruct." Some librarians have called for boycotts of

publishers  in                           response

behaviors such as trust and reciprocity might be
considered "organizing principles" for human society.
But these organic relationships and interactions usually
lack the intentional arrangement to be considered true
Organizing Systems, except when the people are living
in "intentional communities."13

   However, people do qualify as resources in Organizing
Systems under our definition: just like digital and
physical resources, human resources can be identified,
categorized, described in terms of their attributes and
relationships, and take part in interactions to create
value. In businesses, people are organized to amplify
their skills, knowledge, and agency. A company's
organizational chart is often a formal hierarchy in which
each worker's role is defined through his or her
responsibilities and relationships to others in the
company. Treating an employee abstractly as a resource
with specific and predictable functions, inputs, and
outputs enables employees or processes to depend
upon each other without being distracted by the details
of one another's work. This so-called "black boxing" can
encourage specialization and allow an organization to
function more efficiently.

   Nevertheless, while organizational charts are typically
presented as neat hierarchies, human relationships cut
across the hierarchy to create a network, and may be
complicated by differing values and motivations.
Conflicting incentives and lack of communication

13. [link to footnote]

                        Four Distinctions about Resources | 323
       between people may cause breakdowns in the system.
       People are more than the sum of properties used to
       organize them: understanding and defining employees'
       roles too narrowly could exclude the aspects of the job
       that they find rewarding or consider part of their
       professional identity, while black boxing people's labor
       and treating them as "remote person calls" also risks
       dehumanizing them and ignoring their working
       conditions.

Agency is the extent to which a resource can initiate actions on
its own. We can define a continuum between completely passive
resources that cannot initiate any actions and active resources that
can initiate actions based on information they sense from their
environments or obtain through interactions with other resources.
A book being read at the beach will grow warm from absorbing the
sun's energy but it has no way of measuring its temperature and is
a completely passive resource. An ordinary mercury thermometer
senses and displays the temperature but is not capable of
communicating its own reading, whereas a digital wireless
thermometer or weather station can.

Passive resources serve as nouns or operands that are acted upon,
while active resources serve as verbs or operants that cause and
carry out actions. We need a concept of agency to bring resources
that are active information sources, or computational in character,
into the organizing system framework. This concept also lets us
include living resources, or more specifically, humans, into

324 | Four Distinctions about Resources
     discussions about organizing systems in a more general way that
     emphasizes their agency.14

   Passive or Operand Resources

     Organizing systems that contain passive or operand resources are
     ubiquitous for the simple reason that we live in a world of physical
     resources that we identify and name in order to interact with them.
     Passive resources are usually tangible and static and thus they
     become valuable only as a result of some action or interaction with
     them.
     Most organizing systems with physical resources or those that
     contain resources that are digitized equivalents treat those
     resources as passive. A printed book on a library shelf, a digital book
     in an ebook reader, a statue in a museum gallery, or a case of beer in
     a supermarket refrigerator only create value when they are checked
     out, viewed, or consumed. None of these resources exhibits any
     agency and cannot initiate any actions to create value on their own.

   Active or Operant Resources

     Active resources create effects or value on their own, sometimes

14. The opposing categories of operands and operants have
    their roots in debates in political economics about the
    nature of work and the creation of value (Vargo and
    Lusch 2004) and have more recently played a central role
    in the development of modern thinking about service
    design (Constantin and Lusch 1994), (Maglio et al. 2009).

                                                       Four Distinctions about Resources | 325
when they initiate interactions with passive resources. Active
resources can be people, other living resources, computational
agents, active information sources, web-based services, self-driving
cars, robots, appliances, machines or otherwise ordinary objects like
light bulbs, umbrellas, and shoes that have been made "smarter."
We can exploit computing capability, storage capacity, and
communication bandwidth to create active resources that can do
things and support interactions that are impossible for ordinary
physical passive resources.

326 | Four Distinctions about Resources
   These two screenshots of the Nest iPad app show the
thermostat control panel and an energy history report

temperature resulted in higher than average energy use

communicating with lights, appliances, smoke alarms,

                                         Four Distinctions about Resources | 327
       your car, your wearable fitness sensor, and other active
       resources (https://nest.com/works-with-nest/).

          (Screenshots by Andrea Angquist. Used with
       permission.)

We can analyze active resources according to five capabilities that
progressively increase their agency. These capabilities build on each
other to give resources and the organizing systems in which they
participate more ways to create value through interactions and
information exchanges.

Sensing or awareness

      The minimal capability for a resource to have some agency
      is for it to be able to sense or be aware of some aspect of
      its environment or its interactions with other resources. A
      thermometer measures temperature, a photodetector
      measures light, a gauge measures the fuel left in a car's gas
      tank, a GPS device computes its location after detecting and
      analyzing signals from satellites, a wearable fitness sensor
      tracks your heartbeat and how far you walk. But sensing
      something in itself does not create any value in an organizing
      system. Something needs to be done.

Actuation

      A resource has the capability to actuate when it can create
      effects or value by initiating some action as a result of the
      information it senses; "actuator" is often used to describe a
      resource that can move or control a physical mechanism or
      system, while "effector" is used when the resource is a
      biological one. Resources can actuate by turning on lights,

328 | Four Distinctions about Resources
           speakers, cameras, motors, switches, by sending a message
           about the state or value of a sensor, or by moving themselves
           around (as with robots).

              A potential or latent actuation is created when a resource can
           display or broadcast some aspect of its state, but value is only
           created if another resource (possibly human) happens to see
           the display or hear the broadcast and then acts upon it.

              For example, RFID chips, which are essentially bar codes with
           built-in radio transponders, can be attached to otherwise
           passive resources to make them active. RFID chips begin
           transmitting when they detect the presence of a RFID reading
           device. This enables automated location tracking and context
           sensing. RFID receivers are built into assembly lines, loading
           docks, parking lots, toll booths, or store shelves to detect when
           some RFID-tagged resource is at some meaningful location.
           RFID tags can be made more useful by having them record and
           transmit information from sensors that detect temperature,
           humidity, acceleration, and even biological contamination.15

     Connectivity

           For an active resource to do useful work it must be connected
           in some way to the actuation mechanism that manipulates or
           controls some other resource. This connection might be a
           direct and permanent one between the resource and the thing
           it actuates, like that of a thermostat whose temperature sensing
           capability has a fixed connection to a heating or cooling system
           that it turns off or on depending on the temperature.

              An important innovation in the design of active resources
           is "wrapping" physical resources with software so they can be

    (Crawford and Johnson, 2012)

                                                       Four Distinctions about Resources | 329
      given IP addresses and make connections with Internet
      protocols, which allows them to send information to an
      application with more capability to act on it. Such resources are
      said to be part of the "Internet of Things."

         Smart phones are active resources that can identify and share
      their own location, orientation, acceleration and a growing
      number of other contextual parameters to enable
      personalization of information services. Smart phones can also
      run the applications that receive messages from and send
      messages to other smart resources to monitor and optimize
      how they work.

Computation or programmability

      Simple active resources operate in a deterministic manner:
      given this sensor reading, do this. Other active resources have
      computational capabilities that enable them to analyze the
      current and historical information from their sensors, identify
      significant data values or patterns in these interaction
      resources, and then adapt their behavior accordingly.

         Many thermostats are programmable, but most people do not
      bother to program them so they miss out on potential energy
      savings. Nest Labs makes a learning thermostat that programs
      itself. The Nest thermostat uses sensors for temperature,
      humidity, motion, and light to figure out whether people are at
      home, and a Wi-fi connection to get local weather data.

         The Roomba vacuum cleaning robot navigates around
      furniture, power cords, stairs, and optimizes its cleaning paths
      to go over particularly dirty places. But vacuuming is all it does.
      More sophisticated robots are designed to be versatile and
      adaptable so they can repetitively perform whatever task is
      needed for some manufacturing process, and their capabilities
      can be continually upgraded by software updates, just like the
      apps on your smart phone. A new generation of robots typified
      by one called Baxter can be trained by example; a person moves

330 | Four Distinctions about Resources
      Baxter's arms and hands to show him what to do, and when
      Baxter has programmed himself to repeat it, he nods.

Composability and cooperating

      The "smartest" active resources can do more than analyze the
      information they collect and adapt what they do. In addition,
      they expose what they know and can do to other resources
      using standard or non-proprietary formats and protocols. This
      means that active resources that were independently designed
      and implemented can work together to create value.

         Many organizing systems on the web consist of collections or
      configurations of active digital resources. Interactions among
      these active resources often implement information-intensive
      business models where value is created by exchanging,
      manipulating, transforming, or otherwise processing
      information, rather than by manipulating, transforming, or
      otherwise processing physical resources.

         We are beginning to see the same principles of modularity
      and composability applied to physical resources, with open
      source software libraries for using sensors and micro-
      controllers and easy to use APIs. In essence, we are using
      software and physical resources in much the same way as
      functional building blocks, and standards will be critically
      important.

Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) is an emerging design discipline
for organizing active software resources as functional business
components that can be combined in different ways. SOA is
generally implemented using web services that exchange XML
documents in real-time information flows to interconnect the
business service components.

A familiar design pattern for an organizing system composed from
active digital resources is the "online store." The store can be
analyzed as a composition or choreography in which some web

                                                  Four Distinctions about Resources | 331
pages display catalog items, others serve as "shopping carts" to
assemble the order, and then a "checkout" page collects the buyer's
payment and delivery information that gets passed on to other
service providers who process payments and deliver the goods.

          If This, Then That
          IFTTT is a visual programming system that lets non-
       programmers connect and control active resources in
       the physical and digital worlds. IFTTT programs, called
       recipes, can take information from a growing library of
       Internet services (date/time, calendar, weather, news,
       email, social media, and many others) and use this
       information with simple control logic to trigger actions
       in other services or resources. Example recipes can
       copy an Instagram photo to Google Drive, add daily
       Fitbit data to a spreadsheet, or control lights based on
       time, weather, or sunset.

          "If sunset then electrical outlet on." The icon on the
       left is the trigger; the icon on the right is the action.

Design patterns for composing organizing systems from "smart"
physical resources are emerging in work on the "smart home,"
"smart office building," or "smart city." Many experiments are
underway and new products emerging that are trying out different

332 | Four Distinctions about Resources
combinations of hardware and software to understand the design
tradeoffs between them to best determine where the "smarts"
should go. For example, we can compare a "smart home" built
around a super-intelligent hub device that communicates and
coordinates with many other "not so smart" devices from the same
manufacturer to one in which all of the devices are equally smart
and come from different makers.

At more complex scales, a truly smart building will not just have
programmable thermostats to control heating and cooling systems.
It will take in weather forecasts, travel calendars, information about
the cost of electricity from different sources, and other relevant
information as inputs to a model of how the building heats and
cools to optimize energy use and cost while keeping the rooms at
appropriate temperatures.

Standard application interfaces enable active resources to interact
with people to get information that might otherwise come from
sensors or that enhances the value of the sensor information. A
programmable thermostat that can record time-based preferences
of the people who use the space controlled by the thermostat is
more capable than one with just a single temperature threshold. A
standard Internet protocol for communicating with the thermostat
would enable it to be controlled remotely.

Open and standard data formats and communication protocols
enable the aggregation and analysis of information from many
instances of the same type of active resource. For example, smart
phones running the Google Maps application transmit information
about their speed and location. Machine learning and sophisticated
optimization techniques of this dataset can yield collective
intelligence that can then be given to the resources from which
it was derived. In this case, Google can identify traffic jams and
generate alternative routes for the drivers stuck in traffic.

               Stop and Think: The Internet of Things
               There is a great deal of hype about the Internet of
            Things, but there is also a great deal of innovation. If you
            search for the phrase "Internet of Things" along with
            almost any physical resource, chances are you will find
            something, Try "baby," "dog," "fork," "lettuce," "pajamas,"
            "streetlamp," and then a few of your own.

     But not everything can be done best by computers. The web has
     enabled the use of people as active resources to carry out tasks of
     short duration that can be precisely described but which cannot be
     done reliably by computers. These tasks often require aesthetic or
     subjective judgment. The people doing these web-based tasks are
     often called "Mechanical Turks" by analogy to a fake chess playing
     machine from the 18th century that had a human hidden inside who
     secretly moved the pieces.16

16. Luis Von Ahn (von Ahn 2004) was the first to use the
    web to get people to perform "microwork" or "human
    computation" tasks when he released what he called "the
    ESP game" that randomly paired people trying to agree
    on labeling an image. Not long afterward Amazon created
    the MTurk platform (http://www.mturk.com) that lets
    people propose microwork and others sign up to do it,
    and today there are both hundreds of thousands of tasks
    offered and hundreds of thousands of people offering to
    be paid to do them.

     334 | Four Distinctions about Resources
  Resource Focus

    A fourth contrast between types of resources distinguishes original
    or primary resources from resources that describe them. Any
    primary resource can have one or more description resources
    associated with it to facilitate finding, interacting with, or
    interpreting the primary one. Description resources are essential in
    organizing systems where the primary resources are not under its
    control and can only be accessed or interacted with through the
    description. Description resources are often called metadata.

    The distinction between primary resources and description
    resources, or metadata, is deeply embedded in library science and
    traditional organizing systems whose collections are predominantly
    text resources like books, articles, or other documents. In these
    contexts description resources are commonly called bibliographic
    resources or catalogs, and each primary resource is typically
    associated with one or more description resources.

    In business enterprises, the organizing systems for digital
    information resources, such as business documents, or data records
    created by transactions or automated processes, almost always
    employ resources that describe, or are associated with, large sets or
    classes of primary resources.17

17. For semi-structured or more narrative documents these
    descriptions might be authoring templates used in word
    processors or other office applications, document
    schemas in XML applications, style sheets, or other kinds
    of transformations that change one resource
    representation into another one. Primary resources that
    are highly and regularly structured are invariably

                                                       Four Distinctions about Resources | 335
     The contrast between primary resources and description resources
     is very useful in many contexts, but when we look more broadly
     at organizing systems, it is often difficult to distinguish them, and
     determining which resources are primary and which are metadata
     is often just a decision about which resource is currently the focus
     of our attention.18

     For example, many Twitter users treat the 140-character message
     body as the primary resource, while the associated metadata about
     the message and sender (is it a forward, reply, link, etc.) is less
     important. However, for firms that use Twitter metadata to measure

    organized in databases or enterprise information
    management systems in which a data schema specifies
    the arrangement and type of data contained in each field
    or component of the resource.

18. Describing information as "metadata" suggests that it is
    of secondary importance, not as essential or informative
    as the resource being described. This is surely the reason
    why the US National Security Agency and those of other
    governments, whose unauthorized surveillance of global
    communications were revealed in 2013 by Edward
    Snowden, often stressed that they were only collecting
    message metadata, not its content. Of course,

     sender and brand impact, or identify social networks and trends, the
     focus is the metadata, not the content.19

     As another example, players on professional sports teams are
     human resources, but millions of people participate in fantasy
     sports leagues where teams consist of resources based on the
     statistics generated by the actual human players. Put another way,
     the associated resources in the actual sports are treated as the
     primary ones in the fantasy leagues.20

   Resource Format x Focus

     Applying the format contrast between physical and digital resources
     to the focus distinction between primary and descriptive resources
     yields a useful framework with four categories of resources (Figure:
     Resource Format x Focus.).

20. The basic idea behind fantasy sports is quite simple. You
     select a team of existing players in any sport, and then
     compare their statistical performance against other
     teams similarly selected by other people. Fantasy sports
     appeal mostly to die-hard fans who study player statistics
     carefully before "drafting" their players. The global
     fantasy sports business for companies who organize and
     operate fantasy leagues is estimated as between 1 and 2
     billion US dollars annually (Montague 2010).

Resource Format x Focus

The distinctions of resource format and resource focus combine to
distinguish four categories of resources: physical resources, digital
resources, physical descriptions , and digital descriptions.

Physical Description of a Primary Physical Resource

The oldest relationship between descriptive resources and physical
resources is when descriptions or other information about physical
resources are themselves encoded in a physical form. Nearly ten
thousand years ago in Mesopotamia small clay tokens kept in clay
containers served as inventory information to count units of goods
or livestock. It took 5000 years for the idea of stored tokens to
338 | Four Distinctions about Resources
     evolve into Cuneiform writing in which marks in clay stood for the
     tokens and made both the tokens and containers unnecessary.21

                A Cuneiform Document at the Pergamon

                The Pergamon Museum in Berlin contains a very large
             collection of Babylonian, Persian, and Assyrian artifacts
             that are nearly three thousand years old. including
             numerous cuneiform clay tablets like this one.

     Printed cards served as physical description resources for books in
     libraries for nearly two centuries.22

Digital Description of a Primary Physical Resource

Here, the digital resource describes a physical resource. The most
familiar example of this relationship is the online library catalog
used to find the shelf location of physical library resources, which
beginning in the 1960s replaced the physical cards with database
records. The online catalogs for museums usually contain a digital
photograph of the painting, item of sculpture, or other museum
object that each catalog entry describes.

years ago in Sumeria. The first use of cards in library
catalogs was literal; when the revolutionary government
of France seized private book collections, an inventory
was created stating in 1791 using the blank backs of
playing cards. 110 years later the US Library of Congress
began selling pre-printed catalog cards to libraries, but
in the mid-1960s the creation of the Machine-Readable
Cataloging(MARC) format marked the beginning of the
end of printed cards. See (Strout 1956). The MARC
standards are at http://www.loc.gov/marc/.

Digital description resources for primary physical resources are

                                                  Four Distinctions about Resources | 341
essential in supply chain management, logistics retailing,
transportation, and every business model that depends on having
timely and accurate information about where things are or about
their current states. This digital description resource is created as
a result of an interaction with a primary physical resource like a
temperature sensor or with some secondary physical resource that
is already associated with the primary physical resource like an RFID
tag or barcode.

Augmented reality systems combine a layer of real-time digital
information about some physical object to a digital view or
representation of it. The yellow "first down" lines superimposed
in broadcasts of football games are a familiar example. Augmented
reality techniques that superimpose identifying or descriptive
metadata are used in displays to support the operation or
maintenance of complex equipment, in smart phone navigation and
tourist guides, in advertising, and in other domains where users
might otherwise need to consult a separate information source.
Advanced airplane cockpit technology includes heads-up displays
that present critical data based on available instrumentation,
including augmented reality runway lights when visibility is poor
because of clouds or fog.

Augmented reality displays have recently been incorporated into
wearable technology like Google Glass, which mounts on eyeglass
frames to display information obtained from the Internet after being
requested by voice commands. Some luxury car brands have
incorporated similar technology to project dashboard data, traffic
conditions, and directions on the driver's windshield.

Digital Description of a Primary Digital Resource

A digital resource describes a digital resource. This is the
relationship in a digital library or any web-based organizing system,

342 | Four Distinctions about Resources
     making it possible to access a primary digital resource directly from
     the digital secondary resource.

    Physical Description of a Primary Digital Resource

     This is the relationship implemented when we encounter an
     embedded QR barcode in newspaper or magazine advertisements,
     on billboards, sidewalks, t-shirts, or on store shelves. Scanning the
     QR code with a mobile phone camera can launch a website that
     contains information about a product or service, place an order for
     one unit of the pointed-to- item in a web catalog, dial a phone
     number, or initiate another application or service identified by the
     QR code.23

23. We treat resource format and resource focus as distinct
    dimensions, so there are four categories here. This
    contrasts with David Weinberger's three "orders of order"
    that he proposes in the first chapter of a book called
    Everything is Miscellaneous (Weinberger 2007).
    Weinberger starts with the assumption that physical
    resources are inherently the primary ones, so the first
    "order of order" emerges when physical resources are
    arranged. The second "order of order" emerges when
    physical description resources are arranged, and the
    third "order of order" emerges when digital description
    resources for physical resources are arranged. Later in
    the book Weinberger mentions the use of bar codes
    associated with websites, a physical description of a
    digital resource, but because he started with the

assumption that physical resources define the "first
order" this example does not fit into his orders of order.

344 | Four Distinctions about Resources
 27. Resource Identity

   Determining the identity of resources that belong in a domain,
   deciding which properties are important or relevant to the people
   or systems operating in that domain, and then specifying the
   principles by which those properties encapsulate or define the
   relationships among the resources are the essential tasks when
   building any organizing system. In organizing systems used by
   individuals or with small scope, the methods for doing these tasks
   are often ad hoc and unsystematic, and the organizing systems are
   therefore idiosyncratic and do not scale well. At the other extreme,
   organizing systems designed for institutional or industry-wide use,
   especially in information-intensive domains, require systematic
   design methods to determine which resources will have separate
   identities and how they are related to each other. These resources
   and their relationships are then described in conceptual models
   which guide the implementation of the systems that manage the
   resources and support interactions with them.1

1. These methods go by different names in different
  disciplines, including "data modeling," "systems analysis,"
  and "document engineering" (e.g., (Kent 2012), (Silverston
  2000), (Glushko and McGrath 2005). What they have in
  common is that they produce conceptual models of a
  domain that specify their components or parts and the
  relationships among these components or parts. These
  conceptual models are called "schemas" or "domain
  ontologies" in some modeling approaches, and are
  typically implemented in models that are optimized for
  particular technologies or applications.

                                                                            Resource Identity | 345
  Identity and Physical Resources

   Our human visual and cognitive systems do a remarkable job at
   picking out objects from their backgrounds and distinguishing them
   from each other. In fact, we have little difficulty recognizing an
   object or a person even if we are seeing them from a novel distance
   and viewing angle or with different lighting, shading, and so on.
   When we watch a football game, we do not have any trouble
   perceiving the players moving around the field, and their
   contrasting uniform colors allow us to see that there are two
   different teams.

   The perceptual mechanisms that make us see things as permanent
   objects with contrasting visible properties are just the prerequisite
   for the organizing tasks of identifying the specific object,
   determining the categories of objects to which it belongs, and
   deciding which of those categories is appropriate to emphasize.
   Most of the time we carry out these tasks in an automatic,
   unconscious way; at other times we make conscious decisions about
   them. For some purposes we consider a sports team as a single
   resource, as a collection of separate players for others, as offense
   and defense, as starters and reserves, and so on.2

   Although we have many choices about how we can organize football

2. Specifically, an NFL football team needs to be considered
   a single resource for games through the season and in
   playoffs, and 53 individual players for other situations,
   like the NFL draft or play-calling. The team and the
   team's roster can be thought of as resources, and the
   team's individual players are also resources that make up
   the whole team.

    346 | Resource Identity
   players, all of them will include the concept of a single player as
   the smallest identifiable resource. We are never going to think of a
   football player as an intentional collection of separately identified
   leg, arm, head, and body resources because there are no other ways
   to "assemble" a human from body parts. Put more generally, there
   are some natural constraints on the organization of matter into
   parts or collections based on sizes, shapes, materials, and other
   properties that make us identify some things as indivisible
   resources in some domain.

  Identity and Bibliographic Resources

   Pondering the question of identity is something relatively recent in
   the world of librarians and catalogers. Libraries have been around
   for about 4000 years, but until the last few hundred years librarians
   created "bins" of headings and topics to organize resources without
   bothering to give each individual item a separate identifier or name.
   This meant searchers first had to make an educated guess as to
   which bin might house their desired information--"Histories"?
   "Medical and Chemical Philosophy"?--then scour everything in the
   category in a quest for their desired item. The choices were ad
   hoc and always local--that is, each cataloger decided the bins and
   groupings for each catalog.3

3. (Denton 2007) is a highly readable retelling of the history
   of cataloging that follows four themes--the use of axioms,
   user requirements, the work, and standardization and
   internationalization--culminating with their synthesis in
   the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic
   Records(FRBR).

                                                                             Resource Identity | 347
   The first systematic approach to dealing with the concept of
   identity for bibliographic resources was developed by Antonio
   Panizzi at the British Museum in the mid-19th century. Panizzi
   wondered: How do we differentiate similar objects in a library
   catalog? His solution was a catalog organized by author name with
   an index of subjects, along with his newly concocted Rules for the
   Compilation of the Catalogue. This contained 91 rules about how
   to identify and arrange author names and titles and what to do
   with anonymous works. The rules were meant to codify how to
   differentiate and describe each singular resource in his library.
   Taken together, the rules serve to group all the different editions
   and versions of a work together under a single identity.4

   The concept of identity for bibliographic resources was refined in
   the 1950s by Lubetzky, who enlarged the concept of the work to
   make it a more abstract idea of an author's intellectual or artistic
   creation. According to Lubetzky's principle, an audio book, a video
   recording of a play, and an electronic book should be listed each
   as distinct items, yet still linked to the original because of their
   overlapping intellectual origin.5

4. This was a surprisingly controversial activity. Many
   opposed Panizzi's efforts as a waste of time and effort
   because they assumed that "building a catalog was a
   simple matter of writing down a list of titles"(Denton
   2007, p. 38).

5. Seymour Lubetzky worked for the US Library of Congress
   from 1943-1960 where he tirelessly sought to simplify
   the proliferating mass of special case cataloging rules
   proposed by the American Library Association, because
   at the time the LOC had the task of applying those rules

    348 | Resource Identity
   The distinctions put forth by Panizzi, Lubetzky, Svenonius and other
   library science theorists have evolved today into a four-step
   abstraction hierarchy (see Figure: The FRBR Abstraction Hierarchy.)
   between the abstract work, an expression in multiple formats or
   genres, a particular manifestation in one of those formats or genres,
   and a specific physical item. The broad scope from the abstract
   work to the specific item is essential because organizing systems
   in libraries must organize tangible artifacts while expressing the
   conceptual structure of the domains of knowledge represented in
   their collections.

   This hierarchy is defined in the Functional Requirements for
   Bibliographical Records(FRBR), published as a standard by the
   International Federation of Library Associations and
   Institutions(IFLA).6

   and making the catalog cards other libraries used.
   Lubetzky's book on Cataloguing Rules and Principles
   (Lubetzky 1953) bluntly asks "Is this rule necessary?" and
   was a turning point in cataloging.

6. In between the abstraction of the work and the specific
   single item are two additional levels in the FRBR
   abstraction hierarchy. An expression denotes the multiple
   the multiple realizations of a work in some particular
   medium or notation, where it can actually be perceived.
   There are many editions and translations of Macbeth, but
   they are all the same expression, and they are a different
   expression from all of the film adaptations of Macbeth.
   A manifestation is the set of physical artifacts with the

                                                                             Resource Identity | 349
If we revisit the question "What is this thing we call Macbeth?" we
can see how different ways of answering fit into this abstraction
hierarchy. The most specific answer is that " Macbeth" is a specific
item, a very particular and individual resource, like that dog-eared
paperback with yellow marked pages that you owned when you read
Macbeth in high school. A more abstract answer is that Macbeth
is an idealization called a work, a category that includes all the
plays, movies, ballets, or other intellectual creations that share a
recognizable amount of the plot and meaning from the original
Shakespeare play.
The FRBR Abstraction Hierarchy

same expression. All of the copies of the Folger Library
print edition of Macbeth are the same manifestation.

350 | Resource Identity
The abstraction hierarchy for identifying resources yields four
different answers about the identity of an information resource.

Identity and Information Components

In information-intensive domains, documents, databases, software
applications, or other explicit repositories or sources of information
are ubiquitous and essential to the creation of value for the user,
reader, consumer, or customer. Value is created through the
comparison, compilation, coordination or transformation of
information in some chain or choreography of processes operating

                                                                         Resource Identity | 351
   on information flowing from one information source or process
   to another. These processes are employed in accounting, financial
   services, procurement, logistics, supply chain management,
   insurance underwriting and claims processing, legal and
   professional services, customer support, computer programming,
   and energy management.

   The processes that create value in information-intensive domains
   are "glued together" by shared information components that are
   exchanged in documents, records, messages, or resource
   descriptions of some kind. Information components are the
   primitive and abstract resources in information-intensive domains.
   They are the units of meaning that serve as building blocks of
   composite descriptions and other information artifacts.

   The value creation processes in information-intensive domains
   work best when their component parts come from a common
   controlled vocabulary for components, or when each uses a
   vocabulary with a granularity and semantic precision compatible
   with the others. For example, the value created by a personal health
   record emerges when information from doctors, clinics, hospitals,
   and insurance companies can be combined because they all share
   the same "patient" component as a logical piece of information.

   This abstract definition of information components does not help
   identify them, so we will introduce some heuristic criteria: An
   information component can be: (1) Any piece of information that has
   a unique label or identifier or (2) Any piece of information that is
   self-contained and comprehensible on its own.7

7. This kind of advice can be found in many data or
  conceptual modeling texts, but this particular statement
  comes from (Glushko, Weaver, Coonan, and Lincoln 1988).
  Similar advice can also be found in the information

   352 | Resource Identity
   These two criteria for determining the identity of information
   components are often easy to satisfy through observations,
   interviews, and task analysis because people naturally use many
   different types of information and talk easily about specific
   components and the documents that contain them. Some common
   components (e.g., person, location, date, item) and familiar
   document types (e.g., report, catalog, calendar, receipt) can be
   identified in almost any domain. Other components need to be more
   precisely defined to meet the more specific semantic requirements
   of narrower domains. These smaller or more fine-grained
   components might be viewed as refined or qualified versions of the
   generic components and document types, like course grade and
   semester components in academic transcripts, airport codes and
   flight numbers in travel itineraries and tickets, and drug names and
   dosages in prescriptions.

   Decades of practical and theoretical effort in conceptual modeling,
   relational theory, and database design have resulted in rigorous
   methods for identifying information components when
   requirements and business rules for information can be precisely
   specified. For example, in the domain of business transactions,
   required information like item numbers, quantities, prices, payment
   information, and so on must be encoded as a particular type of
   data--integer, decimal, Unicode string, etc.-- with clearly defined
   possible values and that follows clear occurrence rules.8

   science literature: "A unit of information...would have to
   be...correctly interpretable outside any context" (Wilson
   1968, p. 18).

8. A group of techniques collectively called "normalization"
   produces a set of tightly defined information components
   that have minimal redundancy and ambiguity. Imagine

                                                                             Resource Identity | 353
that a business keeps information about customer orders
using a "spreadsheet" style of organization in which a
row contains cells that record the date, order number,
customer name, customer address, item ID, item
description, quantity, unit price, and total price. If an
order contains multiple products, these would be
recorded on additional rows, as would subsequent orders
from the same customer. All of this information is
important to the business, but this way of organizing
it has a great deal of redundancy and inefficiency. For
example, the customer address recurs in every order,
and the customer address field merges street, city, state
and zip code into a large unstructured field rather than
separating them as atomic components of different types
of information with potentially varying uses. Similar
redundancy exists for the products and prices. Canceling
an order might result in the business deleting all the
information it has about a particular customer or
product.

Normalization divides this large body of information into
four separate tables, one for customers, one for customer
orders, one for the items contained in each order, and
one for item information. This normalized information
model encodes all of the information in the "spreadsheet
style" model, but eliminates the redundancy and avoids
the data integrity problems that are inherent in it.

354 | Resource Identity
Identifying components can seem superficially easy at the
transactional end of the Document Type Spectrum (see the sidebar
in "Resource Domain"), with orders or invoices, forms requiring
data entry, or other highly-structured document types like product
catalogs, where pieces of information are typically labeled and
delimited by boxes, lines, white space or other presentation features
that encode the distinctions between types of content. For example,
the presence of ITEM, CUSTOMER NAME, ADDRESS, and PAYMENT
INFORMATION labels on the fields of an online order form suggests
these pieces of information are semantically distinct components in
a retail application. In addition, these labels might have analogues in
variable names in the source code that implements the order form,
or as tags in a XML document created by the ordering application;
<CustName>John Smith</CustName> and <Item>A-19</Item> in
the order document can be easily identified when it is sent to the
other services by the order management application.

But the theoretically grounded methods for identifying components
like those of relational theory and normalization that work for
structured data do not strictly apply when information
requirements are more qualitative and less precise at the narrative
end of the Document Type Spectrum. These information
requirements are typical of narrative, unstructured and semi-
structured types of documents, and information sources like those
often found in law, education, and professional services. Narrative
documents include technical publications, reports, policies,
procedures and other less structured information, where semantic

Normalization is taught in every database design course.
The concept and methods were proposed by (Codd 1970),
who invented the relational data model, and has been
taught to students in numerous database design
textbooks like (Date 2003).

                                                                         Resource Identity | 355
   components are rarely labeled explicitly and are often surrounded
   by text that is more generic. Unlike transactional documents that
   depend on precise semantics because they are used by computers,
   narrative documents are used by people, who can ask if they are not
   sure what something means, so there is less need to explicitly define
   the meaning of the information components. Occasional exceptions,
   such as where components in narrative documents are identified
   with explicit labels like NOTE and WARNING, only prove the rule.

  Identity and Active Resources

   Active resources ("Use Controlled Vocabularies") initiate effects or
   create value on their own. In many cases an inherently passive
   physical resource like a product package or shipping pallet is
   transformed into an active one when associated with an RFID tag
   or bar code. Mobile phones contain device or subscriber IDs so
   that any information they communicate can be associated both with
   the phone and often, through indirect reference, with a particular
   person. If the resource has an IP address, it is said to be part of the
   "Internet of Things."9

9. The "Internet of Things" concept spread very quickly
   after it was proposed in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, who co-
   founded the Auto-ID center at MIT that year to
   standardize RFID and sensor information. For a popular
   introduction, see (Gershenfeld, Krikorian, and Cohen
   2004). For a recent technical survey and a taxonomy of
   application domains and scenarios see (Atzori, Iera, and
   Morabito 2010).

    356 | Resource Identity
Organizing systems that create value from active resources often
co-exist with or complement organizing systems that treat its
resources as passive. In a traditional library, books sat passively on
shelves and required users to read their spines to identify them.
Today, some library books contain active RFID tags that make them
dynamic information sources that self-identify by publishing their
own locations. Similarly, a supermarket or department store might
organize its goods as physical resources on shelves, treating them
as passive resources; superimposed on that traditional organizing
system is one that uses point-of-sale transaction information
created when items are scanned at checkout counters to
automatically re-order goods and replenish the inventory at the
store where they were sold. In some stores the shelves contain
sensors that continually "talk to the goods" and the information
they gather can maintain inventory levels and even help prevent
theft of valuable merchandise by tracking goods through a store or
warehouse. The inventory becomes a collection of active resources;
each item eager to announce its own location and ready to conduct
its own sale. Another category of inanimate objects that are active
resources are those that use Twitter to communicate their status
or sensor measurements. These include bridges, rivers, and the
Curiosity Rover on Mars.

          Big Data Makes "Smart" Soccer Players
          The German World Cup soccer team, which won the
       2014 World Cup, took advantage of sophisticated data
       collection and analysis to optimize player skill and
       strategy training. German software firm SAP analyzed
       video data from on-field cameras that captured
       thousands of data points per second about player
       position and movement to identify improvements in
       passing and ball handling for German players and detect

                                                                         Resource Identity | 357
             weaknesses in opponents. German sports equipment
             firm Adidas designed cleats with sensors that track
             mileage, field position, and movements. (Norton 2014)
             and (Reynolds 2014).

     The extent to which an active resource is "smart" depends on how
     much computing capability it has available to refine the data it
     collects and communicates. A large collection of sensors can
     transmit a torrent of captured data that requires substantial
     processing to distinguish significant events from those that reflect
     normal operation, and also from those that are statistical outliers
     with strange values caused by random noise. This challenge gets
     qualitatively more difficult as the amount of data grows to big data
     size, because a one in million event might be a statistical outlier
     that can be ignored, but if there are a thousand similar outliers
     in a billion sensor readings, this cluster of data probably reveals
     something important. On the other hand, giving every sensor the
     computing capability to refine its data so that it only communicates
     significant information might make the sensors too expensive to
     deploy.10

10. Pattern analysis can help escape this dilemma by

    data. In designing smart things and devices for people,
    it is helpful to create a smart model in order to predict
    the kinds of patterns and locations relevant to the data

    a set of dimensions and principles that will act as smart

guides for the development of smart things. Modeling
helps to enable automation, security, or energy
efficiency, and baseline models can be used to detect
anomalies. As for location, exact locations are
unnecessary; use of a "symbolic space" to represent each
"sensing zone"--e.g., rooms in a house--and an
individual's movement history as a string of
symbols--e.g., abcdegia--works sufficiently as a model of
prediction. See (Das et al. 2002).

 28. Naming Resources

   Determining the identity of the thing, document, information
   component, or data item we need is not always enough. We often
   need to give that resource a name, a label that will help us
   understand and talk about what it is. But naming is not just the
   simple task of assigning a sequence of characters. In this section, we
   will discuss why we name, some of the problems with naming, and
   the principles that help us name things in useful ways.

 What's in a Name?

   When a child is born, its parents give it a name, often a very stressful
   and contentious decision. Names serve to distinguish one person
   from another, although names might not be unique--there are
   thousands of people named James Smith and Maria Garcia. Names
   also, intentionally or unintentionally, suggest characteristics or
   aspirations. The name given to us at birth is just one of the names
   we will be identified with during our lifetimes. We have nicknames,
   names we use professionally, names we use with friends, and names
   we use online. Our banks, our schools, and our governments will
   know who we are because of numbers they associate with our
   names. As long as it serves its purpose to identify you, your name
   could be anything.1

1. Well, maybe not anything. Books list traditional meanings
  of various names, charts rank names by popularity in
  different eras, and dozens of websites tout themselves
  as the place to find a special and unique name. See

   360 | Naming Resources
Resources other than people need names so we can find them,
describe them, reuse them, refer or link to them, record who owns
them, and otherwise interact with them. In many domains the
names assigned to resources are also influenced or constrained by
rules, industry practice, or technology considerations.

Different countries have rules about characters or words
that may be used in names. In Germany, for example,
the government regulates the names parents can give
to their children; there's even a book, the International
Handbook of Forenames, to guide them (Kulish 2009). In
Portugal, the Ministry of Justice publishes lists of
prohibited names (BBC News, 2007a). Meanwhile, in 2007,
Swedish tax officials rejected a family's attempt to name
their daughter Metallica (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/
6525475.stm).

We can also change our names. Whether a woman takes
on her husband's surname after marriage or, like the
California man who changed his name to "Trout Fishing,"
we just find something that better suits us than our given
name.

The Problems of Naming

Giving names to anything, from a business to a concept to an action,
can be a difficult process and it is possible to do it well or do it
poorly. The following section details some of the major challenges in
assigning a name to a resource.

The Vocabulary Problem

Every natural language offers more than one way to express any
thought, and in particular there are usually many words that can
be used to refer to the same thing or concept. The words people
choose to name or describe things are embodied in their
experiences and context, so people will often disagree in the words
they use. Moreover, people are often a bit surprised when it
happens, because what seems like the natural or obvious name
to one person is not natural or obvious to another. One way to
avoid surprises is to have people cooperate in choosing names for
resources, and information architects often use participatory
design techniques of card sorting or free listing for this purpose.23

2. While you may think that certain terms are more
   obviously "good" than others, studies show that "there
   is no one good access term for most objects. The idea
   of an `obvious,' `self-evident,' or `natural' term is a myth!"
   (Furnas et al. 1987, p. 967).

3. (Spencer  2009).     Free  listing              (see

362 | Naming Resources
Back in the 1980s in the early days of computer user interface
design, George Furnas and his colleagues at Bell Labs conducted
a set of experiments to measure how much people would agree
when they named some resource or function. The short answer:
very little. Left to our own devices, we come up with a shockingly
large number of names for a single common thing.

          Unreliable Names: Knockin' On Heaven's Door

          In 2008, Music recommendation service Last.fm
       employee Richard Jones compiled a list of the 100 most
       descriptions of the Guns N' Roses recording of Bob
       Dylan's song "Knockin' on Heaven's Door." The 21st most
       common description of the song incorrectly attributes
       the recording to Aerosmith.

                                                                       Naming Resources | 363
              Reprinted in Figure 1 of (Hemerly 2011). Used by
           permission here.

   In one experiment, a thousand pairs of people were asked to "write
   the name you would give to a program that tells about interesting
   activities occurring in some major metropolitan area." Less than 12
   pairs of people agreed on a name. Furnas called this phenomenon
   the vocabulary problem, concluding that no single word could ever
   be considered the "best" name.4

  Homonymy, Polysemy, and False Cognates

   Sometimes the same word can refer to different resources--a "bank"
   can be a financial institution or the side of a river. When two words
   are spelled the same but have different meanings they are
   homographs; if they are also pronounced the same they are

4. The most common names for this service were activities,
   calendar and events, but in all over a hundred different
   names were suggested, including cityevents, whatup,
   sparetime, funtime, weekender, and nightout, "People
   use a surprisingly great variety of words to refer to the
   same thing," Furnas wrote, "If everyone always agreed
   on what to call things, the user's word would be the
   designer's word would be the system's word. ...
   Unfortunately, people often disagree on the words they
   use for things" (Furnas et al. 1987, p. 964).

    364 | Naming Resources
   homonyms. If the different meanings of the homographs are related,
   they are polysemes.

   Resources with homonymous and polysemous names are
   sometimes incorrectly identified, especially by an automated
   process that cannot use common sense or context to determine
   the correct referent. Polysemy can cause more trouble than simple
   homography because the overlapping meaning might obscure the
   misinterpretation. If one person thinks of a "shipping container"
   as being a cardboard box and orders some of them, while another
   person thinks of a "shipping container" as the large box carried by
   semi-trailers and stacked on cargo ships, their disagreement might
   not be discovered until the wrong kinds of containers arrive.5

   Many words in different languages have common roots, and as a
   result are often spelled the same or nearly the same. This is
   especially true for technology words; for example, "computer" has
   been borrowed by many languages. The existence of these cognates
   and borrowed words makes us vulnerable to false cognates. When a
   word in one language has a different meaning and refers to different
   resources in another, the results can be embarrassing or disastrous.
   "Gift" is poison in German; "pain" is bread in French.

5. This example comes from (Farish 2002), who analyzes
   "What's in a Name?" and suggests that multiple names
   for the same thing might be a good idea because non-
   technical business users, data analysts, and system
   implementers need to see things differently and no one
   standard for assigning names will work for all three
   audiences.

                                                                            Naming Resources | 365
  Names with Undesirable Associations

   False cognates are a special category of words that make poor
   names, and there are many stories relating product marketing
   mistakes, where a product name or description translates poorly,
   into other languages or cultures, with undesirable associations.6
   Furthermore, these undesirable associations differ across cultures.
   For example, even though floor numbers have the straightforward
   purpose to identify floors from lowest to highest levels, most
   buildings in Western cultures skip the 13th floor because many
   people think 13 is an unlucky number. In many East and Southeast
   Asian buildings, the 4th floor is skipped. In China the number 4
   is dreaded because it sounds like the word for "death," while 8 is
   prized because it sounds like the word for "wealth."

   While it can be tempting to dismiss unfamiliar biases and beliefs
   about names and identifiers as harmless superstitions and
   practices, their implications are ubiquitous and far from benign.
   Alphabetical ordering might seem like a fair and non-discriminatory
   arrangement of resources, but because it is easy to choose the name
   at the top of an alphabetical list, many firms in service businesses
   select names that begin with "A," "AA," or even "AAA" (look in any
   printed service directory). A consequence of this bias is that people
   or resources with names that begin with letters late in the alphabet
   are systematically discriminated against because they are often not
   considered, or because they are evaluated in the context created by
   resources earlier in the alphabet rather than on their own merit.7

Names that Assume Impermanent Attributes

Many resources are given names based on attributes that can be
problematic later if the attribute changes in value or interpretation.

          From `Kentucky Fried Chicken' to `KFC'

of scientific publications in alphabetic order has been
shown to affect reputation and employment by giving
undeserved advantages to people whose names start
with letters that come early in the alphabet. This bias
might also affect admission to selective schools.
(Efthyvoulou 2008).

                                                                        Naming Resources | 367
              "Kentucky Fried Chicken" was founded in 1930 by
           Harland Sanders as a tiny restaurant in a gas station
           storeroom in Corbin, Kentucky. It was one of the first
           fast-food chains to go international, and in 1987 was the
           first Western restaurant chain to open in China. It
           changed its name to "KFC" a few years later, no doubt in
           part because in Beijing, Moscow, London and other
           locations not anywhere near Kentucky many people
           have probably never heard of the place.

   Web resources are often referred to using URLs that contain the
   domain name of the server on which the resource is located,
   followed by the directory path and file name on the computer
   running the server. This treats the current location of the resource
   as its name, so the name will change if the resource is moved. It
   also means that resources that are identical in content, like those
   at an archive or mirror website, will have different names than the
   original even though they are exact copies. An analogous problem is
   faced by restaurants or businesses with street names or numbers in
   their names if they lose their leases or want to expand.8

8. The Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise solved this
   problem by changing its name to KFC, which you can now
   find in Beijing, Moscow, London and other locations not
   anywhere near Kentucky and where many people have
   probably never heard of the place.

    368 | Naming Resources
     Some dynamic web resources that are generated by programs have
     URIs that contain information about the server technology used to
     create them. When the technology changes, the URIs will no longer
     work.9

     Some resources have names that include page numbers, which
     disappear or change when the resource is accessed in a digital form.
     For example, the standard citation format for legal opinions uses the
     page number from the printed volume issued by West Publishing,
     which has a virtual monopoly on the publishing of court opinions
     and other types of legal documents.10

    Why is the professional basketball team in Los Angeles
    called the "Lakers" when there are few natural lakes
    there? The team was originally located in Minneapolis,
    Minnesota, a state nicknamed "The Land of 10,000
    Lakes."

 9. Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the web, famously
    argued that Cool URIs Don't Change (Berners-Lee 1998).

10. Any online citation to one of the West printed court
    reports will use the West format. However, when Mead
    Data wanted to use the West page numbers in its LEXIS
    online service to link to specific pages, West sued for
    copyright infringement. The citation for the West
    Publishing vs. Mead Data Central case is 799 F.2d 1219 (8th
    Cir 1986), which means that the case begins on page 1219
    of volume 799 in the set of opinions from the 8th Circuit
    Court of Appeals that West published in print form. West
    won the case and Mead Data had to pay substantial

                                                                             Naming Resources | 369
     Some resources have names that contain dates, years or other time
     indicators, most often to point to the future. The film studio named
     "20th Century Fox" took on that name in the 1930s to give it a
     progressive, forward-looking identity, but today a name with "20th
     Century" in it does the opposite.11

   The Semantic Gap

     The semantic gap is the difference in perspective in naming and
     description when resources are described by automated processes
     rather than by people.12

     The semantic gap is largest when computer programs or sensors
     obtain and name some information in a format optimized for
     efficient capture, storage, decoding, or other technical criteria. The
     names--like IMG20268.jpg on a digital photo--might make sense
     for the camera as it stores consecutively taken photos but they are

    royalties. Fortunately, this logic behind this decision was
    repudiated by the US Supreme Court a few years later in
    a case that West published as Feist Publications, Inc., v.
    Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991), and West
    can no longer claim copyright on page numbers.

11. When George Orwell gave the title "1984" to a novel he
    wrote in 1949, he intended it as a warning about a
    totalitarian future as the Cold War took hold in a divided
    Europe, but today 1984 is decades in the past and the title
    does not have the same impact.

content of the picture, like GoldenGateBridge.jpg.
When we try to examine the content of computer-created or
sensor-captured resources, like a clip of music or a compiled
software program, a text rendering of the content simply looks like
nonsense. It was designed to be interpreted by a computer program,
not by a person.

Choosing Good Names and Identifiers

If someone tells you they are having dinner with their best friend,
                                                                        Naming Resources | 371
a cousin, someone with whom they play basketball, and their
professional mentor from work, how many places at the table will
be set? Anywhere from two to five; it is possible all those relational
descriptions refer to a single person, or to four different people, and
because "friend," "cousin," "basketball teammate" and "mentor" do
not name specific people you will have to guess who is coming to
dinner.

If instead of descriptions you are told that the dinner guests are
Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice, you can count four names and you know
how many people are having dinner. But you still cannot be sure
exactly which four people are involved because there are many
people with those names.

The uncertainty is eliminated if we use identifiers rather than
names. Identifiers are names that refer unambiguously to a specific
person, place, or resource because they are assigned in a controlled
way. Identifiers are often strings of numbers or letters rather than
words to avoid the biases and associations that words can convey.
For example, a professor might grade exams that are identified by
student numbers rather than names.

          Names {and, or, vs} Identifiers
          People change their names for many reasons: when
       they get married or divorced, because their name is
       often mispronounced or misspelled, to make a political
       or ethnic statement, or because they want to stand out.
       A few years a football player with a large ego named
       Chad Johnson, which is the second most common
       surname in the US, decided to change his name to his
       player number of 85, becoming Chad "Ochocinco." He
       had an ochocinco.com website and used the ochocinco
       name on Facebook and Twitter. In a bit of irony, when

372 | Naming Resources
            Ochocinco wanted to put Ocho Cinco on the back of his
            football jersey, the football league would not let him
            because his legal name does not have a space in it. That
            surely contributed to his decision to change his name
            back to Chad Johnson in 2012.

               When you go to coffee shops, you are often asked
            your name, which the cashier writes on the empty cup
            so that your drink can be identified after the barista
            makes it. They do not actually need your name; just as
            some establishments use a receipt number to
            distinguish orders, what they need is an identifier. So
            even if your name is Joe, you can tell them it is Thor,
            Wotan, Mercurio, El Greco, Clark Kent, or any other
            name that is likely to be a unique identifier for the
            minute it takes to make your beverage.13

     The distinction between names and identifiers for people is often
     not appreciated. (See the sidebar, Names {and, or, vs} Identifiers.)

   Make Names Informative

     The most basic principle of naming is to choose names that are
     informative, which makes them easier to understand and
     remember. It is easier to tell what a computer program or XML
     document is doing if it uses names like "ItemCost" and "TotalCost"
     rather than just "I" or "T." People will enter more consistent and
     reusable address information if a form asks explicitly for "Street,"
     "City," and "PostalCode" instead of "Line1" and "Line2."

     Identifiers can be designed with internal structure and semantics
     that conveys information beyond the basic aspect of pointing to
     a specific resource. An International Standard Book Number(ISBN)
     like "978-0-262-07261-8" identifies a resource (07261="Document
     Engineering") and also reveals that the resource is a book (978), in
     English (0), and published by The MIT Press (262).14

    jerseys/?partner=technology_newsletter.

14. Identifiers with meaningful internal structure are said
    to be structured or intelligent. Those that contain no
    additional information are sometimes said to be
    unstructured, opaque, or dumb. The 8 in the ISBN
    example is a check digit, not technically part of the
    identifier, that is algorithmically derived from the other
    digits to detect errors in entering the ISBN.

     The navigation points that mark intersections of radial signals from
     ground beacons or satellites that are crucial to aircraft pilots used
     to be meaningless five-letter codes that were changed to make
     them suggest their locations; semantic landmark names made pilots
     less likely to enter the wrong names into navigation systems, For
     example, some of the navigation points near Orlando, Florida--the
     home of Disney World--are MICKI, MINEE, and GOOFY.15

   Use Controlled Vocabularies

     One way to encourage good names for a given resource domain or
     task is to establish a controlled vocabulary. A controlled vocabulary
     is like a fixed or closed dictionary that includes the terms that can
     be used in a particular domain. A controlled vocabulary shrinks
     the number of words used, reducing synonymy and homonymy,
     eliminating undesirable associations, leaving behind a set of words
     with precisely defined meanings and rules governing their use.

     A controlled vocabulary is not simply a set of allowed words; it also
     includes their definitions and often specifies rules by which the
     vocabulary terms can be used and combined. Different domains
     can create specific controlled vocabularies for their own purposes,
     but the important thing is that the vocabulary be used consistently
     throughout that domain.16

15. (McCartney 2006).

16. (Svenonius 2000) calls vocabulary control "the sine qua
    non of information organization" (p. 89). "The imposition
    of vocabulary control creates an artificial language out

                                                                              Naming Resources | 375
    For bibliographic resources important aspects of vocabulary control
    include determining the authoritative forms for author names,
    uniform titles of works, and the set of terms by which a particular
    subject will be known. In library science, the process of creating and
    maintaining these standard names and terms is known as authority
    control.

    When evaluating what name to use for an author, librarians typically
    look for the name form that is used most commonly across that
    author's body of work while conforming to rules for handling
    prefixes, suffixes and other name parts that often cause name
    variations. For example, a name like that of Johann Wolfgang von
    Goëthe might be alphabetized as both a "G" name and a "V" name,
    but using "G" is the authoritative way. "See" and "see also"
    references then map the variations to the authoritative name.17

    Official authority files are maintained for many resource domains:
    a gazetteer associates names and locations and tells us whether
    we should be referring to Bombay or Mumbai; the Domain Name
    System(DNS) maps human-oriented domain and host names to

    of a natural language" (p. 89), leaving behind an official,
    normalized set of terms and their uses.

17. This mapping is "the means by which the language of the
    user and that of a retrieval system are brought into sync"
    (Svenonius 2000, p. 93) and allows an information-seeker
    to understand the relationship between, say, Samuel
    Clemens and Mark Twain. The Library of Congress(LOC)
    maintains a list of standard, accepted names for authors,
    subjects, and titles called the Name Authority File.

their IP addresses; the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry assigns
unique identifiers to every chemical described in the open scientific
literature; numerous institutions assign unique identifiers to
different categories of animal species.18

In some cases, authority files are created or maintained by a
community, as in the case of MusicBrainz, an "open music
encyclopedia" to which users contribute information about artists,
releases, tracks, and other aspects of music. Music metadata is
notoriously unreliable; one study found over 100 variations in the
description of the Knockin' on Heaven's Door song (written by Bob
Dylan) as recorded by Guns N' Roses.19

          A fish once known as the Patagonian Toothfish
       because of its large and unattractive teeth became
       popular in American restaurants when a fish wholesaler
       began marketing it as the Chilean Sea Bass even though
       it is usually found farther south in cold Antarctic waters
       and it is not a sea bass. Unfortunately for the fish, this
       alias was so successful that it led to overfishing,
       threatening the survival of the species. Some
       environmentally-oriented chefs, restauranteurs, and
       seafood distributors organized a boycott to save the
       fish. (Fabricant 2002)

A controlled vocabulary is extremely useful to people who use it, but
if you are designing an organizing system for other people who do
not or cannot use it, you need to accommodate the variety of words
they will actually use when they seek or describe resources. The
authoritative name of a certain fish species is Amphiprion ocellaris,
but most people would search for it as "clownfish," "anemone fish,"
or even by its more familiar film name of Nemo.

Furnas suggests "unlimited aliasing" to connect the uncontrolled
or natural vocabularies that people use with the controlled one

378 | Naming Resources
     employed by the organizing system. By this he means that there
     must be many alternate access routes to each word or function
     that a user is trying to find. For example, the birth name of the
     42nd President of the United States of America is "William Jefferson
     Clinton," but web pages that refer to him as "Bill Clinton" are vastly
     more common, and searches for the former are redirected to the
     latter. A related mechanism used by search engines is spelling
     correction, essentially treating all the incorrect spellings as aliases
     of the correct one ("did you mean California?" when you typed
     "Claifornia").

    Make Identifiers Unique or Qualified

     Even though an identifier refers to a single resource, this does not
     mean that no two identifiers are identical. One military inventory
     system might use stock number 99 000 1111 to identify a 24-hour,
     cold-climate ration pack, while another inventory system could use
     the same number to identify an electronic radio valve. Each
     identifier is unique in its inventory system, but if a supply request
     gets sent to the wrong warehouse hungry soldiers could be sent
     radio valves instead of rations.2021

20. This rations / radio confusion is described in (Wheatley
     2004). In 2008 a similar mistake in managing inventory at
     a US military warehouse led to missile launch fuses being
     sent to Taiwan instead of helicopter batteries, causing
     a high-level diplomatic furor when the Chinese
     government objected to this as a treaty violation
     (Hoffman 2008).

21. Organizing systems in libraries, museums, and

                                                                              Naming Resources | 379
     We can prevent or reduce identifier collisions by adding information
     about the namespace, the domain from which the names or
     identifiers are selected, thus creating what are often called qualified
     names. There are several dozen US cities named "Springfield" and
     "Washington," but adding state codes to mail addresses
     distinguishes them. Likewise, we can add prefixes to XML element
     names when we create documents that reuse components from
     multiple document types, distinguishing <book:Title> from
     <legal:Title>.

     We can fix problems like these by qualifying or extending the
     identifier, or by creating a globally unique identifier(GUID), one that
     will never be the same as another identifier in any organizing system
     anywhere else. One easy method to create a GUID is to use a URL
     you control and append a string to it, the same approach that gives
     every web page a unique address. GUIDs are often used to identify
     software objects, the resources in distributed systems, or data
     collections.22

     Because they are not created by an algorithm whose results are

    businesses often give sequential accession numbers to
    resources when they are added to a collection, but these
    identifiers are of no use outside of the context in which
    they are assigned, as when a union catalog or merged
    database is created.

22. A more general technique is to use the Universally Unique
    Identifier(UUID) standard, which standardizes some
    algorithms that generate 128-bit tokens that, for all
    practical purposes, will be unique for hundreds, if not
    thousands, of years.

      380 | Naming Resources
     provably unique, we do not consider fingerprints, or other biometric
     information, to be globally unique identifiers for people, but for all
     practical purposes they are.23

    Distinguish Identifying and Resolving

     Library call numbers are identifiers that do not contain any
     information about where the resource can be found in the library
     stacks on in a digital repository. This separation enables this
     identification system to work when there are multiple copies in
     different locations, in contrast to URIs that serve as both identifiers
     and locations much of the time. When the identifier does not
     contain information about resource location, it must be"resolved"
     to determine the location. With physical resources, resolution takes
     place with the aid of signs, maps, or other associated resources that
     describe the resource arrangement in some physical environment;
     for example, "You are here" maps associate each resource identifier
     with a coordinate or other means of finding it on the map. With
     digital resources, the resolver is a directory system or service that
     interprets an identifier and looks up its location or directly initiates
     resource retrieval.

23. (OASIS 2003). The Organization for the Advancement of
    Structured Information Systems(OASIS) XML Common
    Biometric Format(XCBF) was developed to standardize
    the use of biometric data like DNA, fingerprints, iris
    scans, and hand geometry to verify identity
    (https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/
    tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xcbf).

29. Resources over Time

Problems of "what is the resource?" and "how do we identify it?"
are complex and often require ongoing work to ensure they are
properly answered as an organizing system evolves. We might need
to know how a resource does or does not change over time (its
persistence), whether its state and content come into play at a
specified point in time (its effectivity), whether the resource is what
it is said to be (its authenticity), and sometimes who has certified
its authenticity over time (its provenance). A resource might have
persistence, but only the provenance provided by an documented
chain of custody enables questions about authenticity to be
answered with authority. Effectivity describes the limits of a
resource's lifespan on the time line.
Resources over Time

Four considerations that arise with respect to the maintenance of
resources over time are their persistence, provenance, authenticity,
and effectivity.
Figure: Resources over Time. portrays the relationships among the
concepts of Persistence, Provenance, Effectivity, and Authenticity.

Persistence

          The Great Sphinx at Giza

          The Great Sphinx has persisted for over four thousand
       years. It has survived acts of vandalism, target practice
       by Napoleon's artillery, shoulder-deep burial in desert
       sandstorms, and eventual excavation in the early 20th
       century. (Its origin and that of the name "Sphinx" are
       debated among scholars, yet both are recognized
       worldwide as a persistent meme in our collective
       consciousness.)

          (Photo by R. Glushko.)

Even if you have reached an agreement as to the meaning of "a
thing" in your organizing system, you still face the question of the
identity of the resource over time, or its persistence.

                                                                    Resources over Time | 383
Persistent Identifiers

How long must an identifier last? Coyle gives the conventional, if
unsatisfying, answer: "As long as it is needed."1 In some cases, the
time frame is relatively short. When you order a specialty coffee and
the barista asks for your name, this identifier only needs to last until
you pick up your order at the end of the counter. But other time
frames are much longer. For libraries and repositories of scientific,
economic, census, or other data the time frame might be "forever."

The design of a scheme for persistent identifiers must consider
both the required time frame and the number of resources to be
identified. When the Internet Protocol(IP) was designed in 1980,
it contained a 32-bit address scheme, sufficient for over 4 billion
unique addresses. But the enormous growth of the Internet and the
application of IP addresses to resources of unexpected types have
required a new addressing scheme with 128 bits.2

Recognition that URIs are often not persistent as identifiers for
web-based resources led the Association of American
Publishers(AAP) to develop the Digital Object Identifier(DOI) system.
The location and owner of a digital resource can change, but its DOI
is permanent.3

2. IP v6 for Internet addresses. The threat of exhaustion
   was the motivation for remedial technologies, such as
   classful networks, Classless Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR)
   methods, and Network Address Translation(NAT) that
   extend the usable address space.

Persistent Resources

Even though persistence often has a technology dimension, it is
more important to view it as a commitment by an institution or
organization to perform activities over time to ensure that a
resource is available when it is needed. Put another way,
preservation ("Preservation") and governance ("Governance") are
activities carried out to ensure the outcome of persistence.

          Stop and Think: The Paradox of Theseus
          Every day that Theseus's ship is in the harbor, a single
       plank gets replaced, until after a few years the ship is
       completely rebuilt: not a single original plank remains. Is
       it still the ship of Theseus? And suppose, meanwhile, the
       shipbuilders have been building a new ship out of the
       replaced planks? Is that the ship of Theseus?

The subtle relationship between preservation and persistence raises
some interesting questions about what it means for a resource to
stay the same over time. One way to think of persistence is that a
persistent resource is never changed. However, physical resources
often require maintenance, repair, or restoration to keep them
accessible and usable, and we might question whether at some
point these activities have transformed them into different

(http://www.doi.org). However, DOI has its issues too. It
is a highly political, publisher-controlled system, not a
universal solution to persistence.

                                                                    Resources over Time | 385
   resources.4 Likewise, digital resources require regular backup and
   migration to keep them available and this might include changing
   their digital format.

   Many resources like online newspapers or blog feeds continually
   change their content but still have persistent identifiers. This
   suggests we should think of persistence more abstractly, and
   consider as persistent resources any that remain functionally the
   same to support the same interactions at any point in their lifetimes,
   even if their physical properties or information values change.

   Active resources implemented as computational agents or web
   services might be re-implemented numerous times, but as long
   as they do not change their interfaces they can be deemed to be
   persistent from the perspective of other resources that use them.
   Similarly, the dataset that defines a user or customer model in a
   recommendation system should be treated as a persistent resource;
   it includes information like name and date of birth that is persistent
   in the traditional sense; but it might also include "last purchase" and
   "current location," which must change frequently to maintain the
   accuracy and usefulness of the customer model.

   Some organizing systems closely monitor their resources and every
   interaction with them to prevent or detect tampering or other

4. This is called the Paradox of Theseus, a philosophical
   debate since ancient times. Every day that Theseus's ship
   is in the harbor, a single plank gets replaced, until after
   a few years the ship is completely rebuilt: not a single
   original plank remains. Is it still the ship of Theseus? And
   suppose, meanwhile, the shipbuilders have been building
   a new ship out of the replaced planks? Is that the ship of
   Theseus? (Furner 2008, p. 6).

    386 | Resources over Time
   unauthorized changes. Some organizing systems, like those for
   software or legal documents, explicitly maintain every changed
   version to satisfy expectations of persistence, because different
   users might not be relying on the same version. With digital
   resources, determining whether two resources are the same or
   determining how they are related or derived from one another are
   very challenging problems.5

  Effectivity

              In Which Country Do You Live?
              Even if you always live in the same place, the answer
           to "what country do you live in?" can depend on when it
           is asked. Consider the case of an elderly woman born in
           1929 in Zemum, a district in the eastern European city of
           Belgrade, who has never moved. The place she lives has
           been part of seven different countries during her
           lifetime: Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1929-1941); Independent
           State of Croatia (1941-1945); Federal People's Republic of
           Yugoslavia (1945-1963); Socialist Federal Republic of
           Yugoslavia (1963-1992); Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
           (1992-2003); State Union of Serbia and Montenegro
           (2003-2006); Republic of Serbia (2007--present).

   Many resources, or their properties, also have locative or temporal
   effectivity, meaning that they come into effect at a particular time

5. See (Renear and Dubin 2003), (Wynholds 2011).

                                                                         Resources over Time | 387
and/or place; will almost certainly cease to be effective at some
future date, and may cease to be effective in different places.

Temporal effectivity, sometimes known as "time-to-live," is
generally expressed as a range of two dates. It consists of a date on
which the resource is effective, and optionally a date on which the
resource ceases to be effective, or becomes stale. For some types of
resources, the effective date is the moment they are created, but for
others, the effective date can be a time different from the moment
of creation. For example, a law passed in November may take effect
on January 1 of the following year, and credit cards first need to
be activated and then can no longer be used after their expiration
date. An "effective date" is the counterpart of the "Best Before" date
on perishable goods. That date indicates when a product goes bad,
whereas an item's effective date is when it "goes good" and the
resource that it supersedes needs to be disposed of or archived.

Locative effectivity considers borders, security, roadways, altitude,
depth and other geographic factors. Some types of resources,
including people, are restricted as to where they may or may not
be transported and/or used, such as hazardous cargo, explosives,
narcotics, pharmaceuticals, alcohol, and cannabinoids.
Jurisdictional issues concern borders, transportation corridors,
weather stations, and geographic surveys. Parachutes are altitude-
sensitive and scuba diving cylinders are depth-sensitive.

Effectivity concerns sometimes intersect with authority control for
names and places. Name changes for resources often are tied to
particular dates, events, and locations. Laws and regulations differ
across organizational and geopolitical boundaries, and those
boundaries often change. Some places that have been the site of

388 | Resources over Time
civil unrest, foreign occupation, and other political disruptions have
had many different names over time, and even at the same time.6

Today these disputed borders cause a problem for Google Maps
when it displays certain international borders. Because Google is
subject to the laws of the country where its servers are located, it
must present disputed borders to conform with the point of view
of the host country when a country-specific Google site is used to
access the map.7

6. See  http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/

hist_country_names.htm for a list of formerly used

country names and their respective effectivity.

7. See (Gravois 2010). One specific example of this effect
  of international geopolitics on an organizing system
  involves the northern border of the Crimean Peninsula.
  When running a query for "Ukraine" via google.com/maps
  (USA), the border appears as a dotted line, which reflects
  a "neutral" perspective in the aftermath of recent political
  and military conflicts. Alternatively, when submitting the
  same query via google.com.ua/maps (Ukraine), there is no
  border at all, which is a reflection of a Ukrainian
  perspective that the Crimean Peninsula is part of
  Ukraine. Lastly, when the query is submitted via
  google.ru/maps (Russia), the border is represented as a
  solid line, which reflects a Russian perspective that the
  territory is part of Russia. A 2014 study of Google Maps
  found 32 situations where the answer to "what country

                                                                        Resources over Time | 389
   In most cases effectivity implies persistence requirements because
   it is important to be able to determine and reconstruct the
   configuration of resources that was in effect at some prior time. A
   new tax might go into effect on January 1, but if the government
   audits your tax returns what matters is whether you followed the
   law that was in effect when you filed your returns.8

  Authenticity

              Do You Trust This?

   is that on the map?" depended on where it was asked
   (Yanovsky 2014)

8. Effectivity in the tax code is simple compared to that
   relating to documents in complex systems, like
   commercial aircraft. Because of their long lifetimes--the
   Boeing 737 has been flying since the 1960s--and continual
   upgrading of parts like engines and computers, each
   airplane has its own operating and maintenance manual
   that reflects changes made to the plane over time. Every
   change to the plane requires an update to the repair
   manual, making the old version obsolete. And while an
   aircraft mechanic might refer to "the 737 maintenance
   manual," each 737 aircraft actually has its own unique
   manual.

          Ustar.net sells photos autographed by celebrities, and
       each comes with a Certificate of Authenticity that
       includes a replica of the photo and a signature from a
       Ustar employee to guarantee that the autograph is an
       actual hand-signed one. But Ustar does not provide a
       certificate to guarantee that the employee signature is
       an authorized one.

          (Screenshot by R. Glushko. Source: ustar.net.)

In ordinary use we say that something is authentic if it can be
shown to be, or has come to be accepted as what it claims to be.
The importance and nuance of questions about authenticity can
be seen in the many words we have to describe the relationship
between "the real thing" (the "original") and something else: copy,

                                                                     Resources over Time | 391
   reproduction, replica, fake, phony, forgery, counterfeit, pretender,
   imposter, ringer, and so on.

   It is easy to think of examples where authenticity of a resource
   matters: a signed legal contract, a work of art, a historical artifact,
   even a person's signature.

   The creator or operator of an organizing system, whether human or
   machine, can authenticate a newly created resource. A third party
   can also serve as proof of authenticity. Many professional careers
   are based on figuring out if a resource is authentic.9

   There is a large body of techniques for establishing the identity of
   a person or physical resource. We often use judgments about the
   physical integrity of recorded information when we consider the
   integrity of its contents.

   Digital authenticity is more difficult to establish. Digital resources
   can be reproduced at almost no cost, exist in multiple locations,
   carry different names on identical documents or identical names on
   different documents, and bring about other complications that do
   not arise with physical items. Technological solutions for ensuring
   digital authenticity include time stamps, watermarking, encryption,
   and digital signatures. However, while scholars generally trust
   technological methods, technologists are more skeptical of them
   because they can imagine ways for them to be circumvented or
   counterfeited. Even when a technologically sophisticated system for
   establishing authenticity is in place, we can still only assume the

9. A notary public is used to verify that a signature on an
   important document, such as a mortgage or other
   contract, is authentic, much as signet rings and sealing
   wax once proved that no one has tampered with a
   document since it was sealed.

    392 | Resources over Time
constancy of identity as far back as this system reaches in the "chain
of custody" of the document.

Provenance

In "Looking "Upstream" and "Downstream" to Select Resources"
we recommended that you analyze any evidence or records about
the use of resources as they made their way to you from their
headwaters to ensure they have maintained their quality over time.
The concept of provenance transforms the passive question of
"what has happened to this resource?" into actions that can be taken
to ensure that nothing bad can happen to a resource or to enable it
to be detected.

          Chinese Manuscript With Provenance Seals

          This beautiful manuscript, preserved in the National
       Palace Museum in Taipei, was created by Zhao Ji (),
       Emperor Huizong, the 8th Emperor of the Chinese Song

                                                                    Resources over Time | 393
       Dynasty about a thousand years ago. He was famous for
       his skills in poetry, painting, and calligraphy. There are
       two poems here; the one on the right describes the
       techniques for Chinese landscape paintings, while the
       left one expresses the Emperor's appreciation of plum
       blossoms, which signal the onset of spring.

          The red seals are those of several Ching Dynasty
       emperors over many generations, with the oldest being
       at least five hundred years after Huizong created the
       poems. Stamping your personalized red seal on a
       resource is analogous to but vastly more elegant and
       informative than "Liking" a web page today.

          (Photo by R. Glushko.)

The idea that important documents must be created in a manner
that can be authenticated and then preserved, with an unbroken
chain of custody, goes back to ancient Rome. Notaries witnessed
the creation of important documents, which were then protected to
maintain their integrity or value as evidence. In organizing systems
like museums and archives that preserve rare or culturally
important objects or documents this concern is expressed as the
principle of provenance. This is the history of the ownership of a
collection or the resources in it, where they have been and who has
had access to the resources.

A uniquely Chinese technique in organizing systems is the
imprinting of elaborate red seals on documents, books, and
paintings that collectively record the provenance of ownership and
the review and approval of the artifact by emperors or important
officials.

394 | Resources over Time
However, it is not only art historians and custodians of critical
documents that need to be concerned with provenance. If you are
planning to buy a used car, it is wise to check the vehicle history
(using the Vehicle Identification Number, the car's persistent
identifier) to make sure it hasn't been wrecked, flooded, or stolen.

                                                                    Resources over Time | 395
30. Key Points in Chapter
Four

  · What is the relationship between a resource and a category?

      We can consider a resource to be one of many members of a
      very broad category, as the unique instance of a category with
      only one member, or anywhere in between.

      (See "What Is a Resource?")

  · What factors affect the size of a category?

      The size of the category--the number of resources that are
      treated as equivalent--is determined by the properties or
      characteristics we consider when we examine the resource.

      (See "What Is a Resource?")

  · What is metadata?

      Organizing systems for physical information resources
      emphasize description resources or surrogates like
      bibliographic records that describe the information content
      rather than their physical properties.

      (See "Bibliographic Resources, Information Components, and
      "Smart Things" as
      Resources")

  · What is an identifier and what design goals must it satisfy?

      An identifier is a special kind of name assigned in a controlled
      manner and governed by rules that define possible values and
      naming conventions. The design of a scheme for persistent

396 | Key Points in Chapter Four
   identifiers must consider both the required time frame and the
   number of resources to be identified.

   (See "Identity, Identifiers, and Names")

· What are active resources?

   Active resources create effects or value on their own, sometimes
   when they initiate interactions with passive resources. Active
   resources can be people, other living resources, computational
   agents, active information sources, web-based services, self-
   driving cars, robots, appliances, machines or otherwise
   ordinary objects like light bulbs, umbrellas, and shoes that have
   been made "smarter."

   (See "Active or Operant Resources")

· What is the recall/precision tradeoff?

   More fine-grained organization reduces recall, the number of
   resources you find or retrieve in response to a query, but
   increases the precision of the recalled set, the proportion of
   recalled items that are relevant.

   (See "Identity and Information Components")

· What is agency?

   Agency is the extent to which a resource can initiate actions
   on its own. We can define a continuum between completely
   passive resources that cannot initiate any actions and active
   resources that can initiate actions based on information they
   sense from their environments or obtain through interactions
   with other resources.

   (See "Resource Agency")

· What are active resources?

                                                          Key Points in Chapter Four | 397
      Resources become active resources when they contain sensing
      and communication capabilities.

      (See "Resource Agency")

  · Is there a fundamental difference between a primary resource
      and metadata associated with it?

      Which resources are primary and which are metadata is often
      just a decision about which resource is the focus of our
      attention.

      (See "Resource Focus")

  · What is the Document Type Spectrum?

      It can be useful to view domains of information resources on
      the Document Type Spectrum from weakly-structured
      narrative content to highly structured transactional content.

      (See the sidebar, The Document Type Spectrum)

  · What is the FRBR four-level abstraction hierarchy?

      The concept of identity for bibliographic resources has evolved
      into a four-level abstraction hierarchy between the abstract
      work, an expression in multiple formats or genres, a particular
      manifestation in one of those formats or genres, and a specific
      physical item.

      (See "Identity and Bibliographic Resources" and Figure: The
      FRBR Abstraction Hierarchy.)

  · What is the Internet of Things?

      If the resource has an IP address, it is part of the "Internet of
      Things."

      (See "Identity and Active Resources".)

· What is the vocabulary problem?

   Every natural language offers more than one way to express any
   thought, and in particular there are usually many words that
   can be used to refer to the same thing or concept.

   (See "The Problems of Naming")

· What is a potential problem with basing names on a resource
   attribute?

   Many resources are given names based on attributes that can
   be problematic later if the attribute changes in value or
   interpretation.

   (See "Names that Assume Impermanent Attributes")

· What is the Semantic Gap?

   The semantic gap is the difference in perspective in naming
   and description when resources are described by automated
   processes rather than by people.

   (See "The Semantic Gap")

· What is the most basic principle of naming?

   The most basic principle of naming is to choose names that are
   informative.

   (See "Make Names Informative")

· What is a controlled vocabulary?

   One way to encourage good names for a given resource domain
   or task is to establish a controlled vocabulary. A controlled
   vocabulary is like a fixed or closed dictionary that includes the
   terms that can be used in a particular domain. A controlled
   vocabulary shrinks the number of words used, reducing
   synonymy and homonymy, eliminating undesirable

      associations, leaving behind a set of words with precisely
      defined meanings and rules governing their use.

      (See "Use Controlled Vocabularies")

  · What is authority control?

      For bibliographic resources important aspects of vocabulary
      control include determining the authoritative forms for author
      names, uniform titles of works, and the set of terms by which a
      particular subject will be known. In library science, the process
      of creating and maintaining these standard names and terms is
      known as authority control.

      (See "Use Controlled Vocabularies")

  · Which organizing system activities promote persistence?

      Preservation and governance are activities carried out to
      ensure that resources will last as long as they are needed.

      (See "Persistence")

  · What is effectivity?

      Many resources, or their properties, also have locative or
      temporal effectivity, meaning that they come into effect at a
      particular time and/or place; will almost certainly cease to be
      effective at some future date, and may cease to be effective in
      different places.

      (See "Effectivity")

  · What guarantees the authenticity of a resource?

      The only guarantee of a resource's authenticity is having total
      oversight over the "chain of custody" from its creation to the
      present.

This chapter is a turning point in the book. The earlier chapters have
discussed the key ideas of the discipline of organizing: identifying
and selecting the resources to organize, and then organizing and
maintaining them and their organizing system. We have emphasized
that finding things later is the most important reason for organizing
them. This can be surprisingly hard to do. People know things by
different names or remember different aspects of them.

The famous painting here by the 19th century American painter
James Whistler is exhibited in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, and has
been described as a Victorian-era Mona Lisa. What name do you
know it by? How should it be described?

Resource descriptions for art usually contain the name of the artist,
the medium, the year of its completion, and, of course, its title.
Most of these map fairly obviously to the properties they describe;
the title, owing to its prominence and expressive power, is often an
exception.

Most often, a painting's title describes its subject. If you recognize
the previous painting, you most likely know it by its colloquial name,
Whistler's Mother. While it is a portrait of Anna McNeill Whistler,
mother of painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler, the artist gave
it a radically different title, Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 1,
because he believed the most important property of a painting was
not the subject it depicted, but its purely aesthetic properties and
their effect on the viewer. So Whistler named his paintings, which
were mostly landscapes and portraits, in the manner of musical
compositions: Nocturne in Black and Gold; Symphony in White;
Arrangement in Pink, Red, and Purple; and so on.

If Whistler's title surprises you, because you would have described
it as a portrait of an elderly woman, this helps reinforce how wildly
different names of the same resource can be. Resource descriptions
and metadata provide meaning, but to whom? What is salient about

404 | Introduction (V)
a resource can depend on the context in which it is experienced,
and thus may change over time. Descriptions that make sense to
some people might not make sense to others. People searching on
the "wrong descriptions" or the "wrong metadata" will not find what
they are looking for.

          Mt. St. Helens Before and After

          Before 1980, Mt. St. Helens was a "postcard-like"
       snow-covered mountain. Afterward, the mile-wide
       crater where its mountaintop once was reminds us of its
       violent volcanic eruption.

          (Credit: Public domain images from US Forest Service
       and USGS.)

Mt. St. Helens, in the southwest corner of Washington State, was
usually just described as a mountain until 1980. Then, the deadliest
and most economically destructive volcanic event in the history
of the United States blew away the top of the mountain, killing
57 people, and leaving a mile-wide crater. Today almost every
description of Mt. St. Helens mentions the volcanic eruption.
It would seem impossible to search using the wrong description
if the descriptions of a resource were kept current to include all
the latest information, but search engines are already too powerful,

                                                                           Introduction (V) | 405
   usually producing too much information. Technology improvements
   in search and retrieval do not eliminate the cognitive effort to
   remember what things are, how they are best described, and where
   they might be found. The design of resource descriptions and
   metadata depends on why we need to find the information later.
   This chapter is about how and why.

             Stop and Think:
             These Places Have Their Moments
             Our description of Mt. St. Helens forever changed
          after its volcanic eruption. Surely there are times and
          places that you remember differently because of their
          part in an important event. A family wedding? The
          Olympic Games? A natural disaster? The Twin Towers?

   It is easy to find before and after images of Mt. St. Helens doing
   a web search. What information might be associated with these
   images? Modern cameras assign an identifier to the stored
   photograph and they also capture the technical description of the
   image's production: the type of camera, lens, shutter speed, light
   sensitivity, aperture, and other settings.1 Many modern cameras
   also record information about the geographic and temporal
   circumstances surrounding the image's creation: the date, time and
   location on Earth where the photograph is taken. When the image
   is transferred out of the camera and is published for all to see,

1. Most digital cameras use the Exchangeable Image File
  Format(EXIF). The best source of information about it
  looks like its Wikipedia entry. http://en.wikipedia.org/
  wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format.

   406 | Introduction (V)
   it might be useful to record biographical information about the
   photographer to help viewers relate to the photographer and better
   understand the photograph's context. There may also be different
   licenses and copyright information to associate with the
   picture--who owns it and how it can be used.

   Consider a completely different context. Four 7-year old boys are
   selecting Lego blocks to complete their latest construction. The first
   boy is looking for "cylinder one-ers," another for "coke bottles," the
   third for "golder wipers," and the final boy is looking for "round
   one-bricks"? It turns out, they are all the same thing; each boy
   has devised his own set of descriptive terms for the tiny building
   blocks. Some of their many descriptions are based on color alone
   ("redder"), some on color and shape ("blue tunnel"), some on role
   ("connector"), some on common cultural touchstones ("light saber").
   Others, like "jail snail" and "slug," seem unidentifiable--unless, of
   course, you happen to be inside the mind of a particular 7-year-
   old kid. It doesn't matter if the boys use different description
   vocabularies when they play by themselves, but they will have to
   agree if they play together.2

2. This is much more than just a "kids say the darnedest
   things" story (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   Kids_Say_the_Darndest_Things ). Giles Turnbull (Turnbull
   2009) noticed that his kids never used the official names
   for Lego blocks (e.g., Brick 2x2). He then asked other kids
   what their names were for 32 types of Lego blocks. His
   survey showed that the kids mostly used different names,
   but each created names that followed some systematic
   principles. The most standard name was the "light saber,"
   used by every kid in Turnbull's sample.

                                                                               Introduction (V) | 407
Paintings, digital photos, and Lego blocks are all very different,
but together these scenarios raise important questions about
describing resources that we attempt to answer in this chapter:

  · What is the purpose of resource description?
  · What resource properties should be described?
  · How are resource descriptions created?
  · What makes a good resource description?

        Navigating This
            Chapter

          We begin with an overview of resource description
       ("An Overview of Resource Description"), which we
       propose as a broad concept that includes the narrower
       concepts of bibliographic descriptions and metadata.
       "The Process of Describing Resources" describes a
       7-step process of describing resources that includes
       determining scope, focus and purposes, identifying
       resource properties, designing the description

408 | Introduction (V)
vocabulary, designing the description form and
implementation, and creating and evaluating the
descriptions. Because many principles and methods for
resource description were developed for describing text
resources in physical formats, in "Describing Non-text
Resources" we briefly discuss the issues that arise when
describing museum and artistic resources, images,
music, video, and contextual resources.

                                                                  Introduction (V) | 409
 32. An Overview of Resource
 Description

   We describe resources so that we can refer to them, distinguish
   among them, search for them, manage access to them, preserve
   them, and make predictions about what might happen to them or
   what they might do. Each purpose may require different resource
   descriptions. We use resource descriptions in every communication
   and conversation; they are the enablers of organizing systems.

 Naming {and, or, vs.} Describing

   Resources in Organizing Systems discussed how to decide what
   things should be treated as resources and how names and
   identifiers distinguish one resource from another. Names can
   suggest the properties and principles an organizing system uses
   to arrange its resources. We can see how societies organize their
   people by noting that among the most common surnames in English
   are descriptions of occupations (Smith, Miller, Taylor), descriptions
   of kinship relations (Johnson, Wilson, Anderson), and descriptions of
   appearance (Brown, White).1

1. (Reaney and Wilson 1997) classify surnames as local,
  surnames of relationship, surnames of occupation or
  office, and nicknames. The dominance of occupational
  names reflects the fact that there are fewer occupations
  than places. While there are only a handful of kinship

                                                                           An Overview of Resource
                                                                                      Description | 411
   In many cultures, one spouse or the other takes a name that
   describes their marital relationship. In many parts of the English-
   speaking world, married women have often referred to themselves
   using their husband's name.2

   Similarly, many other kinds of resources have names that are
   property descriptions, including buildings (Pentagon, White House),
   geographical locations (North America, Red Sea), and cities (Grand
   Forks, Baton Rouge).

   Every resource can be given a name or identifier. Identifiers are
   especially efficient resource descriptions because, by definition,
   identifiers are unique over some domain or collection of resources.
   Names and identifiers do not typically describe the resource in any
   ordinary sense because they are usually assigned to the resource
   rather than recording a property of it.

   However, the arbitrariness of names and identifiers means that they
   do not serve to distinguish resources for people who do not already
   know them. This is why we use what linguists call referring
   expressions or definite descriptions, like "the small black dog"

   relationships used in surnames (patronymic or father-
   based names are most common), because the surname
   includes the father's name there is more variation than
   for occupations.

2. This odd convention is preserved today in wedding
   invitations, causing some feminist teeth gnashing (Geller
   1999).

    412 | An Overview of Resource Description
   rather than the more efficient "Blackie," when we are talking to
   someone who does not know that is the dog's name.3

   Similarly, when we use a library catalog or search engine to locate
   a known resource, we query for it using its name, or some specific
   information we know about it, to make it easier to find. In contrast,
   when we look for resources to satisfy an information need but
   do not have specific resources in mind, we query for them using
   descriptions of their content or other properties. In general,
   information retrieval can be characterized as comparing the
   description of a user's needs with descriptions of the resources that
   might satisfy them.

  "Description" as an Inclusive Term

   Up to now we have used the concept of "description" in its ordinary
   sense to mean the labeling or explaining of the visible or important
   features that characterize or represent something. However, the
   concept is sometimes used more precisely in the context of
   organizing systems, where resource description is often more
   formal, systematic, and institutional. In the library science context
   of bibliographic description, a descriptor is one of the terms in a
   carefully designed language that can be assigned to a resource to
   designate its properties, characteristics, or meaning, or its
   relationships with other resources. In the contexts of conceptual
   modeling and information systems design, the terms in resource
   descriptions are also called "keywords," "index terms," attributes,

3. See (Donnellan 1966). A contemporary analysis from the
   perspective of cognitive science is (Heller, Gorman, and
   Tanenhaus 2012).

                                                  An Overview of Resource Description | 413
attribute values, elements, "data elements," "data values," or "the
vocabulary." In business intelligence, predictive analytics or other
data science contexts these are called "variables," "features,"
properties, or "measurements." In contexts where descriptions are
less formal or more personal the description terms are often called
"labels" or "tags." Rather than attempt to make fine distinctions
among these synonyms or near-synonyms, we will use "description"
as an inclusive term except where conventional usage
overwhelmingly favors one of the other terms.

Many of these terms come from a narrow semantic scope in which
the purpose of description is to identify and characterize the
essence, or aboutness, of a resource. However, as it becomes trivial
to associate computationally generated information with resources,
many additional kinds of information beyond strict "aboutness" can
support additional interactions. We describe many of these
purposes and the types of information needed to enable them in
"Determining the Purposes". We apply resource description in an
expansive way to accommodate all of them.

Resources in Organizing Systems introduced the distinction of
"Resource Focus" to contrast primary resources with resources that
describe them, which we called Description Resources. We chose
this term as a more inclusive and more easily understood alternative
to two terms that are well established in organizing systems for
information resources: bibliographic descriptions and metadata. We
will also distinguish resource description as a general concept from
the narrower senses of statistical description, tagging of web
resources, and the Resource Description Framework(RDF) language
used to make statements about web resources and physical
resources that can be identified on the Web.

414 | An Overview of Resource Description
  Bibliographic Descriptions

   The purposes and nature of bibliographic description are the
   foundation of library and information science and have been
   debated and systematized for nearly two centuries. Bibliographic
   descriptions characterize information resources and the entities
   that populate the bibliographic universe, which include works,
   editions, authors, and subjects.4

4. Despite the "biblio-" root, bibliographic descriptions are
   applied to all of the resource types contained in libraries,
   not just books. Note also that this definition includes not
   just the information resources being described as distinct
   instances, but also as sets of related instances and the
   nature of those relationships.

   An excellent source for both the history and theory of
   bibliographic description is The Intellectual Foundation of
   Information Organization by Elaine Svenonius (Svenonius
   2000). She divides bibliographic descriptions into "those
   that describe information from those that describe its
   documentary embodiments," contrasting conceptual or
   subject properties from those that describe physical
   properties (p. 54). A more radical contrast was proposed
   by (Wilson 1968, p. 25), who distinguished descriptions
   according to the kind of bibliographic control they
   enabled. Descriptive control is objective and
   straightforward, lining up a population of writings in any
   arbitrary order. Exploitative control, defined as the ability

                                                  An Overview of Resource Description | 415
A bibliographic description of an information resource is typically
realized as a structured record in a standardized format that
describes a specific resource. The earliest bibliographic records
in the nineteenth century were those in book catalogs, which
organized for each author a list of his authored books, with separate
entries for each edition and physical copy. Relationships between
books by different authors were described using cross-references.

The nature and extent of bibliographic descriptions were highly
constrained by the book catalog format, which also made the
process of description a highly localized one because every library
or collection of resources created its own catalog. The adoption
of printed cards as the unit of organization for bibliographic
descriptions around the turn of the twentieth century made it
easier to maintain the catalog, and also enabled the centralized
creation of the records by the Library of Congress.

The computerization of bibliographic records made them easier to
use as aids for finding resources. However, digitizing legacy printed
card-oriented descriptions for online use was not a straightforward
task because the descriptions had been created according to
cataloging rules designed for collections of books and other physical
resources and intended only for use by people.

to make the best use of a body of writings, requires
descriptions that evaluate resources for their suitability
for particular uses. Wilson argued that descriptive
control was a poor substitute for exploitative control,
but recognized that evaluative descriptions were more
difficult to create.

416 | An Overview of Resource Description
  Metadata

   Metadata is often defined as "data about data," a definition that is
   nearly as ubiquitous as it is unhelpful. A more content-full definition
   of metadata is that it is structured description for information
   resources of any kind. Metadata is more useful when supported
   by a metadata schema that defines the elements in the structured
   description.5

   The concept of metadata originated in information systems and
   database design in the 1970s, so it is much newer than that of
   bibliographic description. The earliest metadata schemas, called
   data dictionaries, documented the arrangement and content of data
   fields in the records used by transactional applications on
   mainframe computers. A more sophisticated type of metadata
   emerged as the documentation of the data models in database
   management systems, called database schemas, which described
   the structure of relational tables, attribute names, and legal data
   types and values for content.

   In 1986, the Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML)
   formalized the Document Type Definition(DTD) as a metadata form
   for describing the structure and content elements in hierarchical
   and hypertextual document models. SGML was superseded in 1997
   by eXtensible Markup Language(XML), whose purpose was
   structured and computer-processable web content.6

5. (Gill 2008)

6. (Rubinsky and Maloney 1997) capture this transitional
   perspective. A more recent text on XML is (Goldberg
   2008).

                                                  An Overview of Resource Description | 417
   Today, XML schemas and other web- and compute-friendly formats
   for resource description have broadened the idea of resource
   description far beyond that of bibliographic description to include
   the description of software components, business and scientific
   datasets, web services, and computational objects in both physical
   and digital formats. The resource descriptions themselves serve to
   enable discovery, reuse, access control, and the invocation of other
   resources needed for people or computational agents to effectively
   interact with the primary ones described by the metadata.7

  Tagging of Web-based Resources

              Tags on Last.fm

7. See (Sen 2004), (Laskey 2005).

   418 | An Overview of Resource Description
          Last.fm analyzes tags and other metadata to create
       rich multimedia "discovery" pages that bring together
       artist catalogs, new songs, free downloads, and music
       videos that its algorithm predicts will satisfy a user's
       taste. This allows users to browse for new music in a
       more intuitive manner than searching by artist or genre.

          (Screenshot by Ian MacFarland.)

The concept of metadata has been extended to include the tags,
ratings, bookmarks or other types of descriptions that individuals
apply to individual photos, blog or news items, or any other
resource with a web presence. The practice of tagging has emerged
as a way to apply labels to content in order to describe and identify
it. Sets of tags are useful in managing one's collection of websites

                                              An Overview of Resource Description | 419
   or digital media, in sharing them with others, and enabling new
   types of interactions and services.8 For example, users of Last.fm
   tag music with labels that describe its nature, era, mood, or genre,
   and Last.fm uses these tags to generate radio stations that play
   music similar to that tag and related tags.

   But tagging has a downside. The tendency for users to tag intuitively
   and spontaneously revives the vocabulary problem ("Naming
   Resources") because one photographer's "tree" is another's "oak."
   Likewise, unsystematic word choice leads to morphological
   inconsistency ("Relationships among Word Forms"); the same photo
   might be tagged with "burning" and "trees" and also with "burn" and
   "tree" by another. This disparity in the descriptors people use to
   categorize the same or similar resources can turn systems that use
   tagging into a "tag soup" lacking in structure.9

   Some social media sites have incorporated mechanisms to make the
   tagging activity more systematic and to reduce vocabulary problems.

8. See (Marlow, Naaman, Boyd, and Davis 2006). These
   authors propose a conceptual model of tagging that
   includes (1) tags assigned to a specific resource, (2)
   connections or links between resources, and (3)
   connections or links between users and explain how any
   two of these can be used to infer information about the
   other.

9. (Hammond, Hanney, Lund, and Scott 2004) coined the
   phrase "tag soup" in an review of social bookmarking
   tools written early in the tagging era that remains
   insightful today. Many of the specific tools are no longer
   around, but the reasons why people tag are still the same.

    420 | An Overview of Resource Description
     For example, on Facebook, users can indicate that a specific person
     is in an uploaded picture by clicking on the faces of people in
     photographs, typing the person's name, and then selecting the
     person from a list of Facebook friends whose names are formatted
     the way they appear on the friend's profile. Some social media
     systems suggest the most popular tags, perform morphological
     normalization, or allow users to arrange tags in bundles or
     hierarchies.10

   Resource Description Framework (RDF)

     The Resource Description Framework(RDF) is a standard model for
     making computer-processable statements about web resources; it
     is the foundation for the vision of the Semantic Web.11 We have
     been using the word "resource" to refer to anything that is being
     organized. In the context of RDF and the web, however, "resource"
     means something more specific: a resource is anything that has
     been given a Uniform Resource Identifier(URI). URIs can take

10. Making tagging more systematic leads to "tag
    convergence" in which the distribution of tags for a
    particular resource stabilizes over time (Golder and
    Huberman 2006). Consider three things a user might do if
    his tag does not match the suggested tags; (1) Change the
    tag to conform? (2) Keep the tag to influence the group
    norm? (3) Add the proposed tag but keep his tag as well?

11. (RDF Working Group 2004). The official source for all
    things RDF is the W3C RDF page at http://www.w3.org/
    RDF/.

     various forms, but you are probably most familiar with the URIs
     used to identify web pages, such as http://springfield-
     elementary.edu/. (You are probably also used to calling these
     URLs instead of URIs.) The key idea behind RDF is that we can use
     URIs to identify not only things "on" the web, like web pages, but
     also things "off" the web like people or countries. For example, we
     might use the URI http://springfield-elementary.edu/ to
     refer to Springfield Elementary itself, and not just the school's web
     page.

     RDF models all descriptions as sets of "triples," where each triple
     consists of the resource being described (identified by a URI), a
     property, and a value. Properties are resources too, meaning they
     are identified by URIs. For example, the URI http://xmlns.com/
     foaf/0.1/schoolHomepage
     identifies a property defined by the Friend of a Friend(FOAF) project
     for relating a person to (the web page of) a school they attended.
     Values can be resources too, but they do not have to be: when a
     property takes simple values like numbers, dates, or text strings,
     these values do not have URIs and so are not resources.</span

        >

     Because RDF uses URIs to identify described resources, their
     properties, and (some) property values, the triples in a description
     can be connected into a network or graph. Figure: RDF Triples
     Arranged as a Graph. shows four triples that have been connected
     into a graph. Two of the triples describe Bart Simpson, who is
     identified using the URI of his Wikipedia page.12 The other two

12. Some argue that the resource being described is thus
    Bart Simpson's Wikipedia page, not Bart Simpson himself.
    Whether or not that is an important distinction is a
    controversial question among RDF architects and users.

     422 | An Overview of Resource Description
     describe Lisa Simpson. Two of the triples use the property age,
     which takes a simple number value. The other two use the property
     schoolHomepage, which takes a resource value, and in this case
     they happen to have the same resource (Springfield Elementary's
     home page) as their value.
     RDF Triples Arranged as a Graph

     Two RDF triples can be connected to form a graph when they have a
     resource, property, or value in common. In this example RDF triples
     that make a statement about the home page of the elementary
     school attended by Bart Simpson and Lisa Simpson can be
     connected because they have the same value, namely the URI for
     Springfield Elementary.
     Using URIs as identifiers for resources and properties allows
     descriptions modeled as RDF to be interconnected into a network
     of "linked data," in the same way that the web enabled information
     to be interconnected into a massive network of "linked documents."
     Proponents of RDF claim that this will greatly benefit knowledge
     discovery and inference.13 But the benefits of RDF's highly

13. (Heath and Bizer 2011) and http://linkeddata.org are
    excellent sources.

prescriptive description form must be weighed against the costs;
turning existing descriptions into RDF can be labor-intensive.

RDF can be used for bibliographic description, and some libraries
are exploring whether RDF transformations of their legacy
bibliographic records can be exposed and integrated with resource
descriptions on the open web. This activity has raised technical
concerns about whether the RDF model of description is
sophisticated enough and more fundamental concerns about the
desirability of losing control over library resources. 14

Aggregated Information Objects

In the pre-digital age, information objects came with explicit
tangible boundaries. Books consisted of pages bound within a cover,
a vinyl record album physically bound together a set of songs (you
could even see the groove pattern separating the songs), a movie
was delivered on a strip of film spooled onto a reel, and a collection
was (usually) demarcated as a designated shelf or room in a library.

Boundaries of information objects in the digital realm are neither
tangible nor obvious. Consider the simple notion of a web page. Our
cognitive notion of that which is rendered in our browser window

the cultural and technical obstacles to the adoption of

RDF and linked data in libraries. (Yee 2009) is a highly

specific technical demonstration of converting

bibliographic descriptions to RDF. A detailed analysis /

424 | An Overview of Resource Description
(e.g., some formatted text with an associated image) is actually, in
web architecture terms (Jacobs & Walsh, 2004), three information
objects (aka resources); the HTML encoding the text, CSS that
defines the formatting rules, and the JPEG that encodes the image.
All three have URLs and can independently be retrieved and linked.
The situation is even more ambiguous for the common notion of a
web site, the boundaries of which are not defined technically and
are cognitively difficult to express.

Aggregations can be convenience methods for simplifying
dissemination or organization, but they can also be transformative;
resources can derive nearly all their value from their inclusion in
an aggregation. On a web page, the CSS file is virtually useless
on its own, since its role is to style the HTML file. In iTunes, the
playback and organization functions are optimized for pop music,
where individual songs can usually stand on their own when
separated from the rest of an album. Classical music fans often
struggle with this, because the individual "tracks" of a recording,
split up to reduce file size and facilitate navigation through long
works, are not separable; pieces are meant to be listened to in their
entirety, and it can be difficult to ensure that they are aggregated
together and have the proper metadata assigned to their
aggregations. In other words: you can't listen to symphonies on
shuffle.15

The problem here is how to architecturally and technically express
the notion of an aggregation, a set of information objects that, when
considered together, compose another named information object.
Aggregations are prevalent all over our digital information space:
the web page and site mentioned above; a scholarly publication
consisting of text, figures, and data; a dataset that is the
composition of multiple data files. Notably the notion is both

15. (Pancake 2012)

                    An Overview of Resource Description | 425
     recursive and non-exclusive. An object that is itself an aggregation
     may be aggregated into another object. Information objects
     included in one aggregation may also be included in other
     aggregations, allowing reuse and re-factoring of existing
     information objects. A solution to this problem is a critical aspect
     of organizing digital information because, without well-defined
     boundaries we cannot deterministically identify, reference, or
     describe information objects.

     The following are a number of technical approaches to the
     aggregation problem.

        Kahn-Wilensky Digital Object Framework. Robert Kahn and
     Robert Wilensky coined the term "digital object" in a paper
     describing the core components of digital library infrastructure;
     the content, naming scheme, repository configuration, and access
     protocol. The digital object they describe is a uniquely-identified
     container packaging multiple data and metadata components. The
     model incorporates the recursive notion of a container of
     containers. The Kahn/Wilensky framework was the inspiration for
     the Fedora (Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository
     Architecture) system, open source software deployed worldwide in
     information applications that leverage the container model.16

        Warwick Framework. An early result of work by the Dublin Core
     Metadata Initiative, the Warwick Framework was motivated by the

16. (Kahn & Wilensky, 1995) (Lagoze, Payette, Shin, & Wilper,
    2005)

     426 | An Overview of Resource Description
desire to associate multiple metadata packages with content (e.g.,
descriptive, rights, administrative). It specifies a container
architecture with distinct metadata packages that could be included
directly or by-reference, allowing reuse of individual packages. The
Warwick Framework was the inspiration for METS, described
next.17

   METS. The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Specification is
a widely deployed XML-based container format that packages
together multiple metadata components and content, both either
directly or by-reference. Metadata packages are classified into one
of a set of pre-defined types; descriptive, administrative, rights,
and structural. METS is specified by an XML schema that has been
extended for a variety of specialized applications.18

   OAI-ORE. The Open Archives Initiative's Object Reuse and
Exchange specification was motivated by a desire for an aggregation
architecture fully congruent with web architecture principles, thus
exposing aggregations to standard web tools, e.g. browsers,
crawlers, HTTP servers. OAI-OARE introduces the notion of two
types of URI-identified web resources; a resource map and an
aggregation. When de-referenced through its respective URI, the
former returns an REF/XML formatted description that establishes
the identity of the aggregation, the resources that are included
in the aggregation, and the semantics of the relationships among
them.19

Frameworks for Resource Description

The broad scope of resources to which descriptions can be applied
and the different communities that describe them means that many
frameworks and classifications have been proposed to help make
sense of resource description.
Architectures for Resource Description

Two contrasting architectures for resource descriptions are
separate descriptions versus packaged descriptions, which were
dominant in library catalogs with printed cards containing
descriptions about a resource.
The dominant historical view treats resource descriptions as a
package of statements; this view is embodied in the printed library
card catalog and its computerized analog in the MARC21 format
428 | An Overview of Resource Description
(an exchange format for library catalog records), which contains
many fields about the bibliographic characteristics of an object like
author, title, publication year, publisher, and pagination. An
alternate architecture for resource description focuses on each
individual description or assertion about a single resource, as the
RDF and linked data approaches do. These two alternatives are
contrasted in Figure: Architectures for Resource Description.

In either case, these common ways of thinking about resource
description emphasize--or perhaps even overemphasize--two
implementation decisions:

  · The first is whether to combine multiple resource descriptions
      into a structural package or to keep them as separate
      descriptive statements.

  · The second is the choice of syntax in which the descriptions are
      encoded.

Both of these implementation decisions have important
implications, but are secondary to the questions about the purposes
of resource description, how resource properties are selected as the
basis for description, how they are best created, and other logical
or design considerations. In keeping with a fundamental idea of the
discipline of organizing (introduced in "The Concept of "Organizing
Principle""), it is imperative to distinguish design principles from
implementation choices. We treat the set of implementation
decisions about character notations, syntax, and structure as the
form of resource description and we will defer them as much as we
can until The Forms of Resource Descriptions.

In library and information science, it is very common to discuss
resource descriptions using a classification proposed by Arlene
Taylor, which distinguishes administrative, structural, and

                                             An Overview of Resource Description | 429
     descriptive metadata.20 A similar typology proposed by Gilliland
     breaks metadata down into five types: administrative, descriptive,
     preservation, use, and technical.21
     Resource description is not an end in itself. Its many purposes are
     all means for enabling and using an organizing system for some
     collection of resources. As a result, our framework for resource
     descriptions aligns with the activities of organizing systems we
     discussed in Activities in Organizing Systems: selecting, organizing,
     interacting with, and maintaining resources.

20. (Taylor and Joudrey 2009) Taylor's book on The
     Organization of Information, now in its 3rd edition (with
     co-author Daniel Joudrey), has been widely used in
     library science programs for over a decade.

33. The Process of Describing
Resources

We prefer the general concept of resource description over the
more specialized ones of bibliographic description and metadata
because it makes it easier to see the issues that cut across the
domains where those terms dominate. In addition, it enables us to
propose more standard process that we can apply broadly to the use
of resource descriptions in organizing systems. A shared vocabulary
enables the sharing of lessons and best practices.

The process of describing resources involves seven interdependent
and iterative steps. We begin with a generic summary of the process
to set the stage for a detailed step-by-step discussion.

 1. Identifying resources to describe is the first step; this topic is
      covered in detail in "Resource Identity". The resource domain
      and scope circumscribe the describable properties and the
      possible purposes that descriptions might serve. The resource
      focus determines which are primary information resources and
      which ones are treated as the corresponding resource
      descriptions. Two important decisions at this stage are
      granularity of description--are we describing individual
      resources or collections of them?--and the abstraction
      level--are we describing resource instances, parts of them, or
      resource types?

2. Generally, the purpose of resource description is to support
      the activities common to all organizing systems: selecting,
      organizing, interacting with, and maintaining resources, as we
      saw in Activities in Organizing Systems. The particular resource
      domain and the context in which descriptions are created and

                                                                      The Process of Describing
                                                                                    Resources | 431
      used imposes more specific requirements and constraints on
      the purposes that resource description can serve.

3. Once the purposes of description in terms of activities and
      interactions have been determined, the specific properties of
      the resources that are needed to enable them can be identified.
      The goal of description is not to be exhaustive; there are always
      more possible properties than can be reasonably described.
      Instead, the challenge is to use the properties that are most
      robust and reliable for supporting the desired interactions.

4. This step includes several logical and semantic decisions about
      how the resource properties will be described. What terms
      or element names should be used to identify the resource
      properties we have chosen to describe? Are there rules or
      constraints on the types of data or values that the property
      descriptions can assume? When dealing with numerical
      descriptions, their data types and levels of measurement
      constrain the kinds of processing to which they may submit.
      Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio data each are limited to
      particular transformations based on what they represent. A
      good description vocabulary will be easy to assign when
      creating resource descriptions and easy to understand when
      using them.

5. The logical and semantic decisions about the description
      vocabulary are reified by decisions about the notation, syntax,
      and structure of the descriptions. Taken together, these
      decisions collectively determine what we call the form or
      encoding of the resource descriptions. The implementation of
      the descriptions involves decisions about how and where they
      are stored and the technology used to create, edit, store, and
      retrieve them.

6. Resource descriptions are created by individuals, by informal
      or formal groups of people, or by automated or computational
      means. Some types of descriptions can only be created by

432 | The Process of Describing Resources
      people, some types of descriptions can only be created by
      automated or algorithmic techniques, and some can be created
      in either manner.
 7. The resource descriptions must be evaluated with respect to
      their intended purposes. The results of this evaluation will help
      determine which or the preceding steps need to be redone.
The next seven sub-sections discuss each of these steps in detail.
A quick reference guide is Figure: The Process of Describing
Resources.
The Process of Describing Resources

The process of describing resources consists of seven steps:
Determining the scope and focus, determining the purpose,

                                              The Process of Describing Resources | 433
identifying resource properties, designing the description
vocabulary, designing the description form and implementation,
creating the descriptions, and evaluating the descriptions.

How explicit and systematic each step needs to be depend on the
resource domain and scope, and especially on the intended users
of the organizing system. If we look carefully, we can see most of
these steps taking place even in very informal contexts, like the kids
playing with Lego blocks with which we started this chapter. The
goal of building things with the blocks leads the boys to identify
which properties are most useful to analyze. They develop
descriptions of the blocks that capture the specific values of the
relevant properties. Finally, they evaluate their descriptions by using
them when they play together; it becomes immediately obvious that
a description is not serving its purpose when one boy hands a block
to another that was not the one he thought he had asked for.

In contrast, a picture-taking scenario involves a much more explicit
and systematic process of resource description. The resource
properties, description vocabulary, and description form used
automatically by a digital camera were chosen by an industry
association and published as a technical specification implemented
by camera and mobile phone manufacturers worldwide.

The resource descriptions used by libraries, archives, and museums
are typically created in an even more explicit and systematic
manner. Like the descriptions of the digital photo, the properties,
vocabulary, and form of the descriptions used by their organizing
systems are governed by standards. However, there is no equivalent
to the digital camera that can create these descriptions
automatically. Instead, highly trained professionals create them
meticulously.

A great many resources and their associated descriptions in
business and scientific organizing systems are created by
automated or computational processes, so the process of describing
individual resources is not at all like that in libraries and other

434 | The Process of Describing Resources
memory institutions. However, the process for designing the data
models or schemas for the class of resources that will be generated
is equally systematic and is typically performed by highly skilled
data analysts and data modelers.

Determining the Scope and Focus

Which resources do we want to describe? As we saw in Resources in
Organizing Systems, determining what will be treated as a separate
resource is not always easy, especially for resources with
component parts and for information resources where the most
important property is their content, which is not directly
perceivable. Identifying the thing you want to describe as precisely
as practical is the first step to creating a useful description.

In "Resource Focus", we introduced the contrast between primary
resources and description resources, which we called resource
focus. Determining the resource focus goes hand in hand with
determining which resources we intend to describe; these often
arbitrary decisions then make a huge difference in the nature and
extent of resource description. One person's metadata is another
person's data.

  · For a librarian, the price of a book might be just one more
      attribute that is part of the book's record.

  · For an accountant at a bookstore, the price of that book--both
      the cost to buy the book and the price at which it is then sold to
      customers--is critical information for staying in business.

  · In a medical records context, a patient's insurance provider isn't
      of much concern to the doctor, but to the person responsible
      for billing, it is central. For the nurse, the patient's current vital
      signs may be of most importance, while for the doctor, it may

                                              The Process of Describing Resources | 435
      be most important to understand how those data in aggregate
      serve to indicate a longer-term prognosis of the patient's
      health.

  · A scientist studying comparative anatomy preserves animal
      specimens and records detailed physical descriptions about
      them, but a scientist studying ecology or migration discards the
      specimens and focuses on describing the context in which the
      specimen was located.

Describing Instances or Describing Collections

It is simplest to think of a resource description as being associated
with another individual resource. As we discussed in Resources in
Organizing Systems, it is challenging to determine what to treat as
an individual resource when resources are themselves objects or
systems composed of other parts or resources. For example, we
sometimes describe a football team as a single resource and at other
times we focus on each individual player. However, after deciding on
resource granularity, the question remains whether each resource
needs a separate description.

Libraries and museums specialize in curating resource descriptions
about the instances in their collections. Resource descriptions are
also applied to classes or collections of resources, because a
collection is also a resource ("The Concept of "Collection"").
Archives and special collections of maps are typically assigned
resource descriptions, but each document or map contained in the
collection does not necessarily have its own bibliographic
description. Similarly, business and scientific datasets are invariably
described at collection-level granularity because they are often
analyzed in their entirety.

Furthermore, the granularity of description for a collection of
resources tends to differ for different users or purposes. An investor

436 | The Process of Describing Resources
who owns many different stocks focuses on their individual prices,
while other investors put their money in index funds that combine
all the separate prices into a single value.

Many web pages, especially e-commerce product catalogs and news
sites, are dynamically assembled and personalized from a large
number of information resources and services that are separately
identified and described in content management and content
delivery systems. However, a highly complex collection of resources
that comes together in a single page is treated as a single resource
when that page appears in a list of search engine results. Moreover,
all of the separately generated pages can be given a single
description when a user creates a bookmark to make it easy to
return to the home page of the site.

Abstraction in Resource Description

We can also associate resource descriptions with an entire type
or domain of resources. (See "Preserving Resource Types" and
"Resource Domain".) A collection of resource descriptions is vastly
more useful when every resource is described using common
description elements or terms that apply to every resource. A
schema (or model, or metadata standard) specifies the set of
descriptions that apply to an entire resource type. Sometimes this
schema, model, or standard is inferred from or imposed on a
collection of existing resources to ensure more consistent
definitions, but more often, it is used as a specification when the
resources are created or generated in the first place. (See What
about "Creating" Resources? in "Introduction".)

A relational database, for example, is easily conceptualized as a
collection of records organized as one or more tables, with each
record in its own row having a number of fields or attributes that
contain some prescribed type of content. Each record or row in

                                              The Process of Describing Resources | 437
   the database table is a description of a resource--an employee, a
   product, anything--and the individual attribute values, organized
   by the columns and rows of the table, are distinct parts of the
   description for some particular resource instance, like employee 24
   or product 8012C.1

1. Because the relational database schema serves as a model
  for the creation of resource descriptions, it is designed
  to restrict the descriptions to be simple and completely
  regular sets of attribute-value pairs. The database
  schema specifies the overall structure of the tables and
  especially their columns, which will contain the attribute
  values that describe each resource. An employee table
  might have columns for the attributes of employee ID,
  hiring date, department, and salary. A date attribute will
  be restricted to a value that is a date, while an employee
  salary will be restricted according to salary ranges
  established by the human resources department. This
  makes the name of the attribute and the constraints on
  attribute values into resource descriptions that apply to
  the entire class of resources described by the table.

  It is often necessary to associate some descriptions with
  individual resources that are specific to that instance
  and other kinds of descriptions that reflect the abstract
  class to which the instance belongs. When a typical car
  comes off the assembly line, it has only one instance-
  level description that differentiates it from its peers: its
  vehicle identification number (VIN). Specific cars have

   438 | The Process of Describing Resources
   The information resources that we commonly call documents are,
   by their nature, less homogeneous in content and structure than
   those that can be managed in databases. Document schemas,
   commonly represented in SGML or XML, usually allow for a mixture
   of data-like and textual descriptive elements.

   XML schema languages have improved on SGML and XML by
   expressing the description of the document schema in XML itself,
   making it easy to create resources using the metadata as a template
   or pattern. XML schemas are often used as the specifications for
   XML resources created and used by information-intensive
   applications; in this context, they are often called XML vocabularies.
   XML schemas can be used to define web forms that capture
   resource instances (each filled-out form). XML schemas are also
   used to describe the interfaces to web services and other
   computational resources.2

   individualized interior and exterior colors and installed
   options, and they all have a date and location of
   manufacture. Other description elements have values
   that are shared with many other cars of the same model
   and year, like suggested price and the additional option
   packages, or configurations that can be applied to it
   before it is delivered to a customer. Alternatively, any
   descriptive information that applies to multiple cars of
   the same model year could be part of a resource
   description at that level that is referred to rather than
   duplicated in instance descriptions.

2. Web services are generally implemented using XML
   documents as their inputs and outputs. The interfaces

                                                  The Process of Describing Resources | 439
  Scope, Scale, and Resource Description

   If we only had one thing to describe, we could use a single word to
   describe it: "it." We would not need to distinguish it from anything
   else. A second resource implies at least one more term in the
   description language: "not it." However, as a collection grows,
   descriptions must become more complex to distinguish not only
   between, but also among resources.

   Every element or term in a description language creates a
   dimension, or axis, along which resources can be distinguished,
   or it defines a set of questions about resources. Distinctions and
   questions that arise frequently need to be easy to address, such as:

     · What is the name of the resource?

     · Who created it?

     · What type of content or matter does it contain?

   Therefore, as a collection grows, the language for describing
   resources must become more rigorous, and descriptions created
   when the collection was small often require revision because they
   are no longer adequate for their intended purposes.3

   to web services are typically described using an XML
   vocabulary called Web Services Description
   Language(WSDL). See (Erl 2005b), especially Ch. 3,
   Introduction to Web Services Technologies.

3. Creating descriptions that can keep pace with the growth
   of a collection has been an issue for librarians for years,
   as libraries moved away from describing simply

    440 | The Process of Describing Resources
   This co-evolution of descriptive scope and description complexity
   is easy to see in the highly complex bibliographic descriptions
   created by professional catalogers. The commonly used Anglo-
   American Cataloguing Rules(AACR2) cataloging standards
   distinguish 11 different categories of resources and specify several
   hundred descriptive elements. AACR2 has recently been superseded
   by the Resource Description and Access(RDA) standards, which make
   fine-grained distinctions about content, media type, and carrier
   (technology).4

   Because the task of library resource description has been
   standardized at national and international levels, cataloging work
   is distributed among many describers whose results are shared.
   The principle of standardization has been the basis of centralized
   bibliographic description for a century.

   "whatever came across a cataloger's desk" to cataloging
   resources for a national and even international audience
   (Svenonius 2000, p. 31).

4. The AACR2 includes rules for books, pamphlets, and
   printed sheets; cartographic materials; manuscripts and
   manuscript collections; music; sound recordings; motion
   pictures and video recordings; graphic materials;
   electronic resources; 3-D artifacts; microforms; and
   continuing resources. The Concise AACR2 (4th Edition)
   is the most accessible treatment of these very complex
   rules (Gorman 2004). The Resource Description and
   Access(RDA) vocabularies are the successor to AACR2 and
   make even finer distinctions among resource types. See
   the RDA content, media, and carrier value lists.

Centralized resource description by skilled professionals works for
libraries, but even in the earliest days of the web many library
scientists and web authoring futurists recognized that this
approach would not scale for describing web resources. In 1995, the
Dublin Core(DC) metadata element set with only 15 elements was
proposed as a vastly simpler description vocabulary that people not
trained as professional catalogers could use. Since then, the Dublin
Core initiative has been highly influential in inspiring numerous
other communities to create minimalist description vocabularies,
often by simplifying vocabularies that had been devised by
professionals for use by non-professionals.5

Of course, a simpler description vocabulary makes fewer
distinctions than a complex one; replacing "author," "artist,"
"composer" and many other descriptions of the person or non-
human resource responsible for the intellectual content of a
resource with just "creator" (as Dublin Core does) results in a
substantial loss of precision when the description is created and can
cause misunderstanding when the descriptions are reused.6

5. We can also view the Dublin Core as part of the

intellectual foundations for the "crowdsourcing" or

"community curation" of resource descriptions by non-

professionals ("Social and Web Curation"). See the Dublin

Core  Metadata           Initiative  (DCMI)  at

http://dublincore.org/.

6. The semantic "bluntness" of a minimalist vocabulary is
   illustrated by the examples for use of the "creator"
   element in an official Dublin Core user guide (Hillmann
   2005) that shows "Shakespeare, William" and "Hubble
   Telescope" as creators.

    442 | The Process of Describing Resources
The negative impacts of growing scope and scale on resource
description can sometimes be avoided if the ultimate scope and
scale of the organizing system is contemplated when it is being
created. It would not be smart for a business with customers in six
US states to create an address field in its customer database that
only handled those six states; a more extensible design would allow
for any state or province and include a country code. In general,
however, just as there are problems in adapting a simple vocabulary
as scope and scale increase, designing and applying resource
descriptions that will work for a large and continuously growing
collection might seem like too much work when the collection at
hand is small.

The challenges that arise with large description vocabularies are
transformed when resource descriptions are created and assigned
by computer algorithms. A large dataset might contain many
thousands of descriptions for each resource, but clearly the
computer does not have cognitive difficulty generating or using
them. However, computer models with this many features can be
hard for people to understand and trust.

Determining the Purposes

Resource description serves many purposes, and the mix of
purposes and the resulting kinds of descriptions in any particular
organizing system depends on the scope and scale of the resources
being organized. We can identify and classify the most common
purposes using the four activities that occur in every organizing
system: selecting, organizing, interacting with, and maintaining
resources (see Activities in Organizing Systems). Resource
description also has a more open-ended purpose in sensemaking
and science (see "Resource Description for Sensemaking and
Science"); we observe and describe the world to make sense of our
experiences and to predict future observations.

Resource Description to Support Selection

Defining selection as the process by which resources are identified,
evaluated, and then added to a collection in an organizing system
emphasizes resource descriptions created by someone other than
the person who is using them. We can distinguish several different
ways in which resource description supports selection:

Discovery

      What available resources might be added to a collection? New
      resources are often listed in directories, registries, or catalogs.
      Some types of resources are selected and acquired
      automatically through subscriptions or contracts.

Capability and Compatibility

      Will the resource meet functional or interoperability
      requirements? Technology-intensive resources often have
      numerous specialized types of descriptions that specify their
      functions, performance, reliability, and other "-ilities" that
      determine if they fit in with other resources in an organizing
      system. 7 Some services have qualities of service levels, terms
      and conditions, or interfaces documented in resource

7. The Intel Core 2 Duo Processor has detailed

specifications  (http://www.intel.com/products/

processor/core2duo/specifications.htm) and seven

categories of technical documentation: application notes,

datasheets, design guides, manuals, updates, support

components, and white papers (http://www.intel.com/

design/core2duo/documentation.htm).

444 | The Process of Describing Resources
      descriptions that affect their compatibility and interoperability.
      Some resources have licensing or usage restrictions that might
      prevent the resources from being used effectively for the
      intended purposes. Decisions about "people selection" are
      becoming more data-driven, and sports teams, business
      employers, and dating sites now rely on predictive statistics to
      find the best person.

Authentication

      Is the resource what it claims to be? ("Authenticity") Resource
      descriptions that can support authentication include
      technological ones like time stamps, watermarking, encryption,
      checksums, and digital signatures. The history of ownership or
      custody of a resource, called its provenance ("Provenance"), is
      often established through association with sales or tax records.
      Import and export certificates associated with the resource
      might be required to comply with laws designed to prevent the
      theft of antiquities or the transfer of technology or information
      with national security or foreign policy implications.

Appraisal

      What is the value of this resource? What is its cost? At what rate
      does it depreciate? Does it have a shelf life? Does it have any
      associated ratings, rankings, or quality measures? Moreover,
      what is the quality of those ratings, rankings, and measures?

We also consider the perspective of the person creating the
resource description and his or her primary purpose, which is often
to encourage the selection of the resource by someone else.
Product marketing is about devising names and descriptions to
make a resource distinctive and attractive compared to alternatives.
For many years prunes were promoted as a dietary supplement that
people (especially old ones) need to "maintain regularity." But after
the California Prune Board (the world's biggest supplier) re-branded
them as "dried plums" and started marketing them as a snack food

                                              The Process of Describing Resources | 445
   (and simultaneously renaming itself as the California Dried Plum
   Board) sales increased significantly.8

   Many countries require that imported goods are labeled with their
   country or origin. Consumers often use this property in resource
   descriptions as an indicator of high quality, as they might with
   Swiss watches, French or Italian fashions, or Canadian bacon.
   Alternatively, consumers might want to buy domestic or locally-
   sourced goods out of economic patriotism or to comply with
   procurement regulations. Not surprisingly, when consumers view
   origin in a positive light, this information is conspicuous and easy
   to read. In contrast, when consumers view origin less positively,
   perhaps as a warning of low-quality goods, the supplier is likely to
   make the origin information as inconspicuous as legally possible, or
   might even misrepresent the goods as domestic ones.9

8. Real estate advertisements are notorious for their
   creative descriptions; a house "convenient to
   transportation" is most likely next to a noisy highway,
   and a house in a "secluded location" is in a remote and
   desolate part of town.

9. In its early days. when US consumers were generally
   unaware that Sony was a Japanese company and the
   quality of Japanese products was viewed in a negative
   light, Sony would make the "Made in Japan" label as
   inconspicuous as it could get away with. (John 1999)

   In the summer of 2015, the consumer advocacy
   organization Truth in Advertising reported finding on
   Walmart's website over 100 product descriptions

    446 | The Process of Describing Resources
This misrepresentation is also ubiquitous in online dating, though
the amount of misrepresentation must be balanced with the goals of
the relationship and chances of the deception being discovered.10

Resource Description to Support Organizing

We have defined organizing as specifying the principles for
describing and arranging resources to create the capabilities upon
which interactions are based. This definition treats the creation
of resource descriptions and their use to organize resources for
interactions as separate and sequential activities. This is easiest to
see when people assign keywords and classifications to documents,
or when sensors produce data, and these resource descriptions
are later used to enable document retrieval or data analysis. A
department store clerk might sort dress shirts on a display table

inaccurately presenting the products as being made in

the    United  States.  (See

https://www.truthinadvertising.org/walmart-made-in-

usa/)

10. Findings from a study of four online dating services
    (Toma et al 2008) found that 81% of people lied about
    at least one characteristic. Men were more likely to lie
    about height, while women lied more about weight, and
    the further their actual heights and weights were from
    the mean, the more they lied. A later study (Hall et al
    2010) confirmed the finding for women and weight but
    also found that men are highly likely to misrepresent
    their personal assets.

                                                    The Process of Describing Resources | 447
using labels that describe their brands, sizes, and other properties.
Rules governing the collection, integration, and analysis of personal
information are also resource descriptions that influence the
organization of information resources.

However, even if resource description and resource organization
are logically separable, at times they are intertwined. When you
arrange your own clothes, you don't use explicit resource
descriptions and instead rely on implicit ones about easily perceived
properties like color, shape, and material of composition. When
algorithms rather than people analyze texts to identify descriptive
features for applications like information retrieval, spam
classification, and sentiment analysis, resource descriptions and
resource organization co-evolve, often continuously as the
algorithm adapts and learns with each new resource it describes.
This tight connection between resource description and resource
organization is also exploited in organizing systems that use usage
records from session logs, browsing, or downloading activities as
interaction resources, tying them to payments for using the
resources or analyzing them to influence the selection and
organizing of resources in future personalized interactions. (See
"The Concept of "Interaction Resource"")

Resource Description to Support Interactions

Most discussions of the purposes of resource descriptions and
metadata emphasize the interactions that are based on resource
descriptions that have been intentionally and explicitly assigned.
The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records(FRBR),
defined by library scientists, specifies the four interactions of

448 | The Process of Describing Resources
    Finding, Identifying, Selecting, and Obtaining resources, but these
    apply generically to organizing systems, not just those in libraries.11

11. We encountered FRBR several times in previous chapters,
   especially in "Identity and Bibliographic Resources",
   where we asked "What is this thing we call `Macbeth'?"
   and which describes FRBR four-level abstraction
   hierarchy of the work, depicted in Figure: The FRBR
   Abstraction Hierarchy.

   The FRBR framework is the most recent formalization
   of the purposes of resource description that started in
   nineteenth-century libraries. This long history means it
   is not surprising that how we think about resource
   description still shows some bias toward interactions
   with physical bibliographic resources and the
   descriptions needed to obtain them.

   There are three members of the "FRBR family." One
   member is the "Group 1 entities" --Work, Expression,
   Manifestation, and Item--which are used to define classes
   of intellectual products and their relationships to each
   other. The "Group 2 entities" are responsible for the
   creation or custodianship of the Group 1 entities --
   Person, Family, and Corporate Body. The Group 2 model
   and requirements have been developed further as the
   Functional Requirements for Authority Data(FRAD) to
   enable catalogs to answer questions about the
   relationships between corporate entities or

Finding

      What resources are available that "correspond to the user's
      stated search criteria" and thus can satisfy an information
      need? Before there were online catalogs and digital libraries,
      we found resources by referencing catalogs of printed resource
      descriptions incorporating the title, author, and subject terms
      as access points into the collection; the subject descriptions
      were the most important finding aids when the user had no
      particular resource in mind. Modern users accept that
      computerized indexing makes search possible over not only the
      entire description resource, but often over the entire content

collaborators; see http://www.ifla.org/publications/

functional-requirements-for-authority-data     and

http://archive.ifla.org/VII/d4/wg-

franar.htm#Authority. The "Group 3 entities" are the

subject descriptions for Group 1 and Group 2; see the

Functional Requirements for Subject Authority

Data(FRSAD) at http://www.ifla.org/node/1297.

For bibliographic resources these interactions and the
models of resource descriptions needed to support them
have been formalized as the Functional Requirements for
Bibliographic Records(FRBR). We encountered FRBR
several times in previous chapters (especially in
"Bibliographic Resources, Information Components, and
"Smart Things" as Resources") where we asked "What is
this thing we call `Macbeth'?" and described the FRBR
four-level abstraction hierarchy of the work.

450 | The Process of Describing Resources
           of the primary resource. Businesses search directories for
           descriptions of company capabilities to find potential partners,
           and they also search for descriptions of application interfaces
           (APIs) that enable them to exchange information in an
           automated manner.

     Identifying

           Another purpose of resource description is to enable a user
           to confirm the identity of a specific resource or to distinguish
           among several that have some overlapping descriptions. In
           bibliographic contexts, this might mean finding the resource
           that is identified by its citation. Computer processable resource
           descriptions like bar codes, QR codes, or RFID tags are also used
           to identify resources. In Semantic Web contexts, URIs serve
           this purpose. Color can be used as resource descriptions when
           physical resources need to be identified quickly.12

12. In the very busy and dangerous environment of an
    aircraft carrier flight deck, the sailors wear vests and
    shirts that are color-coded to their jobs. For example,
    red shirts handle munitions, purple shirts handle fuel,
    green shirts run the catapults and hooks that launch and
    land the jets, and yellow shirts manage the flights. Color
    makes it faster and takes less attention for people to see
    if the right people are where they are supposed to be

    A similar principle is used in some sports; goalies wear

     Selecting

           Selecting in this context means the user activity of using
           resource descriptions to support a choice of resource from a
           collection, not the institutional activity of selecting resources
           for the collection in the first place. Search engines typically
           use a short "text snippet" with the query terms highlighted as
           resource descriptions to support selection. People often select
           resources with the least restrictions on uses as described in a
           Creative Commons license.13 A business might select a supplier
           or distributor that uses the same standard or industry
           reference model to describe its products or business processes

    different color jerseys to make it easier to enforce
    position-specific rules, and football quarterbacks wear
    distinctive practice jerseys to remind defensive players
    not to tackle them and possibly injure them.

    It is worth noting that color blindness affects
    approximately 7% of the population.

13. The Creative Commons nonprofit organization defines
    six kinds of copyright licenses that differ in the extent
    they allow commercial uses or modifications of an
    original resource (see http://creativecommons.org/
    licenses/ ). The Flickr photo sharing application is a good
    example of a site where a search for reusable resources
    can use the Creative Commons licenses to filter the
    results (http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/ ).

     452 | The Process of Describing Resources
           because it is almost certain to reduce the cost of doing business
           with that business partner.14

     Obtaining

           Physical resources often require significant effort to obtain
           after they have been selected. Catching a bus or plane involves
           coordinating your current location and time with the time and
           location the resource is available. With information resources
           in physical form, obtaining a selected resource usually meant
           a walk through the library stacks. With digital information
           resources, a search engine returns a list of the identifiers of
           resources that can be accessed with just another click, so it
           takes little effort to go from selecting among the query results
           to obtaining the corresponding primary resource.15

14. Using the same standards to describe products or to
    specify the execution of business processes can facilitate
    the implementation and operation of information-
    intensive business models because information can then
    flow between services or firms without human
    intervention. In turn this enables the business to become
    more demand or event-driven rather than forecast
    driven, making it a more "adaptive," "agile," or "on-
    demand" enterprise. See (Glushko and McGrath 2005),
    especially Ch. 5, How Models and Patterns Evolve.

15. For new resources, the labor-intensive cost of traditional
    bibliographic description is less justifiable when you can
    follow a link from a resource description to the digital
    resource it describes and quickly decide its relevance.

                                                   The Process of Describing Resources | 453
     Elaine Svenonius proposed that a fifth task called Navigation be
     added to the FRBR list, and in 2016 that happened but it was
     renamed as "Explore":16

     Navigation or Explore
           If users are not able to specify their information needs in a way
           that the finding functionality requires, they should be able to
           use relational and structural descriptions among the resources
           to navigate from any resource to other ones that might be
           better. Svenonius emphasizes generalization, aggregation, and
           derivational relationships.17 But in principle, any relationship
           or property could serve as the navigation "highway" between
           resources.
           What some authors call "structural metadata" can be used to
           support the related tasks of moving within multi-part digital
           resources like electronic books, where each page might have
           associated information about previous, next, and other related
           pages. Documents described using XML models can use
           Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations(XSLT) and

    That is, web search engines demonstrate that algorithmic
    analysis of the content of information resources can
    make them self-describing to a significant degree,
    reducing the need for bibliographic description.

           XPath to address and select data elements, sub-trees, or other
           structural parts of the document.18

   Resource Description to Support Maintenance

     Many types of resource descriptions that support selection
     ("Resource Description to Support Selection") are also useful over
     time to support maintenance of specific resource and the collection
     to which they belong. In particular, technical information about
     resource formats and technology (software, computers, or other)
     needed to use the resources, and information needed to ensure
     resource integrity is often called "preservation metadata" in a
     maintenance context.19

18. Ken Holman's Definitive XSLT and XPath (Holman 2001)
    is the book to get started on with XPath, and no one
    has taught more people about XPath than Holman. The
    first five hours of a 24-hour video course on Practical
    Transformation Using XSLT and XPath is available for
    free at http://www.udemy.com/practical-transformation-

    Implementation Strategies(PREMIS) standard for

    Dictionary(http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v2/

Resource descriptions that are more exclusively associated with
maintenance activities include version information and effectivity,
or useful life information. Equipment maintenance schedules are
typically related to the number of miles driven (indicated by a car's
odometer), number of hours operated (stored by many engines),
number of pages printed, or other easily recorded information
about resource use or interactions. With smart resources now
capable of capturing, analyzing, and communicating more data
about real-time performance, more sophisticated prediction and
scheduling of maintenance work is now possible. It is also easier
to identify resources that are not being used as much as expected,
which might imply that they are no longer needed and can thus be
safely archived or discarded.

Resource Description for Sensemaking and Science

Up to now in "Determining the Purposes", we have discussed how
resource descriptions are used to perform well-defined tasks within
an existing organizing system. However, there is a broader and less
well-defined purpose of resource description that is older and more
fundamental: the use of resource descriptions as the raw material
for making sense of the world.

For thousands of years, even before the invention of written
language, people have systematically collected things, information
about those things, and observations of all kinds to understand
how their world works. Paleolithic humans made cave paintings
depicting the results of hunts and animal migrations; ancient
Egyptians recorded the annual floods of the Nile River in stone
carvings; and Babylonian, Egyptian, Chinese, and Mesoamerican
astronomers organized lunar, solar, and planetary observations as
calendars starting about five thousand years ago.

These diverse efforts to impose meaning on experience by

456 | The Process of Describing Resources
recording, analyzing, organizing, and reorganizing observations can
be collectively described as sensemaking. (See the sidebar,
Sensemaking and Organizing.)

          Sensemaking and Organizing

                         People organize to make sense of
                      equivocal inputs and enact this sense
                      back into the world to make it more
                      orderly (Weick 2005)

          Sensemaking and organizing are intertwined. Ancient
       cultures recorded time-based observations and
       analyzed patterns among crop cycles, commodity
       prices, weather conditions, and astronomical sightings.
       Think back to the early astronomers, who oriented
       temple buildings to align with astronomical events and
       who decorated temple walls with zodiac imagery.

            · Which of the planets and stars in the night sky
                should they observe and how should they record
                the details of those observations?

            · What mathematical and statistical techniques
                should be used to analyze and describe these
                observations?

            · What subset of observations are most useful in
                predicting the onset of the Nile River floods,
                caused by unobserved rainfall thousands of miles
                away?

          Every choice about what to observe and how to
       describe it reflects a set of assumptions and potential

                                              The Process of Describing Resources | 457
             hypotheses that are often implicit and unstated. Choices
             that increase understanding are built upon, and those
             that fail to provide insight are abandoned, but there is
             no guarantee that the iterative process of choosing what
             to observe and describe will lead to a correct
             understanding.

                The principle that an accurate or comprehensive
             dataset is insufficient on its own to yield a correct
             model is exemplified in the interlocking efforts of Tycho
             Brahe and Johannes Kepler. Brahe was a 16th-century
             Danish nobleman astronomer who spent decades
             collecting data about the positions of hundreds of stars
             and the planets. However, because of prevailing
             religious and scientific biases, Brahe accepted the
             incorrect assumptions that the sun and planets revolved
             around the earth in circular orbits. After Brahe died in
             1601, Kepler spent a decade analyzing Brahe's data, and
             then rejected the idea of earth-centric and circular
             planetary orbits in favor of elliptical ones with the sun at
             one focus. These new organizing principles for Brahe's
             data made the model of the solar system vastly simpler,
             and Kepler was able to discover laws of planetary
             motion that are part of the foundation of modern
             astronomy and physics.20

     analysis and theorizing is told in an entertaining manner

Some aspects of sensemaking are hard-wired by evolution, which
has given our brains powerful mechanisms that automatically
simplify and organize the perceptual data we obtain from the world
(see the sidebar Gestalt Principles). But this automatic sensemaking
is dominated and amplified by intentional sensemaking.

Intentional sensemaking takes place when systematic statistical,
experimental, and scientific methods are consciously followed to
extract and organize knowledge from collections of samples,
observations, or measurements. It is critical to recognize here that
the contents of these collections represent choices made about
what to collect, because most things and most phenomena have a
great many descriptions or properties that could be recorded about
them.

After things or data have been collected, statistical methods
summarize the values of properties in a collection or dataset and
the relationships among them. Making sense of a single collection
or dataset by determining the properties that contrast and classify
the instances is the start toward the more important goal of
understanding the larger set or population from which the initial
collection is just a sample. There is no better example of this than
the periodic table of elements developed by Mendeleev in 1869, who
organized known elements on the basis of their common chemical
properties and then successfully predicted some properties of yet
undiscovered ones.

Computational models developed from the initial dataset can
predict future observations. Classification models assign a new
instance to a category (e.g., spam or not spam message, Madison
or Hamilton as author, outdoor or indoor scene); regression models

interprets Kepler's conceptual shifts with a model of
analogical reasoning is (Gentner et al., 1997).

                                              The Process of Describing Resources | 459
predict a specific value of some measurement (given a description
of a new movie, how much money will it make?); ordinal regression
models predict values for non-metric measures (how much will you
like the movie?). Experimental methods for hypothesis testing help
develop and refine models of any type by systematically varying the
conditions under which observations are made to discover how the
results change in different situations.
A fundamental challenge in sensemaking and modeling is finding a
balance between the competing goals of understanding a particular
collection or dataset and being able to apply that understanding
to new instances. Models can differ in the number of resource
descriptions they use as parameters, and it is easy and tempting
to overfit a model by using more parameters that capture random
variations in observations. Overfitting produces spurious accuracy
in reproducing the original observations, but it makes models less
generalizable.
The highest level of sensemaking is the creation of scientific models
or theories that propose interpretable and causal mechanisms for
the observations. And just as automatic sensemaking creates simple
explanations, scientists generally prefer simpler theories, a heuristic
known as Occam's Razor, or the law of parsimony. Even though
complex theories can sometimes be more accurate, simpler theories
produce more testable predictions, making it easier to verify or
refine the theory. Occam's famous principle, expressed eight
centuries ago, is to prefer models that make the fewest

460 | The Process of Describing Resources
     assumptions, often measured in terms of the number of parameters
     or variables needed to make a prediction.212223

21. The concept of sensemaking originated from business
    school research in management and organizational
    theory (Weick 1995) but has been widely employed by
    ethnographers in many contexts including emergency
    rooms, classrooms with minority students, airline safety
    inspections, and crime investigation. See (Weick 2005)
    and (Chater 2016)

22. Occam's Razor has a long tradition in scientific
    philosophy, but some people have argued that it is
    overrated as a heuristic for choosing among alternative
    explanations or theories, particularly because it depends
    on how you define simplicity.

23. One way to make simplicity more useful as a guide for
    choosing between mathematical models is to explicitly
    penalize those that are more complex by adding error
    to the predictions, a technique that computer scientists
    have given the non-intuitive name of regularization. This
    penalty requires complex models to be significantly
    better at explaining the data than simpler ones because
    they have to overcome the added errors.

Identifying Properties

Once the purposes of description have been established, we need
to identify the specific properties of the resources that can satisfy
those purposes. There are four reasons why this task is more
difficult than it initially appears.

  · First, any particular resource might need many resource
      descriptions, all of which relate to different properties,
      depending on the interactions to be supported and the context
      in which they take place. Selecting people for a basketball team
      focuses on their physical properties such as height, strength,
      leaping ability, and coordination. Selections for a debate team
      will be more concerned with their verbal and intellectual
      properties.

  · Second, different types of resources need to incorporate
      different properties in their descriptions. For resources in a
      museum, these might include materials and dimensions of
      pieces of art; for files and services managed by a network
      administrator, these include access control permissions; for
      electronic books or DVDs, they would include the digital rights
      management (DRM) code that expresses what you can and
      cannot do with the resource.

  · Third, as we briefly touched on in "Scope, Scale, and Resource
      Description", which properties participate in resource
      descriptions depends on who is doing the describing. It makes
      little sense to expect fine-grained distinctions and
      interpretations about properties from people who lack training
      in the discipline of organizing. We will return to this tradeoff
      in "Creating Resource Descriptions" and again in "Describing
      Museum and Artistic Resources".

  · Fourth, what might seem to be the same property at a

462 | The Process of Describing Resources
           conceptual level might be very different at an implementation
           level. Many resources have a resource description that is a
           surrogate or summary of the primary resource. For photos,
           paintings, and other resources whose appearance is their
           essence, an appropriate summary description can be a smaller,
           reduced resolution photo of the original. This surrogate is
           simple to create and easy for users to relate to the primary
           resource. On the other hand, distilling a text down to a short
           summary or abstract is a skill unto itself. Time-based resources
           provide greater challenges for summary. Should the summary
           of a movie be a textual summary of the plot, a significant clip
           from the movie, a video summary, or something else altogether?

              This implementation gap is often very large for properties
           about people because people are not as easy to measure as
           most types of resources. Businesses need to quantify a person's
           interest in their products to predict what price they would
           be willing to pay, but "interest" cannot be measured directly.
           Instead, predictions rely on proxy measures for "interest" like
           how long the customer looked at the product web page and
           whether they also looked at a competitor's web page.

     Two important dimensions for understanding and contrasting
     resource properties used in descriptions and organizing principles
     are: property essence--whether the properties are intrinsically or
     extrinsically associated with the resource, and; property
     persistence--whether the properties are static or dynamic. Taken
     together these two dimensions yield four categories of properties,
     as illustrated in Figure: Property Essence x Persistence: Four
     Categories of Properties. These four categories provide a useful
     framework for thinking about resource properties, even if, at times,
     the classification of properties is debatable.24

24. For example, the composition of a chair is presented here

                                                    The Process of Describing Resources | 463
Property Essence x Persistence:
Four Categories of Properties

as a static intrinsic property but in fact a wooden chair
might deteriorate over time as a result of exposure to
sunlight, heat, or biological agents that attack it. A skill
can be considered intrinsic and dynamic, but it might
also be highly dependent on context, making it extrinsic.
The subject category assigned to a book is extrinsic and
static, but if the classification system is revised the book
might be reclassified. Finally, while the location of a
resource can be extrinsic and dynamic, the location
history of the resource at some specific point in time is a
fact, an intrinsic and static property.

464 | The Process of Describing Resources
The distinctions of property persistence and property essence
combine to distinguish four categories of properties: intrinsic static,
extrinsic static, intrinsic dynamic, and extrinsic dynamic properties.

Intrinsic Static Properties

Intrinsic or implicit properties are inherent in the resource and can
often be directly perceived or experienced. Static properties do not
change their values over time. The species of an animal, the material
of composition of a wooden chair, and the diameter of a wheel
are all static properties that do not change their values over time.
Static properties like color or shape are often used to describe and
organize physical resources.

                                              The Process of Describing Resources | 465
          Intrinsic Static Properties Define a Dalmatian
          The spots on a Dalmatian dog are intrinsic static
       properties that appear shortly after birth, and they are
       so distinctive that it is impossible to describe the breed
       without acknowledging the spots.

          This particular Dalmatian is the "greeter" at the Viader
       Winery in Deer Park, California. The dog is nice and the
       wines are excellent.

          (Photo by R. Glushko.)

Intrinsic physical properties are usually just part of resource
descriptions. In many cases, physical properties describe only the
surface layer of a resource, revealing little about what something is
or its original intended purpose, what it means, or when and why it
was created. The author of a song and the context of its creation are
other examples of intrinsic and static resource properties that are
not directly perceivable.
466 | The Process of Describing Resources
Intrinsic descriptions are often extracted or calculated by
computational processes. For example, a computer program might
calculate the frequency and distribution of words in some particular
document. Similarly, visual signatures or audio fingerprints are
intrinsic descriptions ("Describing Non-text Resources").

Some relationships among resources are intrinsic and static, like
the parent-child relationship or the sibling relationship between
two children with the same parents. Part-whole or compositional
relationships for resources with parts are also intrinsic static
properties often used in resource descriptions. However, it is better
to avoid treating resource relationships as properties, and instead
express them as relations. Describing Relationships and Structures
discusses part-whole and other semantic relationships in great
detail.

Extrinsic Static Properties

Extrinsic or explicit properties are assigned to a resource rather
than being inherent in it. The name or identifier of a resource
is often arbitrary but once assigned does not usually change.
Arranging resources according to the alphabetical or numerical
order of their descriptive identifiers is a common organizing
principle. Classification numbers and subject headings assigned to
bibliographic resources are extrinsic static properties, as are the
serial numbers stamped on or attached to manufactured products.

For information resources that have a digital form, the properties of
their printed or rendered versions might not be intrinsic. Some text
formats completely separate content from presentation, and as a
result, style sheets can radically change the appearance of a printed
document or web page without altering the primary resource in any
way. For example, were a different style applied to this paragraph to

                                              The Process of Describing Resources | 467
highlight it in bold or cast in 24-point font, its content would remain
the same.

Intrinsic Dynamic Properties

Intrinsic dynamic properties change over time. Developmental
personal characteristics like a person's height and weight, skill
proficiency, or intellectual capacity, for example. Because these
properties are not static, they are usually employed only to organize
resources whose membership in the collection is of limited
duration. Sports programs or leagues that segregate participants by
age or years of experience are using intrinsic dynamic properties to
describe and organize the resources.

Extrinsic Dynamic Properties

Extrinsic dynamic properties are in many ways arbitrary and can
change because they are based on usage, behavior, or context. The
current owner or location of a resource, its frequency of access,
the joint frequency of access with other resources, its current
popularity or cultural salience, or its competitive advantage over
alternative resources are typical extrinsic and dynamic properties
that are used in resource descriptions. A topical book described as
a best seller one year might be found in the discount sales bin a few
years later. A student's grade point average is an extrinsic dynamic
property.

          Why are Ottoman Carpets
          Named After a German Painter?

468 | The Process of Describing Resources
   An example of a cultural category that has far
outlasted its motivation is that of the Holbein carpet. A
particular type of geometrically patterned Ottoman rug
came to be known as a "Holbein carpet" after the
German Renaissance painter Hans Holbein, who often
depicted the rugs in his work (probably to show off his
extremely meticulous technique). Holbein was famous in
his time, and his commissioned paintings of the English
King Henry VIII have Henry standing on such rugs. This
painting, called "The Ambassadors," was painted in 1533
and now hangs in The National Gallery, London.

                                     The Process of Describing Resources | 469
     Extrinsic dynamic properties are useful features for data scientists
     making prediction or classification models. Your current location,
     the thing you just bought, and the place you bought it can be viewed
     as manifestations of unobservable preferences and values.
     Fingerprints found on a doorknob at a crime scene are an extrinsic
     dynamic property associated with the door, and clever detectives
     would analyze them along with other interaction resources they
     discovered with the goal of identifying the person for whom the
     fingerprints are intrinsic static properties.

     Many relationships between resources are extrinsic and dynamic
     properties, like that of best friend.

     Contextual properties are those related to the situation or context
     in which a resource is described. Dey defines context as "any
     information that characterizes a situation related to the
     interactions between users, applications, and the surrounding
     environment." 25 This open-ended definition implies a large number
     of contextual properties that might be used in a description; crisper
     definitions of context might be "location + activity" or "who, when,
     where, why." Since context changes, context-based descriptors
     might be appropriate when assigned but can have limited
     persistence and effectivity ("Resources over Time"); the description
     of a document as "receipt of a recent purchase" will not be useful for
     very long.

25. (Dey 2001) further defines the "environment" of context
    as places, people, and things, and for each of "entities"
    there are four categories of context information:
    location, identity, status (or activity), and time. This
    framework thus yields 12 dimensions for describing the
    context of an environment.

      470 | The Process of Describing Resources
                Latent Feature Creation
                and Netflix Recommendations
                Recent advances in computing technology and data
             science techniques are making it possible to discover or
             create resource properties that are called "latent"
             because they are inferred rather than observed. Many
             such features are used by businesses to segment
             customers or make recommendations to them based on
             their recent behavior, so these features are also
             extrinsic and dynamic.
                Your own movie preferences prove that easy to
             identify properties like sex and age do not differentiate
             movie watchers enough to make good
             recommendations, even if you combine them to create a
             category like "single male students between 18 and 25."
             Netflix found that it was necessary to combine
             demographic properties, viewing history, and browsing
             behavior with very detailed ratings of dozens of movie
             properties to make good recommendations. It takes
             enormous computing power to discover a category of
             Netflix users who typically like action movies, yet
             consistently hover their mouse over romance movies,
             and to use this latent feature to recommend a sub-
             genre of western movies (one of nearly 100,000) that it
             calls "Romantic Action Adventure Movies."26

26. A fascinating story about the Netflix's design and use
    of tens of thousands of movie sub-genres in its
    recommendation system is (Madrigal 2014).

                                                     The Process of Describing Resources | 471
     Citations of one information resource by another are extrinsic static
     descriptions when they are in print form, but when they are
     published in digital libraries it is usually the case that "cited by" is
     a dynamic resource description. Similarly, any particular link from
     one web page to another is an extrinsic static description, but
     because many web pages themselves are highly dynamic, we can
     also consider links as dynamic as well. Citations and web links are
     discussed in more detail in Describing Relationships and Structures.

     Resources are often described with cultural properties that derive
     from conventional language or culture, often by analogy, because
     they can be highly evocative and memorable. 27

     Sometimes a cultural description outlives its salience, losing its
     power to evoke anything other than puzzlement about what it might
     mean.28

     For the Lego boys, current with the latest Star Wars movies, "light

    "-gate" suffix to imply that there is something scandalous
    or unethical going on that is being covered up. This
    cultural description is not immediately meaningful to
    anyone who does not know about the break-in at the
    headquarters of the Democratic National Committee
    headquarters at the Watergate hotel and subsequent
    cover-up that led to the 1974 resignation of US President
    Richard Nixon. A list of "-gate" events is maintained at

     saber" was just the obvious description for a long, neon tube with a
     handle. However, someone unfamiliar with the Star Wars franchise
     might not understand"light saber," and would describe the piece
     some other way.

   Designing the Description Vocabulary

     After we have determined the properties to use in resource
     descriptions, we need to design the description vocabulary: the
     set of words or values that represent the properties. "Naming
     Resources" discussed the problems of naming and proposed
     principles for good names, and since names are a very important
     resource description, much of what we said there applies generally
     to the design of the description vocabulary.
     However, because the description vocabulary as a whole is much
     more than just the resource name, we need to propose additional
     principles or guidelines for this step. In addition, some new design
     questions arise when we consider all the resource descriptions as
     a set whose separate descriptions are created by many people over
     some period of time.

    Principles of Good Description

     In The Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization,
     Svenonius proposes a set of principles or "directives for design"
     of a description language.29 Her principles, framed in the narrow

29. (Svenonius 2000, Ch. 5).

                                                    The Process of Describing Resources | 473
context of bibliographic descriptions, generally apply to the broad
range of resource types we consider in this book.

User Convenience

      Choose description terms with the user in mind; these are likely
      to be terms in common usage among the target audience.

Representation

      Use descriptions that reflect how the resources describe
      themselves; assume that self-descriptions are accurate.

Sufficiency and Necessity

      Descriptions should have enough information to serve their
      purposes and not contain information that is not necessary for
      some purpose; this might imply excluding some aspects of self-
      descriptions that are insignificant.

Standardization

      Standardize descriptions to the extent practical, but also use
      aliasing to allow for commonly used terms.

Integration

      Prefer the same properties and terms for all types of resources.

Any set of general design principles faces two challenges.

  · The first is that implementing any principle requires many
      additional and specific context-dependent choices for which
      the general principle offers little guidance. For example, how
      does the principle of Standardization apply if multiple
      standards already exist in some resource domain? Which of the
      competing standards should be adopted, and why?

  · The second challenge is that the general principles can

474 | The Process of Describing Resources
      sometimes lead to conflicting advice. The User Convenience
      recommendation to choose description terms in common use
      fails if the user community includes both ordinary people and
      scientists who use different terms for the same resources;
      whose "common usage" should prevail?

Who Uses the Descriptions?

Focus on the user of the descriptions. This is a core idea that we
cannot overemphasize because it is implicit in every step of the
process of resource description. All of the design principles in the
previous section share the idea that the design of the description
vocabulary should focus on the user of the descriptions. Are the
resources being organized personal ones, for personal and mostly
private purposes? In that case, the description properties and terms
can be highly personal or idiosyncratic and still follow the design
principles.

Similarly, when resource users share relevant knowledge, or are in
a context where they can communicate and negotiate, if necessary,
to identify the resources, their resource descriptions can afford to
be less precise and rigorous than they might otherwise need to be.
This helps explain the curious descriptions in the Lego story with
which we began this chapter. The boys playing with the blocks were
talking to each other with the Legos in front of them. If they had not
been able to see the blocks the others were talking about, or if they
had to describe their toys to someone who had never played with
Legos before, their descriptions would have been quite different.

More often, however, resource descriptions can not assume this
degree of shared context and must be designed for user categories
rather than individual users: library users searching for books,
business employees or customers using part and product catalogs,
scientists analyzing the datasets from experiments or simulations.

                                              The Process of Describing Resources | 475
In each of these situations resource descriptions will need to be
understood by people who did not create them, so the design of the
description vocabulary needs to be more deliberate and systematic
to ensure that its terms are unambiguous and sufficient to ensure
reliable context-free interpretation. A single individual seldom has
the breadth of domain knowledge and experience with users
needed to devise a description vocabulary that can satisfy diverse
users with diverse purposes. Instead, many people working together
typically develop the required description vocabulary. We call the
results institutional vocabularies, to contrast them with individual
or cultural ones. (We will discuss this contrast more fully in
Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types)

          Stop and Think: Description and Expertise
          Everyone knows something about trees, but some
       people know more than others, and their particular
       experience and perspective influences how they
       describe trees. What kind of properties and descriptions
       would be used by university students? By research
       botanists? By landscape designers? By park maintenance
       workers? By indigenous people who live in tropical rain
       forests?

Some resource descriptions are designed for use by machines,
which seemingly reduces the importance of design principles that
consider user preferences or common uses. However, even if
resources are described and organized by algorithms, when people
need to explain the classifications and predictions that the
algorithms produce, resource descriptions that are comprehensible
and easily communicated are preferable to statistically optimal
ones. Moreover, standardization and integration principles become
more important for inter-machine communication to enable

476 | The Process of Describing Resources
      efficient processing, reuse of data and software, and increased
      interoperability among organizing systems.30

    Controlled Vocabularies and Content Rules

      As we defined in "Use Controlled Vocabularies", a controlled
      vocabulary is a fixed or closed set of description terms in some
      domain with precise definitions that is used instead of the
      vocabulary that people would otherwise use. For example, instead
      of the popular terms for descriptions of diseases or symptoms,
      medical researchers and teaching hospitals can use the National
      Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings(MeSH) controlled
      vocabulary.31

      We can distinguish a progression of vocabulary control: a glossary
      is a set of allowed terms; a thesaurus is a set of terms arranged
      in a hierarchy and annotated to indicate terms that are preferred,
      broader than, or narrower than other terms; an ontology expresses
      the conceptual relationships among the terms in a formal logic-
      based language so they can be processed by computers. We will say
      more about ontologies in Describing Relationships and Structures.

      Content rules are similar to controlled vocabularies because they
      also limit the possible values that can be used in descriptions.
      Instead of specifying a fixed set of values, content rules typically
      restrict descriptions by requiring them to be of a particular data
      type (integer, Boolean, Date, and so on). Possible values are
      constrained by logical expressions (e.g., a value must be between

     0 and 99) or regular expressions (e.g., must be a string of length 5
     that must begin with a number). Content rules like these are used to
     ensure valid descriptions when people enter them in web forms or
     other applications.

    Vocabulary Control as Dimensionality Reduction

     In most cases, a controlled vocabulary is a subset of the natural or
     uncontrolled vocabulary, but sometimes it is a new set of invented
     terms. This might sound odd until we consider that the goal of a
     controlled vocabulary is to reduce the number of descriptive terms
     assignable to a resource. Stated this way the problem is one of
     dimensionality reduction, transforming a high-dimensional space
     into a lower-dimensional one. Reducing the number of components
     in a multidimensional description can be accomplished by many
     different statistical techniques that go by names like "feature
     extraction," "principle components analysis," "orthogonal
     decomposition," "latent semantic analysis," "multidimensional
     scaling," and "factor analysis." 32

32. We cannot cite all of mathematical statistics in one short
    endnote, but if you are inclined to learn more, (Mardia,
    Kent, and Bibby 1980) and (Lee and Verleysen 2007) are
    the kindest and gentlest resources. If we look very
    generously at "dimensionality reduction" we might even
    consider the indexing step of eliminating "stop words"
    to be a form of dimensionality reduction. Stop words
    appear with such high frequency that they have no
    discriminating power, so they are discarded from queries

      478 | The Process of Describing Resources
These techniques might sound imposing and they are
computationally complex, but they all have the same simple concept
at their core, that the features or properties that describe some
resource are often highly correlated. For example, a document that
contains the word "car" is more likely to contain the words "driver"
and "traffic" than a document that does not. Similar correlations
exist among the visual features used to describe images and the
acoustic features that describe music. Dimensionality reduction
techniques analyze the correlations between resource descriptions
to transform a large set of descriptions into a much smaller set
of uncorrelated ones. In a way this implements the principle of
Sufficiency and Necessity we mentioned in "Principles of Good
Description" because it eliminates description dimensions or
properties that do not contribute much to distinguishing the
resources.

Here is an oversimplified example that illustrates the idea. Suppose
we have a collection of resources, and every resource described as
"big" is also described as "red," and every "small" resource is also
"green." This perfect correlation between color and size means that
either of these properties is sufficient to distinguish "big red" things
from "small green" ones, and we do not need clever algorithms to
figure that out. But if we have thousands of properties and the
correlations are only partial, we need the sophisticated statistical
approaches to choose the optimal set of description properties and
terms, and in some techniques the dimensions that remain are
called "latent" or "synthetic" ones because they are statistically
optimal but do not map directly to resource properties.

documents.

Designing the Description Form

By this step in the process of resource description we have made
numerous important decisions about which resources to describe,
the purposes for which we are describing, them, and the properties
and terms we will use in the descriptions. As much as possible
we have described the steps at a conceptual level and postponed
discussion of implementation considerations about the notation,
syntax, and deployment of the resource descriptions separately or
in packages. Separating design from implementation concerns is an
idealization of the process of resource description, but is easier to
learn and think about resource description and organizing systems
if we do. We discuss these implementation issues in The Forms of
Resource Descriptions.

Sometimes we have to confront legacy technology, existing or
potential business relationships, regulations, standards
conformance, performance requirements, or other factors that have
implications for how resource descriptions must or should be
implemented, stored, and managed. We will take this more
pragmatic perspective in The Organizing System Roadmap, The
Organizing System Roadmap, but until then, we will continue to
focus on design issues and defer discussion of the implementation
choices.

Creating Resource Descriptions

Resource descriptions can be created by professionals, by the
authors or creators of resources, by users, or by computational or
automated means.

From the traditional perspective of library and information science
with its emphasis on bibliographic description, these modes of

480 | The Process of Describing Resources
     creation imply different levels of description complexity and
     sophistication; Taylor and Joudrey suggest that professionals create
     rich descriptions, untrained users at best create structured ones,
     and automated processes create simple ones.

     This classification reflects a disciplinary and historical bias more
     than reality. "Simple" resource descriptions are "no more than data
     extracted from the resource itself... the search engine approach to
     organizing the web through automated indexing techniques."33

     It might be fair to describe an inverted index implementation of
     a Boolean information retrieval model as simple, but it is clearly
     wrong to consider what Google and other search engines do to
     describe and retrieve web resources as simple.34

     A better notion of levels of resource description is one based on the
     amount of interpretation imposed by the description, an approach
     that focuses on the descriptions themselves rather than on their
     methods of creation. We will discuss this sort of approach in
     "Describing Museum and Artistic Resources" in the context of
     describing museum and artistic resources.

     Professionally-created resource descriptions, author- or user-
     created descriptions, and computational or automated descriptions
     each have strengths and limitations that impose tradeoffs. A natural
     solution is to try to combine desirable aspects from each in hybrid

33. (Taylor and Joudrey 2009), p. 91.

34. See Ch. 4 of (Buttcher, Clarke, and Cormack 2010) for
    a description of a simple Boolean information retrieval
    model and Chapter 14 and 15 for descriptions of Google-
    scale ones. For a popular discussion of the Google
    algorithm see (Levy 2010).

approaches. For example, the vocabulary for a new resource domain
may arise from tagging by end users but then be refined by
professionals, lay classifiers may create descriptions with help from
software tools that suggest possible terms, or software that creates
descriptions can be improved by training it with human-generated
descriptions, a form of supervised learning (see "Categories Created
by Clustering").

Often existing resource descriptions can or must be transformed or
enhanced to meet the ongoing needs of an organizing system, and
sometimes these processes can be automated. We will defer further
discussion of those situations to Interactions with Resources. In the
discussion that follows we focus on the creation of new resource
descriptions where none yet exist.

Resource Description by Professionals

Before the web made it possible for almost anyone to create,
publish, and describe their own resources and to describe those
created and published by others, resource description was generally
done by professionals in institutional contexts. Professional
indexers and catalogers described bibliographic and museum
resources after having been trained to learn the concepts,
controlled descriptive vocabularies, and the relevant standards. In
information systems domains professional data and process
analysts, technical writers, and others created similarly rigorous
descriptions after receiving analogous training. We have called
these types of resource descriptions institutional ones to highlight
the contrast between those created according to standards and

482 | The Process of Describing Resources
     those created informally in ad hoc ways, especially by untrained or
     undisciplined individuals.35

35. Many institutional organizing systems are subject to a
    single centralized or governmental authority that can
    impose principles for describing and arranging
    resources. Examples of organizing systems where
    resources are described using standard centralized
    principles are:

    Libraries that use national bibliographic standards to
    satisfy requirements set by industry associations or other
    accreditation bodies such as the Association of College
    and Research Libraries (ACRL). (http://ala.org/acrl )

    Companies that follow industry standards for
    information or process models, product classification or
    identification to be eligible for government business
    (Shah and Kesan 2006).

    Legislative documents that conform to National or
    European Community standards for structure, naming,
    and description (Biasiotti 2008).

    The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
    Numbers(ICANN) and its policies for operating the
    Domain Name System(DNS) make it possible for every
    website to be located using its logical name (like
    "berkeley.edu" rather than using an IP address like
    169.229.131.81). (http://www.icann.org/ )

                                                    The Process of Describing Resources | 483
Resource Description by Authors or Creators

The author or creator of a resource can be presumed to understand
the reasons why and the purposes for which the resource can be
used. And, presumably, most authors want to be read, so they will
describe their resources in ways that will appeal to and be useful
to their intended users. However, these descriptions are unlikely

In other domains multiple organizations or institutions
have the authority to impose principles of resource
description. Sometimes this authority derives from the
voluntary collaboration of multiple autonomous parties
who set and conform to standards because they benefit
from being able to share resources or information about
resources. Examples of organizing systems where
resources are described using standardized
decentralized principles are:

Firms that establish company-wide standards for their
information resources, typically including the
organization and management of source content,
document type models, and a style guide that applies to
print and web documents.

Firms that participate in the OASIS (http://www.oasis-
open.org/ ) or the W3C (http://www.w3.org/ ) industry
consortia to establish specifications or technical
recommendations for their information systems or web
services).

484 | The Process of Describing Resources
     to use the controlled vocabularies and standards that professional
     catalogers would use.

    Resource Description by Users

     Today's web contains a staggering number of resources, most of
     which are primary information resources published as web content,
     but many others are resources that stand for "in the world" physical
     resources. Most of these resources are being described by their
     users rather than by professionals or by their authors. These "at
     large" users are most often creating descriptions for their own
     benefit when they assign tags or ratings to web resources, and they
     are unlikely to use standard or controlled descriptors when they
     do so.36 The resulting variability can be a problem if creating the
     description requires judgment on the tagger's part. Most people can
     agree on the length of a particular music file but they may differ
     wildly when it comes to determining to which musical genre that
     file belongs. Fortunately most web users implicitly recognize that
     the potential value in these "Web 2.0" or "user-generated content"
     applications will be greater if they avoid egocentric descriptions.
     In addition, the statistics of large sample sizes inevitably leads to
     some agreement in descriptions on the most popular applications

36. Many organizing systems describe and arrange their
    physical or information resources in ad hoc ways because
    the person or institution determining the arrangement is
    completely autonomous. This is the domain of organizing
    systems embraced by David Weinberger in Everything is
    Miscellaneous (Weinberger 2007).

                                                    The Process of Describing Resources | 485
     because idiosyncratic descriptions are dominated in the frequency
     distribution by the more conventional ones.37

     We are not suggesting that professional descriptions are always
     of high quality and utility, and socially produced ones are always
     of low quality and utility.38 Rather, it is important to understand
     the limitations and qualifications of descriptions produced in each
     way. Tagging lowers the barrier to entry for description, making
     organizing more accessible and creating descriptions that reflects
     a variety of viewpoints. However, when many tags are associated
     with a resource, it increases recall while decreasing precision. (See
     "Resource Description by Users")

37. (Sen et al. 2006) analyze the effects of four tag selection
    algorithms used in sites that allow user tags on
    vocabulary evolution (more often called "tag
    convergence" in the literature), tag utility, tag adoption,
    and user satisfaction.

38. But in an often-cited essay (Doctorow, 2001)
    provocatively titled Metacrap: Putting the torch to seven
    straw-men of the meta-utopia, Cory Doctorow argues
    that much human-created metadata is of low quality
    because "people lie, people are lazy, people are stupid,
    mission impossible--know thyself, schemas are not
    neutral, metrics influence results, (and) there is more
    than one way to describe something."

      486 | The Process of Describing Resources
    Automated and Computational Resource Description

      A picture's EXIF file created by a digital camera records properties
      associated with the camera and its settings, as well as some
      properties of the photo-taking context. (See Figure: Contrasting
      Descriptions for a Work of Art. for an example.) Creating this highly
      detailed description by hand would be nearly impossible. The
      downside, however, is that the automated description does not
      capture the meaning of the photo; an automated picture description
      captures the time and place, but not that it is a picture of a
      honeymoon vacation. The difference between automated and
      human description is called the semantic gap ("The Semantic Gap").

      Any resource that is smart enough to collect data about its state
      or environment is creating resource descriptions automatically (See
      "Active or Operant Resources"). Resources with computational
      capabilities can process the raw sensor data to identify important
      events and create more interpretable descriptions.

      Some computational approaches create resource descriptions that
      are similar in purpose to those created by human describers. Text
      mining and summarization systems for customer comments about
      products can reduce thousands of comments to a list of the most
      important features.39 People shopping for books at Amazon.com
      get insights about a book's content and distinctiveness from the
      statistically improbable phrases that it has identified by comparing
      all the books for which it has the complete text.40

      Computational descriptions can use any observable or latent

     variable (see the sidebar, Latent Feature Creation and Netflix
     Recommendations) except some that are prohibited by law, such
     as race, religion, national origin, and marital status, to prevent
     discrimination. In practice, however, this prohibition is easily
     circumvented because these properties can usually be predicted
     using other ones. For example, race can often be reliably predicted
     using residence address and surname.41

     Of course, all information retrieval systems compare a description
     of a user's needs with descriptions of the resources that might
     satisfy them. IR systems differ in the resource properties they
     emphasize; word frequencies and distributions for documents in
     digital libraries, links and navigation behavior for web pages,
     acoustics for music, and so on. These different property
     descriptions determine the comparison algorithms and the way in
     which relevance or similarity of descriptions is determined. We say
     a lot more about this in "Describing Non-text Resources" and in
     Interactions with Resources.

   Evaluating Resource Descriptions

     Evaluation is implicit in many of the activities of organizing systems
     we described in Activities in Organizing Systems and is explicit
     when we maintain a collection of resources over time. In this
     section, we focus on the narrower problem of evaluating resource
     descriptions.

41. The title says it all: Predictive analytics: The power to
    predict who will click, buy, lie, or die. (Siegel 2013). The
    Bayesian Surname and Geocoding technique for
    predicting race is described by (Elliott et al. 2008).

     488 | The Process of Describing Resources
Evaluating means determining quality with respect to some criteria
or dimensions. Many different sets of criteria have been proposed;
for repositories of digital resources, the most commonly used ones
are accuracy, completeness, and consistency.42 Other typical
criteria are timeliness, interoperability, and usability. It is easy to
imagine these criteria in conflict; efforts to achieve accuracy and
completeness might jeopardize timeliness; enforcing consistency
might preclude modifications and personalizations that would
enhance usability.

          Stop and Think: Defining Quality
          What characteristics or criteria would you use to
       determine the quality of a car? Of food? Of clothing? Of
       a place to live? Which of these criteria are domain-
       specific, and which ones apply more generally to many
       types of resources?

The quality of the outcome of the multi-step process proposed in
this chapter is a composite of the quality created or squandered at
each step. A scope that is too granular or abstract, overly ambitious
or vague intended purposes, a description vocabulary that is hard
to use, or giving people inadequate time to create good descriptions
can all cause quality problems, but none of these decisions is visible
at the end of the process where users interact with resource
descriptions.

    Evaluating the Creation of Resource Descriptions

     When professionals create resource descriptions in a centralized
     manner, which has long been the standard practice for many
     resources in libraries, there is a natural focus on quality at the point
     of creation to ensure that the appropriate controlled vocabularies
     and standards have been used. However, the need for resource
     description generalizes to resource domains outside of the
     traditional bibliographic one, and other quality considerations
     emerge in those contexts.

     Resource descriptions in private sector firms are essential to
     running the business and in interacting efficiently with suppliers,
     partners, and customers. Compared to the public sector, there is
     much greater emphasis on the economics and strategy of resource
     description.43 What is the value of resource description? Who will
     bear the costs of producing them? Which of the competing industry
     standards will be followed? Some of these decisions are not free
     choices as much as they are constraints imposed as a condition
     of doing business with a dominant economic partner, which is
     sometimes a governmental entity.

     For example, a firm like Wal-Mart with enormous market power
     can dictate terms and standards to its suppliers because the long-
     term benefits of a Wal-Mart contract usually make the initial
     accommodation worthwhile. Likewise, governments often require

43. However, these concerns are rapidly becoming more
    important in the public sector. In particular, many public
    universities in the US are struggling with cuts in state
    and federal funding that are affecting library services and
    practices.

      490 | The Process of Describing Resources
     their suppliers to conform to open standards to avoid lock-in to
     proprietary technologies. 44

     In both the public and private sectors there is increased use of
     computational techniques for creating resource descriptions
     because the number of resources to be described is simply too
     great to allow for professional description. A great deal of work in
     text data mining, web page classification, semantic enrichment, and
     other similar research areas is already under way and is significantly
     lowering the cost of producing useful resource descriptions. Some
     museums have embraced approaches that automatically create
     user-oriented resource descriptions and new user interfaces for
     searching and browsing by transforming the professional
     descriptions in their internal collections management systems.45
     Google's ambitious project to digitize millions of books has been
     criticized for the quality of its algorithmically extracted resource
     descriptions, but we can expect that computer scientists will put

44. More generally, economists use the concept of the "mode
    of exchange" in a business relationship to include the
    procedures and norms that govern routine behavior
    between business partners. An "exit" mode is one in
    which the buyer makes little long-term commitment to
    a supplier, and problems with a supplier cause the buyer
    to find a new one. In contrast, in "voice" mode there is
    much greater commitment and communication between
    the parties, usually leading to improved processes and
    designs. See (Helper and McDuffie 2003).

                                                     The Process of Describing Resources | 491
     the Google book corpus to good use as a research test bed to
     improve the techniques.46

     Web 2.0 applications that derive their value from the aggregation
     and interpretation of user-generated content can be viewed as
     voluntarily ceding their authority to describe and organize
     resources to their users, who then tag or rate them as they see fit. In
     this context the consistency of resource description, or the lack of
     it, becomes an important issue, and many sites are using technology
     or incentives to guide users to create better descriptions.

    Evaluating the Use of Resource Descriptions

     Regardless of, or in addition to, any quality criteria applied to the
     creation and selection of resource descriptions, at some point the
     resource descriptions meet their intended users. The most
     important quality criterion at that point is whether the resource
     descriptions satisfy their intended purposes in a usable way. In
     many ways, the answer is a disappointing no.

     For example, in one of the earliest revisions to the original HTML
     specification, a <META> tag was added to allow creators of web
     resources to define a set of key terms to describe a website or
     web page. This well-motivated resource description was to be used
     by search engines to improve the relevance of retrieved pages.
     However, it soon became obvious that it was possible to "game"
     the META tag by adding popular terms even though they did not

46. (Nunberg 2009) called the quality of Google's metadata
    "a disaster for scholars," but (Sag 2012) argues that the
    otherwise neglected "orphan works" in the Google
    corpus are "grist for the data mill."

      492 | The Process of Describing Resources
accurately describe the page. Today search engines ignore the
<META> tag for ranking pages, but many other techniques that use
false resource descriptions continue to plague web users. (See
"Social and Web Curation".)

The design of a description vocabulary circumscribes what can be
said about a resource, so it is important to recognize that it
implicitly determines what cannot be said as well, with unintended
negative consequences for users. The resource description schema
implemented in a physician's patient management system defines
certain types of recordable information about a patient's visit--the
date of the visit, any tests that were ordered, a diagnosis that was
made, a referral to a specialist. The schema, and its associated
workflow, impose constraints that affect the kinds of information
medical professionals can record and the amount of space they can
use for those descriptions. Moreover, such a schema might also
eliminate vital unstructured space that paper records can provide,
where doctors communicate their rationale for a diagnosis or
decision without having to fit it into any particular box.

However, when resource descriptions are the data used to train
models for prediction or classification, the focus of evaluation is
not on the descriptions, which are often assumed to be accurate
observations about the world. Instead, evaluation focuses on the
model, and "model selection" is the task of choosing which of several
competing models best fit the original data while also generalizing
well to new data. In any event, any quality problems or selection
biases with the original data will undermine the value of whatever
model is selected.

The Importance of Iterative Evaluation

The inevitable conflicts between quality goals mean that there will
be compromises among the quality criteria. Furthermore,

                                              The Process of Describing Resources | 493
     increasing scale in an organizing system and the steady
     improvements of computational techniques for resource
     description imply that the nature of the compromise will change
     over time. As a result, a single evaluation of resource descriptions at
     one moment in time will not suffice.

     This makes usage records, navigation history, and transactional data
     extremely important kinds of resource descriptions because they
     enable you to focus efforts on improving quality where they are
     most needed. Furthermore, for organizing systems with many types
     of resources and user communities, this information can enable the
     tailoring of the nature and extent of resource description to find the
     right balance between "rich and comprehensive" and "simple and
     efficient" approaches. Each combination of resource type and user
     community might have a different solution.

     The idea that quality is a property of an end-to-end process is
     embodied in the "quality movement" and statistical process control
     for industrial processes but it applies equally well to resource
     description. The central idea is that quality cannot be tested in by
     inspecting the final products. Instead, quality is achieved through
     process control--measuring and removing the variability of every
     process needed to create the products.47 Explicit feedback from
     users or implicit feedback from the records of their resource
     interactions needs are essential as we iterate through the design
     process and revisit the decisions made there.

47. The modern "quality movement" grew out of the efforts
    of the US to rebuild Japan after the Second World War
    and its "Bible" was Juran's 1951 Quality Control Handbook
    (Juran 1951).

      494 | The Process of Describing Resources
34. Describing Non-text
Resources

Many of the principles and methods for resource description were
developed for describing text resources in physical formats. Those
principles have had to evolve to deal with different types of
resources that people want to describe and organize, from paintings
and statues to MP3s, JPEGs, and MPEGs.

Some descriptions for non-text resources are text-based, and are
most often assigned by people. Other descriptions are in non-text
formats are extracted algorithmically from the content of the non-
text resource. These latter content-based resource descriptions
capture intrinsic technical properties and in some domains are able
to describe aboutness with some accuracy, thanks to breakthroughs
in machine learning.

Describing Museum and Artistic Resources

The problems associated with describing multimedia resources are
not all new. Museum curators have been grappling with them since
they first started to collect, store, and describe artifacts hundreds
of years ago. Many artifacts may represent the same work (think
about shards of pottery that may once have been part of the same
vase). The materials and forms do not convey semantics on their
own. Without additional research and description, we know nothing
about the vase; it does not come with any sort of title page or
tag that connects it with a 9th-century Mayan settlement. Since
museums can acquire large batches of artifacts all at once, they
have to make decisions about which resources they can afford to
describe and how much they can describe them.

                                                     Describing Non-text Resources | 495
   German art historian Erwin Panofsky first codified one approach
   to these problems of description. In his classic Studies in Iconology,
   he defined three levels of description that can be applied to an
   artistic work or museum artifact. Figure: Contrasting Descriptions
   for a Work of Art. contrasts these three levels in the descriptions of
   a marble statue. It also shows the striking differences between the
   EXIF description in a digital photo of the statue and those created
   by people.1

1. (Panofsky 1972) proposes these three levels of
  description:
  Primary subject matter

        At this level, we describe the most basic elements of
        a work in a generic way that would be recognizable
        by anyone regardless of expertise or training. The
        painting The Last Supper, for example, might be
        described as "13 people having dinner."

  Secondary subject matter

        Here, we introduce a level of basic cultural

Professionals who create descriptions of museum and artistic
resources, architecture and other cultural works typically use the
VRA Core from the Library of Congress, or the Getty Trust
Categories for the Description of Works of Art(CDWA), a massive
controlled vocabulary with 532 categories and subcategories. A
CDWA-Lite has been developed to create a very small subset for use
by non-specialists.2

Contrasting Descriptions for a Work of Art

     description knows about the situation in which the
     work was created. Why, for example, did this
     particular artist create this particular depiction of
     The Last Supper in this way? Panofsky posited that
     professional art historians are needed here, because
     they are the ones with the education and
     background necessary to draw meaning from a work.

In other words, Panofsky saw the need for many different
types of descriptors--including physical, cultural, and
contextual --to work together when making a full
description of an artifact.

Descriptions for works of art can contrast a great deal, especially
between those captured by a device like a digital camera and those
created by people. Furthermore, the descriptions created by people
differ according to the expertise of the creator and the amount of
subjective interpretation applied in the description.

  Describing Images

   Digital cameras, including those in cell phones, take millions of
   photos each day. Unlike the images in museums and galleries, most
   of these images receive few descriptions beyond those created by
   the device that made them. Nevertheless, a great many of them end
   up with some limited descriptions in Facebook, Instagram, Flickr,
   Picasa, DeviantArt, or others of the numerous places where people
   share images, or in professional image applications like Light Room.
   All of these sites provide some facilities for users to assign tags to
   images or arrange them in named groups.

   Many different computational approaches have been used to
   describe or classify images. One approach uses the visual signature
   of an image extracted from low-level features like color, shape,
   texture, and luminosity, which are then used to distinguish
   significant regions and objects. Image similarity is computed to
   create categories of images that contain the same kinds of colors,
   objects, or settings, which makes it easy to find duplicate or
   modified images.3

   For computers to identify specific objects or people in images, it
   is logically necessary to train them with images that are already
   identified. In 2005 Luis van Ahn devised a clever way to collect large
   amounts of labeled images with a web-based game called ESP that
   randomly paired people to suggest labels or tags for an image. The
   obvious choices were removed from contention, so a photo of a bird

3. See (Datta et al. 2008). The company Idée is developing
   a variety of image search algorithms, which use image
   signatures and measures of visual similarity to return
   photos similar to those a user asks to see.

                                                          Describing Non-text Resources | 499
   against a blue sky might already strike "bird" and "sky" from the set
   of acceptable words, leaving users to suggest words such as "flying"
   and "cloudless." Van Ahn also invented the reCAPTCHA technique
   that presents images of text from old books being digitized, which
   improves the accuracy of the digitization while verifying that the
   user of a web site is a person and not a robot program.4

   However, if short text descriptions or low-level image properties
   are the only features available to train an image, otherwise
   irrelevant variations in the position, orientation, or illumination of
   objects in images will make it very difficult to distinguish objects
   that look similar, like a white wolf and the wolf-like white dog called
   a Samoyed. This problem can be addressed by using deep neural
   networks, which exploit the idea that low-level image features can
   be combined into many layers of higher-level ones; edges combine
   to form motifs or patterns, patterns combine to form parts of
   familiar objects, and parts combine to form complete objects. This
   hierarchical composition enables the highest-level representations
   to become insensitive to the lower-level variations that plague the
   other approaches.

   In 2012, when deep learning techniques were applied to a dataset
   of about a million images that contained a thousand different object
   categories, they reduced the error rate by half. This spectacular
   breakthrough, and the fact that the deep learning techniques that
   derive layers of features from the input data are completely general,
   rapidly caused deep learning to be applied to many other domains
   with high-dimensional data. Facebook uses deep learning to identify
   people in photos, Google uses it for speech recognition and
   language translation, and rapid captioning for images and video are
   on the horizon. Wearable computers might use it to layer useful

  Describing Music

   Describing music presents challenges quite different from those
   involved in describing texts or images. Poems and paintings are
   tangible things that we can look at and contemplate, while the
   aural nature of music means that it is a fleeting phenomenon that
   can only be experienced in the performative moment. Even musical
   scores and recordings, while as much tangible things as paintings
   and poems, are merely containers that hold the potential for
   musical experience and not the music itself. Most contemporary
   popular music is in the form of songs, in which texts are set to a
   melody and supported by instrumental harmonies. If we want to
   categorize or describe such music by its lyrical content, we can still

5. The key idea that made deep learning possible is the use
   of "backpropagation" to adjust the weights on features
   by working backwards from the output (the object
   classification produced by the network) all the way back
   to the input. Mathematically-sophisticated readers can
   find a concise explanation and history of deep learning
   in (LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015). LeCun and Hinton
   were part of research teams that independently invented
   backpropagation in the mid 1980s. Today, LeCun heads
   Facebook's research group on artificial intelligence, and
   Hinton has a similar role at Google.

                                                          Describing Non-text Resources | 501
   rely on methods for describing texts. But if we want to describe the
   music itself, we need to take a somewhat different approach.

   Several people and companies working in multimedia have explored
   different processes for how songs are described. On the heavily
   technological side, software applications such as Shazam and
   Midomi can create a content-based audio fingerprint from a snippet
   of music. Audio fingerprinting renders a digital description of a
   piece of music, which a computer can then interpret and compare
   to other digital descriptions in a library.6

   On the face of it, contemporary music streaming services represent
   the apex of music classification and description. Pandora, for
   example, employs trained musicologists to listen to the music and
   then categorize the genres and musical materials according to a
   highly controlled musical vocabulary. The resulting algorithm, the
   "Music Genome," can essentially learn to define a listener's musical
   tastes by means of this musical tagging, and can then use that
   information to suggest other music with similar characteristics.7

   But musicians have been thinking about how to describe music
   for centuries, and while the Music Genome certainly brims with
   complexity, it pales in comparison to the sophistication of the much
   older "pen-and-paper" methods from which it derives.
   Ethnomusicology (loosely defined as the study of global musical
   practices in their social contexts) has arguably made greater strides
   towards comprehensive descriptions of musical resources than any
   other field of musicological study. Since the late 19th century,
   ethnomusicologists have created complex methods of notation and

   stylistic taxonomies to capture and categorize the music of both
   Western and non-Western cultures.
   Hungarian composer and scholar Béla Bartók collected and
   transcribed thousands of Eastern European folk songs to which
   he applied a complex classification system to group them into
   "families" derived from melodic archetypes. More recently,
   American ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax's Cantometrics project
   classified songs collected from around the word according to 37
   style factors in an effort to create a common controlled vocabulary
   that would facilitate cross-cultural comparison and analysis.8

8. Bartók's method for transcribing and categorizing each
   tune into families was as follows:

     1. All tunes end on the note "g" for ease of comparison;

    2. Tunes are divided and categorized according to the
         number of lines;

    3. Tunes are classified according to the placement of
         the final note of various tune lines with the final note
         indicated by figures;

    4. Sub-groups are categorized according to the number
         of syllables to each tune line;

    5. Tunes are categorized according to their melodic
         compass with the lowest and highest note of each
         tune labeled.

It is not difficult to see the parallels of this method with
the Pandora algorithm, as well as the greater level of
descriptive detail afforded by Bartók's method. See
(Bartók 1981).

Every folk song collection contains several examples of
the same song performed at various times by the same
singer or by many different singers. Often these different
songs (or "variants") are so drastically different that we
begin to ask the question: "At what point does a variant
become a completely new piece of music?" Up until the
beginning of the twentieth-century, many scholars
believed that variants were simply poor performances by
folk singers who were attempting to recreate a pristine,
archetypical version of the song.

It wasn't until Australian collector Percy Grainger
suggested that variants represented a vital and dynamic
performance practice among folk singers that the idea of
variants as flawed archetypes gave way to one in which all
performances were unique entities unto themselves that
possess what Wittgenstein would eventually refer to as
"family resemblances" with one another. (Grainger 1908)

More recently, Newsweek magazine compiled a list of 60
different versions of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah," many
of which differ so drastically from Cohen's original as
to seem to be completely different songs with only the

          A DJ Describes and Organizes Music

          Casual music fans might describe their music using
       the names of the songs or performers and might
       organize it according to genres like "Pop," "Rock," or
       "Classical." A professional DJ, however, emphasizes
       different properties, especially the beats per minute of
       the music.

          This annotated photo shows a portion of the music

most rudimentary family resemblances. Does "Hallelujah"
as a "work" even exist anymore? Or is it simply an idea,
a potential for music that only exists during each varied
performance? (http://www.newsweek.com/60-versions-

              (Photo and annotation by Matt Earp. Used with
           permission.)

   On a more granular level, musicians are endlessly innovative in
   finding ways to categorize, describe, and analyze not simply large-
   scale musical genres, but the notes themselves. In the
   accompanying photo showing the record collection of professional
   DJ "Kid Kameleon," we see that the records are arranged not simply
   by genre, but also by beats-per-minute (BPM). For Kid Kameleon,
   these records represent the resources of his musical creative
   process, and arranging them by BPM allows him to pull exactly the
   correct musical material he needs to keep the music flowing during
   a performance. His classification system is therefore a taxonomy
   that moves from the broad strokes of genre down to the fine grains
   of specific arrangements of notes and rhythms. This photo is not
   simply a picture of a record collection: it is a visual representation
   of an artist's creative process.9

9. This method of organizing musical resources for ready
   access (physically and cognitively) is one that has both
   an illustrious past and a fascinating future. Musicologist
   Robert Gjerdingen has studied the way in which
   composers in 18th century Naples learned their art by
   studying an organized system of musical schemata that
   could be expanded, strung together, and varied to create
   an endless series of pleasing compositions in the galant

   Describing Video

     Video is yet another resource domain where work to create
     resource descriptions to make search more effective is ongoing.
     Video analytics techniques can segment a video into shorter clips
     described according to their color, direction of motion, size of
     objects, and other characteristics. Identifying anomalous events and
     faces of people in video has obvious applications in security and
     surveillance.10 Identifying specific content details about a video

    style of the period (Gjerdingen 2007). A current approach
    to this same idea can be found in the work of composer
    David Cope, whose Experiments in Musical Intelligence
    software ("Emmy" and the next-generation "Emily
    Howell") can analyze existing music, break its musical
    resources down into identifiable schema, and then
    recombine those schema to create a musical output in
    the style of the original musical input (Cope 2001). Emmy
    can recombine these elements in millions of different
    ways to produce compelling, convincing, and somewhat
    unnerving works in the style of any composer whose
    music has been fed to her. Different though they may
    all seem, 18th century Neapolitans, Kid Kameleon, and
    Emmy all represent a creative process dependent on the
    input, description, organization, recombination, and
    output of musical resources.

    it is possible that image signature-matching algorithms will take
    over in the future because they would enable automated ad
    placement in videos and television.11

11. One organization that sees a future in assembling better
   descriptions of video content is the United States'
   National Football League (NFL), whose vast library of clips
   can not only be used to gather plays for highlight reels
   and specials but can also be monetized by pointing out
   when key advertisers' products appear on film. Currently,
   labeling the video requires a person to watch the scenes
   and tag elements of each frame, but once those tags have
   been created and sequenced along with the video, they
   can be more easily searched in computerized, automated
   ways (Buhrmester 2007).

Five

  · How are resource descriptions used in information retrieval?

      Information retrieval is characterized as comparing a
      description of a user's needs with descriptions of the resources
      that might satisfy them. Different property descriptions
      determine the comparison algorithms and the way in which
      relevance or similarity of descriptions is determined.

      (See "Naming {and, or, vs.} Describing")

  · What are some of the different names given to the terms used
      in resource descriptions?

      In different contexts, the terms in resource descriptions are
      called keywords, index terms, attributes, attribute values,
      elements, data elements, data values, or "the vocabulary," labels,
      or tags.

      (See ""Description" as an Inclusive Term")

  · What is a descriptor?

      In the library science context of bibliographic description, a
      descriptor is one of the terms in a carefully designed language
      that can be assigned to a resource to designate its properties,
      characteristics, or meaning, or its relationships with other
      resources.

      (See ""Description" as an Inclusive Term")

  · What is a bibliographic record?

      A bibliographic description of an information resource is most

                                                            Key Points in Chapter Five | 509
      commonly realized as a structured record in a standard format
      that describes a specific resource.

      (See "Bibliographic Descriptions")

  · What is the relationship between metadata and bibliographic
      description?

      Metadata is structured description for information resources
      of any kind, which makes it a superset of bibliographic
      description.

      (See "Metadata")

  · What is a database schema?

      A relational database schema is designed to restrict resource
      descriptions to be simple and completely regular sets of
      attribute-value pairs.

      (See "Metadata")

  · What is RDF?

      The Resource Description Framework(RDF) is a language for
      making computer-processable statements about web resources
      that is the foundation for the vision of the Semantic Web.

      (See "Resource Description Framework (RDF)")

  · What is an aggregated information object?

      An aggregation is a set of information objects that, when
      considered together, compose another named information
      object.

      (See "Resource Description Framework (RDF)")

  · What is the dominant historical framework for resource
      description? What is an alternative?

510 | Key Points in Chapter Five
   The dominant historical view treats resource descriptions as a
   package of statements, an alternate framework focuses on each
   individual description or assertion about a single resource.

   (See "Frameworks for Resource Description")

· What are the key principles guiding design of a description
   vocabulary?

   Design of the description vocabulary should focus on the user
   of the descriptions. Svenonius proposes five principles for a
   description vocabulary: user convenience, representation,
   sufficiency and necessity, standardization, and integration.

   (See "The Process of Describing Resources")

· What is the disciplined process for describing resources?

   The process of describing resources involves several
   interdependent and iterative steps, including determining
   scope, focus and purposes, identifying resource properties,
   designing the description vocabulary, designing the description
   form and implementation, and creating and evaluating the
   descriptions.

   (See "The Process of Describing Resources" and Figure: The
   Process of Describing Resources.)

· Why are schemas or models important in resource description?

   A collection of resource descriptions is vastly more useful when
   every resource is described using common description
   elements or terms that apply to every resource; this
   specification is most often called a schema or model.

   (See "Abstraction in Resource Description")

· What are XML schemas used for?

      XML schemas are often used to define web forms that capture
      resource instances, and are also used to describe the interfaces
      to web services and other computational resources.

      (See "Abstraction in Resource Description")

  · What is the value of standardization of resource description?

      When the task of resource description is standardized, the work
      can be distributed among many describers whose results are
      shared. This is the principle on which centralized bibliographic
      description has been based for a century.

      (See "Scope, Scale, and Resource Description")

  · How does resource description support selection?

      Resource description can facilitate the discovery of resources,
      specify their capabilities and compatibility, authenticate them,
      and indicate their appraised value.

      (See "Resource Description to Support Selection")

  · What are the four generic purposes for resource descriptions?

      The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records(FRBR)
      presents four purposes that apply generically: Finding,
      Identifying, Selecting, and Obtaining resources.

      (See "Resource Description to Support Interactions")

  · What kinds of resource descriptions are most important in
      interactions with digital resources?

      The variety and functions of the interactions with digital
      resources depends on the richness of their structural, semantic,
      and format description.

      (See "Resource Description to Support Interactions")

512 | Key Points in Chapter Five
· What's the relationship between sensemaking and organizing?

   Sensemaking is the foundation of organizing, as it is the basic
   human activity of making sense of the world. Sensemaking
   encompasses the range of organizing activities from the very
   informal and personal to systematic scientific processes.

   (See "Resource Description for Sensemaking and Science")

· What is the value of having multiple descriptions for the sane
   resource?

   Any particular resource might need many resource
   descriptions, all of which relate to different properties,
   depending on the interactions that need to be supported and
   the context in which they take place.

   (See "Identifying Properties")

· What are the two important dimensions for understanding
   resource properties?

   Two important dimensions for understanding and contrasting
   resource properties are whether the properties are intrinsically
   or extrinsically associated with the resource, and whether the
   properties are static or dynamic.

   (See "Identifying Properties")

· Why are some resource properties called "latent" ones?

   Recent advances in computing technology and data science
   techniques are making it possible to discover or create
   resource properties that are called "latent" because they are
   inferred rather than observed.

   (See the sidebar, Latent Feature Creation and Netflix
   Recommendations)

· What is a controlled vocabulary?

A controlled vocabulary is a fixed or closed set of description
terms in some domain with precise definitions that is used
instead of the vocabulary that people would otherwise use. A
controlled vocabulary reduces synonymy and homonymy.

· Who should create resource descriptions?

Professionally created resource descriptions, author or user
created descriptions, and computational or automated
descriptions each have strengths and limitations that impose
tradeoffs.

(See "Creating Resource Descriptions")

   descriptions?

The most commonly used            criteria for evaluating resource
descriptions are accuracy,        completeness, and consistency.
Other typical criteria are        timeliness, interoperability, and
usability.

   We consider a family to be a collection of people affiliated by some
   connections, such as common ancestors or a common residence.
   The Simpson family includes a man named Homer and a woman
   named Marge, the married parents of three sibling children, a boy
   named Bart and two girls, Lisa and Maggie. This magical family
   speaks many languages, but most often uses the language of the
   local television station. In the English-speaking Simpson family, the
   boy describes his parents as his father and mother and his two
   siblings as his sisters. In the Spanish speaking Simpson family he
   refers to his parents as su padre y su madre and his sisters are las
   hermanas. In the Chinese Simpson family the sisters refer to each
   other according to their relative ages; Lisa, the elder, as ji jie and,
   Maggie, the younger, as mèi mei.1

   Kinship relationships are ubiquitous and widely studied, and the
   names and significance of kinship relations like "is parent of" or "is
   sibling of" are familiar ones, making kinship a good starting point for

   understanding relationships in organizing systems.2 An organizing
   system can make use of existing relationships among resources,
   or it can create relationships by applying organizing principles to
   arrange the resources. Organizing systems for digital resources or
   digital description resources are the most likely to rely on explicit
   relationships to enable interactions with the resources.

              Because the Simpson family is known throughout the

   association having a particular significance.3 "The things being
   associated," the components of the relationship, are people in
   kinship relationships but more generally can be any type of resource
   (Resources in Organizing Systems), when we relate one resource
   instance to another. When we describe a resource (Resource
   Description and Metadata), the components of the relationship are
   a primary resource and a description resource. If we specify sets
   of relationships that go together, we are using these common
   relationships to define resource types or classes, which more
   generally are called categories (Categorization: Describing Resource
   Classes and Types). We can then use resource types as one or both
   the components of a relationship when we want to further describe
   the resource type or to assert how two resource types go together
   to facilitate our interactions with them.

   We begin with a more complete definition of relationship and
   introduce five perspectives for analyzing them: semantic, lexical,
   structural, architectural, and implementation. We then discuss each
   perspective, introducing the issues that each emphasizes, and the
   specialized vocabulary needed to describe and analyze relationships
   from that point of view. We apply these perspectives and vocabulary

37. Describing Relationships:

An Overview

The concept of a relationship is pervasive in human societies in
both informal and formal senses. Humans are inescapably related
to generations of ancestors, and in most cases they also have social
networks of friends, co-workers, and casual acquaintances to whom
they are related in various ways. We often hear that our access
to information, money, jobs, and political power is all about "who
you know," so we strive to "network" with other people to build
relationships that might help us expand our access. In information
systems, relationships between resources embody the organization
that enables finding, selection, retrieval, and other interactions.

Most organizing systems are based on many relationships to enable
the system to satisfy some intentional purposes with individual
resources or the collection as a whole. In the domain of information
resources, common resources include web pages, journal articles,
books, datasets, metadata records, and XML documents, among
many others. Important relationships in the information domain
that facilitate purposes like finding, identifying, and selecting
resources include "is the author of," "is published by," "has
publication date," "is derived from," "has subject keyword," "is
related to," and many others.

When we talk about relationships we specify both the resources
that are associated along with a name or statement about the reason
for the association. Just identifying the resources involved is not
enough because several different relationships can exist among the
same resources; the same person can be your brother, your
employer, and your landlord. Furthermore, for many relationships
the directionality or ordering of the participants in a relationship
statement matters; the person who is your employer gives a

                                                                  Describing Relationships: An
                                                                                     Overview | 521
paycheck to you, not vice versa. Kent points out that when we
describe a relationship we sometimes use whole phrases, such as
"is-employed-by," if our language does not contain a single word
that expresses the meaning of the relationship.

        Navigating This
            Chapter

          In this chapter, we analyze relationships from several
       different perspectives:

          Semantic perspective
                The semantic perspective is the most essential

             one; it characterizes the meaning of the association
             between resources. ("The Semantic Perspective")
          Lexical perspective

                The lexical perspective focuses on how the
             conceptual description of a relationship is
             expressed using words in a specific language. ("The
             Lexical Perspective")

522 | Describing Relationships: An Overview
Structural perspective
      The structural perspective analyzes the actual

   patterns of association, arrangement, proximity, or
   connection between resources. ("The Structural
   Perspective")
Architectural perspective

      The architectural perspective emphasizes the
   number and abstraction level of the components of
   a relationship, which together characterize its
   complexity. ("The Architectural Perspective")
Implementation perspective

      The implementation perspective considers how
   the relationship is implemented in a particular
   notation and syntax and the manner in which
   relationships are arranged and stored in some
   technology environment. ("The Implementation
   Perspective ")

                               Describing Relationships: An Overview | 523
 38. The Semantic Perspective

   To describe relationships among resources, we need to understand
   what the relations mean. This semantic perspective is the essence
   of relationships and explains why the resources are related, relying
   on information that is not directly available from perceiving the
   resources. In our Simpson family example, we noted that Homer
   and Marge are related by marriage, and also by their relationship as
   parents of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, and none of these relationships
   are directly perceivable. This means that "Homer is married to
   Marge" is a semantic assertion, but "Homer is standing next to
   Marge" is not.1

   Semantic relationships are commonly expressed with a predicate
   with one or more arguments. A predicate is a verb phrase template
   for specifying properties of objects or a relationship among objects.
   In many relationships the predicate is an action or association that
   involves multiple participants that must be of particular types, and
   the arguments define the different roles of the participants.2

1. "Semantic" is usually defined as "relating to meaning or
   language" and that does not seem helpful here.

2. For decades important and vexing questions have been
   raised about the specificity of these predicate-argument
   associations and how or when the semantic constraints
   they embody combine with syntactic and contextual
   constraints during the process of comprehending
   language. Consider how "While in the operating room,
   the surgeon used a knife to cut the ____" generates a

    524 | The Semantic Perspective
We can express the relationship between Homer and Marge
Simpson using a predicate(argument(s)) syntax as follows:

is-married-to (Homer Simpson, Marge Simpson)

The sequence, type, and role of the arguments are an essential part
of the relationship expression. The sequence and role are explicitly
distinguished when predicates that take two arguments are
expressed using a subject-predicate-object syntax that is often called
a triple because of its three parts:

Homer Simpson  is-married-to  Marge Simpson

However, we have not yet specified what the "is-married-to"
relationship means. People can demonstrate their understanding
of "is-married-to" by realizing that alternative and semantically
equivalent expressions of the relationship between Homer and
Marge might be:

Homer Simpson  is-married-to  Marge Simpson
Homer Simpson  is-the-husband-of  Marge Simpson
Marge Simpson  is-married-to  Homer Simpson
Marge Simpson  is-the-wife-of  Homer Simpson

Going one step further, we could say that people understand the
equivalence of these different expressions of the relationship
because they have semantic and linguistic knowledge that relates
some representation of "married," "husband," "wife," and other
words. None of that knowledge is visible in the expressions of the
relationships so far, all of which specify concrete relationships
about individuals and not abstract relationships between resource

different expectancy from the same predicate and agent
in "While at the fancy restaurant, the surgeon used a
knife to cut the ____." See (Elman 2009).

                                                             The Semantic Perspective | 525
   classes or concepts. We have simply pushed the problem of what it
   means to understand the expressions into the mind of the person
   doing the understanding.

   We can be more rigorous and define the words used in these
   expressions so they are "in the world" rather than just "in the mind"
   of the person understanding them. We can write definitions about
   these resource classes:

     · The conventional or traditional marriage relationship is a
         consensual lifetime association between a husband and a wife,
         which is sanctioned by law and often by religious ceremonies;

     · A husband is a male lifetime partner considered in relation to
         his wife; and

     · A wife is a female lifetime partner considered in relation to her
         husband.3

   Definitions like these help a person learn and make some sense of
   the relationship expressions involving Homer and Marge. However,
   these definitions are not in a form that would enable someone
   to completely understand the Homer and Marge expressions; they
   rely on other undefined terms (consensual, law, lifetime, etc.), and
   they do not state the relationships among the concepts in the
   definitions.4 Furthermore, for a computer to understand the

3. This book is not the place for the debate over the
   definition of marriage. We are not bigots; we just do not
   need this discussion here. If these definitions upset you
   here, you will feel better in "Degree".

4. Typically, when people use language they operate on the

    526 | The Semantic Perspective
expressions, it needs a computer-processable representation of the
relationships among words and meanings that makes every
important semantic assumption and property precise and explicit.
We will see what this takes starting in the next section.

Types of Semantic Relationships

In this discussion we will use entity type, class, concept, and resource
type as synonyms. Entity type and class are conventional terms in
data modeling and database design, concept is the conventional
term in computational or cognitive modeling, and we use resource
type when we discuss organizing systems. Similarly, we will use
entity occurrence, instance, and resource instance when we refer to
one thing rather than to a class or type of them.

There is no real consensus on how to categorize semantic
relationships, but these three broad categories are reasonable for
our purposes:

assumption that everyone shares their model of the
world, providing the common ground that enables them
to communicate. As we saw in Resources in Organizing
Systems and Resource Description and Metadata, (because
of the vocabulary problem and different purposes for
using resources and language) this assumption is often
wrong, This paves the way for serious
misunderstandings, since what is assumed to be shared
knowledge may not really be shared or understood the
same way.

                                                              The Semantic Perspective | 527
   Inclusion Relationship
         One entity type contains or is comprised of other entity types;
         often expressed using "is-a," "is-a-type-of," "is-part-of," or "is-
         in" predicates.

   Attribution Relationship
         Asserting or assigning values to properties; the predicate
         depends on the property: "is-the-author-of," "is-married-to,"
         "is-employed-by," etc.

   Possession Relationship
         Asserting ownership or control of a resource; often expressed
         using a "has" predicate, such as "has-serial-number-plate."5

   All of these are fundamental in organizing systems, both for
   describing and arranging resources themselves, and for describing
   the relationships among resources and resource descriptions.

  Inclusion

   There are three different types of inclusion relationships: class
   inclusion, meronymic inclusion, and topological inclusion. All three
   are commonly used in organizing systems.
   Class inclusion is the fundamental and familiar "is-a," "is-a-type-of,"
   or "subset" relationship between two entity types or classes where
   one is contained in and thus more specific than the other more
   generic one.

5. See (Chaffin and Herrmann 1984), (Storey 1993).

    528 | The Semantic Perspective
Meat  is-a  Food
A set of interconnected class inclusion relationships creates a
hierarchy, which is often called a taxonomy.
Meat  is-a  Food
Dairy Product  is-a  Food
Cereal  is-a  Food
Vegetable  is-a  Food
Beef  is-a  Meat
Pork  is-a  Meat
Chicken  is-a  Meat
Ground Beef  is-a  Beef
Steak  is-a  Beef
...
A visual depiction of the taxonomy makes the class hierarchy easier
to perceive. See Figure: A Partial Taxonomy of Food.

                                                             The Semantic Perspective | 529
A partial taxonomy of food distinguishes the categories or prepared
food from meat, distinguishes chicken, beef, and pork as
subcategories of meat, and distinguishes ground beef and steak as
subcategories of beef.

Each level in a taxonomy subdivides the class above it into sub-
classes, and each sub-class is further subdivided until the
differences that remain among the members of each class no longer
matter for the interactions the organizing system needs to support.
We discuss the design of hierarchical organizing systems in
"Principles for Creating Categories", "Principles for Creating
Categories."

All of the examples in the current section have expressed abstract

530 | The Semantic Perspective
   relationships between classes, in contrast to the earlier concrete
   ones about Homer and Marge, which expressed relationships
   between specific people. Homer and Marge are instances of classes
   like "married people," "husbands," and "wives." When we make an
   assertion that a particular instance is a member of class, we are
   classifying the instance. Classification is a class inclusion
   relationship between an instance and a class, rather than between
   two classes. (We discuss Classification in detail in Classification:
   Assigning Resources to Categories.)

   Homer Simpson  is-a  Husband

   This is just the lowest level of the class hierarchy in which Homer
   is located at the very bottom; he is also a man, a human being,
   and a living organism (in cartoon land, at least).6 You might now
   remember the bibliographic class inclusion hierarchy we discussed
   in "Identity and Bibliographic Resources"; a specific physical item
   like your dog-eared copy of Macbeth is also a particular
   manifestation in some format or genre, and this expression is one of
   many for the abstract work.

   instance is-member-of  class

   Part-whole inclusion or meronymic inclusion is a second type of
   inclusion relationship. It is usually expressed using "is-part-of," "is-
   partly," or with other similar predicate expressions. Winston,

6. Which of these classifications is most relevant depends
   on the context. In addition, there might be other Homer
   Simpsons who are not cartoon characters or who are
   not married, so we might have to disambiguate this
   homonymy to make sure we referring to the intended
   Homer Simpson.

                                                                  The Semantic Perspective | 531
   Chaffin, and Herrmann identified six distinct types of part-whole
   relationships. Their meaning subtly differs depending on whether
   the part is separately identifiable and whether the part is essential
   to the whole.7

     · Component-Object is the relationship type when the part is a
         separate component that is arranged or assembled with other
         components to create a larger resource. In "Resources with
         Parts", "Resources with Parts," we used as an example the
         component-object relationship between an engine and a car:

         The Engine  is-part-of  the Car

         The components of this type of part-whole relationship need
         not be physical objects; "Germany is part of the European
         Union" expresses a component-object relationship. What
         matters is that the component is identifiable on its own as an
         integral entity and that the components follow some kind of
         patterned organization or structure when they form the whole.
         Together the parts form a composition, and the parts
         collectively form the whole. A car that lacks the engine part will
         not work.

     · Member-Collection is the part-whole relationship type where
         "is-part-of" means "belongs-to," a weaker kind of association
         than component-object because there is no assumption that
         the component has a specific role or function in the whole.

         The Book  is-part-of  the Library

         The members of the collection exist independently of the

7. (Winston, Chaffin, and Herman 1987).

   532 | The Semantic Perspective
   whole; if the whole ceases to exist the individual resources still
   exist.

· Portion-Mass is the relationship type when all the parts are
   similar to each other and to the whole, unlike either of the
   previous types where engines are not tires or cars, and books
   are not like record albums or libraries.
   The Slice  is-part-of  the Pie

· Stuff-Object relationships are most often expressed using "is-
   partly" or "is-made-of" and are distinguishable from
   component-object ones because the stuff cannot be separated
   from the object without altering its identity. The stuff is not
   a separate ingredient that is used to make the object; it is a
   constituent of it once it is made.
   Wine  is-partly  Alcohol

· Place-Area relationships exist between areas and specific places
   or locations within them. Like members of collections, places
   have no particular functional contribution to the whole.
   The Everglades  are-part-of  Florida

· Feature-Activity is a relationship type in which the components
   are stages, phases, or sub activities that take place over time.
   This relationship is similar to component-object in that the
   components in the whole are arranged according to a structure
   or pattern.
   Overtime  is-part-of  a Football Game

                                                           The Semantic Perspective | 533
   A seventh type of part-whole relationship called Phase-Activity was
   proposed by Storey.8

     · Phase-Activity is similar to feature-activity except that the
         phases do not make sense as standalone activities without the
         context provided by the activity as a whole.
         Paying  is-part-of  Shopping

   Topological, Locative and Temporal Inclusion is a third type of
   inclusion relationship between a container, area, or temporal
   duration and what it surrounds or contains. It is most often
   expressed using "is-in" as the relationship. However, the entity that
   is contained or surrounded is not a part of the including one, so this
   is not a part-whole relationship.
   The Vatican City  is-in  Italy
   The meeting  is-in  the afternoon

  Attribution

   In contrast to inclusion expressions that state relationships
   between resources, attribution relationships assert or assign values
   to properties for a particular resource. In Resource Description and
   Metadata we used "attribute" to mean "an indivisible part of a
   resource description" and treated it as a synonym of "property."
   We now need to be more precise and carefully distinguish between
   the type of the attribute and the value that it has. For example, the
   color of any object is an attribute of the object, and the value of that
   attribute might be "green."

8. (Storey 1993).

    534 | The Semantic Perspective
Some frameworks for semantic modeling define "attribute" very
narrowly, restricting it to expressions with predicates with only one
argument to assert properties of a single resource, distinguishing
them from relationships between resources or resource types that
require two arguments:9

Martin the Gecko  is-small
Martin the Gecko  is-green

However, it is always possible to express statements like these in
ways that make them into relationships with two arguments:

Martin  has-size  small
Martin  has-skin-color  green

Dedre Gentner notes that this supposed distinction between one-
predicate attributes and two-predicate relationships depends on
context.10

For example, small can be viewed as an attribute, X  is-small, or
as a relationship between X and some standard or reference Y, X 
is-smaller-than  Y.

Another somewhat tricky aspect of attribution relationships is that
from a semantic perspective, there are often many different ways of
expressing equivalent attribute values.

9. Martin is the animated gecko who is the advertising
   spokesman for Geico Insurance (http://www.geico.com/).
   Martin's wit and cockney accent make him engaging and
   memorable, and a few years ago he was voted the favorite
   advertising icon in the US.

10. (Gentner 1983).

                     The Semantic Perspective | 535
Martin  has-size  6 inches
Martin  has size  152 mm

These two statements express the idea that Martin is small.
However, many implementations of attribution relationships treat
the attribute values literally. This means that unless we can process
these two statements using another relationship that expresses the
conversion of inches to mm, the two statements could be
interpreted as saying different things about Martin's size.

Finally, we note that we can express attribution relationships about
other relationships, like the date a relationship was established.
Homer and Marge Simpson's wedding anniversary is an attribute of
their "is-married-to" relationship.

The semantic distinctions between attributes and other types of
relationships are not strong ones, but they can be made clearer
by implementation choices. For example, XML attributes are tightly
coupled to a containing element, and their literal values are limited
to atomic items of information. In contrast, inclusion relationships
are expressed by literal containment of one XML element by
another.

Possession

A third distinct category of semantic relationships is that of
possession. Possession relationships can seem superficially like part-
whole ones:

Bob  has  a car
A car  has  wheels

However, in the second of these relationships "has" is an elliptical
form of "has as a part," expressing a part-whole relationship rather
that one of possession.

536 | The Semantic Perspective
    The concept of possession is especially important in institutional
    organizing systems, where questions of ownership, control,
    responsibility and transfers of ownership, control, and
    responsibility can be fundamental parts of the interactions they
    support. However, possession is a complex notion, inherently
    connected to societal norms and conventions about property and
    kinship, making it messier than institutional processes might like.
    Possession relationships also imply duration or persistence, and are
    often difficult to distinguish from relationships based on habitual
    location or practice. Miller and Johnson-Laird illustrate the complex
    nature of possession relationships with this sentence, which
    expresses three different types of them:11

          He owns an umbrella but she's borrowed it, though she doesn't
          have it with her.

  Properties of Semantic Relationships

    Semantic relationships can have numerous special properties that
    help explain what they mean and especially how they relate to each
    other. In the following sections we briefly explain those that are
    most important in systems for organizing resources and resource
    descriptions.

   Symmetry

    In most relationships the order in which the subject and object

11. (Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976, p 565).

                                                                   The Semantic Perspective | 537
arguments are expressed is central to the meaning of the
relationship. If X has a relationship with Y, it is usually not the
case that Y has the same relationship with X. For example, because
"is-parent-of" is an asymmetric relationship, only the first of these
relationships holds:

Homer Simpson  is-parent-of  Bart Simpson (TRUE)
Bart Simpson  is-parent-of  Homer Simpson (NOT TRUE)

In contrast, some relationships are symmetric or bi-directional, and
reversing the order of the arguments of the relationship predicate
does not change the meaning. As we noted earlier, these two
statements are semantically equivalent because "is-married-to" is
symmetric:

Homer Simpson  is-married-to  Marge Simpson
Marge Simpson  is-married-to  Homer Simpson

We can represent the symmetric and bi-directional nature of these
relationships by using a double-headed arrow:

Homer Simpson  is-married-to  Marge Simpson

Transitivity

Transitivity is another property that can apply to semantic
relationships. When a relationship is transitive, if X and Y have a
relationship, and Y and Z have the same relationship, then X also
has the relationship with Z. Any relationship based on ordering is
transitive, which includes numerical, alphabetic, and chronological
ones as well as those that imply qualitative or quantitative
measurement. Because "is-taller-than" is transitive:

Homer Simpson  is-taller-than  Bart Simpson
Bart Simpson  is-taller-than  Maggie Simpson

538 | The Semantic Perspective
     implies that:
     Homer Simpson  is-taller-than  Maggie Simpson

     Inclusion relationships are inherently transitive, because just as "is-
     taller-than" is an assertion about relative physical size, "is-a-type of"
     and "is-part-of" are assertions about the relative sizes of abstract
     classes or categories. An example of transitivity in part-whole or
     meronymic relationships is: (1) the carburetor is part of the engine,
     (2) the engine is part of the car, (3) therefore, the carburetor is part
     of the car. 12

     Transitive relationships enable inferences about class membership
     or properties, and allow organizing systems to be more efficient
     in how they represent them since transitivity enables implicit
     relationships to be made explicit only when they are needed.

   Equivalence

     Any relationship that is both symmetric and transitive is an
     equivalence relationship; "is-equal-to" is obviously an equivalence
     relationship because if A=B then B=A and if A=B and B=C, then A=C.
     Other relationships can be equivalent without meaning "exactly
     equal," as is the relationship of "is-congruent-to" for all triangles.

     We often need to assert that a particular class or property has the
     same meaning as another class or property or that it is generally

12. Some people have argued that meronomy is not
    transitive, but a closer look at their supposed counter-
    examples suggests otherwise. See Section 5 in (Winston,
    Chaffin, and Herman 1987).

                                                                   The Semantic Perspective | 539
substitutable for it. We make this explicit with an equivalence
relationship.
Sister (English)  is-equivalent-to  Hermana (Spanish)

Inverse

For asymmetric relationships, it is often useful to be explicit about
the meaning of the relationship when the order of the arguments
in the relationship is reversed. The resulting relationship is called
the inverse or the converse of the first relationship. If an organizing
system explicitly represents that:
Is-child-of  is-the-inverse-of  Is-parent-of
We can then conclude that:
Bart Simpson  is-child-of  Homer Simpson

Ontologies

We now have described types and properties of semantic
relationships in enough detail to return to the challenge we posed
earlier: what information is required to fully understand
relationships? This question has been asked and debated for
decades and we will not pretend to answer it to any extent here.
However, we can sketch out some of the basic parts of the solution.
Let us begin by recalling that a taxonomy captures a system of
class inclusion relationships in some domain. But as we have seen,
there are a great many kinds of relationships that are not about
class inclusion. All of these other types of relationships represent
knowledge about the domain that is potentially needed to

540 | The Semantic Perspective
understand statements about it and to make sense when more than
one domain of resources or activities comes together.
For example, in the food domain whose partial taxonomy appears
in Figure: A Partial Ontology of Food., we can assert relationships
about properties of classes and instances, express equivalences
about them, and otherwise enhance the representation of the food
domain to create a complex network of relationships. In addition,
the food domain intersects with food preparation, agriculture,
commerce, and many other domains. We also need to express the
relationships among these domains to fully understand any of them.
Grilling  is-a-type-of  Food Preparation
Temperature  is-a-measure-of  Grilling
Hamburger  is-equivalent-to  Ground Beef
Hamburger  is-prepared-by  Grilling
Hamburger Sandwich  is-a-type-of  Prepared Food
Rare  is-a  State of Food Preparation
Well-done  is-a  State of Food Preparation
Meat  is-preserved-by  Freezing

A partial ontology of food overlays the taxonomy of food with
statements that make assertions about categories, instances, and
relationships in the food domain. Example statements might be that
"Grilling is a type of food preparation," that "Meat is preserved by
freezing," and that "Hamburger is equivalent to ground beef."

In this simple example we see that class inclusion relationships form
a kind of backbone to which other kinds of relationships attach.
We also see that there are many potentially relevant assertions
that together represent the knowledge that just about everyone
knows about food and related domains. A network of relationships

542 | The Semantic Perspective
     like these creates a resource that is called an ontology.13 A visual
     depiction of the ontology illustrates this idea that it has a taxonomy
     as its conceptual scaffold. (See Figure: A Partial Ontology of Food.)

     There are numerous formats for expressing ontologies, but many of
     them have recently converged to or are based on the Web Ontology
     Language(OWL), developed by the W3C. OWL ontologies use a
     formal logic-based language that builds on RDF ("Resource
     Description Framework (RDF)") to define resource classes and
     assign properties to them in rigorous ways, arrange them in a class
     hierarchy, establish their equivalence, and specify the properties of
     relationships.14

     Ontologies are essential parts in some organizing systems,
     especially information-intensive ones where the scope and scale
     of the resources require an extensive and controlled description
     vocabulary. (See "The Process of Describing Resources".) The most
     extensive ontology ever created is Cyc, born in 1984 as an artificial
     intelligence research project. Three decades later, the latest version

13. ontology is a branch of philosophy concerned with what
    exists in reality and the general features and relations
    of whatever that might be (Hofweber 2009). Computer
    science has adopted "ontology" to refer to any computer-
    processable resource that represents the relationships
    among words and meanings in some knowledge domain.

 39. The Lexical Perspective

   The semantic perspective for analyzing relationships is the
   fundamental one, but it is intrinsically tied to the lexical one
   because a relationship is always expressed using words in a specific
   language. For example, we understand the relationships among the
   concepts or classes of "food," "meat," and "beef" by using the words
   "food," "meat," and "beef" to identify progressively smaller classes of
   edible things in a class hierarchy.

   The connection between concept and words is not so simple. In
   the Simpson family example with which we began this chapter, we
   noted with "father" and "padre" that languages differ in the words
   they use to describe particular kinship relationships. Furthermore,
   we pointed out that cultures differ in which kinship relationships
   are conceptually distinct, so that languages like Chinese make
   distinctions about the relative ages of siblings that are not made in
   English.1

   This is not to suggest that an English speaker cannot notice the
   difference between his older and younger sisters, only that this
   distinction is not lexicalized--captured in a single word--as it is in
   Chinese. This "missing word" in English from the perspective of
   Chinese is called a lexical gap. Exactly when a lexical gap exists
   is sometimes tricky, because it depends on how we define
   "word"--polar bear and sea horse are not lexicalized but they are
   a single meaning-bearing unit because we do not decompose and

1. Languages and cultures differ in how they distinguish
  and describe kinship, so Bart might find the system of
  family organization easier to master in some countries
  and cultures and more difficult in others.

                                                                    The Lexical Perspective | 545
   reassemble meaning from the two separate words. These "lexical
   gaps" differ from language to language, whereas "conceptual
   gaps"--the things we cannot think of or directly experience, like the
   pull of gravity-- may be innate and universal. We revisit this issue as
   "linguistic relativity" in Categorization: Describing Resource Classes
   and Types. 2

   Earlier in this book we discussed the naming of resources ("The
   Problems of Naming") and the design of a vocabulary for resource
   description ("Scope, Scale, and Resource Description"), and we
   explained how increasing the scope and scale of an organizing
   system made it essential to be more systematic and precise in
   assigning names and descriptions. We need to be sure that the
   terms we use to organize resources capture the similarities and
   differences between them well enough to support our interactions
   with them. After our discussion about semantic relationships in this
   chapter, we now have a clearer sense of what is required to bring
   like things together, keep different things separate, and to satisfy
   any other goals for the organizing system.

   For example, if we are organizing cars, buses, bicycles, and sleds,
   all of which are vehicles, there is an important distinction between
   vehicles that are motorized and those that are powered by human
   effort. It might also be useful to distinguish vehicles with wheels
   from those that lack them. Not making these distinctions leaves
   an unbalanced or uneven organizing system for describing the
   semantics of the vehicle domain. However, only the "motorized"
   concept is lexicalized in English, which is why we needed to invent
   the "wheeled vehicle" term in the second case.3

2. (Bentivogli and Pianta 2000).

3. This example comes from (Fellbaum 2010, pages 236-237).
   German has a word Kufenfahrzeug for vehicle on runners.

    546 | The Lexical Perspective
Simply put, we need to use words effectively in organizing systems.
To do that, we need to be careful about how we talk about the
relationships among words and how words relate to concepts.
There are two different contexts for those relationships.

  · First, we need to discuss relationships among the meanings of
      words. ("Relationships among Word Meanings") and the most
      commonly used tool for describing them ("Thesauri").

  · Second, we need to discuss relationships among the form of
      words. ("Relationships among Word Forms")

Relationships among Word Meanings

There are several different types of relationships of word meanings.
Not surprisingly, in most cases they parallel the types of
relationships among concepts that we described in "The Semantic
Perspective".

Hyponymy and Hyperonymy

When words encode the semantic distinctions expressed by class
inclusion, the word for the more specific class in this relationship
is called the hyponym, while the word for the more general class to
which it belongs is called the hypernym. George Miller suggested
an exemplary formula for defining a hyponym as its hypernym
preceded by adjectives or followed by relative clauses that
distinguish it from its co-hyponyms, mutually exclusive subtypes of
the same hypernym.

   hyponym = {adjective+} hypernym {distinguishing clause+}

For example, robin is a hyponym of bird, and could be defined as "a

                                                                 The Lexical Perspective | 547
   migratory bird that has a clear melodious song and a reddish breast
   with gray or black upper plumage." This definition does not describe
   every property of robins, but it is sufficient to differentiate robins
   from bluebirds or eagles.4

  Metonymy

   Part-whole or meronymic semantic relationships have lexical
   analogues in metonomy, when an entity is described by something
   that is contained in or otherwise part of it. A country's capital city or
   a building where its top leaders reside is often used as a metonym
   for the entire government: "The White House announced today..."
   Similarly, important concentrations of business activity are often
   metonyms for their entire industries: "Wall Street was bailed out
   again..."

  Synonymy

   Synonymy is the relationship between words that express the same
   semantic concept. The strictest definition is that synonyms "are
   words that can replace each other in some class of contexts with
   insignificant changes of the whole text's meaning."5 This is an

4. (Miller 1998).

5. (Bolshakov and Gelbukh 2004), p, 314. The quote
   continues "The references to `some class' and to
   `insignificant change' make this definition rather vague,
   but we are not aware of any significantly stricter
   definition. Hence the creation of synonymy dictionaries,

    548 | The Lexical Perspective
extremely hard test to pass, except for acronyms or compound
terms like "USA," "United States," and "United States of America"
that are completely substitutable.

Most synonyms are not absolute synonyms, and instead are
considered propositional synonyms. Propositional synonyms are not
identical in meaning, but they are equivalent enough that
substituting one for the other will not change the truth value of
the sentence. This weaker test lets us treat word as synonyms even
though their meanings subtly differ. For example, if Lisa Simpson
can play the violin, then because "violin" and "fiddle" are
propositional synonyms, no one would disagree with an assertion
that Lisa Simpson can play the fiddle.

An unordered set of synonyms is often called a synset, a term first
used by the WordNet "semantic dictionary" project started in 1985
by George Miller at Princeton.6 Instead of using spelling as the

which are known to be quite large, is rather a matter of
art and insight."

6. George Miller made many important contributions to the

study of mind and language during his long scientific

career. His most famous article, The Magical Number

Seven, Plus or Minus Two (Miller 1956), was seminal in

its proposals about information organization in human

memory, even though it is one of the most misquoted

scientific papers of all time. Relatively late in his career

Miller began the WordNet project to build a semantic

dictionary, which is now an essential resource in natural

language  processing            applications.  See

http://wordnet.princeton.edu/.

                                The Lexical Perspective | 549
   primary organizing principle for words, WordNet uses their
   semantic properties and relationships to create a network that
   captures the idea that words and concepts are an inseparable
   system. Synsets are interconnected by both semantic relationships
   and lexical ones, enabling navigation in either space.7

  Polysemy

   We introduced the lexical relationship of polysemy, when a word
   has several different meanings or senses, in the context of problems
   with names ("Homonymy, Polysemy, and False Cognates"). For
   example, the word "bank" can refer to a: river bank, money bank,
   bank shots in basketball and billiards, an aircraft maneuver, and
   other concepts.8

   Polysemy is represented in WordNet by including a word in multiple

7. This navigation is easiest to carry out using the
   commercial product called "The Visual Thesaurus" at
   http://www.visualthesaurus.com/.

8. These contrasting meanings for "bank" are clear cases of
   polysemy, but there are often much subtler differences in
   meaning that arise from context. The verb "save" seems
   to mean something different in "The shopper saved..."
   versus "The lifeguard saved..." although they overlap in
   some ways. (Fillmore and Atkins 2000) and others have
   proposed definitions of polysemy, but there is no
   rigorous test for determining when word meanings
   diverge sufficiently to be called different senses.

    550 | The Lexical Perspective
   synsets. This enables WordNet to be an extremely useful resource
   for sense disambiguation in natural language processing research
   and applications. When a polysemous word is encountered, it and
   the words that are nearby in the text are looked up in WordNet. By
   following the lexical relationships in the synset hierarchy, a "synset
   distance" can be calculated. The smallest semantic distance
   between the words, which identifies their most semantically
   specific hypernym, can be used to identify the correct sense. For
   example, in the sentence:

     Put the money in the bank

   Two of the three WordNet senses for "money" are:

     1) the most common medium of exchange
     2) the official currency issued by a government or national bank

   and the first two of the ten WordNet senses for "bank" are:

     1) a financial institution that accepts deposits
     2) sloping land, especially the slope beside a body of water

   The synset hierarchies for the two senses of "money" intersect after
   a very short path with the hierarchy for the first sense of "bank," but
   do not intersect with the second sense of "bank" until they reach
   very abstract concepts.9

9. Many techniques for using WordNet to calculate
   measures of semantic similarity have been proposed. See
   (Budanitsky and Hirst 2006).

                                                                     The Lexical Perspective | 551
   Antonymy

     Antonymy is the lexical relationship between two words that have
     opposite meanings. Antonymy is a very salient lexical relationship,
     and for adjectives it is even more powerful than synonymy. In word
     association tests, when the probe word is a familiar adjective, the
     most common response is its antonym; a probe of "good" elicits
     "bad," and vice versa. Like synonymy, antonymy is sometimes exact
     and sometimes more graded.10

     Contrasting or binary antonyms are used in mutually exclusive
     contexts where one or the other word can be used, but never both.
     For example, "alive" and "dead" can never be used at the same time
     to describe the state of some entity, because the meaning of one
     excludes or contradicts the meaning of the other.

     Other antonymic relationships between word pairs are less
     semantically sharp because they can sometimes appear in the same
     context as a result of the broader semantic scope of one of the
     words. "Large" and "small," or "old" and "young" generally suggest
     particular regions on size or age continua, but "how large is it?" or
     "how old is it?" can be asked about resources that are objectively
     small or young.11

10. See (Gross and Miller, 1990).

11. This type of "lexical asymmetry" is called "markedness."
    The broader or dominant term is the unmarked one and
    the narrower one is the marked one. See (Battistella
    1996).

      552 | The Lexical Perspective
   Thesauri

     The words that people naturally use when they describe resources
     reflect their unique experiences and perspectives, and this means
     that people often use different words for the same resource and
     the same words for different ones. Guiding people when they select
     description words from a controlled vocabulary is a partial solution
     to this vocabulary problem ("The Vocabulary Problem") that becomes
     increasingly essential as the scope and scale of the organizing
     system grows. A thesaurus is a reference work that organizes words
     according to their semantic and lexical relationships. Thesauri are
     often used by professionals when they describe resources.

     Thesauri have been created for many domains and subject areas.
     Some thesauri are very broad and contain words from many
     disciplines, like the Library of Congress Subject Headings(LOC-SH)
     used to classify any published content. Other commonly used
     thesauri are more focused, like the Art and Architecture
     Thesaurus(AAT) developed by the Getty Trust and the Legislative
     Indexing Vocabulary developed by the Library of Congress.12

     We can return to our simple food taxonomy to illustrate how a
     thesaurus annotates vocabulary terms with lexical and semantic
     relationships. The class inclusion relationships of hypernomy and
     hyponymy are usually encoded using BT ("broader term") and NT
     ("narrower term"):

     Food BT Meat
     Beef NT Meat

12. http://www.loc.gov/library/libarch-thesauri.html,

     http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/

    aat/index.html.

                                                                      The Lexical Perspective | 553
The BT and NT relationships in a thesaurus create a hierarchical
system of words, but a thesaurus is more than a lexical taxonomy
for some domain because it also encodes additional lexical
relationships for the most important words. Many thesauri
emphasize the cluster of relationships for these key words and de-
emphasize the overall lexical hierarchy.
Because the purpose of a thesaurus is to reduce synonymy, it
distinguishes among synonyms or near-synonyms by indicating one
of them as a preferred term using UF ("used for"):

Food UF Sustenance, Nourishment
A thesaurus might employ USE as the inverse of the UF relationship
to refer from a less preferred or variant term to a preferred one:

Victuals USE Food
Thesauri also use RT ("related term" or "see also") to indicate terms
that are not synonyms but which often occur in similar contexts:

Food RT Cooking, Dining, Cuisine

Relationships among Word Forms

The relationships among word meanings are critically important.
Whenever we create, combine, or compare resource descriptions
we also need to pay attention to relationships between word forms.
These relationships begin with the idea that all natural languages
create words and word forms from smaller units. The basic building
blocks for words are called morphemes and can express semantic
concepts (when they are called root words ) or abstract concepts like

554 | The Lexical Perspective
     "pastness" or "plural"). The analysis of the ways by which languages
     combine morphemes is called morphology.13

     Simple examples illustrate this:

       "dogs" = "dog" (root) + "s" (plural)
       "uncertain" = "certain" (root) + "un" (negation)
       "denied" = "deny" (root) + "ed" (past tense)

     Morphological analysis of a language is heavily used in text
     processing to create indexes for information retrieval. For example,
     stemming (discussed in more detail in Interactions with Resources)
     is morphological processing which removes prefixes and suffixes
     to leave the root form of words. Similarly, simple text processing
     applications like hyphenation and spelling correction solve word
     form problems using roots and rules because it is more scalable
     and robust than solving them using word lists. Many misspellings
     of common words (e.g., "pain") are words of lower frequency (e.g.,
     "pane"), so adding "pane" to a list of misspelled words would
     occasionally identify it incorrectly. In addition, because natural
     languages are generative and create new words all the time, a word
     list can never be complete; for example, when "flickr" occurs in text,
     is it a misspelling of "flicker" or the correct spelling of the popular
     photo-sharing site?

13. Languages differ a great deal in morphological
    complexity and in the nature of their morphological
    mechanisms. Mandarin Chinese has relatively few
    morphemes and few grammatical inflections, which leads
    to a huge number of homophones. English is pretty
    average on this scale. A popular textbook on morphology
    is (Haspelmath and Sims 2010).

                                                                      The Lexical Perspective | 555
   Derivational Morphology

     Derivational morphology deals with how words are created by
     combining morphemes. Compounding, putting two "free
     morphemes" together as in "batman" or "catwoman," is an extremely
     powerful mechanism. The meaning of some compounds is easy to
     understand when the first morpheme qualifies or restricts the
     meaning of the second, as in "birdcage" and "tollbooth."14 However,
     many compounds take on new meanings that are not as literally
     derived from the meaning of their constituents, like "seahorse" and
     "batman."

     Other types of derivations using "bound" morphemes follow more
     precise rules for combining them with "base" morphemes. The most
     common types of bound morphemes are prefixes and suffixes,
     which usually create a word of a different part-of-speech category
     when they are added. Familiar English prefixes include "a-," "ab-
     ," "anti-," "co-," "de-," "pre-," and "un-." Among the most common
     English suffixes are "-able," "-ation," "-ify," "ing," "-ity," "-ize,"

14. These so-called endocentric compounds essentially
    mean what the morphemes would have meant separately.
    But if a "birdcage" is exactly a "bird cage," what is gained
    by creating a new word? This question has long been
    debated in subject classification, where it is framed as
    the contrast between "pre-coordination" and "post-
    coordination." For example, is it better to pre-classify
    some resources as about "Sports Gambling" or should
    such resources be found by intersecting those classified
    as about "Sports" and about "Gambling." See (Svenonius
    2000, pages 187-192).

     556 | The Lexical Perspective
     "-ment," and "-ness." Compounding and adding prefixes or suffixes
     are simple mechanisms, but very complex words like
     "unimaginability" can be formed by using them in combination.

   Inflectional Morphology

     Inflectional mechanisms change the form of a word to represent
     tense, aspect, agreement, or other grammatical information. Unlike
     derivation, inflection never changes the part-of-speech of the base
     morpheme. The inflectional morphology of English is relatively
     simple compared with other languages.15

15. English nouns have plural (book/books) and possessive
    forms (the professor's book), adjectives have
    comparatives and superlatives (big/bigger/biggest), and
    regular verbs have only four inflected forms (see

     http://cla.calpoly.edu/~jrubba/morph/

    morph.over.html). In contrast, in Classical Greek each
    noun can have 11 word forms, each adjective 30, and every
    regular verb over 300 (Anderson 2001).

                                                                      The Lexical Perspective | 557
 40. The Structural
 Perspective

   The structural perspective analyzes the association, arrangement,
   proximity, or connection between resources without primary
   concern for their meaning or the origin of these relationships.1

   We take a structural perspective when we define a family as "a
   collection of people" or when we say that a particular family like
   the Simpsons has five members. Sometimes all we know is that
   two resources are connected, as when we see a highlighted word
   or phrase that is pointing from the current web page to another.
   At other times we might know more about the reasons for the
   relationships within a set of resources, but we still focus on their
   structure, essentially merging or blurring all of the reasons for the
   associations into a single generic notion that the resources are
   connected.

   Travers and Milgram conducted a now-famous study in the 1960s
   involving the delivery of written messages between people in the

1. Of the five perspectives on relationships in this chapter,
  the structural one comes closest to the meaning of
  "relation" in mathematics and computer science, where
  a relation is a set of ordered elements ("tuples") of equal
  degree ("Degree"). A binary relation is a set of element
  pairs, a ternary relation is a set of 3-tuples, and so on. The
  elements in each tuple are "related" but they do not need
  to have any "significant association" or "relationship"
  among them.

   558 | The Structural Perspective
   midwestern and eastern United States. If a person did not know
   the intended recipient, he was instructed to send the message to
   someone that he thought might know him. The study demonstrated
   what Travers and Milgram called the "small world problem," in
   which any two arbitrarily selected people were separated by an
   average of fewer than six links.

   It is now common to analyze the number of "degrees of separation"
   between any pair of resources. For example, Markoff and Sengupta
   describe a 2011 study using Facebook data that computed the
   average "degree of separation" of any two people in the Facebook
   world to be 4.74.2

              Stop and Think: Kevin Bacon Numbers
              See http://oracleofbacon.org/ for a web-based
           demonstration of "Kevin Bacon Numbers," which
           measure the average degrees of separation among more
           than 2.6 million actors in more than 1.9 million movies.
           Its name reflects the parlor game "Six Degrees of Kevin
           Bacon," a pun on "six degrees of separation" that is often
           associated with Travers and Milgram's work; the game
           relies on the remarkable variety of Bacon's roles, and
           hence the number of fellow actors in his movies (two
           actors in the same movie have one degree of
           separation). Bacon's Bacon Number is 2.994, but it turns
           out that more than 300 actors are closer to the center
           of the movie universe than Bacon. Try some famous

       actors and see if their Bacon Numbers are greater or
       smaller than Bacon's. (Hint: older actors have been in
       more movies.)

Many types of resources have internal structure in addition to their
structural relationships with other resources. Of course, we have
to remember (as we discussed in "Resource Identity") that we often
face arbitrary choices about the abstraction and granularity with
which we describe the parts that make up a resource and whether
some combination of resource should also be identified as a
resource. This is not easy when you are analyzing the structure
of a car with its thousands of parts, and it is ever harder with
information resources where there are many more ways to define
parts and wholes. However, an advantage for information resources
is that their internal structural descriptions are usually highly
"computable," something we consider in depth in Interactions with
Resources.

          Business Structures
          Management science is constantly reevaluating
       different structures for organizations. Many large
       businesses are organized similarly near the top, with a
       board of directors, a chief executive officer, and other
       executives who manage the vice presidents or directors
       of various business units. Within and across these
       business units, however, there are significant variations
       in how a business can organize its people.
          Management strategies are built around the style of

560 | The Structural Perspective
       organization the business has chosen. These
       organizational choices reflect the CEO's management
       philosophy, the industry, regulatory requirements,
       operating scale, and other factors. Strict hierarchies are
       a traditional approach, with a tree structure leading
       from the lowest level worker directly up to the CEO. The
       strict management hierarchy at Foxconn is needed to
       enable close oversight of large numbers of low level
       employees in the manufacturing industry, with workers
       organized by physical location.

          Other firms have a matrix structure in which an
       employee can be working on multiple projects, and
       reporting to a different manager for each one. A
       consulting firm's matrix structure might emphasize an
       employee's functional role (e.g., "process engineering
       consultant") and disassociate it from the employee's
       home location, which is why consultants spend so much
       time traveling on airplanes from project to project.

Intentional, Implicit, and Explicit Structure

In the discipline of organizing we emphasize "intentional structure"
created by people or by computational processes rather than
accidental or naturally-occurring structures created by physical
and geological processes. We acknowledged in "The Concept of
"Intentional Arrangement"" that there is information in the piles
of debris left after a tornado or tsunami and in the strata of the
Grand Canyon. These structural patterns might be of interest to
meteorologists, geologists, or others but because they were not

created by an identifiable agent following one or more organizing
principles, they are not our primary focus.

          Stop and Think:
          Intentional, Implicit, or Explicit Structure?
          Find a map of the states (or provinces or other
       divisions) in your country. You probably think of some
       set of these as members of a collection. Other than their
       literal arrangement (e.g., "x is next to y, y is east of z"),
       how could you describe their relationships to each
       other within the collection? Are these relationships
       based on natural or unintentional properties or
       intentional ones? Example: in the United States,
       California, Oregon, and Washington are considered the
       "West Coast" and the Pacific Ocean determines their
       western boundaries. Some of the borders between the
       states are natural, determined by rivers, and other
       borders are more intentional and arbitrary.

Some organizing principles impose very little structure. For a small
collection of resources, co-locating them or arranging them near
each other might be sufficient organization. We can impose two- or
three-dimensional coordinate systems on this "implicit structure"
and explicitly describe the location of a resource as precisely as
we want, but we more naturally describe the structure of resource
locations in relative terms. In English we have many ways to
describe the structural relationship of one resource to another: "in,"
"on," "under," "behind," "above," "below," "near," "to the right of," "to
the left of," "next to," and so on. Sometimes several resources are
arranged or appear to be arranged in a sequence or order and we

562 | The Structural Perspective
   can use positional descriptions of structure: a late 1990s TV show
   described the planet Earth as the "third rock from the Sun."3

   We pay most attention to intentional structures that are explicitly
   represented within and between resources because they embody
   the design or authoring choices about how much implicit or latent
   structure will be made explicit. Structures that can be reliably
   extracted by algorithms become especially important for very large
   collections of resources whose scope and scale defy structural
   analysis by people.

  Structural Relationships within a Resource

   We almost always think of human and other animate resources as
   unitary entities. Likewise, many physical resources like paintings,
   sculptures, and manufactured goods have a material integrity that
   makes us usually consider them as indivisible. For an information
   resource, however, it is almost always the case that it has or might
   have had some internal structure or sub-division of its constituent
   data elements.

   In fact, since all computer files are merely encodings of bits, bytes,
   characters and strings, all digital resources exhibit some internal
   structure, even if that structure is only discernible by software
   agents. Fortunately, the once inscrutable internal formats of word

   processing files are now much more interpretable after they were
   replaced by XML in the last decade.

   When an author writes a document, he or she gives it some internal
   organization with its title, section headings, typographic
   conventions, page numbers, and other mechanisms that identify its
   parts and their significance or relationship to each other. The lowest
   level of this structural hierarchy, usually the paragraph, contains the
   text content of the document. Sometimes the author finds it useful
   to identify types of content like glossary terms or cross-references
   within the paragraph text. Document models that mix structural
   description with content "nuggets" in the text are said to contain
   mixed content.

              Mixed Content
              Mixed content distinguishes XML from other data
           representation languages. It is this structural feature,
           combined with the fact that child nodes in the XML
           Infoset ("XML Information Set") are ordered, that makes
           it possible for XML documents to function both as
           human reader-oriented, textual documents and as
           structured data formats. It allows us to use natural
           language in writing descriptions while still enabling us
           to identify content by type by embedding markup to
           enclose "semantic nuggets" in otherwise
           undifferentiated text.4

   "named entity recognition" has as its goal the creation of
   mixed content by identifying people, companies,

              The Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
           Interchange, produced by the Text Encoding
           Initiative(TEI), for example, includes a set of elements
           and attributes for Names, Dates, People and Places.5

   In data-intensive or transactional domains, document instances
   tend to be homogeneous because they are produced by or for
   automated processes, and their information components will
   appear predictably in the same structural relationships with each
   other. These structures typically form a hierarchy expressed in an
   XML schema or word processing style template. XML documents
   describe their component parts using content-oriented elements
   like <ITEM>, <NAME>, and <ADDRESS>, that are themselves often
   aggregate structures or containers for more granular elements. The
   structures of resources maintained in databases are typically less
   hierarchical, but the structures are precisely captured in database
   schemas.

   The internal parts of XML documents can be described, found and
   selected using the XPath language, which defines the structures and
   patterns used by XML forms, queries, and transformations. The key
   idea used by XPath is that the structure of XML documents is a tree
   of information items called nodes, whose locations are described in
   terms of the relationships between nodes. The relationships built

   organizations, dates, trademarks, stock symbols, and so
   on in unstructured text.

   into XPath, which it calls axes, include self, child, parent, following,
   and preceding, making it very easy to specify a structure-based
   query like "find all sections in Chapter 1 through Chapter 5 that have
   at least two levels of subsections."6

   In addition, tools like Schematron take advantage of XPath's
   structural descriptions to test assertions about a document's
   structure and content. For example, a common editorial constraint
   might be that a numbered list must have at least three items.7

   In more qualitative, less information-intensive and more
   experience-intensive domains, we move toward the narrative end
   of the Document Type Spectrum, and document instances become
   more heterogeneous because they are produced by and for people.
   (See the sidebar, The Document Type Spectrum in "Resource
   Domain".) The information conveyed in the documents is
   conceptual or thematic rather than transactional, and the structural
   relationships between document parts are much weaker. Instead of
   precise structure and content rules, there is usually just a shallow
   hierarchy marked up with Word processing or HTML tags like
   <HEAD>, <H1>, <H2>, and <LIST>.

database or document, describes a class of information
resources, and may also prescribe grammatical details
of inclusion and attribution relationships among the
components. For example, the chapters of this book
contain four levels of subsections. Each of those
sections contains a title, some paragraphs and other
text blocks, and subordinate sections. The textual
content of the paragraphs includes highlighted terms
and phrases that are defined in situ and referenced
again in the glossary and index; there are also
bibliographic citations that are reflected in the
bibliography and index. We can discover these
characteristics of a book through observation, but we
could also examine its structural metadata, in its
schema.

   Structural metadata allows us to describe and
prescribe relations among database tables, within the
chapters of a book, or among parts in an inventory
management system. The schema for HTML, for
example, informs us that the <A> element can be used
to signal a hypertext link-end; whether that link-end is
an anchor or a target, or both, depends on the
combination of values assigned to attributes. In HTML,
the optional REL attribute may contain a value that
signals the purpose of a hypertext link, and any HTML
element may include a CLASS attribute value that may
be used as a CSS selector for the purposes of formatting
or dynamic interactions.

   The usefulness of any given schema is often a
function of the precision with which we may make
useful statements based upon the descriptions and

                                                    The Structural Perspective | 567
       prescriptions it offers. Institutional schemas tend to be
       more prescriptive and restrictive, stressing professional
       orthodoxy and conformance to controlled vocabularies.
       Schemas for the information content in social and
       informal applications tend to be less prescriptive.
       Whether and how we use structural metadata is a
       tradeoff. Structural metadata is essential to enable
       quality control and maintenance in information
       collection and publishing processes, but someone has to
       do the work to create it.

The internal structural hierarchy in a resource is often extracted
and made into a separate and familiar description resource called
the "table of contents" to support finding and navigation
interactions with the primary resource. In a printed media context,
any given content resource is likely to only be presented once,
and its page number is provided in the table of contents to allow
the reader to locate the chapter, section or appendix in question.
In a hypertext media context, a given resource may be a chapter
in one book while being an appendix in another. Some tables of
contents are created as a static structural description, but others
are dynamically generated from the internal structures whenever
the resource is accessed. In addition, other types of entry points
can be generated from the names or descriptions of content
components, like selectable lists of tables, figures, maps, or code
examples.

          DocBook Schema
          The schema most commonly used for producing

568 | The Structural Perspective
           technical books is called DocBook; it describes every
           XML element and attribute and prescribes their
           grammatical forms. The schema lets us know that a
           formal paragraph must include a title, and that a title
           may contain emphasis. A schema can also describe and
           prescribe the lexical value space of a postal code, or
           require that every list must have at least three items.
           The DocBook schema is well-documented and has been
           production-tested in institutional publishing contexts
           for over twenty years.8

   Identifying the components and their structural relationships in
   documents is easier when they follow consistent rules for structure
   (e.g., every non-text component must have a title and caption) and
   presentation (e.g., hypertext links in web pages are underlined and
   change cursor shapes when they are "moused over") that reinforce
   the distinctions between types of information components.
   Structural and presentation features are often ordered on some
   dimension (e.g., type size, line width, amount of white space) and
   used in a correlated manner to indicate the importance of a content
   component.9

   Many indexing algorithms treat documents as "bags of words" to

     compute statistics about the frequency and distribution of the
     words they contain while ignoring all semantics and structure. In
     Interactions with Resources, we contrast this approach with
     algorithms that use internal structural descriptions to retrieve more
     specific parts of documents.

   Structural Relationships between Resources

     Many types of resources have "structural relationships" that
     interconnect them. Web pages are almost always linked to other
     pages. Sometimes the links among a set of pages remain mostly
     within those pages, as they are in an e-commerce catalog site. More
     often, however, links connect to pages in other sites, creating a
     link network that cuts across and obscures the boundaries between
     sites.

     The links between documents can be analyzed to infer connections
     between the authors of the documents. Using the pattern of links
     between documents to understand the structure of knowledge and
     of the intellectual community that creates it is not a new idea,
     but it has been energized as more of the information we exchange
     with other people is on the web or otherwise in digital formats.
     An important function in Google's search engine is the page rank
     algorithm that calculates the relevance of a page in part using the
     number of links that point to it while giving greater weight to pages
     that are themselves linked to often.10

    Rank when its inventors were computer science graduate

Web-based social networks enable people to express their
connections with other people directly, bypassing the need to infer
the connections from links in documents or other communications.

Hypertext Links

The concept of read-only or follow-only structures that connect
one document to another is usually attributed to Vannevar Bush
in his seminal 1945 essay titled As We May Think. Bush called it
associative indexing, defined as "a provision whereby any item may
be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another."11

The "item" connected in this way was for Bush most often a book
or a scientific article. However, the anchor and destination of a
hypertext link can be a resource of any granularity, ranging from a
single point or character, a paragraph, a document, or any part of
the resource to which the ends of link are connected. The anchor
and destination of a web link are its structural specification, but

     sidebar, Perspectives on Hypertext Links).

               Transclusion
               The inclusion, by hypertext reference, of a resource
            or part of a resource into another resource is called
            transclusion. Transclusion is normally performed
            automatically, without user intervention. The inclusion
            of images in web documents is an example of
            transclusion. Transclusion is a frequently used
            technique in business and legal document processing,
            where re-use of consistent and up-to-date content is
            essential to achieve efficiency and consistency.

     Theodor Holm Nelson, in a book intriguingly titled Literary
     Machines, renamed associative indexing as hypertext decades later,
     expanding the idea to make it a writing style as well as a reading
     style.12

     Nelson urged writers to use hypertext to create non-sequential
     narratives that gave choices to readers, using a novel technique for
     which he coined the term transclusion.13

     At about the same time, and without knowing about Nelson's work,
     Douglas Engelbart's Augmenting the Human Intellect, described a
     future world in which professionals equipped with interactive

     computer displays utilize an information space consisting of a
     cross-linked resources.14

     In the 1960s, when computers lacked graphic displays and were
     primarily employed to solve complex mathematical and scientific
     problems that might take minutes, hours or even days to complete,
     Nelson's and Engelbart's visions of hypertext-based personal
     computing may have seemed far-fetched. In spite of this, by 1968,
     Engelbart and his team demonstrated human computer interface
     including the mouse, hypertext, and interactive media, along with a
     set of guiding principles.15

               Perspectives on Hypertext Links
               A lexical perspective on hypertext links concerns the
            words that are used to signal the presence of a link or to
            encode its type. In web contexts, the words in which a
            structural link is embedded are called the anchor text.
            More generally, rhetorical structure theory analyzes
            how different conventions or signals in texts indicate

14. (Engelbart 1963) Douglas Engelbart credits Bush's As We
    May Think article as his direct inspiration. Engelbart was
    in the US Navy, living in a hut in the South Pacific during
    the last stages of WWII when he read The Atlantic
    monthly magazine in which Bush's article was published.

            relationships between texts or parts of them, like the
            subtle differences in polarity among "see," "see also,"
            and "but see" as citation signals.16

               Many hypertext links in web pages are purely
            structural because they lack explicit representation of
            the reason for the relationship. When it is evident, this
            semantic property of the link is called the link type.17

               An architectural perspective on links considers
            whether links are one-way or bi-directional. When a bi-
            directional link is created between an anchor and a

16. See (Lorch 1989), (Mann and Thomson 1988). For
    example, an author might use "See" as in "See (Glushko
    et al. 2013)" when referring to this chapter if it is
    consistent with his point of view. On the other hand,
    that same author could use "but" as a contrasting
    citation signal, writing "But see (Glushko et al. 2013)" to
    express the relationship that the chapter disagrees with
    him.

17. Before the web, most hypertexts implementations
    were in stand-alone applications like CD-ROM
    encyclopedias or in personal information management
    systems that used "cards" or "notes" as metaphors for
    the information units that were linked together, typically
    using rich taxonomies of link types. See (Conklin 1987),
    (Conklin and Begeman 1988), and (DeRose 1989).

            destination, it is as though a one-way link that can be
            followed in the opposite direction is automatically
            created. Two one-way links serve the same purpose, but
            the return link is not automatically established when the
            first one is created. A second architectural
            consideration is whether to employ binary links,
            connecting one anchor to one destination, or n-ary
            links, connecting one anchor to multiple types of
            destinations.18

               (See "The Architectural Perspective")
               A "front end" or "surface" implementation perspective
            on hypertext links concerns how the presence of the
            link is indicated in a user interface; this is called the
            "link marker"; underlining or coloring of clickable text
            are conventional markers for web links.19

18. Many of the pre-web hypertext designs of the 1980s
    and 1990s allowed for n-ary links. The Dexter hypertext
    reference model (Halasz and Schwartz 1994) elegantly
    describes the typical architectures. However, there is
    some ambiguity in use of the term binary in hypertext
    link architectures. One-to-one vs. one-to-many is a
    cardinality distinction, and some people reserve binary
    to discussion about degree.

                A "back end" implementation issue is whether links
             are contained or embedded in the resources they link or
             whether they are stored separately in a link base.21

                (See "The Implementation Perspective ")

     Hypertext links are now familiar structural mechanisms in
     information applications because of the World Wide Web, proposed
     in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau.22

     They invented the methods for encoding and following hypertext
     links using the now popular HyperText Markup Language(HTML).23

20. Most designers use a variety of visual cues and
     conventions to distinguish hyperlinks (e.g., plain
     hyperlink, button, selectable menu, etc.) so that users
     can anticipate how they work and what they mean. A
     recent counter-trend called "flat design" --exemplified
     most notably by the user interfaces of Windows 8 and
     iOS 7-- argues for a minimalist style with less variety in
     typography, color, and shading. Flat designs are easier to
     adapt across multiple devices, but convey less
     information.

     to text or documents. Selecting a hypertext link can invoke a
     connected resource that might be a picture, video, or interactive
     application.24

     By 1993, personal computers, with a graphic display, speakers and
     a mouse pointer, had become ubiquitous. NCSA Mosaic is widely
     credited with popularizing the World Wide Web and HTML in 1993,

    text in the linking document is wrapped in <A> and </A>
    tags, with an HREF (hypertext reference) attribute that
    contains the URI of the link destination if it is in another
    page, or a reference to an ID attribute if the link is to a
    different part of the same page. HTML also has a <LINK>
    tag, which, along with <A> have REL (relationship) and REV
    (reverse relationship) attributes that enable the encoding
    of typed relationships in links. In a book context for
    example, link relationships and reverse relations include
    obvious candidates such as next, previous, parent, child,
    table of contents, bibliography, glossary and index.

24. Using hypertext links as interaction controls is the
    modern dynamic manifestation of cross references
    between textual commentary and illustrations in books,
    a mechanism that dates from the 1500s (Kilgour 1998).
    Hypertext links can be viewed as state transition controls
    in distributed collections of web-based resources; this
    design philosophy is known as Representational State
    Transfer(REST). See (Wilde and Pautasso 2011).

                                                                   The Structural Perspective | 577
     by introducing inline graphics, audio and video media, rather than
     having to link to media segments in a separate window.25

     The ability to transclude images and other media would transform
     the World Wide Web from a text-only viewer with links to a
     "networked landscape" with hypertext signposts to guide the way.
     On 12 November 1993, the first full release of NCSA Mosaic on
     the world's three most popular operating systems (X Windows,
     Microsoft Windows, and Apple Macintosh) enabled the general
     public to access the network with a graphical browser.26

     Since browsers made them familiar, hypertext links have been used
     in other computing applications as structure and navigation
     mechanisms.

    Analyzing Link Structures

     We can portray a set of links between resources graphically as a
     pattern of boxes and links. Because a link connection from one
     resource to another need not imply a link in the opposite direction,
     we distinguish one-way links from explicitly bi-directional ones.

25. Mosaic was developed in Joseph Hardin's lab at the
    National Center for Supercomputing Applications(NCSA),
    hosted by the University of Illinois, at Urbana/
    Champaign by Marc Andreesen, Eric Bina and a team
    of student programmers. Mosaic was initially developed
    on the Unix X Window System. See
    http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/Projects/mosaic.html.

26. (Schatz and Hardin 1994).

      578 | The Structural Perspective
A graphical representation of link structure is shown on the left
panel of figure Figure: Representing Link Structures.. For a small
network of links, a diagram like this one makes it easy to see that
some resources have more incoming or outgoing links than other
resources. However, for most purposes we leave the analysis of link
structures to computer programs, and there it is much better to
represent the link structures more abstractly in matrix form. In
this matrix the resource identifiers on the row and column heads
represent the source and destination of the link. This is a full matrix
because not all of the links are symmetric; a link from resource 1 to
resource 2 does not imply one from 2 to 1.

The structure of links between web resources can be represented
graphically or in a matrix. The matrix representation is a more
abstract one that can be analyzed by computers.
A matrix representation of the same link structure is shown on
the right panel of Figure: Representing Link Structures.. This
representation models the network as a directed graph in which the
resources are the vertices and the relationships are the edges that
connect them. We now can apply graph algorithms to determine

     many useful properties. A very important property is reachability,
     the "can you get there from here" property.27

     Other useful properties include the average number of incoming
     or outgoing links, the average distance between any two resources,
     and the shortest path between them.

    Bibliometrics, Shepardizing, Altmetrics, and Social Network
    Analysis

     Information scientists began studying the structure of scientific
     citation, now called bibliometrics, nearly a century ago to identify
     influential scientists and publications. This analysis of the flow of
     ideas through publications can identify "invisible colleges" of
     scientists who rely on each other's research, and recognize the
     emergence of new scientific disciplines or research areas.
     Universities use bibliometrics to evaluate professors for promotion
     and tenure, and libraries use it to select resources for their
     collections.28

27. Reachability is determined by calculating the transitive
    closure of the link matrix. A classic and well written
    explanation is (Agrawal, Borgida, and Jagadish 1989).

28. Eugene Garfield developed many of the techniques for
    studying scientific citation and he has been called the
    "grandfather of Google" (http://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/

     hardinmd/2010/07/12/eugene-garfield-librarian-

    grandfather-of-google/) because of Google's use of
    citation patterns to determine relevance. See (Garfield,

      580 | The Structural Perspective
     The expression of citation relationships between documents is
     especially nuanced in legal contexts, where the use of legal cases
     as precedents makes it essential to distinguish precisely where a
     new ruling lies on the relational continuum between "Following" and
     "Overruling" with respect to a case it cites. The analysis of legal
     citations to determine whether a cited case is still good law is called
     Shepardizing because lists of cases annotated in this way were first
     published in the late 1800s by Frank Shepard, a salesman for a legal
     publishing company.29

     The links pointing to a web page might be thought of as citations to
     it, so it is tempting to make the analogy to consider Shepardizing
     the web. But unlike legal rulings, web pages aren't always persistent,
     and only courts have the authority to determine the value of cited
     cases as precedents, so Shepard-like metrics for web pages would
     be tricky to calculate and unreliable.

     Nevertheless, the web's importance as a publishing and
     communication medium is undeniable, and many scholars,
     especially younger ones, now contribute to their fields by blogging,
     Tweeting, leaving comments on online publications, writing
     Wikipedia articles, giving MOOC lectures, and uploading papers,
     code, and datasets to open access repositories. Because the

      alternative metrics or "altmetrics" have been proposed to count
      these new venues for scholarly influence.30
      Facebook's valuation is based on its ability to exploit the structure of
      a person's social network to personalize advertisements for people
      and "friends" to whom they are connected. Many computer science
      researchers are working to determine the important characteristics
      of people and relationships that best identify the people whose
      activities or messages influence others to spend money.31

     Standards Organization sought to standardize the
     definition and use cases for altmetrics, which should

      582 | The Structural Perspective
41. The Architectural
Perspective

The architectural perspective emphasizes the number and
abstraction level of the components of a relationship, which
together characterize the complexity of the relationship. We will
briefly consider three architectural issues: degree (or arity),
cardinality, and directionality.

These architectural concepts come from data modeling and they
enable relationships to be described precisely and abstractly, which
is essential for maintaining an organizing system that implements
relationships among resources. Application and technology
lifecycles have never been shorter, and vast amounts of new data are
being created by increased tracking of online interactions and by
all the active resources that are now part of the Internet of Things.
Organizing systems built without clear architectural foundations
cannot easily scale up in size and scope to handle these new
requirements.

Degree

The degree or arity of a relationship is the number of entity types
or categories of resources in the relationship. This is usually, though
not always, the same as the number of arguments in the relationship
expression.

Homer Simpson (husband)  is-married-
to  Marge Simpson (wife)

is a relationship of degree 2, a binary relationship between two

                                                        The Architectural Perspective | 583
entity types, because the "is-married-to" relationship as we first
defined it requires one of the arguments to be of entity type
"husband" and one of them to be of type "wife."

Now suppose we change the definition of marriage to allow the
two participants in a marriage to be any instance of the entity type
"person." The relationship expression looks exactly the same, but
its degree is now unary because only 1 entity type is needed to
instantiate the two arguments:

Homer Simpson (person)  is-married-
to  Marge Simpson (person)

Some relationships are best expressed as ternary ones that involve
three different entity types. An example that appears in numerous
data modeling books is one like this:

Supplier  provides  Part  assembled-in  Product

It is always possible to represent ternary relationships as a set of
binary ones by creating a new entity type that relates to each of the
others in turn. This new entity type is called a dummy in modeling
practice.

Supplier  provides  DUMMY
Part  provided-for  DUMMY
DUMMY  assembled-in  Product

This transformation from a sensible ternary relationship to three
binary ones involving a DUMMY entity type undoubtedly seems
strange, but it enables all relationships to be binary while still
preserving the meaning of the original ternary one. Making all
relationships binary makes it easier to store relationships and
combine them to discover new ones.

584 | The Architectural Perspective
Cardinality

The cardinality of a relationship is the number of instances that can
be associated with each entity type in a relationship. At first glance
this might seem to be degree by another name, but it is not.
Cardinality is easiest to explain for binary relationships. If we return
to Homer and Marge, the binary relationship that expresses that
they are married husband and wife is a one-to-one relationship
because a husband can only have one wife and a wife can only have
one husband (at a time, in monogamous societies like the one in
which the Simpsons live).
In contrast, the "is-parent-of" relationship is one-to-many, because
the meaning of being a parent makes it correct to say that:
Homer Simpson  is-parent-of  Bart AND Lisa AND Maggie
As we did with the ternary relationship in "Degree", we can
transform this more complex relationship architecture to a set of
simpler ones by restricting expressions about being a parent to the
one-to-one cardinality.
Homer Simpson  is-parent-of  Bart
Homer Simpson  is-parent-of  Lisa
Homer Simpson  is-parent-of  Maggie
The one-to-many expression brings all three of Homer's children
together as arguments in the same relational expression, making it
more obvious that they share the same relationship than in the set
of separate and redundant one-to-one expressions.

                                                        The Architectural Perspective | 585
Directionality

The directionality of a relationship defines the order in which the
arguments of the relationship are connected. A one-way or uni-
directional relationship can be followed in only one direction,
whereas a bi-directional one can be followed in both directions.
All symmetric relationships are bi-directional, but not all bi-
directional relationships are symmetric. (See "Symmetry".) A
relationship between a manager and an employee that he manages
is "employs," a different meaning than the "is-employed-by"
relationship in the opposite direction. As in this example, the
relationship is often lexicalized in only one direction.

586 | The Architectural Perspective
42. The Implementation
Perspective

Finally, the implementation perspective on relationships considers
how a relationship is realized or encoded in a technology context.
The implementation perspective contrasts strongly with the
conceptual, structural, and architectural perspectives, which
emphasize the meaning and abstract structure of relationships. The
implementation perspective is a superset of the lexical perspective
because the choice of the language in which to express a
relationship is an implementation decision. However, most people
think of implementation as all of the decisions about technological
form rather than just about the choice of words.

In this book, we focus on the fundamental issues and challenges
that apply to all organizing systems, and not just on information-
intensive ones that rely extensively on technology. Even with this
reduced scope, there are some critical implementation concerns
about the notation, syntax, and deployment of the relationships and
other descriptions about resources. We briefly introduce some of
these issues here and then discuss them in detail in The Forms of
Resource Descriptions.

Choice of Implementation

The choice of implementation determines how easy it is to
understand and process a set of relationships. For example, the
second sentence of this chapter is a natural language
implementation of a set of relationships in the Simpson family:

               The Simpson family includes a man named Homer

                                                                              The Implementation
                                                                                  Perspective | 587
                  and a woman named Marge, the married parents of
                  three sibling children, a boy named Bart and two
                  girls, Lisa and Maggie.

   A subject-predicate-object syntax makes the relationships more
   explicit:

   Subject-Predicate-Object Syntax

   Homer Simpson  is-married-to  Marge Simpson
   Homer Simpson  is-parent-of  Bart
   Homer Simpson  is-parent-of  Lisa
   Homer Simpson  is-parent-of  Maggie
   Marge Simpson  is-married-to  Homer Simpson
   Marge Simpson  is-parent-of  Bart
   Marge Simpson  is-parent-of  Lisa
   Marge Simpson  is-parent-of  Maggie
   Bart Simpson  is-a  Boy
   Lisa Simpson  is-a  Girl
   Maggie Simpson  is-a  Girl

   In the following example of a potential XML implementation syntax,
   we emphasize class inclusion relationships by using elements as
   containers, and the relationships among the members of the family
   are expressed explicitly through references, using XML's ID and
   IDREF attribute types:1

1. We are assuming a schema that establishes that the name
  attributes are of type ID and that the other attributes
  are of type IDREFS. This schema allows for polygamy,
  the possibility of multiple values for the spouse attribute.
  Restrictions on the number of spouses can be enforced

An XML Implementation Syntax

<Family name="Simpson">
   <Parents children="Bart Lisa Maggie">

   </Parents>
   <Children parents="Homer Marge" >
      <Boy name="Bart" siblings="Lisa Maggie" />
      <Girl name="Lisa" siblings="Bart Maggie" />
      <Girl name="Maggie" siblings="Bart Lisa" />
   </Children>

</Family>
None of the models we have presented so far in this chapter
represents the complexities of modern families that involve multiple
marriages and children from more than one marriage, but they are
sufficient for our limited demonstration purposes.

Syntax and Grammar

The syntax and grammar of a language consist of the rules that
determine which combinations of its words are allowed and are thus
grammatical or well-formed. Natural languages have substantial
similarities by having nouns, verbs, adjectives and other parts of
speech, but they differ greatly in how they arrange them to create

with Schematron. (Also see the sidebar, Inclusions and
References).

                                                    The Implementation Perspective | 589
   sentences. Conformance to the rules for arranging these parts
   makes a sentence syntactically compliant but does not mean that
   an expression is semantically comprehensible; the classic example
   is Chomsky's anomalous sentence:

         Colorless green ideas sleep furiously

   Any meaning this sentence has is odd, difficult to visualize, and
   outside of readily accessible experience, but anyone who knows the
   English language can recognize that it follows its syntactic rules, as
   opposed to this sentence, which breaks them and seems completely
   meaningless:

         Ideas colorless sleep furiously green2

  Requirements for Implementation Syntax

   The most basic requirement for implementation syntax is that it
   can represent all the expressions that it needs to express. For the
   examples in this chapter, we have used an informal combination of
   English words and symbols (arrows and parentheses) that you could

2. (Chomsky 1957) used these now famous sentences to
   motivate the distinction between syntax and semantics.
   He argued that since the probability in both cases that
   the words had previously occurred in this order was
   essentially zero, statistics of word occurrence could not
   be part of language knowledge. See.

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

   Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously.

    590 | The Implementation Perspective
understand easily, but simple language is incapable of expressing
most of what we readily say in English. But this benefit of natural
language only accrues to people, and the more restrictive and
formal syntax is easier to understand for computers.

A second consideration is that the implementation can be
understood and used by its intended users. We can usually express
a relationship in different languages while preserving its meaning,
just as we can usually implement the same computing functionality
in different programming languages. From a semantic perspective
these three expressions are equivalent:

My name is Homer Simpson
Mon nom est Homer Simpson
Mein name ist Homer Simpson

However, whether these expressions are equivalent for someone
reading them depends on which languages they understand.

An analogous situation occurs with the implementation of web
pages. HTML was invented as a language for encoding how web
pages look in a browser, and most of the tags in HTML represent
the simple structure of an analogous print document. Representing
paragraphs, list items and numbered headings with <P> and <LI>
and <Hn> makes using HTML so easy that school children can create
web pages. However, the "web for eyes" implemented using HTML
is of less efficient or practical for computers that want to treat
content as product catalogs, orders, invoices, payments, and other
business transactions and information that can be analyzed and
processed. This "web for computers" is best implemented using
domain-specific vocabularies in XML.

 43. Relationships in
 Organizing Systems

   In the previous sections as we surveyed the five perspectives on
   analyzing relationships, we mentioned numerous examples where
   relationships had important roles in organizing systems. In this final
   section we examine three contexts for organizing systems where
   relationships are especially fundamental; the Semantic Web and
   Linked Data, bibliographic organizing systems, and situations
   involving system integration and interoperability.

 The Semantic Web and Linked Data

   In a classic 2001 paper, Tim Berners-Lee laid out a vision of a
   Semantic Web in which all information could be shared and
   processed by automated tools as well as by people.1 The essential

1. (Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila, 2001) is the classic
  paper, and (Shadbolt, Hall, and Berners-Lee 2006) is
  something of a revisionist history.

  Ironically, the web was not semantic originally because
  Berners-Lee implemented web documents using a
  presentation-oriented HTML markup language.
  Designing HTML to be conceptually simple and easy to
  implement led to its rapid adoption. HTML documents
  can make assertions and describe relationships using REL

   592 | Relationships in Organizing
   Systems
   technologies for making the web more semantic and relationships
   among web resources more explicit are applications of XML,
   including RDF ("Resource Description Framework (RDF)"), and OWL
   ("Ontologies"). Many tools have been developed to support more
   semantic encoding, but most still require substantial expertise in
   semantic technologies and web standards.2
   More likely to succeed are applications that aim lower, not trying
   to encode all the latent semantics in a document or web page.
   For example, some wiki and blogging tools contain templates for
   semantic annotation, and Wikipedia has thousands of templates and
   "infoboxes" to encourage the creation of information in content-
   encoded formats.

              Wikipedia Infoboxes

   and REV attributes, but browsers still do not provide
   useful interactions for link relations.
2. For example, Protégé a free, open-source platform with
   a suite of tools to construct domain models and
   knowledge-based applications with ontologies. (See
   http://protege.stanford.edu/)

                                                   Relationships in Organizing Systems | 593
          Wikipedia encourages authors to augment their
       articles with "info boxes" that organize sets of
       structured information generically relevant to the type
       of resource that is the subject of the article. These three
       examples show parts of the info boxes for "Company,"
       "Song," and "City."

          (Collage of screenshots by R. Glushko.)

The "Linked Data" movement is an extension of the Semantic Web
idea to reframe the basic principles of the web's architecture in
more semantic terms. Instead of the limited role of links as simple
untyped relationships between HTML documents, links between

594 | Relationships in Organizing Systems
   resources described by RDF can serve as the bridges between
   islands of semantic data, creating a Linked Data network or cloud.3

  Bibliographic Organizing Systems

   Much of our thinking about relationships in organizing systems for
   information comes from the domain of bibliographic cataloging of
   library resources and the related areas of classification systems
   and descriptive thesauri. Bibliographic relationships provide an
   important means to build structure into library catalogs.4

   Bibliographic relationships are common among library resources.
   Smiraglia and Leazer found that approximately 30% of the works in
   the Online Computer Library Center(OCLC) WorldCat union catalog
   have associated derivative works. Relationships among items within
   these bibliographic families differ, but the average family size for
   those works with derivative works was found to be 3.54 items.
   Moreover, "canonical" works that have strong cultural meaning and
   influence, such as "the plays of William Shakespeare" and The Bible,
   have very large and complex bibliographic families.5

3. See http://linkeddata.org/ and "Syntax".

4. Barbara Tillett has written extensively about the theory
   of bibliographic relationships; (Tillett 2001) is an
   especially useful resource because it is a chapter in a
   comprehensive discussion ambitiously titled
   Relationships in the Organization of Knowledge (Bean and
   Green 2001).

                                                   Relationships in Organizing Systems | 595
  Tillett's Taxonomy

   Barbara Tillett, in a study of 19th and 20th-century catalog rules,
   found that many different catalog rules have existed over time to
   describe bibliographic relationships. She developed a taxonomy of
   bibliographic relationships that includes equivalence, derivative,
   descriptive, whole-part, accompanying, sequential or chronological,
   and shared characteristic. These relationship types span the
   relationship perspectives defined in this chapter; equivalence,
   derivative, and description are semantic types; whole-part and
   accompanying are part semantic and part structural types;
   sequential or chronological are part lexical and part structural
   types; and shared characteristics are part semantic and part lexical
   types.6

   Smiraglia expanded on Tillett's derivative relationship to create
   seven subtypes: simultaneous derivations, successive derivations,
   translations, amplifications, extractions, adaptations, and
   performances.7

   In "Identity and Bibliographic Resources", "Identity and
   Bibliographic Resources," we briefly mentioned the four-level
   abstraction hierarchy for resources introduced in the Functional
   Requirements for Bibliographic Records report. FRBR was highly
   influenced by Tillett's studies of bibliographic relationships, and
   prescribes how the relationships among resources at different
   levels are to be expressed (work-work, expression-expression,
   work-expression, expression-manifestation, and so on).

    596 | Relationships in Organizing Systems
Resource Description and Access (RDA)

Many cataloging researchers have recognized that online catalogs
do not do a very good job of encoding bibliographic relationships
among items, both due to catalog display design and to the
limitations of how information is organized within catalog records.8
Author name authority databases, for example, provide information
for variant author names, which can be very important in finding
all of the works by a single author, but this information is not held
within a catalog record. Similarly, MARC records can be formatted
and displayed in web library catalogs, but the data within the
records are not available for re-use, re-purposing, or re-arranging
by researchers, patrons, or librarians.

The Resource Description and Access(RDA) next-generation
cataloging rules are attempting to bring together disconnected
resource descriptions to provide more complete and
interconnected data about works, authors, publications, publishers,
and subjects.

RDA uses RDF to assert relationships among bibliographic
materials.9

RDA and the Semantic Web

The move in RDA to encode bibliographic data in RDF stems from
the desire to make library catalog data more web-accessible. As
web-based data mash-ups, application programming interfaces

8. (Tillett 2005).
9. See Section 8.1.3.1.

                         Relationships in Organizing Systems | 597
     (APIs), and web searching are becoming ubiquitous and expected,
     library data are becoming increasingly isolated. The developers of
     RDA see RDF as the means for making library data more widely
     available online.10

     In addition to simply making library data more web accessible, RDA
     seeks to leverage the distributed nature of the Semantic Web. Once
     rules for describing resources, and the relationships between them,
     are declared in RDF syntax and made publicly available, the rules
     themselves can be mixed and mashed up. Creators of information
     systems that use RDF can choose elements from any RDF schema.
     For example, we can use the Dublin Core metadata schema (which
     has been aligned with the RDF model) and the Friend of a
     Friend(FOAF) schema (a schema to describe people and the
     relationships between them) to create a set of metadata elements
     about a journal article that goes beyond the standard bibliographic
     information. RDA's process of moving to RDF is well underway.11

10. See (Coyle 2010a).

11. The FRBR entities, RDA data elements, and RDA value
    vocabularies have been defined in alignment with RDF
    using the Simple Knowledge Organization System
    (SKOS). SKOS is an "RDF-compliant language specifically
    designed for term lists and thesauri" (Coyle 2010b). The
    SKOS website provides lists of registered RDF metadata
    schemas and vocabularies. From these, information
    system designers can create application profiles for their
    resources, selecting elements from multiple schemas,

Integration and Interoperability

Integration is the controlled sharing of information between two (or
more) business systems, applications, or services within or between
firms. Integration means that one party can extract or obtain
information from another one, it does not imply that the recipient
can make use of the information.

Interoperability goes beyond integration to mean that systems,
applications, or services that exchange information can make sense
of what they receive. Interoperability can involve identifying
corresponding components and relationships in each system,
transforming them syntactically to the same format, structurally to
the same granularity, and semantically to the same meaning.

For example, an Internet shopping site might present customers
with a product catalog whose items come from a variety of
manufacturers who describe the same products in different ways.
Likewise, the end-to-end process from customer ordering to
delivery requires that customer, product and payment information
pass through the information systems of different firms. Creating
the necessary information mappings and transformations is tedious
or even impossible if the components and relationships among them
are not formally specified for each system.

In contrast, when these models exist as data or document schemas
or as classes in programming languages, identifying and exploiting
the relationships between the information in different systems to
achieve interoperability or to merge different classification systems
can often be completely automated. Because of the substantial
economic benefits to governments, businesses, and their customers
of more efficient information integration and exchange, efforts to
standardize these information models are important in numerous
industries. Interactions with Resources will dive deeper into

contexts.

  · What is a relationship?

      A relationship is "an association among several things, with that
      association having a particular significance."

      (See "Introduction")

  · Why is it essential to include the type of association in a
      specification of a relationship?

      Just identifying the resources involved is not enough because
      several different relationships can exist among the same
      resources.

      (See "Describing Relationships: An Overview")

  · What is the most typical grammatical model for expressing a
      relationship?

      Most relationships between resources can be expressed using a
      subject-predicate-object model.

      (See "The Semantic Perspective" and "Choice of
      Implementation")

  · What knowledge does a computer need to be able to
      understand relational expressions?

      For a computer to understand relational expressions, it needs
      a computer-processable representation of the relationships
      among words and meanings that makes every important
      semantic assumption and property precise and explicit.

      (See "The Semantic Perspective")

  · What are three broad categories of semantic relationships?

                                                              Key Points in Chapter Six | 601
      Three broad categories of semantic relationships are inclusion,
      attribution, and possession.
      (See "Types of Semantic Relationships")
  · What is a taxonomy?
      A set of interconnected class inclusion relationships creates a
      hierarchy called a taxonomy.
      (See "Inclusion")
  · What kind of semantic relationship is expressed by a
      classification?
      Classification is a class inclusion relationship between an
      instance and a class.
      (See "Inclusion")
  · What kinds of inferences are possible when relationships are
      transitive?
      Ordering and inclusion relationships are inherently transitive,
      enabling inferences about class membership and properties.
      (See "Transitivity")
  · What is an ontology?
      Class inclusion relationships form a framework to which other
      kinds of relationships attach, creating a network of
      relationships called an ontology.
      (See "Ontologies")
  · What is hyponymy?
      When words encode the semantic distinctions expressed by

602 | Key Points in Chapter Six
   class inclusion, the more specific class is called the hyponym;
   the more general class is the hypernym.
   (See "Hyponymy and Hyperonymy")
· What is a practical application of morphological analysis?
   Morphological analysis of how words in a language are created
   from smaller units is heavily used in text processing.
   (See "Relationships among Word Forms")
· What are the two types of structural relationships?
   Many types of resources have internal structure in addition to
   their structural relationships with other resources.
   (See "Structural Relationships within a Resource" and
   "Structural Relationships within a Resource")
· What is link analysis?
   Using the pattern of links between documents to understand
   the structure of knowledge and the structure of the intellectual
   community that creates it is an idea that is nearly a century old.
   (See "Structural Relationships between Resources")
· When are hypertext links merely structural?
   Many hypertext links are purely structural because there is no
   explicit representation of the reason for the relationship.
   (See the sidebar, Perspectives on Hypertext Links)
· What aspects of relationships between resources does the
   architectural perspective emphasize?
   The architectural perspective on resources emphasizes the
   number and abstraction level of the components of a

      relationship; three important issues are degree, cardinality, and
      directionality.

  · What are the essential semantic web technologies?

      The essential technologies for making the web more semantic
      and relationships among web resources more explicit are XML,
      RDF, and OWL.

      (See "The Semantic Web and Linked Data")

  · What is the origin of the study of relationships in organizing
      systems?

      Much of our thinking about relationships in organizing systems
      for information comes from the domain of bibliographic
      cataloging of library resources and the related areas of
      classification systems and descriptive thesauri.

      (See "Bibliographic Organizing Systems")

45. Introduction (VII)

For nearly two decades, a TV game show called Pyramid aired in
North America. The show featured two competing teams, each team
consisting of two contestants: an ordinary civilian contestant and
a celebrity. In the show's first round, both teams' members viewed
a pyramid-shaped sign that displayed six category titles, some
straightforward like "Where You Live" and others less conventional
like "Things You Need to Feed." Each team then had an opportunity
to compete for points in 30-second turns. The goal was for one
team member to gain points by identifying a word or phrase related
to the category from clues provided by the other team member. For
example, a target phrase for the "Where You Live" category might be
"zip code," and the clue might be "Mine is 94705." "Things you Need
to Feed" might include both "screaming baby" and "parking meter."

The team that won the first round advanced to the "Winner's Circle,"
where the game was turned around. This time, only the clue giver
was shown the category name and had to suggest concepts or
instances belonging to that category so that the teammate could
guess the category name. Clues like "alto," "soprano," and "tenor"
would be given to prompt the teammate to guess "Singing Voices"
or "Types of Singers."

As the game progressed, the categories became more challenging.
It was interesting and entertaining to hear the clue receiver's initial
guess and how subsequent guesses changed with more clues. The
person giving clues would often become frustrated, because to
them their clues seemed obvious and discriminating but would
seem not to help the clue receivers in identifying the category.
Viewers enjoyed sharing in these moments of vocabulary and
category confusion.

The Pyramid TV game show developers created a textbook example
for teaching about categories--groups or classes of things, people,

                                                                         Introduction (VII) | 609
   processes, events or anything else that we treat as equivalent--and
   categorization--the process of assigning instances to categories.
   The game is a useful analog for us to illustrate many of the issues
   we discuss in this chapter. The Pyramid game was challenging, and
   sometimes comical, because people bring their own experiences
   and biases to understanding what a category means, and because
   not every instance of a category is equally typical or suggestive.
   How we organize reflects our thinking processes, which can
   inadvertently reveal personal characteristics that can be amusing
   in a social context. Hence, the popularity of the Pyramid franchise,
   which began on CBS in 1973 and has been produced in 20 countries.

   Many texts in library science introduce categorization via
   cataloging rules, a set of highly prescriptive methods for assigning
   resources to categories that some describe and others satirize as
   "mark 'em and park 'em." Many texts in computer science discuss
   the process of defining the categories needed to create, process,
   and store information in terms of programming language
   constructs: "here's how to define an abstract type, and here's the
   data type system." Machine learning and data science texts explain
   how categories are created through statistical analysis of the
   correlations among the values of features in a collection or dataset.
   We take a very different approach in this chapter, but all of these
   different perspectives will find their place in it.1

1. Cataloging and programming are important activities
  that need to be done well, and prescriptive advice is often
  essential. However, we believe that understanding how
  people create psychological and linguistic categories can
  help us appreciate that cataloging and information
  systems design are messier and more intellectually
  challenging activities than we might otherwise think.

   610 | Introduction (VII)
      Navigating This
          Chapter

   In the following sections, we discuss how and why we
create categories, reviewing some important work in
philosophy, linguistics, and cognitive psychology to
better understand how categories are created and used
in organizing systems. We discuss how the way we
organize differs when we act as individuals or as
members of social, cultural, or institutional groups ("The
What and Why of Categories"); later we share principles
for creating categories( "Principles for Creating
Categories"), design choices ("Category Design Issues
and Implications"), and implementation experience
("Implementing Categories"). Throughout the chapter,
we will compare how categories created by people
compare with those created by computer algorithms. As
usual, we close the chapter with a summary of the key
points ("Key Points in Chapter Seven").

                                                                 Introduction (VII) | 611
 46. The What and Why of
 Categories

 The What and Why of
 Categories

   Categories are equivalence classes, sets or groups of things or
   abstract entities that we treat the same. This does not mean that
   every instance of a category is identical, only that from some
   perspective, or for some purpose, we are treating them as
   equivalent based on what they have in common. When we consider
   something as a member of a category, we are making choices about
   which of its properties or roles we are focusing on and which ones
   we are ignoring. We do this automatically and unconsciously most
   of the time, but we can also do it in an explicit and self-aware
   way. When we create categories with conscious effort, we often
   say that we are creating a model, or just modeling. You should be
   familiar with the idea that a model is a set of simplified descriptions
   or a physical representation that removes some complexity to
   emphasize some features or characteristics and to de-emphasize
   others.1

1. Cognitive science mostly focuses on the automatic and
  unconscious mechanisms for creating and using
  categories. This disciplinary perspective emphasizes the
  activation of category knowledge for the purpose of
  making inferences and "going beyond the information

                                                                               The What and Why of
                                                                                       Categories | 613
When we encounter objects or situations, recognizing them as
members of a category helps us know how to interact with them.
For example, when we enter an unfamiliar building we might need
to open or pass through an entryway that we recognize as a door.
We might never have seen that particular door before, but it has
properties and affordances that we know that all doors have; it has
a doorknob or a handle; it allows access to a larger space; it opens

given," to use Bruner's classic phrase (Bruner 1957). In
contrast, the discipline of organizing focuses on the
explicit and self-aware mechanisms for creating and
using categories because by definition, organizing
systems serve intentional and often highly explicit
purposes. Organizing systems facilitate inferences about
the resources they contain, but the more constrained
purposes for which resources are described and
arranged makes inference a secondary goal.

Cognitive science is also highly focused on
understanding and creating computational models of the
mechanisms for creating and using categories. These
models blend data-driven or bottom-up processing with
knowledge-driven or top-down processing to simulate
the time course and results of categorization at both
fine-grained scales (as in word or object recognition) and
over developmental time frames (as in how children learn
categories). The discipline of organizing can learn from
these models about the types of properties and principles
that organizing systems use, but these computational
models are not a primary concern to us in this book.

614 | The What and Why of Categories
and closes. By mentally assigning this particular door to the "doors"
category we distinguish it from "windows," a category that also
contains objects that sometimes have handles and that open and
close, but which we do not normally pass through to enter another
space. Categorization judgments are therefore not just about what
is included in a class, but also about what is excluded from a class.
Nevertheless, the category boundaries are not sharp; a "Dutch door"
is divided horizontally in half so that the bottom can be closed like a
door while the top can stay open like a window.

Categories are cognitive and linguistic models for applying prior
knowledge; creating and using categories are essential human
activities. Categories enable us to relate things to each other in
terms of similarity and dissimilarity and are involved whenever we
perceive, communicate, analyze, predict, or classify. Without
categories, we would perceive the world as an unorganized blur
of things with no understandable or memorable relation to each
other. Every wall-entry we encounter would be new to us, and we
would have to discover its properties and supported interactions
as though we had never before encountered a door. Of course, we
still often need to identify something as a particular instance, but
categories enable us to understand how it is equivalent to other
instances. We can interchangeably relate to something as specific as
"the wooden door to the main conference room" or more generally
as "any door."

All human languages and cultures divide up the world into
categories. How and why this takes place has long been debated by
philosophers, psychologists and anthropologists. One explanation
for this differentiation is that people recognize structure in the
world, and then create categories of things that "go together" or are
somehow similar. An alternative view says that human minds make
sense of the world by imposing structure on it, and that what goes
together or seems similar is the outcome rather than a cause of
categorization. Bulmer framed the contrast in a memorable way by

                                                    The What and Why of Categories | 615
asking which came first, the chicken (the objective facts of nature)
or the egghead (the role of the human intellect).2

A secondary and more specialized debate going on for the last
few decades among linguists, cognitive scientists, and computer
scientists concerns the extent to which the cognitive mechanisms
involved in category formation are specialized for that purpose
rather than more general learning processes.3

2. However, even the way this debate has been framed is

a bit controversial. Bulmer's chicken, the "categories are

in the world" position, has been described as empirical,

environment-driven, bottom-up, or objectivist, and these

are not synonymous. Likewise, the "egghead" position

that "categories are in the mind" has been called rational,

constructive,  top-down,  experiential,      and

embodied--and they are also not synonyms. See (Bulmer

1970). See also (Lakoff 1990), (Malt 1995).

3. Is there a "universal grammar" or a "language faculty"
   that imposes strong constraints on human language and
   cognition? (Chomsky 1965) and (Jackendoff 1996) think so.
   Such proposals imply cognitive representations in which
   categories are explicit structures in memory with
   associated instances and properties. In contrast,
   generalized learning theories model category formation
   as the adjustment of the patterns and weighting of
   connections in neural processing networks that are not
   specialized for language in any way. Computational
   simulations of semantic networks can reproduce the

    616 | The What and Why of Categories
   Even before they can talk, children behave in ways that suggest they
   have formed categories based on shape, color, and other properties
   they can directly perceive in physical objects.4

   People almost effortlessly learn tens of thousands of categories
   embodied in the culture and language in which they grow up. People
   also rely on their own experiences, preferences, and goals to adapt

   experimental and behavioral results about language
   acquisition and semantic judgments that have been used
   as evidence for explicit category representations without
   needing anything like them. (Rogers and McClelland
   2008) thoroughly review the explicit category models
   and then show how relatively simple learning models can
   do without them.

4. The debates about human category formation also
   extend to issues of how children learn categories and
   categorization methods. Most psychologists argue that
   category learning starts with general learning
   mechanisms that are very perceptually based, but they
   do not agree whether to characterize these changes as
   "stages" or as phases in a more complex dynamical
   system. Over time more specific learning techniques
   evolve that focus on correlations among perceptual
   properties (things with wings tend to have feathers),
   correlations among properties and roles (things with eyes
   tend to eat), and ultimately correlations among roles
   (things that eat tend to sleep). See (Smith and Thelen
   2003).

                                                        The What and Why of Categories | 617
   these cultural categories or create entirely individual ones that they
   use to organize resources that they personally arrange. Later on,
   through situational training and formal education, people learn to
   apply systematic and logical thinking processes so that they can
   create and understand categories in engineering, logistics,
   transport, science, law, business, and other institutional contexts.

   These three contexts of cultural, individual, and institutional
   categorization share some core ideas but they emphasize different
   processes and purposes for creating categories, so they are a useful
   distinction.5 Cultural categorization can be understood as a natural
   human cognitive ability that serves as a foundation for both informal
   and formal organizing systems. Individual categorization tends to
   grow spontaneously out of our personal activities. Institutional
   categorization responds to the need for formal coordination and
   cooperation within and between companies, governments, and
   other goal-oriented enterprises.

5. These three contexts were proposed by (Glushko, Maglio,
   Matlock, and Barsalou 2008), who pointed out that
   cognitive science has focused on cultural categorization
   and largely ignored individual and institutional contexts.
   They argue that taking a broader view of categorization
   highlights dimensions on which it varies that are not
   apparent when only cultural categories are considered.
   For example, institutional categories are usually designed
   and maintained using prescriptive methods that have no
   analogues with cultural categories. There is a difference
   between institutional categories created for people, and
   categories created in institutions by computers in the
   predictive analytics, data mining sense.

    618 | The What and Why of Categories
   In contrast to these three categorization contexts in which
   categories are created by people, computational categories are
   created by computer programs for information retrieval, machine
   learning, predictive analytics, and other applications.
   Computational categories are similar to those created by people in
   some ways but differ substantially in other ways.

  Cultural Categories

   Cultural categories are the archetypical form of categories upon
   which individual and institutional categories are usually based.
   Cultural categories tend to describe our everyday experiences of
   the world and our accumulated cultural knowledge. Such categories
   describe objects, events, settings, internal experiences, physical
   orientation, relationships between entities, and many other aspects
   of human experience. Cultural categories are learned primarily, with
   little explicit instruction, through normal exposure of children with
   their caregivers; they are associated with language acquisition and
   language use within particular cultural contexts.

   Two thousand years ago Plato wrote that living species could be
   identified by "carving nature at its joints," the natural boundaries or
   discontinuities between types of things where the differences are
   the largest or most salient. Plato's metaphor is intuitively appealing
   because we can easily come up with examples of perceptible
   properties or behaviors of physical things that go together that
   make some ways of categorizing them seem more natural than
   others.6

6. This quote comes from Plato's Phaedrus dialogue, written
   around 370 BCE. Contemporary philosophers and

                                                        The What and Why of Categories | 619
   Natural languages rely heavily on nouns to talk about categories of
   things because it is useful to have a shorthand way of referring to
   a set of properties that co-occur in predictable ways.7 For example,
   in English (borrowed from Portuguese) we have a word for "banana"
   because a particular curved shape, greenish-yellow or yellow color,
   and a convenient size tend to co-occur in a familiar edible object,
   so it became useful to give it a name. The word "banana" brings
   together this configuration of highly interrelated perceptions into a

  cognitive scientists commonly invoke it in discussions
  about whether "natural kinds" exist. . For example, see
  (Campbell, O'Rourke, and Slater 2011), and (Hutchins
  2010), (Atran 1987), and others have argued that the
  existence of perceptual discontinuities is not sufficient to
  account for category formation. Instead, people assume
  that members of a biological category must have an
  essence of co-occurring properties and these guide
  people to focus on the salient differences, thereby
  creating categories. Property clusters enable inferences
  about causality, which then builds a framework on which
  additional categories can be created and refined. For
  example, if "having wings" and "flying" are co-occurring
  properties that suggest a "bird" category, wings are then
  inferred as the causal basis of flying, and wings become
  more salient.

7. Pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions,
  conjunctions, particles, and numerals and other "parts of
  speech" are also grammatical categories, but nouns carry
  most of the semantic weight.

   620 | The What and Why of Categories
   unified concept so we do not have to refer to bananas by listing their
   properties.8

   Languages differ a great deal in the words they contain and also
   in more fundamental ways that they require speakers or writers
   to attend to details about the world or aspects of experience that
   another language allows them to ignore. This idea is often described
   as linguistic relativity. (See the sidebar, Linguistic Relativity.)

8. In contrast, the set of possible interactions with even a
   simple object like a banana is very large. We can pick,
   peel, slice, smash, eat, or throw a banana, so instead of
   capturing this complexity in the meaning of banana it
   gets parceled into the verbs that can act on the banana
   noun. Doing so requires languages to use verbs to
   capture a broader and more abstract type of meaning
   that is determined by the nouns with which they are
   combined. Familiar verbs like "set," "put," and "get" have
   dozens of different senses as a result because they go
   with so many different nouns. We set fires and we set
   tables, but fires and tables have little in common. The
   intangible character of verbs and the complexity of
   multiple meanings make it easier to focus instead on
   their associated nouns, which are often physical
   resources, and create organizing systems that emphasize
   the latter rather than the former. We create organizing
   systems that focus on verbs when we are categorizing
   actions, behaviors, or services where the resources that
   are involved are less visible or less directly involved in the
   supported interactions.

                                                        The What and Why of Categories | 621
              Linguistic Relativity
              Linguistic diversity led Benjamin Whorf, in the
           mid-20th century, to propose an overly strong
           statement of the relationships among language, culture,
           and thought. Whorf argued that the particularities of
           one's native language determine how we think and what
           we can think about. Among his extreme ideas was the
           suggestion that, because some Native American
           languages lacked words or grammatical forms that refer
           to what we call "time" in English, they could not
           understand the concept. More careful language study
           showed both parts of the claim to be completely false.
              Nevertheless, even though academic linguists have
           discredited strong versions of Whorf's ideas, less
           deterministic versions of linguistic relativity have
           become influential and help us understand cultural
           categorization. The more moderate position was crisply
           characterized by Roman Jakobson, who said that
           "languages differ essentially in what they must convey
           and not in what they may convey." In English one can
           say "I spent yesterday with a neighbor." In languages
           with grammatical gender, one must choose a word that
           identifies the neighbor as male or female.9

9. Many languages have a system of grammatical gender
   in which all nouns must be identified as masculine or
   feminine using definite articles (el and la in Spanish, le
   and la in French, and so on) and corresponding
   pronouns. Languages also contrast in how they describe

     Yimithirr, do not use concepts of left and right, but rather use
     cardinal directions. Where in English we might say to a person
     facing north, "Take a step to your left," they would use their term
     for west. If the person faced south, we would change our instruction
     to "right," but they would still use their term for west. Imagine how
     difficult it would be for a speaker of Guugu Yimithirr and a speaker
     of English to collaborate in organizing a storage room or a closet.10

    (Deutscher 2011) carefully reviews and discredits the
    strong Whorfian view and makes the case for a more
    nuanced perspective on linguistic relativity. He also
    reviews much of Lera Boroditsky's important work in
    this area. George Lakoff's book with the title Women,
    Fire, and Dangerous Things (Lakoff 1990) provocatively
    points out differences in gender rules among languages;
    in an aboriginal language called Dyirbal many dangerous
    things, including fire have feminine gender, meanwhile
    "fire" is masculine in Spanish (el feugo) and French (le
    feu).

    Lera Boroditsky has done many interesting studies and
    experiments about linguistic relativity. See (Boroditksy
    2003) for an academic summary and (Boroditsky 2010,
    2011) for more popular treatments.

     It is not controversial to notice that different cultures and language
     communities have different experiences and activities that give
     them contrasting knowledge about particular domains. No one
     would doubt that university undergraduates in Chicago would think
     differently about animals than inhabitants of Guatemalan rain
     forests, or even that different types of "tree experts" (taxonomists,
     landscape workers, foresters, and tree maintenance personnel)
     would categorize trees differently.11

     On the other hand, despite the wide variation in the climates,
     environments, and cultures that produce them, at a high level "folk
     taxonomies" that describe natural phenomena are surprisingly
     consistent around the world. Half a century ago the sociologists
     Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss observed that the language and
     structure of folk taxonomies mirrors that of human family
     relationships (e.g., different types of trees might be "siblings," but
     animals would be part of another family entirely). They suggested
     that framing the world in terms of familiar human relationships
     allowed people to understand it more easily.12

11. (Medin et al. 1997).

12. This was ultimately reflected in complex mythological
    systems, such as Greek mythology, where genealogical
    relationships between gods represented category
    relationships among the phenomena with which they
    were associated. As human knowledge grew and the
    taxonomies became more comprehensive and complex,
    Durkheim and Mauss argued, they lay the groundwork
    for scientific classifications and shed their mythological
    roots. (Durkheim 1963).

     624 | The What and Why of Categories
Anthropologist Brent Berlin, a more recent researcher, concurs with
Durkheim and Mauss's observation that kinship relations and folk
taxonomies are related, but argues that humans patterned their
family structures after the natural world, not the other way
around.13

                   The What and Why of Categories | 625
   Individual Categories

     Individual categories are created in an organizing system to satisfy
     the ad hoc requirements that arise from a person's unique
     experiences, preferences, and resource collections. Unlike cultural
     categories, which usually develop slowly and last a long time,
     individual categories are created by intentional activity, in response
     to a specific situation, or to solve an emerging organizational
     challenge. As a consequence, the categories in individual organizing
     systems generally have short lifetimes and rarely outlive the person
     who created them.14

     Individual categories draw from cultural categories but differ in
     two important ways. First, individual categories sometimes have an
     imaginative or metaphorical basis that is meaningful to the person
     who created them but which might distort or misinterpret cultural
     categories. Second, individual categories are often specialized or
     synthesized versions of cultural categories that capture particular
     experiences or personal history. For example, a person who has
     lived in China and Mexico, or lived with people from those places,
     might have highly individualized categories for foods they like and
     dislike that incorporate characteristics of both Chinese and
     Mexican cuisine.

     Individual categories in organizing systems also reflect the
     idiosyncratic set of household goods, music, books, website
     bookmarks, or other resources that a person might have collected

14. The personal archives of people who turn out to be
    famous or important are the exception that proves this
    rule. In that case, the individual's organizing system and
    its categories are preserved along with their contents.

     626 | The What and Why of Categories
     over time. The organizing systems for financial records, personal
     papers, or email messages often use highly specialized categories
     that are shaped by specific tasks to be performed, relationships
     with other people, events of personal history, and other highly
     individualized considerations. Put another way, individual
     categories are used to organize resource collections that are likely
     not representative samples of all resources of the type being
     collected. If everyone had the same collection of music, books,
     clothes, or toys the world would be a boring place.

     Traditionally, individual categorization systems were usually not
     visible to, or shared with, others, whereas, this has become an
     increasingly common situation for people using web-based
     organizing system for pictures, music, or other personal resources.
     On websites like the popular Flickr, Instagram, and YouTube sites
     for photos and videos, people typically use existing cultural
     categories to tag their content as well as individual ones that they
     invent.15

15. The typical syntactic constraint that tags are delimited by
    white space encourages the creation of new categories
    by combining existing category names using
    concatenation and camel case conventions; photos that
    could be categorized as "Berkeley" and "Student" are
    sometimes tagged as "BerkeleyStudent." Similar
    generative processes for creating individual category
    names are used with Twitter "hashtags" where tweets
    about events are often categorized with an ad hoc tag
    that combines an event name and a year identifier like
    "#NBAFinals16."

   Institutional Categories

     In contrast to cultural categories that are created and used
     implicitly, and to individual categories that are used by people
     acting alone, institutional categories are created and used explicitly,
     and most often by many people in coordination with each other.
     Institutional categories are most often created in abstract and
     information-intensive domains where unambiguous and precise
     categories are needed to regulate and systematize activity, to enable
     information sharing and reuse, and to reduce transaction costs.
     Furthermore, instead of describing the world as it is, institutional
     categories are usually defined to change or control the world by
     imposing semantic models that are more formal and arbitrary than
     those in cultural categories. Laws, regulations, and standards often
     specify institutional categories, along with decision rules for
     assigning resources to new categories, and behavior rules that
     prescribe how people must interact with them. The rigorous
     definition of institutional categories enables classification: the
     systematic assignment of resources to categories in an organizing
     system.16

16. Consider how the cultural category of "killing a person"
    is refined by the legal system to distinguish manslaughter
    and different degrees of murder based on the amount of
    intentionality and planning involved (e.g., first and second
    degree murder) and the roles of people involved with
    the killing (accessory). In general, the purpose of laws is
    to replace coarse judgments of categorization based on
    overall similarity of facts with rule-based categorization
    based on specific dimensions or properties.

     628 | The What and Why of Categories
    Creating institutional categories by more systematic processes than
    cultural or individual categories does not ensure that they will be
    used in systematic and rational ways, because the reasoning and
    rationale behind institutional categories might be unknown to, or
    ignored by, the people who use them. Likewise, this way of creating
    categories does not prevent them from being biased. Indeed, the
    goal of institutional categories is often to impose or incentivize
    biases in interpretation or behavior. There is no better example of
    this than the practice of gerrymandering, designing the boundaries
    of election districts to give one political party or ethnic group an
    advantage.17(See the sidebar, Gerrymandering in Illinois.)

               Gerrymandering in Illinois

17. The word was invented in 1812 in a newspaper article
    critical of Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry, who
    oversaw the creation of biased electoral districts. One
    such district was so contorted in shape, it was said to
    look like a salamander, and thus was called a
    Gerrymander. The practice remains widespread, but
    nowadays sophisticated computer programs can select
    voters on any number of characteristics and create
    boundaries that either "pack" them into a single district
    to concentrate their voting power or "crack" them into
    multiple districts to dilute it.

          The 17th Congressional District in Illinois was dubbed
       "the rabbit on a skateboard" from 2003 through 2013
       because of its highly contorted shape. The bizarre
       boundary was negotiated to create favorable voting
       constituencies for two incumbent legislators from
       opposing parties.

Institutional categorization stands apart from individual
categorization primarily because it invariably requires significant
efforts to reconcile mismatches between existing individual
categories, where those categories embody useful working or

630 | The What and Why of Categories
     contextual knowledge that is lost in the move to a formal
     institutional system.18

     Institutional categorization efforts must also overcome the
     vagueness and inconsistency of cultural categories because the
     former must often conform to stricter logical standards to support
     inference and meet legal requirements. Furthermore, institutional
     categorization is usually a process that must be accounted for in
     a budget and staffing plans. While some kinds of institutional
     categories can be devised or discovered by computational
     processes, most of them are created through the collaboration of
     many individuals, typically from various parts of an organization or
     from different firms. For example, with the gerrymandering case
     we just discussed, it is important to emphasize that the inputs to
     these programs and the decisions about districting are controlled

18. The particularities or idiosyncrasies of individual
    categorization systems sometimes capture user
    expertise and knowledge that is not represented in the
    institutional categories that replace them. Many of the
    readers of this book are information professionals whose
    technological competence is central to their work and
    which helps them to be creative. But for a great many
    other people, information technology has enabled the
    routinization of work in offices, assembly lines, and in
    other jobs where new institutionalized job categories
    have "downskilled" or "deskilled" the nature of work,
    destroying competence and engendering a great deal of
    resistance from the affected workers.

                                                         The What and Why of Categories | 631
by people, which is why the districts are institutional categories; the
programs are simply tools that make the process more efficient. 19

          Stop and Think: Color
          Think of the very broad category of "color." What are
       a few examples of a "cultural" category of color? How
       about an "individual" one? And an "institutional" one?

The different business or technical perspectives of the participants
are often the essential ingredients in developing robust categories
that can meet carefully identified requirements. And as
requirements change over time, institutional categories must often

19. Similar technical concerns arise in within-company and

multi-company standardization efforts, but the

competitive and potentially anti-competitive character

of the latter imposes greater complexity by introducing

considerations of business strategy and politics. Credible

standards-making in multi-company contexts depends

on an explicit and transparent process for gathering and

prioritizing requirements, negotiating specifications that

satisfy them, and ensuring conformant

implementations--without at any point giving any

participating firm an advantage. See the OASIS Technical

Committee Process for an example (https://www.oasis-

open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process)  and

(Rosenthal et al. 2004) for an analysis of best practices.

632 | The What and Why of Categories
     change as well, implying version control, compliance testing, and
     other formal maintenance and governance processes.

     Some institutional categories that initially had narrow or focused
     applicability have found their way into more popular use and are
     now considered cultural categories. A good example is the periodic
     table in chemistry, which Mendeleev developed in 1869 as a new
     system of categories for the chemical elements. The periodic table
     proved essential to scientists in understanding their properties and
     in predicting undiscovered ones. Today the periodic table is taught
     in elementary schools, and many things other than elements are
     commonly arranged using a graphical structure that resembles the
     periodic table of elements in chemistry, including sci-fi films and
     movies, desserts, and superheroes.20

   A "Categorization Continuum"

     As we have seen, the concepts of cultural, individual, and
     institutional categorization usefully distinguish the primary
     processes and purposes when people create categories. However,
     these three kinds of categories can fuse, clash, and recombine with

20. Unfortunately, in this transition from science to popular
     culture, many of these so-called periodic tables are just
     ad hoc collections that ignore the essential idea that the
     rows and columns capture explanatory principles about
     resource properties that vary in a periodic manner. A
     notable exception is Andrew Plotkin's Periodic Table of
     Dessert. See (Suehle 2012) and Plotkin's table at (Periodic
     Table of Dessert).

                                                          The What and Why of Categories | 633
each other. Rather than viewing them as having precise boundaries,
we might view them as regions on a continuum of categorization
activities and methods.

Consider a few different perspectives on categorizing animals as
an example. Scientific institutions categorize animals according to
explicit, principled classification systems, such as the Linnaean
taxonomy that assigns animals to a phylum, class, order, family,
genus and species. Cultural categorization practices cannot be
adequately described in terms of a master taxonomy, and are more
fluid, converging with principled taxonomies sometimes, and
diverging at other times. While human beings are classified within
the animal kingdom in biological classification systems, people are
usually not considered animals in most cultural contexts.
Sometimes a scientific designation for human beings, homo sapiens
is even applied to human beings in cultural contexts, since the
genus-species taxonomic designation has influenced cultural
conceptions of people and (other) animals over the years.

Animals are also often culturally categorized as pets or non-pets.
The category "pets" commonly includes dogs, cats, and fish. A pet
cat might be categorized at multiple levels that incorporate
individual, cultural, and institutional perspectives on
categorization--as an "animal" (cultural/institutional), as a
"mammal" (institutional), as a "domestic short-hair" (institutional) as
a "cat" (cultural), and as a "troublemaker" or a "favorite" (individual),
among other possibilities, in addition to being identified individually
by one or more pet names. Furthermore, not everyone experiences
pets as just dogs, cats and fish. Some people have relatively unusual
pets, like pigs. For individuals who have pet pigs or who know
people with pet pigs, "pigs" may be included in the "pets" category.
If enough people have pet pigs, eventually "pigs" could be included
in mainstream culture's pet category.

Categorization skewed toward cultural perspectives incorporate
relatively traditional categories, such as those learned implicitly

634 | The What and Why of Categories
from social interactions, like mainstream understandings of what
kinds of animals are "pets," while categorization skewed toward
institutional perspectives emphasizes explicit, formal categories,
like the categories employed in biological classification systems.

          CAFE Standards: Blurring the Lines Between
       Categorization Perspectives

          The Corporate Average Fuel Economy(CAFE) standards
       sort vehicles into "passenger car" and "light truck"
       categories and impose higher minimum fuel efficiency
       requirements for cars because trucks have different
       typical uses.

          When CAFE standards were introduced, the vehicles
       classified as light trucks were generally used for "light
       duty" farming and manufacturing purposes. "Light
       trucks" might be thought of as a "sort of" in-between
       category--a light truck is not really a car, but sufficiently
       unlike a prototypical truck to qualify the vehicle's
       categorization as "light." Formalizing this sense of in-
       between-ness by specifying features that define a "car"
       and a "light truck" is the only way to implement a
       consistent, transparent fuel efficiency policy that makes
       use of informal, graded distinctions between vehicles.

          A manufacturer whose average fuel economy for all
       the vehicles it sells in a year falls below the CAFE
       standards has to pay penalties. This encourages them to
       produce "sport utility vehicles" (SUVs) that adhere to
       the CAFE definitions of light trucks but which most
       people use as passenger cars. Similarly, the PT Cruiser, a
       retro-styled hatchback produced by Chrysler from
       2000-2010, strikes many people as a car. It looks like a

                                                   The What and Why of Categories | 635
            car; we associate it with the transport of passengers
            rather than with farming; and in fact it is formally
            classified as a car under emissions standards. But like
            SUVs, in the CAFE classification system, the PT Cruiser
            is a light truck.

               CAFE standards have evolved over time, becoming a
            theater for political clashes between holistic cultural
            categories and formal institutional categories, which
            plays out in competing pressures from industry,
            government, and political organizations. Furthermore,
            CAFE standards and manufacturers' response to them
            are influencing cultural categories, such that our
            cultural understanding of what a car looks like is
            changing over time as manufacturers design vehicles
            like the PT Cruiser with car functionality in
            unconventional shapes to take advantage of the CAFE
            light truck specifications.21

    have been developed by the United States National
    Highway Traffic Safety Administration

    politics of categorization for vehicles like the PT Cruiser,

     636 | The What and Why of Categories
Computational Categories

Computational categories are created by computer programs when
the number of resources, or when the number of descriptions or
observations associated with each resource, are so large that people
cannot think about them effectively. Computational categories are
created for information retrieval, predictive analytics, and other
applications where information scale or speed requirements are
critical. The resulting categories are similar to those created by
people in some ways but differ substantially in other ways.

The simplest kind of computational categories can be created using
descriptive statistics (see "Organizing With Descriptive Statistics").
Descriptive statistics do not identify the categories they create by
giving them familiar cultural or institutional labels. Instead, they
create implicit categories of items according to how much they
differ from the most typical or frequent ones. For example, in any
dataset where the values follow the normal distribution, statistics
of central tendency and dispersion serve as standard reference
measures for any observation. These statistics identify categories
of items that are very different or statistically unlikely outliers,
which could be signals of measurement errors, poorly calibrated
equipment, employees who are inadequately trained or committing
fraud, or other problems. The "Six Sigma" methodology for process
improvement and quality control rests on this idea that careful
and consistent collection of statistics can make any measurable
operation better.

Many text processing methods and applications use simple
statistics to categorize words by their frequency in a language, in
a collection of documents, or in individual documents, and these
categories are exploited in many information retrieval applications
(see "Interactions Based on Instance Properties" and "Interactions
Based on Collection Properties").

                                                   The What and Why of Categories | 637
          Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
          Two subfields of machine learning that are relevant to
       organizing systems are supervised and unsupervised
       learning. In supervised learning, a machine learning
       program is trained with sample items or documents that
       are labeled by category, and the program learns to
       assign new items to the correct categories. In
       unsupervised learning, the program gets the same items
       but has to come up with the categories on its own by
       discovering the underlying correlations between the
       items; that is why unsupervised learning is sometimes
       called statistical pattern recognition.

Categories that people create and label also can be used more
explicitly in computational algorithms and applications. In
particular, a program that can assign an item or instance to one
or more existing categories is called a classifier. The subfield of
computer science known as machine learning is home to numerous
techniques for creating classifiers by training them with already
correctly categorized examples. This training is called supervised
learning; it is supervised because it starts with instances labeled by
category, and it involves learning because over time the classifier
improves its performance by adjusting the weights for features that
distinguish the categories. But strictly speaking, supervised learning
techniques do not learn the categories; they implement and apply
categories that they inherit or are given to them. We will further
discuss the computational implementation of categories created by
people in "Implementing Categories".

In contrast, many computational techniques in machine learning
can analyze a collection of resources to discover statistical
regularities or correlations among the items, creating a set of

638 | The What and Why of Categories
categories without any labeled training data. This is called
unsupervised learning or statistical pattern recognition. As we
pointed out in "Cultural Categories", we learn most of our cultural
categories without any explicit instruction about them, so it is not
surprising that computational models of categorization developed
by cognitive scientists often employ unsupervised statistical
learning methods.

Many computational categories are like individual categories
because they are tied to specific collections of resources or data
and are designed to satisfy narrow goals. The individual categories
you use to organize your email inbox or the files on your computer
reflect your specific interests, activities, and personal network and
are surely different than those of anyone else. Similarly, your credit
card company analyzes your specific transactions to create
computational categories of "likely good" and "likely fraudulent" that
are different for every cardholder.

This focused scope is obvious when we consider how we might
describe a computational category. "Fraudulent transaction for
cardholder 4264123456780123" is not lexicalized with a one-word
label as familiar cultural categories are. "Door" and "window" have
broad scopes that are not tied to a single purpose. Put another way,
the "door" and "window" cultural categories are highly reusable,
as are institutional categories like those used to collect economic
or health data that can be analyzed for many different purposes.
The definitions of "door" and "window" might be a little fuzzy, but
institutional categories are more precisely defined, often by law or
regulation. Examples are the North American Industry Classification
System(NAICS) from the US Census Bureau and the United Nations
Standard Products and Services Code(UNSPC).

A final contrast between categories created by people and those
created computationally is that the former can almost always be
inspected and reasoned about by other people, but only some of the
latter can. A computational model that categorizes loan applicants

                                                   The What and Why of Categories | 639
as good or poor credit risks probably uses properties like age,
income, home address, and marital status, so that a banker can
understand and explain a credit decision. However, many other
computational categories, especially those that created by
clustering and deep learning techniques, are inseparable from the
mathematical model that learned to use them, and as a result are
uninterpretable by people.
A machine learning algorithm for classifying objects in images
creates a complex multi-layer neural network whose features have
no clear relationship to the categories, and this network has no
other use. Put another way, machine learning programs are very
general because they can be employed in any domain with high
dimensional data, but what they learn cannot be applied in any
other domain.

47. Principles for Creating
Categories

"The What and Why of Categories" explained what categories are
and the contrasting cultural, individual, and institutional contexts
and purposes for which categories are created. In doing so, a
number of different principles for creating categories were
mentioned, mostly in passing.

We now take a systematic look at principles for creating categories,
including enumeration, single properties, multiple properties and
hierarchy, probabilistic, similarity, and theory- and goal-based
categorization. These ways of creating categories differ in the
information and mechanisms they use to determine category
membership.

Enumeration

The simplest principle for creating a category is enumeration; any
resource in a finite or countable set can be deemed a category
member by that fact alone. This principle is also known as
extensional definition, and the members of the set are called the
extension. Many institutional categories are defined by enumeration
as a set of possible or legal values, like the 50 United States or the
ISO currency codes (ISO 4217).

Enumerative categories enable membership to be unambiguously
determined because a value like a state name or currency code is
either a member of the category or it is not. However, this clarity
has a downside; it makes it hard to argue that something not

   member of the category, which can make laws or regulations
   inflexible. Moreover, there comes a size when enumerative
   definition is impractical or inefficient, and the category either must
   be sub-divided or be given a definition based on principles other
   than enumeration.1

             Too Many Planets to Enumerate:
             Keeping up with Kepler
             Kepler is a space observatory launched by NASA in
          2009 to search for Earth-like planets orbiting other
          stars in our own Milky Way galaxy. Kepler has already
          discovered and verified a few thousand new planets, and
          these results have led to estimates that there may be at
          least as many planets as there are stars, a few hundred
          billion in the Milky Way alone. Count fast.

   For example, for millennia we earthlings have had a cultural

  category membership and whether a list of category
  members is exhaustive or merely illustrative. The legal
  principle of "implied exclusion"--expressio unius est
  exclusio alterius --says that if you "expressly name" or
  "designate" an enumeration of one or more things, any
  thing that is not named is excluded, by implication.
  However, prefacing the list with "such as," "including," or
  "like" implies that it is not a strict enumeration because
  there might be other members.

   category of "planet" as a "wandering" celestial object, and because
   we only knew of planets in our own solar system, the planet
   category was defined by enumeration: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
   Jupiter, and Saturn. When the outer planets of Uranus, Neptune,
   and Pluto were identified as planets in the 18th-20th centuries, they
   were added to this list of planets without any changes in the cultural
   category. But in the last couple of decades many heretofore
   unknown planets outside our solar system have been detected,
   making the set of planets unbounded, and definition by
   enumeration no longer works.

   The International Astronomical Union(IAU) thought it solved this
   category crisis by proposing a definition of planet as "a celestial
   body that is (a) in orbit around a star, (b) has sufficient mass for
   its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes
   a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared
   the neighborhood around its orbit." Unfortunately, Pluto does not
   satisfy the third requirement, so it no longer is a member of the
   planet category, and instead is now called an "inferior planet."

   Changing the definition of a significant cultural category generated
   a great deal of controversy and angst among ordinary non-scientific
   people. A typical headline was "Pluto's demotion has schools
   spinning," describing the outcry from elementary school students
   and teachers about the injustice done to Pluto and the disruption on
   the curriculum. 2

2. International Astronomical Union(IAU) (iau.org)
   published its new definition of planet in August 2006. A
   public television documentary in 2011 called The Pluto
   Files retells the story (Tyson 2011).

  Single Properties

   It is intuitive and useful to think in terms of properties when we
   identify instances and when we are describing instances (as we saw
   in "Resource Identity" and in Resource Description and Metadata).
   Therefore, it should also be intuitive and useful to consider
   properties when we analyze more than one instance to compare
   and contrast them so we can determine which sets of instances
   can be treated as a category or equivalence class. Categories whose
   members are determined by one or more properties or rules follow
   the principle of intensional definition, and the defining properties
   are called the intension.

   You might be thinking here that enumeration or extensional
   definition of a category is also a property test; is not "being a state"
   a property of California? But statehood is not a property precisely
   because "state" is defined by extension, which means the only way
   to test California for statehood is to see if it is in the list of states.3

   Any single property of a resource can be used to create categories,
   and the easiest ones to use are often the intrinsic static properties.
   As we discussed in Resource Description and Metadata, intrinsic
   static properties are those inherent in a resource that never change.
   The material of composition of natural or manufactured objects is
   an intrinsic and static property that can be used to arrange physical
   resources. For example, an organizing system for a personal
   collection of music that is based on the intrinsic static property of

3. The distinction between intension and extension was
   introduced by Gottlob Frege, a German philosopher and
   mathematician (Frege 1892).

    644 | Principles for Creating Categories
   physical format might use categories for CDs, DVDs, vinyl albums,
   8-track cartridges, reel-to-reel tape, and tape cassettes.4

   Using a single property is most natural to do when the properties
   can take on only a small set of discrete values like music formats,
   and especially when the property is closely related to how the
   resources are used, as they are with the music collection where
   each format requires different equipment to listen to the music.
   Each value then becomes a subcategory of the music category.

   The author, date, and location where an intellectual resource was
   created cannot be directly perceived but they are also intrinsic
   static properties. The subject matter or purpose of a resource, its
   "what it is about" or "what it was originally for," are also intrinsic
   static properties that are not directly perceivable, especially for
   information resources.

   The name or identifier of a resource is often arbitrary but once
   assigned normally does not change, making it an extrinsic static

4. The number of resources in each of these categories
   depends on the age of the collection and the collector.
   We could be more precise here and say "single atomic
   property" or otherwise more carefully define "property"
   in this context as a characteristic that is basic and not
   easily or naturally decomposable into other
   characteristics. It would be possible to analyze the
   physical format of a music resource as a composition of
   size, shape, weight, and material substance properties,
   but that is not how people normally think. Instead, they
   treat physical format as a single property as we do in this
   example.

                                                      Principles for Creating Categories | 645
   property. Any collection of resources with alphabetic or numeric
   identifiers as an associated property can use sorting order as an
   organizing principle to arrange spices, books, personnel records,
   etc., in a completely reliable way. Some might argue whether this
   organizing principle creates a category system, or whether it simply
   exploits the ordering inherent in the identifier notation. For
   example, with alphabetic identifiers, we can think of alphabetic
   ordering as creating a recursive category system with 26 (A-Z) top-
   level categories, each containing the same number of second-level
   categories, and so on until every instance is assigned to its proper
   place.5

   Some resource properties are both extrinsic and dynamic because
   they are based on usage or behaviors that can be highly context-
   dependent. The current owner or location of a resource, its
   frequency of access, the joint frequency of access with other
   resources, or its current rating or preference with respect to
   alternative resources are typical extrinsic and dynamic properties
   that can be the basis for arranging resources and defining
   categories.

   These properties can have a large number of values or are
   continuous measures, but as long as there are explicit rules for
   using property values to determine category assignment the
   resulting categories are still easy to understand and use. For
   example, we naturally categorize people we know on the basis of

5. We need to think of alphabetic ordering or any other
   organizing principle in a logical way that does not imply
   any particular physical implementation. Therefore, we do
   not need to consider which of these alphabetic
   categories exist as folders, files, or other tangible
   partitions.

    646 | Principles for Creating Categories
   their current profession, the city where they live, their hobbies, or
   their age. Properties with a numerical dimension like "frequency
   of use" are often transformed into a small set of categories like
   "frequently used," "occasionally used," and "rarely used" based on
   the numerical property values.6

   There is an infinite number of logically expressible properties for
   any resource, but most of them would not lead to categories that
   would be interpretable and useful for people. If people are going
   to use the categories, it is important to base them on properties
   that are psychologically or pragmatically relevant for the resource
   domain being categorized. Whether something weighs more or less
   than 5000 pounds is a poor property to apply to things in general,
   because it puts cats and chairs in one category, and buses and
   elephants in another.7

   To summarize: The most useful single properties to use for creating
   categories for an organizing system used by people are those that
   are formally assigned, objectively measurable and orderable, or tied

6. Another example: rules for mailing packages might use
   either size or weight to calculate the shipping cost, and
   whether these rules are based on specific numerical
   values or ranges of values, the intent seems to be to
   create categories of packages.

7. If you try hard, you can come up with situations in which
   this property is important, as when the circus is coming
   to the island on a ferry or when you are loading an
   elevator with a capacity limit of 5000 pounds, but it just
   is not a useful or psychologically salient property in most
   contexts.

to well-established cultural categories, because the resulting
categories will be easier to understand and describe.

If only a single property is used to distinguish among some set of
resources and to create the categories in an organizing system, the
choice of property is critical because different properties often lead
to different categories. Using the age property, Bill Gates and Mark
Zuckerberg are unlikely to end up in the same category of people.
Using the wealth property, they most certainly would. Furthermore,
if only one property is used to create a system of categories, any
category with a large numbers of items in it will lack coherence
because differences on other properties will be too apparent, and
some category members will not fit as well as the others.

Multiple Properties

Organizing systems often use multiple properties to define
categories. There are three different ways in which to do this that
differ in the scope of the properties and how essential they are in
defining the categories.

Multi-Level or Hierarchical Categories

If you have many shirts in your closet (and you are a bit compulsive
or a "neat freak"), instead of just separating your shirts from your
pants using a single property (the part of body on which the clothes
are worn) you might arrange the shirts by style, and then by sleeve
length, and finally by color. When all of the resources in an
organizing system are arranged using the same sequence of
resource properties, this creates a logical hierarchy, a multi-level
category system.

If we treat all the shirts as the collection being organized, in the

648 | Principles for Creating Categories
   shirt organizing system the broad category of shirts is first divided
   by style into categories like "dress shirts," "work shirts," "party
   shirts," and "athletic or sweatshirts." Each of these style categories
   is further divided until the categories are very narrow ones, like the
   "white long-sleeve dress shirts" category. A particular shirt ends up
   in this last category only after passing a series of property tests
   along the way: it is a dress shirt, it has long sleeves, and it is white.
   Each test creates more precise categories in the intersections of the
   categories whose members passed the prior property tests.

   Put another way, each subdivision of a category takes place when
   we identify or choose a property that differentiates the members
   of the category in a way that is important or useful for some intent
   or purpose. Shirts differ from pants in the value of the "part of
   body" property, and all the shirt subcategories share this "top part"
   value of that property. However, shirts differ on other properties
   that determine the subcategory to which they belong. Even as we
   pay attention to these differentiating properties, it is important
   to remember the other properties, the ones that members of a
   category at any level in the hierarchy have in common with the
   members of the categories that contain it. These properties are
   often described as "inherited" or "inferred" from the broader
   category.8 For example, just as every shirt shares the "worn on top
   part of body" property, every item of clothing shares the "can be
   worn on the body" property, and every resource in the "shirts" and
   "pants" category inherits that property.

8. Many information systems, applications, and
   programming languages that work with hierarchical
   categories take advantage of this logical relationship to
   infer inherited properties when they are needed rather
   than storing them redundantly.

                                                      Principles for Creating Categories | 649
Each differentiating property creates another level in the category
hierarchy, which raises an obvious question: How many properties
and levels do we need? In order to answer this question, we must
reflect upon the shirt categories in our closet. Our organizing
system for shirts arranges them with the three properties of style,
sleeve length, and color; some of the categories at the lowest level
of the resulting hierarchy might have only one member, or no
members at all. You might have yellow or red short-sleeved party
shirts, but probably do not have yellow or red long-sleeved dress
shirts, making them empty categories. Obviously, any category with
only one member does not need any additional properties to tell
the members apart, so a category hierarchy is logically complete if
every resource is in a category by itself.

However, even when the lowest level categories of our shirt
organizing system have more than one member, we might choose
not to use additional properties to subdivide it because the
differences that remain among the members do not matter to us for
the interactions the organizing system needs to support. Suppose
we have two long-sleeve white dress shirts from different shirt
makers, but whenever we need to wear one of them, we ignore this
property. Instead, we just pick one or the other, treating the shirts
as completely equivalent or substitutable. When the remaining
differences between members of a category do not make a
difference to the users of the category, we can say that the
organizing system is pragmatically or practically complete even if it
is not yet logically complete. That is to say, it is complete "for all
intents and purposes." Indeed, we might argue that it is desirable to
stop subdividing a system of categories while there are some small
differences remaining among the items in each category because
this leaves some flexibility or logical space in which to organize new
items. This point might remind you of the concept of overfitting,
where models with many parameters can very accurately fit their
training data, but as a result generalize less well to new data. (See
"Resource Description for Sensemaking and Science".)

650 | Principles for Creating Categories
On the other hand, consider the shirt section of a big department
store. Shirts there might be organized by style, sleeve length, and
color as they are in our home closet, but would certainly be further
organized by shirt maker and by size to enable a shopper to find
a Marc Jacobs long-sleeve blue dress shirt of size 15/35. The
department store organizing system needs more properties and
a deeper hierarchy for the shirt domain because it has a much
larger number of shirt instances to organize and because it needs to
support many shirt shoppers, not just one person whose shirts are
all the same size.

          The swimsuits worn by surfers, called "boardshorts,"
       have evolved from purely functional garments to
       symbols of extreme sports and the Hawaiian lifestyle. A
       2012 exhibition at the Honolulu Museum of Art captured
       the diversity of boardshorts on three facets: their

       waist, and their length.

Different Properties for Subsets of Resources

A different way to use multiple resource properties to create
categories in an organizing system is to employ different properties
for distinct subsets of the resources being organized. This contrasts
with the strict multi-level approach in which every resource is
evaluated with respect to every property. Alternatively, we could
view this principle as a way of organizing multiple domains that are
conceptually or physically adjacent, each of which has a separate set
of categories based on properties of the resources in that domain.
This principle is used for most folder structures in computer file
systems and by many email applications; you can create as many
folder categories as you want, but any resource can only be placed
in one folder.

The contrasts between intrinsic and extrinsic properties, and
between static and dynamic ones, are helpful in explaining this
method of creating organizing categories. For example, you might
organize all of your clothes using intrinsic static properties if you
keep your shirts, socks, and sweaters in different drawers and
arrange them by color; extrinsic static properties if you share your
front hall closet with a roommate, so you each use only one side
of that closet space; intrinsic dynamic properties if you arrange
your clothes for ready access according to the season; and, extrinsic

652 | Principles for Creating Categories
   dynamic properties if you keep your most frequently used jacket
   and hat on a hook by the front door.9
   If we relax the requirement that different subsets of resources use
   different organizing properties and allow any property to be used to
   describe any resource, the loose organizing principle we now have
   is often called tagging. Using any property of a resource to create
   a description is an uncontrolled and often unprincipled principle
   for creating categories, but it is increasingly popular for organizing
   photos, web sites, email messages in gmail, or other web-based
   resources. We discuss tagging in more detail in "Tagging of Web-
   based Resources".

              A Supermarket Map

9. Similarly, clothing stores use intrinsic static properties
   when they present merchandise arranged according to
   color and size; extrinsic static properties when they host
   branded displays of merchandise; intrinsic dynamic
   properties when they set aside a display for seasonal
   merchandise, from bathing suits to winter boots; and
   extrinsic dynamic properties when a display area is set
   aside for "Today's Special."

          A typical supermarket embodies a surprisingly
       complex classification system. Each section of the store
       employs a different set of properties to arrange its
       resources, and some properties such as perishability
       and onsite preparation are important in more than one
       section.

Necessary and Sufficient Properties

A large set of resources does not always require many properties
and categories to organize it. Some types of categories can be
defined precisely with just a few essential properties. For example, a
prime number is a positive integer that has no divisors other than 1
and itself, and this category definition perfectly distinguishes prime
and not-prime numbers no matter how many numbers are being
654 | Principles for Creating Categories
     categorized. "Positive integer" and "divisible only by 1 and itself" are
     necessary or defining properties for the prime number category;
     every prime number must satisfy these properties. These properties
     are also sufficient to establish membership in the prime number
     category; any number that satisfies the necessary properties is a
     prime number. Categories defined by necessary and sufficient
     properties are also called monothetic. They are also sometimes
     called classical categories because they conform to Aristotle's theory
     of how categories are used in logical deduction using syllogisms.10
     (See the sidebar, The Classical View of Categories.)

     Theories of categorization have evolved a great deal since Plato and
     Aristotle proposed them over two thousand years ago, but in many
     ways we still adhere to classical views of categories when we create
     organizing systems because they can be easier to implement and
     maintain that way.

     An important implication of necessary and sufficient category
     definition is that every member of the category is an equally good
     member or example of the category; every prime number is equally
     prime. Institutional category systems often employ necessary and
     sufficient properties for their conceptual simplicity and
     straightforward implementation in decision trees, database
     schemas,and programming language classes.

                The Classical View of Categories

10. Aristotle did not call them classical categories. That label
    was bestowed about 2300 years later by (Smith and
    Medin 1981).

                                                        Principles for Creating Categories | 655
          The classical view is that categories are defined by
       necessary and sufficient properties. This theory has
       been enormously influential in Western thought, and is
       embodied in many organizing systems, especially those
       for information resources. However, as we will explain,
       we cannot rely on this principle to create categories in
       many domains and contexts because there are not
       necessary and sufficient properties. As a result, many
       psychologists, cognitive scientists, and computer
       scientists who think about categorization have criticized
       the classical theory.

          We think this is unfair to Aristotle, who proposed
       what we now call the classical theory primarily to
       explain how categories underlie the logic of deductive
       reasoning: All men are mortal; Socrates is a man;
       Therefore, Socrates is mortal. People are wrong to turn
       Aristotle's thinking around and apply it to the problem
       of inductive reasoning, how categories are created in
       the first place. But this is not Aristotle's fault; he was not
       trying to explain how natural cultural categories arise.

Consider the definition of an address as requiring a street, city,
governmental region, and postal code. Anything that has all of these
information components is therefore considered to be a valid
address, and anything that lacks any of them will not be considered
to be a valid address. If we refine the properties of an address
to require the governmental region to be a state, and specifically
one of the United States Postal Service's list of official state and
territory codes, we create a subcategory for US addresses that uses
an enumerated category as part of its definition. Similarly, we could
create a subcategory for Canadian addresses by exchanging the

656 | Principles for Creating Categories
    name "province" for state, and using an enumerated list of Canadian
    province and territory codes.

  The Limits of Property-Based Categorization

    Property-based categorization works tautologically well for
    categories like "prime number" where the category is defined by
    necessary and sufficient properties. Property-based categorization
    also works well when properties are conceptually distinct and the
    value of a property is easy to perceive and examine, as they are with
    man-made physical resources like shirts.

    Historical experience with organizing systems that need to
    categorize information resources has shown that basing categories
    on easily perceived properties is often not effective. There might be
    indications "on the surface" that suggest the "joints" or boundaries
    between types of information resources, but these are often just
    presentation or packaging choices, That is to say, neither the size
    of a book nor the color of its cover are reliable cues for what
    it contains. Information resources have numerous descriptive
    properties like their title, author, and publisher that can be used
    more effectively to define categories, and these are certainly useful
    for some kinds of interactions, like finding all of the books written
    by a particular author or published by the same publisher. However,
    for practical purposes, the most useful property of an information
    resource is its aboutness, which may not be objectively perceivable
    and which is certainly hard to characterize.11 Any collection of

information resources in a library or document filing system is likely
to be about many subjects and topics, and when an individual
resource is categorized according to a limited number of its content

others.

When the web first started, there were many attempts to create
categories of web sites, most notably by Yahoo! As the web grew,
it became obvious that search engines would be vastly more useful
because their near real-time text indexes obviate the need for a
priori assignment of web pages to categories. Rather, web search

engines represent each web page or document in a way that treats
each word or term they contain as a separate property.

Considering every distinct word in a document stretches our notion
of property to make it very different from the kinds of properties
we have discussed so far, where properties were being explicitly
used by people to make decisions about category membership and
resource organization. It is just not possible for people to pay
attention to more than a few properties at the same time even if
they want to, because that is how human perceptual and cognitive
machinery works. But computers have no such limitations, and
algorithms for information retrieval and machine learning can use
huge numbers of properties, as we will see later in this chapter and
in Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories and Interactions
with Resources.

Probabilistic Categories and "Family
Resemblance"

As we have seen, some categories can be precisely defined using
necessary and sufficient features, especially when the properties
that determine category membership are easy to observe and
evaluate. Something is either a prime number or it isn't. A person
cannot be a registered student and not registered at the same time.

However, categorization based on explicit and logical consideration
of properties is much less effective, and sometimes not even
possible for domains where properties lack one or more of the
characteristics of separability, perceptibility, and necessity. Instead,
we need to categorize using properties in a probabilistic or
statistical way to come up with some measure of resemblance or
similarity between the resource to be categorized and the other
members of the category.

660 | Principles for Creating Categories
Consider a familiar category like "bird." All birds have feathers,
wings, beaks, and two legs. But there are thousands of types of
birds, and they are distinguished by properties that some birds have
that other birds lack: most birds can fly, most are active in the
daytime, some swim, some swim underwater; some have webbed
feet. These properties are correlated or clustered, a consequence
of natural selection that conveys advantages to particular
configurations of characteristics, and there are many different
clusters; birds that live in trees have different wings and feet than
those that swim, and birds that live in deserts have different
colorations and metabolisms that those that live near water. So
instead of being defined by a single set of properties that are both
necessary and sufficient, the bird category is defined
probabilistically, which means that decisions about category
membership are made by accumulating evidence from the
properties that are more or less characteristic of the category.

Categories of information resources often have the same
probabilistic character. The category of spam messages is suggested
by the presence of particular words (beneficiary, pharmaceutical)
but these words also occur in messages that are not spam. A spam
classifier uses the probabilities of each word in a message in spam
and non-spam contexts to calculate an overall likelihood that the
message is spam.

There are three related consequences for categories when their
characteristic properties have a probabilistic distribution:

  · The first is an effect of typicality or centrality that makes some
      members of the category better examples than others.
      Membership in probabilistic categories is not all or none, so
      even if they share many properties, an instance that has more
      of the characteristic properties will be judged as better or more

           typical.12 Try to define "bird" and then ask yourself if all of
           the things you classify as birds are equally good examples of
           the category (look at the six birds in Family Resemblance and
           Typicality). This effect is also described as gradience in category
           membership and reflects the extent to which the most
           characteristic properties are shared.

       · A second consequence is that the sharing of some but not
           all properties creates what we call family resemblances among
           the category members; just as biological family members do
           not necessarily all share a single set of physical features but
           still are recognizable as members of the same family. This idea
           was first proposed by the 20th-century philosopher Ludwig
           Wittgenstein, who used "games" as an example of a category
           whose members resemble each other according to shifting
           property subsets.13

       · The third consequence, when categories do not have necessary
           features for membership, is that the boundaries of the category
           are not fixed; the category can be stretched and new members
           assigned as long as they resemble incumbent members.

12. Typicality and centrality effects were studied by Rosch
    and others in numerous highly influential experiments in
    the 1970s and 1980s (Rosch 1975). Good summaries can
    be found in (Mervis and Rosch 1981), (Rosch 1999), and in
    Chapter 1 of (Rogers and McClelland 2008).

    "game" is (Wittgenstein 2002) in a collection of core

           no trouble recognizing them as games and neither would
           Wittgenstein, were he alive. Recall that in Foundations for
           Organizing Systems we pointed out that the cultural category
           of "library" has been repeatedly extended by new properties, as
           when Flickr is described as a web-based photo-sharing library.
           Categories defined by family resemblance or multiple and
           shifting property sets are termed polythetic.

               What Is a Game?
               Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) was a philosopher
            who thought deeply about mathematics, the mind, and
            language. In 1999, his Philosophical Investigations was
            ranked as the most important book of 20th-century
            philosophy in a poll of philosophers.14 In that book,
            Wittgenstein uses "game" to argue that many concepts
            have no defining properties, and that instead there is a
            "complicated network of similarities overlapping and
            criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities,
            sometimes similarities of detail." He contrasts board
            games, card games, ball games, games of skill, games of
            luck, games with competition, solitary games, and
            games for amusement. Wittgenstein notes that not all
            games are equally good examples of the category, and
            jokes about teaching children a gambling game with dice
            because he knows that this is not the kind of game that

            teach their children a game.15

     We conclude that instead of using properties one at a time to assign
     category membership, we can use them in a composite or
     integrated way where together a co-occurring cluster of properties
     provides evidence that contributes to a similarity calculation.
     Something is categorized as an A and not a B if it is more similar to
     A's best or most typical member rather than it is to B's.16

15. It might be possible to define "game,"but it requires a
    great deal of abstraction that obscures the "necessary
    and sufficient" tests. "To play a game is to engage in
    activity directed toward bringing about a specific state
    of affairs, using only means permitted by specific rules,
    where the means permitted by the rules are more
    limited in scope than they would be in the absence of
    the rules, and where the sole reason for accepting such
    limitation is to make possible such activity." (Suits 1967)

16. The exact nature of the category representation to which
    the similarity comparison is made is a subject of ongoing
    debate in cognitive science. Is it a prototype, a central
    tendency or average of the properties shared by category
    members, or it one or more exemplars, particular
    members that typify the category. Or is it neither, as

  Similarity

    Similarity is a measure of the resemblance between two things that
    share some characteristics but are not identical. It is a very flexible
    notion whose meaning depends on the domain within which we
    apply it. Some people consider that the concept of similarity is
    itself meaningless because there must always be some basis, some
    unstated set of properties, for determining whether two things are
    similar. If we could identify those properties and how they are used,
    there would not be any work for a similarity mechanism to do.17
    To make similarity a useful mechanism for categorization we have
    to specify how the similarity measure is determined. There are
    four psychologically-motivated approaches that propose different
    functions for computing similarity: feature- or property-based,
    geometry-based, transformational, and alignment- or analogy-
    based. The big contrast here is between models that represent
    items as sets of properties or discrete conceptual features, and

17. Another situation where similarity has been described
    as a "mostly vacuous" explanation for categorization is
    with abstract categories or metaphors. Goldstone says
    "an unrewarding job and a relationship that cannot be
    ended may both be metaphorical prisons... and may seem
    similar in that both conjure up a feeling of being trapped...
    but this feature is almost as abstract as the category to be
    explained." (Goldstone 1994), p. 149.

     666 | Principles for Creating Categories
     those that assume that properties vary on a continuous metric
     space.18

   Feature-based Models of Similarity

     An influential model of feature-based similarity calculation is Amos
     Tversky's contrast model, which matches the features or properties
     of two things and computes a similarity measure according to three
     sets of features:

       · those features they share,

       · those features that the first has that the second lacks, and

       · those features that the second has that the first lacks.

     The similarity based on the shared features is reduced by the two
     sets of distinctive ones. The weights assigned to each set can be
     adjusted to explain judgments of category membership. Another
     commonly feature-based similarity measure is the Jaccard
     coefficient, the ratio of the common features to the total number of
     them. This simple calculation equals zero if there are no overlapping
     features and one if all features overlap. Jaccard's measure is often
     used to calculate document similarity by treating each word as a
     feature.19

18. (Medin, Goldstone, and Gentner 1993) and (Tenenbaum
    and Griffiths 2001).

19. Because Tversky's model separately considers the sets
    of non-overlapping features, it is possible to accurately
    capture similarity judgments when they are not

                                                        Principles for Creating Categories | 667
We often use a heuristic version of feature-based similarity
calculation when we create multi-level or hierarchical category
systems to ensure that the categories at each level are at the same
level of abstraction or breadth. For example, if we were organizing a
collection of musical instruments, it would not seem correct to have
subcategories of "woodwind instruments," "violins," and "cellos"
because the feature-based similarity among the categories is not
the same for all pairwise comparisons among the categories; violins
and cellos are simply too similar to each other to be separate
categories given woodwinds as a category.

Geometric Models of Similarity

Geometric models are a type of similarity framework in which items
whose property values are metric are represented as points in a
multi-dimensional feature- or property-space. The property values
are the coordinates, and similarity is calculated by measuring the
distance between the items.

          Document Similarity

symmetric, i.e., when A is judged more similar to B than
B is to A. This framing effect is well-established in the
psychological literature and many machine learning
algorithms now employ asymmetric measures. (Tversky
1974)

668 | Principles for Creating Categories
          Documents represented as vectors in term space,
       with the angles between them as a measure of their
       similarity.

Geometric similarity functions are commonly used by search
engines; if a query and document are each represented as a vector
of search terms, relevance is determined by the distance between
the vectors in the "term space." The simplified diagram in the
sidebar, Document Similarity, depicts four documents whose
locations in the term space are determined by how many of each
of three terms they contain. The document vectors are normalized
to length 1, which makes it possible to use the cosine of the angle
between any two documents as a measure of their similarity.
Documents d1 and d2 are more similar to each other than
documents d3 and d4, because angle between the former pair () is
smaller than the angle between the latter (). We will discuss how
this works in greater detail in Interactions with Resources.

If the vectors that represent items in a multi-dimensional property

                                                  Principles for Creating Categories | 669
space are of different lengths, instead of calculating similarity using
cosines we need to calculate similarity in a way that more explicitly
considers the differences on each dimension.

          Geometric Distance Functions

          The distance between points 1 and 2 depends on how
       the distance function combines the differences in values
       (A and B) on each dimension.

The diagram in the sidebar, Geometric Distance Functions shows
two different ways of calculating the distance between points 1 and
2 using the differences A and B. The Euclidean distance function
takes the square root of the sum of the squared differences on
each dimension; in two dimensions, this is the familiar Pythagorean
Theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right
triangle, where the exponent applied to the differences is 2. In
contrast, the City Block distance function, so-named because it is
the natural way to measure distances in cities with "gridlike" street
670 | Principles for Creating Categories
plans, simply adds up the differences on each dimension, which is
equivalent to an exponent of 1.

We can interpret the exponent as a weighting function that
determines the relative contribution of each property to the overall
distance or similarity calculation. The choice of exponent depends
on the type of properties that characterize a domain and how
people make category judgments within it. The exponent of 1 in the
City Block function ensures that each property contributes its full
amount. As the exponent grows larger, it magnifies the impact of the
properties on which differences are the largest.

The Chebyshev function takes this to the limit (where the exponent
would be infinity) and defines the distance between two items as
the difference of their values on the single property with the
greatest difference. What this means in practice is that two items
could have similar or even identical values on most properties, but
if they differ much on just one property, they will be treated as very
dissimilar. We can make an analogy to stereotyping or prejudice
when a person is just like you in all ways except for the one property
you view as negative, which then becomes the only one that matters
to you.

At the other extreme, if the exponent is reduced to zero, this treats
each property as binary, either present or absent, and the distance
function becomes a count of the number of times that the value of
the property for one item is different from the value for the other
one. This is called the "Hamming distance."

Transformational Models of Similarity

Transformational models assume that the similarity between two
things is inversely proportional to the complexity of the
transformation required to turn one into the other. The simplest
transformational model of similarity counts the number of

                                                   Principles for Creating Categories | 671
properties that would need to change their values. More generally,
one way to perform the name matching task of determining when
two different strings denote the same person, object, or other
named entity is to calculate the "edit distance" between them; the
number of changes required to transform one into the other.

The simplest calculation just counts the number of insertion,
deletion, and substitution operations and is called the Levenshtein
distance; for example, the distance between "bob" and "book" is two:
insert "o" and change the second "b" to "k". Two strings with a short
edit distance might be variant spellings or misspellings of the same
name, and transformational models that are sensitive to common
typing errors like transposed or duplicated letters are very effective
at spelling correction. Transformational models of similarity are also
commonly used to detect plagiarism and duplicate web pages.20

transformational models of similarity, see (Flach 2012),

   Alignment or Analogy Models of Similarity

     None of the previous types of similarity models works very well
     when comparing things that have lots of internal or relational
     structure. In these cases, calculations based on matching features is
     insufficient; you need to compare features that align because they
     have the same role in structures or relationships. For example, a
     car with a green wheel and a truck with a green hood both share
     the feature green, but this matching feature does not increase their
     similarity much because the car's wheel does not align with the
     truck's hood. On the other hand, analogy lets us say that an atom
     is like the solar system. They have no common properties, but they
     share the relationship of having smaller objects revolving around a
     large one.

     This kind of analogical comparison is especially important in
     problem solving. You might think that experts are good at solving
     problems in their domain of expertise because they have organized
     their knowledge and experience in ways that enable efficient search
     for and evaluation of possible solutions. For example, it is well
     known that chess masters search their memories of previous
     winning positions and the associated moves to decide what to play.
     However, top chess players also organize their knowledge and select
     moves on the basis of abstract similarities that cannot be explained
     in terms of specific positions of chess pieces. This idea that experts
     represent and solve problems at deeper levels than novices do by
     using more abstract principles or domain structure has been
     replicated in many areas. Novices tend to focus more on surface
     properties and rely more on literal similarity.21

21. This explanation for expert-novice differences in
    categorization and problem solving was proposed in (Chi

   Goal-Derived Categories

     Another psychological principle for creating categories is to
     organize resources that go together in order to satisfy a goal.
     Consider the category "Things to take from a burning house," an
     example that cognitive scientist Lawrence Barsalou termed an ad
     hoc or goal-derived category.22

       trouble on the Pyramid game show.

What things would you take from your house if a fire threatened
it?? Possibly your cat, your wallet and checkbook, important papers
like birth certificates and passports, and grandma's old photo album,
and anything else you think is important, priceless, or
irreplaceable--as long as you can carry it. These items have no
discernible properties in common, except for being your most
precious possessions. The category is derived or induced by a
particular goal in some specified context.

Theory-Based Categories

A final psychological principle for creating categories is organizing
things in ways that fit a theory or story that makes a particular
categorization sensible. A theory-based category can win out even
if probabilistic categorization, on the basis of family resemblance
or similarity with respect to visible properties, would lead to a
different category assignment. For example, a theory of phase
change explains why liquid water, ice, and steam are all the same
chemical compound even though they share few visible properties.

Theory-based categories based on origin or causation are especially
important with highly inventive and computational resources

                                                  Principles for Creating Categories | 675
     because unlike natural kinds of physical resources, little or none
     of what they can do or how they behave is visible on the surface
     (see "Affordance and Capability"). Consider all of the different
     appearances and form factors of the resources that we categorize
     as "computers" --their essence is that they all compute, an invisible
     or theory-like principle that does not depend on their visible
     properties.23

23. The emergence of theory-based categorization is an
    important event in cognitive development that has been
    characterized as a shift from "holistic" to "analytic"
    categories or from "surface properties" to "principles."
    See (Carey and Gelman 1991) (Rehder and Hastie 2004).

48. Category Design Issues
and Implications

We have previously discussed the most important principles for
creating categories: resource properties, similarity, and goals. When
we use one or more of these principles to develop a system of
categories, we must make decisions about its depth and breadth.
Here, we examine the idea that some levels of abstraction in a
system of categories are more basic or natural than others. We
also consider how the choices we make affect how we create the
organizing system in the first place, and how they shape our
interactions when we need to find some resources that are
categorized in it.

Category Abstraction and Granularity

We can identify any resource as a unique instance or as a member of
a class of resources. The size of this class--the number of resources
that are treated as equivalent--is determined by the properties or
characteristics we consider when we examine the resources in
some domain. The way we think of a resource domain depends
on context and intent, so the same resource can be thought of
abstractly in some situations and very concretely in others. As we
discussed in Resource Description and Metadata, this influences the
nature and extent of resource description, and as we have seen in
this chapter, it then influences the nature and extent of categories
we can create.

Consider the regular chore of putting away clean clothes. We can
consider any item of clothing as a member of a broad category
whose members are any kind of garment that a person might wear.

                                                                    Category Design Issues and
                                                                                 Implications | 677
   Using one category for all clothing, that is, failing to distinguish
   among the various items in any useful or practical way would likely
   mean that we would keep our clothes in a big unorganized pile.

   However, we cannot wear any random combination of clothing
   items--we need a shirt, a pair of pants, socks, and so on. Clearly,
   our indiscriminate clothing category is too broad for most purposes.
   So instead, most people organize their clothes in more fine-grained
   categories that fit the normal pattern of how they wear clothes.

   This tendency to use specific categories instead of broader ones is a
   general principle that reflects how people organize their experience
   when they see similar, but not identical, examples or events. This
   "size principle" for concept learning, as cognitive scientist Josh
   Tenenbaum describes it, is a preference for the most specific rules
   or descriptions that fit the observations. For example, if you visit
   a zoo and see many different species of animals, your conception
   of what you saw is different than if you visited a kennel that only
   contained dogs. You might say "I saw animals at the zoo," but would
   be more likely to say "I saw dogs at the kennel" because using the
   broad "animal" category to describe your kennel visit conveys less
   of what you learned from your observations there.1

   In "Single Properties" we described an organizing system for the
   shirts in our closet, so let us talk about socks instead. When it comes
   to socks, most people think that the basic unit is a pair because they
   always wear two socks at a time. If you are going to need to find
   socks in pairs, it seems sensible to organize them into pairs when
   you are putting them away. Some people might further separate
   their dress socks from athletic ones, and then sort these socks by

  most specific hypothesis that fits the data is a general
  principle of Bayesian learning with random samples.

   678 | Category Design Issues and Implications
   color or material, creating a hierarchy of sock categories analogous
   to the shirt categories in our previous example.

   Questions of resource abstraction and granularity also emerge
   whenever the information systems of different firms, or different
   parts of a firm, need to exchange information or be merged into a
   single system. All parties must define the identity of each thing in
   the same way, or in ways that can be related or mapped to each
   other either manually or electronically.

   For example, how should a business system deal with a customer's
   address? Printed on an envelope, "an address" typically appears
   as a comprehensive, multi-line text object. Inside an information
   system, however, an address is best stored as a set of distinctly
   identifiable information components. This fine-grained
   organization makes it easier to sort customers by city or postal
   codes, for sales and marketing purposes. Incompatibilities in the
   abstraction and granularity of these information components, and
   the ways in which they are presented and reused in documents,
   will cause interoperability problems when businesses need to share
   information.2

   The Universal Business Language(UBL) (mentioned briefly in

2. Consider what happens if two businesses model the
   concept of "address" in a customer database with
   different granularity. One may have a coarse "Address"
   field in the database, which stores a street address, city,
   state, and Zip code all in one block, while the other stores
   the components "StreetAddress," "City," and
   "PostalCode" In separate fields. The more granular model
   can be automatically transformed into the less granular
   one, but not vice versa (Glushko and McGrath 2005).

                                             Category Design Issues and Implications | 679
   "Institutional Semantics") is a library of information components
   designed to enable the creation of business document models that
   span a range of category abstraction. UBL comes equipped with
   XML schemas that define document categories like orders, invoices,
   payments, and receipts that many people are familiar with from
   their personal experiences of shopping and paying bills. However,
   UBL can also be used to design very specific or subordinate level
   transactional document types like "purchase order for industrial
   chemicals when buyer and seller are in different countries," or
   document types at the other end of the abstraction hierarchy like
   "fill-in-the-blank" legal forms for any kind of contract.

   Bowker and Star point out that there is often a pragmatic tradeoff
   between precision and validity when defining categories and
   assigning resources to them, particularly in scientific and other
   highly technical domains. More granular categories make more
   precise classification possible in principle, but highly specialized
   domains might contain instances that are so complex or hard to
   understand that it is difficult to decide where to organize them.3

   As an example of this real-world messiness that resists precise
   classification, Bowker and Star turn to medicine and the World
   Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD),
   a system of categories for cause-of-death reporting. The ICD
   requires that every death be assigned to one and only one category
   out of thousands of possible choices, which facilitates important
   uses such as statistical reporting for public health research.

   In practice, however, doctors often lack conclusive evidence about
   the cause of a particular death, or they identify a number of
   contributing factors, none of which could properly be described as
   the sole cause. In these situations, less precise categories would

   better accommodate the ambiguity, and the aggregate data about
   causes of death would have greater validity. But doctors have to
   use the ICD's precise categories when they sign a death certificate,
   which means they sometimes record the wrong cause of death just
   to get their work done.

   It might seem counterintuitive, but when a system of human-
   generated categories is too complex for people to interpret and
   apply reliably, computational classifiers that compute statistical
   similarity between new and already classified items can outperform
   people.4

4. Statistician and baseball fan Nate Silver rejected a
   complex system that used twenty-six player categories
   for predicting baseball performance because "it required
   as much art as science to figure out what group a player
   belonged in." (Silver 2012, p, 83). His improved system
   used the technique of "nearest neighbor" analysis to
   identify current baseball players whose minor league
   statistics were most similar to the current minor league
   players being evaluated. (See "Categories Created by
   Clustering").

   Silver later became famous for his extremely accurate
   predictions of the 2008 US presidential elections. He is
   the founder and editor of the FiveThirtyEight blog, so
   named because there are 538 senators and
   representatives in the US Congress.

  Basic or Natural Categories

   Category abstraction is normally described in terms of a hierarchy
   of superordinate, basic, and subordinate category levels. "Clothing,"
   for example, is a superordinate category, "shirts" and "socks" are
   basic categories, and "white long-sleeve dress shirts" and "white
   wool hiking socks" are subordinate categories. Members of basic
   level categories like "shirts" and "socks" have many perceptual
   properties in common, and are more strongly associated with motor
   movements than members of superordinate categories. Members of
   subordinate categories have many common properties, but these
   properties are also shared by members of other subordinate
   categories at the same level of abstraction in the category hierarchy.
   That is, while we can identify many properties shared by all "white
   long-sleeve dress shirts," many of them are also properties of "blue
   long-sleeve dress shirts" and "black long-sleeve pullover shirts."

   Psychological research suggests that some levels of abstraction in
   a system of categories are more basic or natural than others.
   Anthropologists have also observed that folk taxonomies invariably
   classify natural phenomena into a five- or six-level hierarchy, with
   one of the levels being the psychologically basic or "real" name
   (such as "cat" or "dog"), as opposed to more abstract names (e.g.
   "mammal") that are used less in everyday life. An implication for
   organizing system design is that basic level categories are highly
   efficient in terms of the cognitive effort they take to create and
   use. A corollary is that classifications with many levels at different
   abstraction levels may be difficult for users to navigate effectively.5

5. (Rosch 1999) calls this the principle of cognitive economy,
   that "what one wishes to gain from one's categories is
   a great deal of information about the environment while

    682 | Category Design Issues and Implications
The Recall / Precision Tradeoff

The abstraction level we choose determines how precisely we
identify resources. When we want to make a general claim, or
communicate that the scope of our interest is broad, we use
superordinate categories, as when we ask, "How many animals are
in the San Diego Zoo?" But we use precise subordinate categories
when we need to be specific: "How many adult emus are in the San
Diego Zoo today?"

If we return to our clothing example, finding a pair of white wool
hiking socks is very easy if the organizing system for socks creates
fine-grained categories. When resources are described or arranged
with this level of detail, a similarly detailed specification of the
resources you are looking for yields precisely what you want. When
you get to the place where you keep white wool hiking socks, you
find all of them and nothing else. On the other hand, if all your
socks are tossed unsorted into a sock drawer, when you go sock
hunting you might not be able to find the socks you want and
you will encounter lots of socks you do not want. But you will not
have put time into sorting them, which many people do not enjoy
doing; you can spend time sorting or searching depending on your
preferences.

If we translate this example into the jargon of information retrieval,
we say that more fine-grained organization reduces recall, the
number of resources you find or retrieve in response to a query, but

conserving finite resources as much as possible. [...] It
is to the organism's advantage not to differentiate one
stimulus from another when that differentiation is
irrelevant to the purposes at hand." (Pages 3-4.)

                                         Category Design Issues and Implications | 683
increases the precision of the recalled set, the proportion of recalled
items that are relevant. Broader or coarse-grained categories
increase recall, but lower precision. We are all too familiar with
this hard bargain when we use a web search engine; a quick one-
word query results in many pages of mostly irrelevant sites, whereas
a carefully crafted multi-word query pinpoints sites with the
information we seek. We will discuss recall, precision, and
evaluation of information retrieval more extensively in Interactions
with Resources.

This mundane example illustrates the fundamental tradeoff
between organization and retrieval. A tradeoff between the
investment in organization and the investment in retrieval persists
in nearly every organizing system. The more effort we put into
organizing resources, the more effectively they can be retrieved.
The more effort we are willing to put into retrieving resources, the
less they need to be organized first. The allocation of costs and
benefits between the organizer and retriever differs according to
the relationship between them. Are they the same person? Who
does the work and who gets the benefit?

Category Audience and Purpose

The ways in which people categorize depend on the goals of
categorization, the breadth of the resources in the collection to
be categorized, and the users of the organizing system. Suppose
that we want to categorize languages. Our first step might be
determining what constitutes a language, since there is no
widespread agreement on what differentiates a language from a
dialect, or even on whether such a distinction exists.

What we mean by "English" and "Chinese" as categories can change
depending on the audience we are addressing and what our purpose

684 | Category Design Issues and Implications
   is, however.6 A language learning school's representation of
   "English" might depend on practical concerns such as how the
   school's students are likely to use the language they learn, or which
   teachers are available. For the purposes of a school teaching global
   languages, and one of the standard varieties of English (i.e., those
   associated with political power), or an amalgamation of several
   standard varieties, might be thought of as a single instance
   ("English") of the category "Languages."

   Similarly, the category structure in which "Chinese" is situated can
   vary with context. While some schools might not conceptualize
   "Chinese" as a category encompassing multiple linguistic varieties,

6. For example, some linguists think of "English" as a broad
   category encompassing multiple languages or dialects,
   such as "Standard British English," "Standard American
   English," and "Appalachian English."

   If we are concerned with linguistic diversity and the
   survival of minority languages, we might categorize some
   languages as endangered in order to mobilize language
   preservation efforts. We could also categorize languages
   in terms of shared linguistic ancestors ("Romance
   languages," for example), in terms of what kinds of sounds
   they make use of, by how well we speak them, by regions
   they are commonly spoken in, whether they are signed or
   unsigned, and so on. We could also expand our definition
   of the languages category to include artificial computer
   languages, or body language, or languages shared by
   people and their pets--or thinking more metaphorically,
   we might include the language of fashion.

                                             Category Design Issues and Implications | 685
but rather as a single instance within the "Languages" category,
another school might teach its students Mandarin, Wu, and
Cantonese as dialects within the language category "Chinese," that
are unified by a single standard writing system. In addition, a linguist
might consider Mandarin, Wu, and Cantonese to be mutually
unintelligible, making them separate languages within the broader
category "Chinese" for the purpose of creating a principled language
classification system.
If people could only categorize in a single way, the Pyramid game
show, where contestants guess what category is illustrated by the
example provided by a clue giver, would pose no challenge. The
creative possibilities provided by categorization allow people to
order the world and refer to interrelationships among conceptions
through a kind of allusive shorthand. When we talk about the
language of fashion, we suggest that in the context of our
conversation, instances like "English," "Chinese," and "fashion" are
alike in ways that distinguish them from other things that we would
not categorize as languages.

686 | Category Design Issues and Implications
49. Implementing Categories

Categories are conceptual constructs that we use in a mostly
invisible way when we talk or think about them. When we organize
our kitchens, closets, or file cabinets using shelves, drawers, and
folders, these physical locations and containers are visible
implementations of our personal category system, but they are not
the categories. This distinction between category design and
implementation is obvious when we follow signs and labels in
libraries or grocery stores to find things, search a product catalog
or company personnel directory, or analyze a set of economic data
assembled by the government from income tax forms. These
institutional categories were designed by people prior to the
assignment of resources to them.

This separation between category creation and category
implementation prompts us to ask how a system of categories can
be implemented. We will not discuss the implementation of
categories in the literal sense of building physical or software
systems that organize resources. Instead, we will take a higher-level
perspective that analyzes the implementation problem to be solved
for the different types of categories discussed in "Principles for
Creating Categories", and then explain the logic followed to assign
resources correctly to them.

Implementing Enumerated Categories

Categories defined by enumeration are easy to implement. The
members or legal values in a set define the category, and testing an
item for membership means looking in the set for it. Enumerated
category definitions are familiar in drop-down menus and form-
filling. You scroll through a list of all the countries in the world to

                                                              Implementing Categories | 687
search for the one you want in a shipping address, and whatever
you select will be a valid country name, because the list is fixed
until a new country is born. Enumerated categories can also be
implemented with associative arrays (also known as hash tables or
dictionaries). With these data structures, a test for set membership
is even more efficient than searching, because it takes the same
time for sets of any size (see "Kinds of Structures").

Implementing Categories Defined by Properties

The most conceptually simple and straightforward implementation
of categories defined by properties adopts the classical view of
categories based on necessary and sufficient features. Because such
categories are prescriptive with explicit and clear boundaries,
classifying items into the categories is objective and deterministic,
and supports a well-defined notion of validation to determine
unambiguously whether some instance is a member of the category.
Items are classified by testing them to determine if they have the
required properties and property values. Tests can be expressed as
rules:

  · If instance X has property P, then X is in category Y.

  · If a home mortgage loan in San Francisco exceeds $625,000,
      then it is classified as a "jumbo" loan by the US Office of Federal
      Housing Oversight.

  · For a number to be classified as prime it must satisfy two rules:
      It must be greater than 1, and have no positive divisors other
      than 1 and itself.

This doesn't mean the property test is always easy; validation might
require special equipment or calculations, and tests for the property
might differ in their cost or efficiency. But given the test results, the

688 | Implementing Categories
   answer is unambiguous. The item is either a member of the category
   or it isn't.1

   A system of hierarchical categories is defined by a sequence of
   property tests in a particular order. The most natural way to
   implement multi-level category systems is with decision trees. A
   simple decision tree is an algorithm for determining a decision by
   making a sequence of logical or property tests. Suppose a bank
   used a sequential rule-based approach to decide whether to give
   someone a mortgage loan.

     · If an applicant's annual income exceeds $100,000, and if the
         monthly loan payment is less than 25% of monthly income,
         approve the mortgage application.

     · Otherwise, deny the loan application.

1. For example, you can test whether a number is prime
  by dividing it by every number smaller than its square
  root, but this algorithm is ridiculously impractical for any
  useful application. Many cryptographic systems multiply
  prime numbers to create encryption keys, counting on
  the difficulty of factoring them to protect the keys; so,
  proving that ever larger numbers are prime is very
  important. See (Crandall and Pomerance 2006).

  If you are wondering why prime numbers aren't
  considered an enumerative category given that every
  number that is prime already exists, it is because we have
  not found all of them yet, and we need to test through to
  infinity.

                                                                 Implementing Categories | 689
This simple decision tree is depicted in Figure: Rule-based Decision
Tree. The rules used by the bank to classify loan applications as
"Approved" or "Denied" have a clear representation in the tree.
The easy interpretation of decision trees makes them a common
formalism for implementing classification models.
Rule-based Decision Tree

In this simple decision tree, a sequence of two tests for the
borrower's annual income and the percentage of monthly income
required to make the loan payment classify the applicants into the
"deny" and "approve" categories.
Nevertheless, any implementation of a category is only
interpretable to the extent that the properties and tests it uses
in its definition and implementation can be understood. Because
natural language is inherently ambiguous, it is not the optimal
representational format for formally defined institutional
690 | Implementing Categories
   categories. Categories defined using natural language can be
   incomplete, inconsistent, or ambiguous because words often have
   multiple meanings. This implementation of the bank's procedure for
   evaluating loans would be hard to interpret reliably:

     · If applicant is wealthy, and then if the monthly payment is an
         amount that the applicant can easily repay, then applicant is
         approved.

   To ensure their interpretability, decision trees are sometimes
   specified using the controlled vocabularies and constrained syntax
   of "simplified writing" or "business rule" systems.

   Artificial languages are a more ambitious way to enable precise
   specification of property-based categories. An artificial language
   expresses ideas concisely by introducing new terms or symbols
   that represent complex ideas along with syntactic mechanisms for
   combining and operating on them. Mathematical notation,
   programming languages, schema languages that define valid
   document instances (see "Specifying Vocabularies and Schemas"),
   and regular expressions that define search and selection patterns
   (see "Controlling Values") are familiar examples of artificial
   languages. It is certainly easier to explain and understand the
   Pythagorean Theorem when it is efficiently expressed as "H2 = A2
   + B2" than with a more verbose natural language expression: "In all
   triangles with an angle such that the sides forming the angle are
   perpendicular, the product of the length of the side opposite the
   angle such that the sides forming the angle are perpendicular with
   itself is equal to the sum of the products of the lengths of the other
   two sides, each with itself."2

2. This example comes from (Perlman 1984), who
   introduced the idea of "natural artificial languages" as

                                                                   Implementing Categories | 691
   Artificial languages for defining categories have a long history in
   philosophy and science. (See the sidebar, Artificial Languages for
   Description and Classification). However, the vast majority of
   institutional category systems are still specified with natural
   language, despite its ambiguities because people usually understand
   the languages they learned naturally better than artificial ones.
   Sometimes this is even intentional to allow institutional categories
   embodied in laws to evolve in the courts and to accommodate
   technological advances.3

3. When the US Congress revised copyright law in 1976 it
   codified a "fair use" provision to allow for some limited
   uses of copyrighted works, but fair use in the digital era
   is vastly different today; website caching to improve
   performance and links that return thumbnail versions
   of images are fair uses that were not conceivable when
   the law was written. A law that precisely defined fair
   uses using contemporary technology would have quickly
   become obsolete, but one written more qualitatively to
   enable interpretation by the courts has remained viable.

    692 | Implementing Categories
   John Wilkins was one of the founders of the British
Royal Society. In 1668 he published An Essay towards a
Real Character and a Philosophical Language in which he
proposed an artificial language for describing a
universal taxonomy of knowledge that used symbol
composition to specify a location in the category
hierarchy. There were forty top level genus categories,
which were further subdivided into differences within
the genus, which were then subdivided into species.
Each genus was a monosyllable of two letters; each
difference added a consonant, and each species added a
vowel.

   This artificial language conveys the meaning of
categories directly from the composition of the
category name. For instance, zi indicates the genus of
beasts, zit would be "rapacious beasts of the dog kind"
whereas zid would be "cloven-footed beast." Adding for
the fourth character an a for species, indicating the
second species in the difference, would give zita for dog
and zida for sheep.

   In The Analytical Language of John Wilkins, Jorge Luis
Borges remarks that Wilkins has many "ambiguities,
redundancies and deficiencies" in the language and
presents as a foil and parody an imagined "Celestial
Empire of Benevolent Knowledge."

                  In its remote pages it is written that
               the animals are divided into: (a)
               belonging to the emperor, (b) embalmed,
               (c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f)

                                                     Implementing Categories | 693
                          fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in
                          the present classification, (i) frenzied, (j)
                          innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine
                          camel hair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having
                          just broken the water pitcher, (n) that
                          from a long way off look like flies.

              Borges compliments Wilkins for inventing names that
           might signify in themselves some meaning to those who
           know the system, but notes that "it is clear that there is
           no classification of the Universe not being arbitrary and
           full of conjectures."4

   Data schemas that specify data entities, elements, identifiers,
   attributes, and relationships in databases and XML document types
   on the transactional end of the Document Type Spectrum
   ("Resource Domain") are implementations of the categories needed
   for the design, development and maintenance of information
   organization systems. Data schemas tend to rigidly define
   categories of resources. 5

4. (Wilkins 1668) and (Borges 1952)

5. "Rigid" might sound negative, but a rigidly defined
   resource is also precisely defined. Precise definition is
   essential when creating, capturing, and retrieving data
   and when information about resources in different
   organizing systems needs to be combined or compared.
   For example, in a traditional relational database, each

    694 | Implementing Categories
   In object-oriented programming languages, classes are schemas that
   serve as templates for the creation of objects. A class in a
   programming language is analogous to a database schema that
   specifies the structure of its member instances, in that the class
   definition specifies how instances of the class are constructed in
   terms of data types and possible values. Programming classes may
   also specify whether data in a member object can be accessed, and
   if so, how.6

   table contains a field, or combination of fields, known
   as a primary key, which is used to define and restrict
   membership in the table. A table of email messages in
   a database might define an email message as a unique
   combination of sender address, recipient address, and
   date/time when the message was sent, by enforcing a
   primary key on a combination of these fields. Similar to
   category membership based on a single, monothetic set
   of properties, membership in this email message table is
   based on a single set of required criteria. An item without
   a recipient address cannot be admitted to the table. In
   categorization terms, the item is not a member of the
   "email message" class because it does not have all the
   properties necessary for membership.

6. Like data schemas, programming classes specify and
   enforce rules in the construction and manipulation of
   data. However, programming classes, like other
   implementations that are characterized by specificity
   and rule enforcement, can vary widely in the degree to
   which rules are specified and enforced. While some class

                                                                  Implementing Categories | 695
   Unlike transactional document types, which can be prescriptively
   defined as classical categories because they are often produced and
   consumed by automated processes, narrative document types are
   usually descriptive in character. We do not classify something as a
   novel because it has some specific set of properties and content
   types. Instead, we have a notion of typical novels and their
   characteristic properties, and some things that are considered
   novels are far from typical in their structure and content.7

   Nevertheless, categories like narrative document types can
   sometimes be implemented using document schemas that impose
   only a few constraints on structure and content. A schema for a
   purchase order is highly prescriptive; it uses regular expressions,
   strongly data typed content, and enumerated code lists to validate
   the value of required elements that must occur in a particular order.
   In contrast, a schema for a narrative document type would have
   much optionality, be flexible about order, and expect only text in
   its sections, paragraphs and headings. Even very lax document

  definitions are very rigid, others are more flexible. Some
  languages have abstract types that have no instances but
  serve to provide a common ancestor for specific
  implemented types.

7. The existence of chapters might suggest that an item is a
  novel; however, a lack of chapters need not automatically
  indicate that an item is not a novel. Some novels are
  hypertexts that encourage readers to take alternative
  paths. Many of the writings by James Joyce and Samuel
  Beckett are "stream of consciousness" works that lack a
  coherent plot, yet they are widely regarded as novels.

   696 | Implementing Categories
schemas can be useful in making content management, reuse, and
formatting more efficient.

Implementing Categories Defined by Probability
and Similarity

Many categories cannot be defined in terms of required properties,
and instead must be defined probabilistically, where category
membership is determined by properties that resources are likely to
share. Consider the category "friend." You probably consider many
people to be your friends, but you have longtime friends, school
friends, workplace friends, friends you see only at the gym, and
friends of your parents. Each of these types of friends represents
a different cluster of common properties. If someone is described
to you as a potential friend or date, how accurately can you predict
that the person will become a friend? (See the sidebar, Finding
Friends and Dates: Lessons for Learning Categories)

          Finding Friends and Dates:
          Lessons for Learning Categories
          Online dating or matchmaking sites use many of the
       same features to describe people, but also have
       additional features to make more accurate matches for
       their targeted users. As the number of features grows,
       there are exponentially more combinations of shared
       properties. For example, the matchmaking site
       eHarmony employs 29 "Dimensions of Compatibility"
       and more than 200 questions to create a user profile.
       Even if the 29 dimensions were Boolean (would you
       describe yourself as x?) this yields 229 or over

                                                              Implementing Categories | 697
       500,000,000 different combinations. Using these
       complex resource descriptions to predict the
       probability of a good match requires matchmaking sites
       to use proprietary machine learning algorithms to
       propose matches, which are ranked with unexplained
       measures and precision (what does an 80% match
       mean?). Not surprisingly, many people who try online
       dating give up after less success than they expected.

          With such a large number of features in user profiles,
       any matching algorithm confronts what machine
       learning calls the curse of dimensionality. With high-
       dimensional data, there can never be enough instances
       to learn which features are really the most important.
       Neither you nor the online dating algorithm will ever
       meet enough different kinds of people to reliably predict
       the outcome of a possible match.

          But all is not hopeless. Machine learning programs
       attack the curse of dimensionality using statistical
       techniques that use correlations among features to
       combine them or adjust the weights given to features to
       reflect their value in making predictions or
       classifications. For example, OKCupid asks people to
       rate how much importance they assign to match
       questions. You might prefer cats to dogs, and you might
       either never consider dating a dog lover or you might
       not care at all.

          Another way to reduce the number of features needed
       to classify accurately is to reduce the scope of the
       category being learned. The matchmaking model for
       sites that target people with particular professions,
       religions, or political views would be less complex than

698 | Implementing Categories
       the eHarmony one, because the former will have fewer
       relevant features, and hence fewer random correlations
       and noise that will undermine its accuracy. All other
       things being equal, the lower the variability in a set of
       examples, the better a model that learns from that data
       will perform.

Probabilistic categories can be challenging to define and use
because it can be difficult to keep in mind the complex feature
correlations and probabilities exhibited by different clusters of
instances from some domain. Furthermore, when the category
being learned is broad with a large number of members, the sample
from which you learn strongly shapes what you learn. For example,
people who grow up in high-density and diverse urban areas may
have less predictable ideas of what an acceptable potential date
looks like than someone in a remote rural area with a more
homogeneous population.

More generally, if you are organizing a domain where the resources
are active, change their state, or are measurements of properties
that vary and co-occur probabilistically, the sample you choose
strongly affects the accuracy of models for classification or
prediction. In The Signal and the Noise, statistician Nate Silver
explains how many notable predictions failed because of poor
sampling techniques. One common sampling mistake is to use too
short a historical window to assemble the training dataset; this is
often a corollary of a second mistake, an over reliance on recent
data because it is more available. For example, the collapse of
housing prices and the resulting financial crisis of 2008 can be
explained in part because the models that lenders used to predict
mortgage foreclosures were based on data from 1980-2005, when
house prices tended to grow higher. As a result, when mortgage

   foreclosures increased rapidly, the results were "out of sample" and
   were initially misinterpreted, delaying responses to the crisis.

   Samples from dynamic and probabilistic domains result in models
   that capture this variability. Unfortunately, because many
   forecasters want to seem authoritative, and many people do not
   understand probability, classifications or predictions that are
   inherently imprecise are often presented with certainty and
   exactness even though they are probabilistic with a range of
   outcomes. Silver tells the story of a disastrous 1997 flood caused
   when the Red River crested at 54 feet when the levees protecting
   the town of Grand Forks were at 51 feet. The weather service had
   predicted a crest between 40 and 58 feet, but emphasized the
   midpoint of the range, which was 49 feet. Unfortunately, most
   people interpreted this probabilistic prediction as if it were a binary
   classification, "flood" versus "no flood," ignored the range of the
   forecast, and failed to prepare for a flood that had about a 35%
   chance of occurring.8

  Probabilistic Decision Trees

   In "Implementing Categories Defined by Properties", we showed
   how a rule-based decision tree could be used to implement a strict
   property-based classification in which a bank uses tests for the
   properties of "annual income" and "monthly loan payment" to

8. See (Silver 2012). Over reliance on data that is readily
   available is a decision-making heuristic proposed by
   (Tversky and Kahneman 1974), who developed the
   psychological foundations for behavioral economics. (See
   the sidebar, Behavioral Economics.)

classify applicants as approved or denied. We can adapt that
example to illustrate probabilistic decision trees, which are better
suited for implementing categories in which category membership
is probabilistic rather than absolute.

Banks that are more flexible about making loans can be more
profitable because they can make loans to people that a stricter
bank would reject but who still are able to make loan payments.
Instead of enforcing conservative and fixed cutoffs on income and
monthly payments, these banks consider more properties and look
at applications in a more probabilistic way. These banks recognize
that not every loan applicant who is likely to repay the loan looks
exactly the same; "annual income" and "monthly loan payment"
remain important properties, but other factors might also be useful
predictors, and there is more than one configuration of values that
an applicant could satisfy to be approved for a loan.

Which properties of applicants best predict whether they will repay
the loan or default? A property that predicts each at 50% isn't
helpful because the bank might as well flip a coin, but a property
that splits the applicants into two sets, each with very different
probabilities for repayment and defaulting, is very helpful in making
a loan decision.

A data-driven bank relies upon historical data about loan repayment
and defaults to train algorithms that create decision trees by
repeatedly splitting the applicants into subsets that are most
different in their predictions. Subsets of applicants with a high
probability of repayment would be approved, and those with a high
probability of default would be denied a loan. One method for
selecting the property test for making each split is calculating the
"information gain" (see the sidebar Using "Information Theory" to
Quantify Organization). This measure captures the degree to which
each subset contains a "pure" group in which every applicant is
classified the same, as likely repayers or likely defaulters.

For example, consider the chart in Figure: Historical Data: Loan

                                                               Implementing Categories | 701
Repayment Based on Interest Rate which is a simplified
representation of the bank's historical data on loan defaults based
on the initial interest rate. The chart represents loans that were
repaid with "o" and those that defaulted with "x." Is there an interest
rate that divides them into "pure" sets, one that contains only "o"
loans and the other that contains only "x" loans?
Historical Data: Loan Repayment Based on Interest Rate

The "o" symbol represents loans that were repaid by the borrower;
"x" represents loans on which the borrower defaulted. A 6% rate
(darker vertical line) best divides the loans into subsets that differ in
the payment outcome.
You can see that no interest rate divides these into pure sets. So the
best that can be done is to find the interest rate that divides them

702 | Implementing Categories
   so that the proportions of defaulters are most different on each side
   of the line.9
   This dividing line at the 6% interest rate best divides those who
   defaulted from those who repaid their loan. Most people who
   borrowed at 6% or greater repaid the loan, while those who took
   out loans at a lower rate were more likely to default. This might
   seem counter-intuitive until you learn that the lower-interest rate
   loans had adjustable rates that increased after a few years, causing
   the monthly payments to increase substantially. More prudent
   borrowers were willing to pay higher interest rates that were fixed
   rather than adjustable to avoid radical increases in their monthly
   payments.

   Probabilistic Decision Tree

9. To be precise, this "difference of proportions" calculation
   uses an algorithm that also uses the logarithm of the
   proportions to calculate entropy, a measure of the
   uncertainty in a probability distribution. An entropy of
   zero means that the outcome can be perfectly predicted
   and entropy increases as outcomes are less predictable.
   The information gain for an attribute is how much it
   reduces entropy after it is used to subdivide a dataset.

                                                                  Implementing Categories | 703
In this probabilistic decision tree, the sequence of property tests
and the threshold values in each test divide the loan applicants into
categories that differ in how likely they are to repay the loan.

This calculation is carried out for each of the attributes in the
historical data set to identify the one that best divides the applicants
into the repaid and defaulted categories. The attributes and the
value that defines the decision rule can then be ordered to create a
decision tree similar to the rule-based one we saw in "Implementing
Categories Defined by Properties". In our hypothetical case, it turns
out that the best order in which to test the properties is Income,
Monthly Payment, and Interest Rate, as shown in Figure:
Probabilistic Decision Tree. The end result is still a set of rules, but
behind each decision in the tree are probabilities based on historical
data that can more accurately predict whether an applicant will
repay or default. Thus, instead of the arbitrary cutoffs at $100,000
in income and 25% for monthly payment, the bank can offer loans to

704 | Implementing Categories
     people with lower incomes and remain profitable doing so, because
     it knows from historical data that $82,000 and 27% are the optimal
     decision points. Using the interest rate in their decision process is
     an additional test to ensure that people can afford to make loan
     payments even if interest rates go up.10

     Because decision trees specify a sequence of rules that make
     property tests, they are highly interpretable, which makes them a
     very popular choice for data scientists building models much more
     complex than the simple loan example here. But they assume that
     every class is a conjunction of all the properties used to define
     them. This makes them susceptible to over-fitting because if they
     grow very deep with many property conjunctions, they capture
     exactly the properties that describe each member of the training
     set, effectively memorizing the training data. In other words, they
     capture both what is generally true beyond the set and what is
     particular to the training set only, when the goal is to build a model

10. Unfortunately, this rational data-driven process for
    classifying loan applications as "Approved" or "Denied"
    was abandoned during the "housing bubble" of the early
    2000s. Because lending banks could quickly sell their
    mortgages to investment banks who bundled them into
    mortgage-backed securities, applicants were approved
    without any income verification for "subprime" loans that
    initially had very low adjustable interest rates. Of course,
    when the rates increased substantially a few years later,
    defaults and foreclosures skyrocketed. This sad story is
    told in an informative, entertaining, but depressing
    manner in "The Big Short" (Lewis, 2010) and in a 2015
    movie with the same name.

                                                                    Implementing Categories | 705
that captures only what is generally true. Overfitting in decision
trees can be prevented by pruning back the tree after it has
perfectly classified the training set, or by limiting the depth of the
tree in advance, essentially pre-pruning it.

Naïve Bayes Classifiers

Another commonly used approach to implement a classifier for
probabilistic categories is called Naïve Bayes. It employs Bayes'
Theorem for learning the importance of a particular property for
correct classification. There are some common sense ideas that are
embodied in Bayes' Theorem:

  · When you have a hypothesis or prior belief about the
      relationship between a property and a classification, new
      evidence consistent with that belief should increase your
      confidence.

  · Contradictory evidence should reduce confidence in your
      belief.

  · If the base rate for some kind of event is low, do not forget
      that when you make a prediction or classification for a new
      specific instance. It is easy to be overly influenced by recent
      information.

Now we can translate these ideas into calculations about how
learning takes place. For property A and classification B, Bayes'
Theorem says:

   P (A | B) = P (B|A) P(A) / P(B)

The left hand side of the equation, P (A | B), is what we want to
estimate but can't measure directly: the probability that A is the
correct classification for an item or observation that has property B.

706 | Implementing Categories
This is called the conditional or posterior probability because it is
estimated after seeing the evidence of property B.

P (B | A) is the probability that any item correctly classified as A has
property B. This is called the likelihood function.

P (A) and P (B) are the independent or prior probabilities of A and
B; what proportion of the items are classified as A? How often does
property B occur in some set of items?

          Using Bayes' Theorem to Calculate
          Conditional Probability
          Your personal library contains 60% fiction and 40%
       nonfiction books. All of the fiction books are in ebook
       format, and half of the nonfiction books are ebooks and
       half are in print format. If you pick a book at random and
       it is in ebook format, what is the probability that it is
       nonfiction?
          Bayes' Theorem tells us that:

             P (nonfiction | ebook) = P (ebook |nonfiction) x P (no
       nfiction) / P (ebook).

          We know: P (ebook | nonfiction) = .5 and P (nonfiction)
       = .4

          We compute P (ebook) using the law of total
       probability to compute the combined probability of all
       the independent ways in which an ebook might be
       sampled. In this example there are two ways:

             P (ebook) = P (ebook | nonfiction) x P (nonfiction)
       + P (ebook | fiction) x P (fiction)
       = (.5 x .4) + (1 x .6) = .8

                                                              Implementing Categories | 707
               Therefore: P (nonfiction | ebook) = (.5 x .4) / .8 = .25

    Now let's apply Bayes' Theorem to implement email spam filtering.
    Messages are classified as SPAM or HAM (i.e., non-SPAM); the
    former are sent to a SPAM folder, while the latter head to your
    inbox.

     1. Select Properties. We start with a set of properties, some from
          the message metadata like the sender's email address or the
          number of recipients, and some from the message content.
          Every word that appears in messages can be treated as a
          separate property11

11. Machine learning algorithms differ in which properties
   they use in how they select them. A straightforward
   method is to run the algorithms using different sets of
   properties, and select the set that yields the best result.
   However, it can be very computationally expensive to run
   algorithms multiple times, especially when the number
   of properties is large. A faster alternative is to select
   or filter features based on how well they predict the
   classification. The information gain calculation discussed
   in "Probabilistic Decision Trees" is an example of a filter
   method.
      Naïve Bayes classifiers make the simplifying
   assumption that the properties are independent, an
   assumption that is rarely correct, which is why the

    708 | Implementing Categories
2. Assemble Training Data. We assemble a set of email message
      that have been correctly assigned to the SPAM and HAM
      categories. These labeled instances make up the training set.

3. Analyze the Training Data. For each message, does it contain a
      particular property? For each message, is it classified as SPAM?
      If a message is classified as SPAM, does it contain a particular
      property? (These are the three probabilities on the right side of
      the Bayes equation).

4. Learn. The conditional probability (the left side of the Bayes
      equation) is recalculated, adjusting the predictive value of each
      property. Taken together, all of the properties are now able to
      correctly assign (most of) the messages into the categories they
      belonged to in the training set.

5. Classify. The trained classifier is now ready to classify
      uncategorized messages to the SPAM or HAM categories.

approach is called naïve. For example, a document that
contains the word "insurance" is also likely to contain
"beneficiary," so their presence in messages is not
independent.

   Nevertheless, even though the independence
assumption is usually violated, Naive Bayes classifiers
often perform very well. Furthermore, treating
properties as independent means that the classifier
needs much less data to train than if we had to calculate
the conditional probabilities of all combination of
properties. Instead, we just have to count separately the
number of times each property occurs with each of the
two classification outcomes.

     6. Improve. The classifier can improve its accuracy if the user
           gives it feedback by reclassifying SPAM messages as HAM ones
           or vice versa. The most efficient learning occurs when an
           algorithm uses "active learning" techniques to choose its own
           training data by soliciting user feedback only where it is
           uncertain about how to classify a message. For example, the
           algorithm might be confident that a message with "Cheap
           drugs" in the subject line is SPAM, but if the message comes
           from a longtime correspondent, the algorithm might ask the
           user to confirm that the classification.12

   Categories Created by Clustering

     In the previous two sections, we discussed how probabilistic
     decision trees and naïve Bayes classifiers implement categories that
     are defined by typically shared properties and similarity. Both are
     examples of supervised learning because they need correctly
     classified examples as training data, and they learn the categories
     they are taught.

     In contrast, clustering techniques are unsupervised; they analyze
     a collection of uncategorized resources to discover statistical

    problem and the policy and technology methods for
    fighting it. (Upsana and Chakravarty 2010) is somewhat
    more recent and more narrowly focused on text
    classification techniques.
       A very thorough yet highly readable introduction to
    Active Learning is (Settles 2012).

     710 | Implementing Categories
regularities or structure among the items, creating a set of
categories without any labeled training data.

Clustering techniques share the goal of creating meaningful
categories from a collection of items whose properties are hard
to directly perceive and evaluate, which implies that category
membership cannot easily be reduced to specific property tests and
instead must be based on similarity. For example, with large sets
of documents or behavioral data, clustering techniques can find
categories of documents with the same topics, genre, or sentiment,
or categories of people with similar habits and preferences.

Because clustering techniques are unsupervised, they create
categories based on calculations of similarity between resources,
maximizing the similarity of resources within a category and
maximizing the differences between them. These statistically-
learned categories are not always meaningful ones that can be
named and used by people, and the choice of properties and
methods for calculating similarity can result in very different
numbers and types of categories. Some clustering techniques for
text resources suggest names for the clusters based on the
important words in documents at the center of each cluster.
However, unless there is a labeled set of resources from the same
domain that can be used as a check to see if the clustering
discovered the same categories, it is up to the data analyst or
information scientist to make sense of the discovered clusters or
topics.

There are many different distance-based clustering techniques, but
they share three basic methods.

  · The first shared method is that clustering techniques start with
      an initially uncategorized set of items or documents that are
      represented in ways that enable measures of inter-item
      similarity can be calculated. This representation is most often
      a vector of property values or the probabilities of different

                                                               Implementing Categories | 711
           properties so that items can be represented in a
           multidimensional space and similarity calculated using a
           distance function like those described in "Geometric Models of
           Similarity".13

       · The second shared method is that categories are created by
           putting items that are most similar into the same category.
           Hierarchical clustering approaches start with every item in its
           own category. Other approaches, notably one called "K-means
           clustering," start with a fixed number of K categories initialized
           with a randomly chosen item or document from the complete
           set.

       · The third shared method is refining the system of categories
           by iterative similarity recalculation each time an item is added
           to a category. Approaches that start with every item in its own
           category create a hierarchical system of categories by merging
           the two most similar categories, recomputing the similarity
           between the new category and the remaining ones, and
           repeating this process until all the categories are merged into
           a single category at the root of a category tree. Techniques
           that start with a fixed number of categories do not create new
           ones but instead repeatedly recalculate the "centroid" of the

13. In particular, documents are usually represented as
    vectors of frequency-weighted terms. Other approaches
    start more directly with the similarity measure, obtained
    either by direct judgments of the similarity of each pair
    of items or by indirect measures like the accuracy in
    deciding whether two sounds, colors, or images are the
    same or different. The assumption is that the
    confusability of two items reflects how similar they are.

     712 | Implementing Categories
           category by adjusting its property representation to the average
           of all its members after a new member is added.14

     It makes sense that the algorithms that create clusters or categories
     of similar items can be later used as classifiers by using the same
     similarity measures to compare the unclassified items against items
     that are labeled by category. There are different choices about
     which items to compare with the unclassified one:

       · The centroid: a prototypical or average item calculated on the
           properties of all the category members. However, the centroid
           might not correspond to any actual member (see the sidebar
           Median versus Average), and this can make it hard to interpret
           the classification.

       · Items that actually exist: Because the items in categories
           defined by similarity are not equally typical or good members,
           it is more robust to test against more than one exemplar.
           Classifiers that use this approach are called nearest-neighbor
           techniques, and they essentially vote among themselves and the
           majority category is assigned to the new item.

       · The edge cases: These are instances that are closest to the

14. Unlike hierarchical clustering methods that have a clear
    stopping rule when they create the root category, k-
    means clustering methods run until the centroids of the
    categorize stabilize. Furthermore, because the k-means
    algorithm is basically just hill-climbing, and the initial
    category "seed" items are random, it can easily get stuck
    in a local optimum. So it is desirable to try many different
    starting configurations for different choices of K.

                                                                     Implementing Categories | 713
           boundary between two categories, so there needs to be at least
           two of them, one in each category. Because they are not typical
           members of the category, they are the hardest to classify
           initially, but using them in classifiers emphasizes the properties
           that are the most discriminating. This is the approach taken by
           support vector machines, which are not clustering algorithms
           but are somewhat like nearest-neighbor algorithms in that they
           calculate the similarity of an unclassified item to these edge
           cases. Their name makes more sense if you think of the vectors
           that represent the "edge cases" being used to "support" the
           category boundary, which falls between them.

   Neural networks

     Among the best performing classifiers for categorizing by similarity
     and probabilistic membership are those implemented using neural
     networks, and especially those employing deep learning techniques.
     Deep learning algorithms can learn categories from labeled training
     data or by using autoencoding, an unsupervised learning technique
     that trains a neural network to reconstruct its input data. However,
     instead of using the properties that are defined in the data, deep
     learning algorithms devise a very large number of features in hidden
     hierarchical layers, which makes them uninterpretable by people.
     The key idea that made deep learning possible is the use of
     "backpropagation" to adjust the weights on features by working
     backwards from the output (the object classification produced by
     the network) all the way back to the input. The use of deep learning
     to classify images was mentioned in "Describing Images".15

15. In addition, the complex feature representations of
    neural networks compute very precise similarity

     714 | Implementing Categories
Implementing Goal-Based Categories

Goal-based categories are highly individualized, and are often used
just once in a very specific context. However, it is useful to consider
that we could implement model goal-derived categories as rule-
based decision trees by ordering the decisions to ensure that any
sub-goals are satisfied according to their priority. We could
understand the category "Things to take from a burning house"
by first asking the question "Are there living things in the house?"
because that might be the most important sub-goal. If the answer to
that question is "yes," we might proceed along a different path than
if the answer is "no." Similarly, we might put a higher priority on
things that cannot be replaced (Grandma's photos) than those that
can (passport).

Implementing Theory-Based Categories

Theory-based categories arise in domains in which the items to be
categorized are characterized by abstract or complex relationships
with their features and with each other. With this model an entity
need not be understood as inherently possessing features shared in
common with another entity. Rather, people project features from
one thing to another in a search for congruities between things,
much as clue receivers in the second round of the Pyramid game
search for congruities between examples provided by the clue giver
in order to guess the target category. For example, a clue like
"screaming baby" can suggest many categories, as can "parking

measurements, which enable searches for specific
images or that find duplicate ones.

                                                               Implementing Categories | 715
     meter." But the likely intersection of the interactions one can have
     with babies and parking meters is that they are both "Things you
     need to feed."

     Theory-based categories are created as cognitive constructs when
     we use analogies and classify because things brought together by
     analogy have abstract rather than literal similarity. The most
     influential model of analogical processing is Structure Mapping,
     whose development and application have been guided by Dedre
     Gentner for over three decades.

     The key insight in Structure Mapping is that an analogy "a T is like
     B" is created by matching relational structures and not properties
     between the base domain B and a target domain T. We take any
     two things, analyze the relational structures they contain, and align
     them to find correspondences between them. The properties of
     objects in the two domains need not match, and in fact, if too many
     properties match analogy goes away and we have literal similarity:

       · Analogy: The hydrogen atom is like our solar system

       · Literal Similarity: The X12 star system in the Andromeda galaxy
           is like our solar system

     Structure Mapping theory was implemented in the Structure-
     Mapping Engine (SME), which both formalized the theory and
     offered a computationally-tractable algorithm for carrying out the
     process of mapping structures and drawing inferences.16

16. Structure Mapping theory was proposed in (Gentner
    1983), and the Structure Mapping Engine followed a few
    years later (Falkenhainer et al 1989). The SME was
    criticized for relying on hand-coded knowledge

  · Why do we contrast cultural, individual, and institutional
      categorization?
      Cultural, individual, and institutional categorization share some
      core ideas but they emphasize different processes and
      purposes for creating categories.
      (See "The What and Why of Categories")

  · What distinguishes individual categories?
      Individual categories are created by intentional activity that
      usually takes place in response to a specific situation.
      (See "Individual Categories")

  · What distinguishes institutional categories?
      Institutional categories are most often created in abstract and

   information-intensive domains where unambiguous and
   precise categories are needed.

   (See "Institutional Categories")

· What is the relation between categories and classification?

   The rigorous definition of institutional categories enables
   classification, the systematic assignment of resources to
   categories in an organizing system.

   (See "Institutional Categories")

· When is it necessary to create categories by computational
   methods rather than by people?

   Computational categories are created by computer programs
   when the number of resources, or when the number of
   descriptions or observations associated with each resource, are
   so large that people cannot think about them effectively.

   (See "Computational Categories")

· What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised
   learning?

   In supervised learning, a machine learning program is trained
   by giving it sample items or documents that are labeled by
   category. In unsupervised learning, the program gets the
   samples but has to come up with the categories on its own.

   (See Supervised and Unsupervised Learning)

· Why does it matter if every resource in a collection has a
   sortable identifier?

   Any collection of resources with sortable identifiers (alphabetic
   or numeric) as an associated property can benefit from using
   sorting order as an organizing principle.

      (See "Single Properties")

  · What is the concern when only a single property is used to
      assign category membership?

      If only a single property is used to distinguish among some
      set of resources and to create the categories in an organizing
      system, the choice of property is critical because different
      properties often lead to different categories.

      (See "Single Properties")

  · What is a hierarchical category system?

      A sequence of organizing decisions based on a fixed ordering of
      resource properties creates a hierarchy, a multi-level category
      system.

      (See "Multi-Level or Hierarchical Categories")

  · What can one say about any member of a classical category in
      terms of how it represents the category?

      An important implication of necessary and sufficient category
      definition is that every member of the category is an equally
      good member or example of the category.

      (See "Necessary and Sufficient Properties")

  · What is aboutness?

      For most purposes, the most useful property of information
      resources for categorizing them is their aboutness, which is not
      directly perceivable and which is hard to characterize.

      (See "The Limits of Property-Based Categorization")

  · When it is necessary to adopt a probabilistic or statistical view
      of properties in defining categories?

720 | Key Points in Chapter Seven
In domains where properties lack one or more of the
characteristics of separability, perceptibility, and necessity, a
probabilistic or statistical view of properties is needed to define
categories.

· What is family resemblance?

Sharing some but not all properties is akin to family
resemblances among the category members.

· What is similarity?

Similarity is a measure of the resemblance between two things
that share some characteristics but are not identical.

Classical categories can be defined precisely with just a few
necessary and sufficient properties.

  · What is the practical benefit of defining categories according to
      necessary and sufficient features?

  · How do artificial languages like mathematical notation and
      programming languages enable precise specification of
      categories?

      An artificial language expresses ideas concisely by introducing
      new terms or symbols that represent complex ideas along with
      syntactic mechanisms for combining and operating on them.

      (See "Implementing Categories Defined by Properties")

  · How do Naïve Bayes classifiers learn?

      Naïve Bayes classifiers learn by revising the conditional
      probability of each property for making the correct
      classification after seeing the base rates of the class and

      of the class has the property.

   Because clustering techniques are unsupervised, they create
   categories based on calculations of similarity between

51. Introduction (VIII)

In Describing Relationships and Structures we discussed different
types of semantic relationships and contrasted abstract
relationships between categories that define a semantic hierarchy
like

      Meat  is-a  Food

with concrete relationships involving specific people like members
of the Simpson family:

      Homer Simpson  is-a  Husband

When we make an assertion that a particular instance like Homer
Simpson is a member of class, we are classifying the instance.

Classification, the systematic assignment of resources to intentional
categories, is the focus of this chapter. In Categorization: Describing
Resource Classes and Types, we described categories created by
people as cognitive and linguistic models for applying prior
knowledge and we discussed a set of principles for creating
categories and category systems. We explained how cultural
categories serve as the foundations upon which individual and
institutional categories are based. Institutional categories are most
often created in abstract and information-intensive domains where
unambiguous and precise categories enable classification to be
purposeful and principled. Computational categories inherited by
supervised learning techniques are usually as interpretable as those
created by people, but categories created by unsupervised machine
learning techniques are statistical patterns that might or might not
be interpretable.

A system of categories and its attendant rules or access methods
is typically called a classification scheme or just the classifications.

                                                                         Introduction (VIII) | 727
A system of categories captures the distinctions and relationships
among its resources that are most important in a domain and for a
particular context of use, creating a reference model or conceptual
roadmap for its users. This classification creates the structure and
support for the interactions that human or computational agents
perform. For example, research libraries and bookstores do not use
the same classifications to organize books, but the categories they
each use are appropriate for their contrasting types of collections
and the different kinds of browsing and searching activities that
take place in each context. Likewise, the scientific classifications for
animals used by biologists contrast with those used in pet stores
because the latter have no need for the precise differentiation
enabled by the former.

        Navigating This
            Chapter

          Most of the chapter is a survey of topics that span the
       broad range of how classifications are used in
       organizing systems. These include enumerative
       classification ("Bibliographic Classification"), faceted
       classification ("Faceted Classification"), activity-based

728 | Introduction (VIII)
classification ("Classification by Activity Structure"), and
computational classification ("Computational
Classification"). Because classification and
standardization are closely related, we also analyze
standards and standards making as they apply to
organizing systems. Throughout, we observe how
personal, institutional, cultural, linguistic, political,
religious, and even artistic biases can affect otherwise
principled and purposeful classification schemes. We
finish the chapter with "Key Points in Chapter Eight".

Classification vs. Categorization

Classification requires a system of categories, so not everyone
distinguishes classification from categorization. Batley, for example,
says classification is "imposing some sort of structure on our
understanding of our environment," a vague definition that applies
equally well to categorization.1

In the discipline of organizing, the definition of classification is
narrower and more formal. The contrasts among cultural,
individual, and institutional categories in "The What and Why of
Categories" yield a precise definition of classification: The
systematic assignment of resources to a system of intentional
categories, often institutional ones. This definition highlights the
intentionality behind the system of categories, the systematic

1. (Batley 2005 p. 1).

                        Introduction (VIII) | 729
   processes for using them, and implies the greater requirements for
   governance and maintenance that are absent for cultural categories
   and most individual ones.

  Classification vs. Tagging

   Precise and reliable classification is possible when the shared
   properties of a collection of resources are used in a principled
   and systematic manner. This method of classification is essential to
   satisfy institutional and commercial purposes. However, this degree
   of rigor might be excessive for personal classifications and for
   classifications of resources in social or informal contexts.

   Instead, a weaker approach to organizing resources is to use any
   property of a resource and any vocabulary to describe it, regardless
   of how well it differentiates it from other resources to create a
   system of categories. This method of organizing resources is most
   often called tagging ("Tagging of Web-based Resources"), but it has
   also been called social classification.2

   Tagging is often used in personal organizing systems, but is social
   when it serves goals to convey information, develop a community,
   or manage reputation. Regardless of its name, however, tagging is
   popular for organizing and rating photos, websites, email messages,

2. (Hammond et al. 2004) note that the "unstructured (or
   better, free structured) approach to classification with
   users assigning their own labels is variously referred to
   as a folksonomy, folk classification, ethnoclassification,
   distributed classification, or social classification."

    730 | Introduction (VIII)
   or other web-based resources or web-based descriptions of
   physical resources like stores and restaurants.

   The distinction between classification and tagging was blurred
   when Thomas Vander Wal coined the term "folksonomy"
   --combining "folk" and "taxonomy" (which is a classification; see
   "Inclusion") --to describe the collection of tags for a particular web
   site or application.3 Folksonomies are often displayed in the form
   of a tag cloud, where the frequency with which the tag is used
   throughout the site determines the size of the text in the tag cloud.
   The tag cloud emerges through the bottom-up aggregation of user
   tags and is a statistical construct, rather than a semantic one.4

   Tagging seems insufficiently principled to be considered
   classification. Tagging a photo as "red" or "car" is an act of resource
   description, not classification, because the other tags that would
   serve as the alternative classifications are unspecified. Furthermore,
   when tagging principles are followed at all, they are likely to be
   idiosyncratic ones that were not pre-determined or arrived at
   through an analysis of goals and requirements.

   Noticeably, some uses of tags treat them as category labels, turning
   tagging into classification. Many websites and resources encourage

3. Thomas Vander Wal invented the term "folksonomy" in
   2004, and the term quickly gained traction. His personal
   account of the creation and dispersion of the term is
   (Vander Wal 2007).

4. See (Halvey and Keane 2007), (Sinclair and Cardrew-Hall
   2007)) for analyses of the usability of different
   presentations, and (Kaser and Lemire 2007) for
   algorithms for drawing tag clouds.

                                                                             Introduction (VIII) | 731
   users to assign "Like" or "+1" tags to them, and because these tags
   are pre-defined, they are category choices in an implied
   classification system; for example, we can consider "Like" as an
   alternative to a "Not liked enough" category.

   When users or communities establish sets of principles to govern
   their tagging practices, tagging is even more like classification. Such
   a tagging system can be called a tagsonomy, a neologism we have
   invented to describe more systematic tagging. For example, a
   tagsonomy could predetermine tags as categories to be assigned to
   particular contents of a blog post, or specify the level of abstraction
   and granularity for assigning tags without predetermining them
   ("Category Design Issues and Implications"). Some people use
   multiple user accounts for the same application to establish distinct
   personas or contexts (e.g., personal vs. business photo collections)
   as a way to make their tagsonomies more distinct.

   Making these decisions about tagging content and form and
   applying them in the tagging process transforms an ad hoc set of
   tags into a principled tagsonomy. When tagging is introduced in
   a business setting, more pragmatic purposes and more systematic
   tagging--for example, by using tags from lists of departments or
   products--also tends to create tagsonomic classification.5

   "Tagging documents by computer," or multi-label classification, is
   a glib way to describe topic modeling, an unsupervised learning
   technique for organizing and summarizing collections of
   unstructured documents by discovering patterns or clusters in the
   words they contain. The basic intuition behind topic modeling is
   that the words in a document are probabilistic indications of what
   the document is about; a document that contains words like

5. See (Millen, Feinberg, and Kerr 2006), (John and
   Seligmann 2006).

    732 | Introduction (VIII)
   "election, government, and candidate" is probably about the
   "politics" topic, while words like "adore, wedding, and marriage"
   are good indications of a "love" topic. Topic models are not quite
   tagging because the words they identify to describe documents
   are not atomic tags or labels explicitly assigned to individual
   documents. Instead, topics are more like themes that different
   documents are more or less likely to contain.

   Topic models have been used to implement user interfaces for
   browsing large document collections because they let a user explore
   using themes instead of specific search terms. In digital humanities,
   topic models have been used to discover changes in "what's written
   about" by some author or resource (like a newspaper) over time.
   Web commerce companies use topic models to organize books or
   products for their recommendation engines.6

  Classification vs. Physical Arrangement

   We have often stressed the principle in the discipline of organizing
   that logical issues must be separated from implementation issues.
   (See "The Concept of "Organizing Principle"", "Designing the
   Description Form", and "The Implementation Perspective ") With
   classification we separate the conceptual act of assigning a resource
   to a category from the subsequent but often incidental act of
   putting it in some physical or digital storage location. This focus

6. The statistical techniques used in topic models are
   intimidating; to vastly oversimplify, topic models start
   with a document x term matrix and extract topics by
   reducing the dimensionality through linear algebra
   techniques. (Blei 2012) is a relatively easy introduction.

                                                                             Introduction (VIII) | 733
   on the logical essence of classification is elegantly expressed in a
   definition by Gruenberg: Classification is "a higher order thinking
   skill requiring the fusion of the naturalist's eye for relationships...
   with the logician's desire for structured order... the mathematician's
   compulsion to achieve consistent, predictable results... and the
   linguist's interest in explicit and tacit expressions of meaning."7

   Taking a conceptual or cognitive perspective on classification
   contrasts with much conventional usage in library science, where
   classification is mostly associated with arranging tangible items
   on shelves, emphasizing the "parking" function that realizes the
   "marking" function of identifying the category to which the
   resource belongs.8

7. Gruenberg wrote this definition over a decade ago as
   a University of Illinois PhD student in an unpublished
   paper titled Faceted Classification, Facet Analysis, and
   the Web that was found by a web search by the first
   author of this chapter in 2005. When this chapter was
   being written several years later, the paper was no longer
   on the web, but a copy was located at Illinois by Matthew
   Beth on a backup disk.

8. This is reflected in library call numbers, which assign a
   unique number to books to designate the order in which
   they are shelved. Most American libraries use a
   classification system as part of their call number,
   composing it from a class number of the classification
   and a unique identifier (derived from the author name
   and title), which identifies the book within the class,
   often using a system called Cutter numbers. See

    734 | Introduction (VIII)
From a library science or collection curation perspective, it seems
undeniable that when the resources being classified are physical or
tangible things such as books, paintings, animals, or cooking pots,
the end result of the classification activity is that some resource
has been placed in some physical location. Moreover, the placement
of physical resources can be influenced by the physical context
in which they are organized. Once placed, the physical context
often embodies some aspects of the organization when similar or
related resources are arranged in nearby locations. In libraries and
bookstores, this adjacency facilitates the serendipitous discovery of
resources, as anyone well knows who has found an interesting book
by browsing the shelves.

It might seem natural to identify storage locations with the classes
used by the classification system. Just as we might think of a
location in the zoo as the "lion habitat," we can put a "QC" sign on a
particular row of shelves in a library where books about physics are
arranged.

However, once we broaden the scope of organizing to include digital
resources, it is clear that we rely on their logical classifications
when we interact with them, not whether they reside on a computer
in Berkeley or Bangalore. It is better to emphasize that a
classification system is foremost a specification for the logical
arrangement of resources because there are usually many possible
and often arbitrary mappings of logical references to physical
locations.

Classification Schemes

A classification scheme is a realization of one or more organizing
principles. Physical resources are often classified according to their
tangible or perceivable properties. As we discussed in "Single
Properties" and "Multiple Properties", when properties take on only
a small set of discrete values, a classification system naturally
emerges in which each category is defined by one property value
or some particular combination of property values. Classification
schemes in which all possible categories to which resources can
be assigned are defined explicitly are enumerative. For example,
the enumerative classification for a personal collection of music
recorded on physical media might have categories for CDs, DVDs,
vinyl albums, 8-track cartridges, reel-to-reel tape, and tape
cassettes; every music resource fits into one and only one of these
categories.

When multiple resource properties are considered in a fixed
sequence, each property creates another level in the system of
categories and the classification scheme is hierarchical or
taxonomic. (See "Inclusion".)

For information resources, their aboutness is usually more
important than their physical properties. For example, a professor
planning a new course might organize candidate articles for the
syllabus in a fixed set of categories, one for each potential lecture
topic. But it is more challenging to enumerate all the subjects or
topics that a larger collection of resources might be about. The
Library of Congress Classification(LCC) is a hierarchical and
enumerative scheme with a very detailed set of subject categories
because books can be about almost anything. We discuss the LCC
more in "Bibliographic Classification".

In addition to or instead of their aboutness, information resources
are sometimes organized using intrinsic properties like author

736 | Introduction (VIII)
names or creation dates. Our professor might primarily organize
his collection of articles by author name, and when he plans a
new course, he might put those he selects for the syllabus into a
classification system with one category for every scheduled lecture.

Because names and dates can take on a great many values, an
organizing principle like alphabetical or chronological ordering is
unlikely to enumerate in advance an explicit category for each
possible value. Instead, we can consider these organizing principles
as creating an implicit or latent classification system in which the
categories are generated only as needed. For example, the Q
category only exists in an alphabetical scheme if there is a resource
whose name starts with Q.

Many resource domains have multiple properties that might be
used to define a classification scheme. For example, wine can be
classified by type of grape (varietal), color, flavor, price, winemaker,
region of origin (appellation), blending style, and other properties.
Furthermore, people differ in their knowledge or preferences about
these properties; some people choose wine based on its price and
varietal, while others studiously compare winemakers and
appellations. Each order of considering the properties creates a
different hierarchical classification, and using all of them would
create a very deep and unwieldy system. Moreover, many different
hierarchies might be required to satisfy divergent preferences. An
alternative classification scheme for domains like these is faceted
classification, a type of classification system that takes a set of
resource properties and then generates only those categories for
combinations that actually occur.

The most common types of facets are enumerative (mutually
exclusive); Boolean (yes or no); hierarchical or taxonomic (logical
containment); and spectrum (a range of numerical values). We
discuss faceted classification in detail (in "Faceted Classification")
because it is very frequently used in online classifications. Faceted
schemes enable easier search and browsing of large resource

                                                                         Introduction (VIII) | 737
collections like those for retail sites and museums than hierarchical
enumerative schemes. In library science a classification system that
builds categories by combination of facets is sometimes also called
analytico-synthetic.
The Dewey Decimal Classification(DDC) is a highly enumerative
classification system that also uses faceted properties; we will
discuss it more in "Bibliographic Classification".

Classification and Standardization

Classifications impose order on resources. Standards do the same
by making distinctions, either implicitly or explicitly, between
"standard" and "nonstandard" ways of creating, organizing, and
using resources. Classification and standardization are not identical,
but they are closely related. Some classifications become standards,
and some standards define new classifications. Institutional
categories ("Institutional Categories") are of two broad types.

Institutional Taxonomies

Institutional taxonomies are classifications designed to make it more
likely that people or computational agents will organize and interact
with resources in the same way. Among the thousands of standards
published by the International Organization for
Standardization(ISO) are many institutional taxonomies that govern
the classification of resources and products in agriculture, aviation,

738 | Introduction (VIII)
construction, energy, healthcare, information       technology,
transportation, and almost every industry sector.9

Institutional taxonomies are especially important in libraries and
knowledge management. The Dewey Decimal Classification(DDC)
and Library of Congress Classification(LCC) enable different
libraries to arrange books in the same categories, and the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM) in clinical
psychology enables different doctors to assign patients to the same
diagnostic and insurance categories.10

 9. The most "standard" of all standards organization is the
    International Organization for Standardization(ISO),
    whose members are themselves national standards
    organizations, which as a result gives the nearly 20,000
    ISO standards the broadest and most global coverage.
    See http://ISO.org. In addition, there are scores of other
    national and industry-specific standards bodies whose
    work is potentially relevant to organizing systems of the
    sorts discussed in this book. We encounter these kinds
    of standards every day in codes for countries, currencies,
    and airports, in file formats, in product barcodes, and in
    many other contexts.

    Similarly, the DSM is maintained and published by the
    American Psychiatric Association(APA) and it earns the
    many millions of dollars a year.

   Institutional Semantics

    Systems of institutional semantics offer precisely defined
    abstractions or information components ("Identity and Information
    Components") needed to ensure that information can be efficiently
    exchanged and used. Organizing systems that use different
    information models often cannot share and combine information
    without tedious negotiation and excessive rework.

    Automating transactions with suppliers and customers in a supply
    chain requires that all the parties use the same data format or
    formats that can be transformed to be interoperable. Retrofitting
    or replacing these applications to enable efficient interoperability is
    often possible, and it is usually desirable for the firm to develop or
    adopt enterprise standards for information exchange models rather
    than pay the recurring transaction costs to integrate or transform
    incompatible formats.

    Standard semantics are especially important in industries or
    markets that have significant network effects where the value of
    a product depends on the number of interoperable or compatible
    products--these include much of the information and service
    economies.

    An example of a system of institutional semantics is the Universal
    Business Language(UBL) a library of about 2000 semantic "building
    blocks" for common concepts like "Address," "Item," "Payment," and
    "Party" along with nearly 100 document types assembled from the
    standard components. UBL is widely used to facilitate the
    automated exchange of transactional documents in procurement,
    logistics, inventory management, collaborative planning and
    forecasting, and payment.11

   Specifications vs. Standards

     Implementing an organizing system of significant scope and
     complexity in a robust and maintainable fashion requires precise
     descriptions of the resources it contains, their formats, the classes,
     relations, structures and collections in which they participate, and
     the processes that ensure their efficient and effective use. Rigorous
     descriptions like these are often called "specifications" and there
     are well-established practices for developing good ones.

     There is a subtle but critical distinction between "specifications"
     and "standards." Any person, firm, or ad hoc group of people or
     firms can create a specification and then use it or attempt to get
     others to use it.12 In contrast, a standard is a published specification

    available at https://www.oasis-open.org; the UBL
    committee is at https://www.oasis-open.org/
    committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ubl.

12. A small number of people can often informally agree on
    an organizing system that meets the needs of each
    participant. But each new person often brings new
    requirements and it is not feasible to resolve every
    disagreement between every pair of participants. Instead,
    for a large-scale organizing system, decisions are usually
    made by entities that have the authority to coordinate
    actions and prevent conflicts by imposing a single
    solution on all the participants. (Rosenthal, Seligman, and
    Renner 2004) call this the "person-concept" tradeoff,
    which we can paraphrase as "a few people can agree on a
    lot, but a lot of people can only agree on a little."

                                                                               Introduction (VIII) | 741
     that is developed and maintained by consensus of all the relevant
     stakeholders in some domain by following a defined and transparent
     process, usually under the auspices of a recognized standards
     organization.13 In addition, implementations of standards often are

    This authority can come from many different sources,
    but they can be roughly categorized as "authority from
    power" and "authority from consensus." Often the
    economic dominance of a firm allows it to control how
    business gets done in its industry. One key part of that
    is establishing specifications for data formats and
    classification schemes in organizing systems, which
    usually means requiring other firms to use the ones
    developed by the dominant firm for its own use. This
    ensures the continued efficiency of their own business
    processes while making it harder for other firms to
    challenge their market power.

    In contrast, consensus is the authority mechanism
    embodied in the workings of the open source community,
    where the freedom to view and change data formats and
    code that uses them encourages cooperation and
    adoption. Consensus also underlies the authority of
    voluntary standards activities, where firms work together
    under the auspices of a standards body and agree to
    follow its procedures for creating, ratifying, and
    implementing standards.

13. International and national standards bodies derive their

     742 | Introduction (VIII)
subject to conformance tests that establish the completeness and
accuracy of the implementation. This means that users can decide
either to implement the specification themselves or choose from
other conforming implementations.

The additional rigor and transparency when specifications are
developed and maintained through a standards process often makes
them fairer and gives them more legitimacy. Governments often
require or recommend these de jure standards, especially those that
are "open" or "royalty free" because they are typically supported by
multiple vendors, minimizing the cost of adoption and maximizing
their longevity.

For example, work on UBL has gone on for over a decade in a
technical committee under the auspices of a standards

authority from the authority of the governments that
created them. But standards organizations arguably
derive most of their authority from the collective power
of their members, because many influential standards
organizations like OASIS, W3C, OMG, and IETF are not
chartered or sponsored by governments. In addition,
firms often create ad hoc "quasi-standards" organizations
or "communities of interest" to facilitate relatively short-
term cooperative standards-making activities that in the
former case would otherwise be prohibited by anti-trust
considerations. Finally, at the extreme "lightweight" end
of the standards-making continuum, the codification of
simple and commonly used information models as
"microformats" depends on authority that emerges from
the collaboration of individuals rather than firms.

                                                                        Introduction (VIII) | 743
     development consortium called the Organization for the
     Advancement of Structured Information Standards(OASIS), which
     has developed scores of standards for web services and
     information-intensive industries.

     Despite these important distinctions between "specifications" and
     "standards," however, in conventional usage "standard" is often
     simply a synonym for "dominant or widely-adopted specification."
     These de facto standards, in contrast with the de jure standards
     created by standards organizations, are typically created by the
     dominant firm or firms in an industry, by a new firm that is first
     to use a new technology or innovative method, or by a non-profit
     entity like a foundation that focuses on a particular domain.14

     De facto standards and ad hoc standards often co-exist and compete
     in "standards wars," especially in information-intensive domains
     and industries with rapid innovation. Standards "wars" tend to
     occur when different firms or groups of firms develop two or more
     standards that tend to address the same needs. Not surprisingly,
     the competing standards are often incompatible on purpose. At first
     this lets each standard attract customers with features not enabled
     by the other, but it ends up locking them in by imposing switching
     costs. Current examples include Google vs. Apple on mobile phones
     and Kindle versus Apple on ebook readers.15

14. Often a standard evolves from an existing specification
    submitted to a standards organization by the firm that
    created it. In other cases, the specifications used by a
    dominant firm becomes a de facto standard by other firms
    in its industry, and it is never submitted to a formal
    standards-making process.

15. See (Shapiro and Varian, 1998).

     744 | Introduction (VIII)
     For example, the Dewey Decimal Classification(DDC) is the world's
     most widely used library classification system, and most people
     treat it as a standard. In fact, the DDC is proprietary and it is
     maintained and licensed for use by the Online Computer Library
     Center(OCLC). Similarly, the DSM is maintained and published by
     the American Psychiatric Association(APA) and it earns the APA many
     millions of dollars a year.

     In contrast, de jure standards include the Library of Congress
     Classification(LCC), developed under the auspices of the US
     government, the familiar MARC record format used in online library
     catalogs (ISO 2709), and its American counterpart ANSI Z39.2.16

     As a result, even though it would be technically correct to argue
     that "while all standards are specifications, not all specifications are
     standards," this distinction is hard to maintain in practice.

   Mandated Classifications

     Standards are often imposed by governments to protect the
     interests of their citizens by coordinating or facilitating activities
     that might otherwise not be possible or safe. Some of them
     primarily concern public or product safety and are only tangentially
     relevant to systems for organizing information. Others are highly
     relevant, especially those that specify the formats and content of

16. Even so, the LCC is not "open" standard. You can browse
    the classifications on the LOC site, but to get them
    packaged as a book or complete digital resource you have
    to pay for them.

    doing business with the government to adopt UBL.17

    Other government standards that are important in organizing
    systems are those that express requirements for classification and

17. Governments have inherently long time horizons for
    their actions, they need to serve all citizens fairly and
    without discrimination, and they (should seek to)
    minimize cost to taxpayers. Each of these principles is an
    independent argument for standards and taken together
    they make a very strong one. Indeed, one the founding
    goals in the US Constitution is to protect the public
    interest, and this is enabled in Article I, Section 8 by
    granting Congress the power to set standards "of
    Weights and Measures" to facilitate commerce. Setting
    standards is a key role of the National Institute of
    Standards and Technology(NIST), part of the Department
    of Commerce, and other departments have similar
    standards-setting responsibilities and agencies, like the
    Food and Drug Administration(FDA) in the Department
    of Health and Social Services. In addition, independent
    government agencies like the Federal Communications
    Commission(FCC) and Federal Trade Commission(FTC) set
    numerous standards that are relevant to information
    organizing systems. And of course, the Library of
    Congress(LOC) maintains procedures and standards
    needed "to sustain and preserve a universal collection of
    knowledge... for future generations" (LOC.gov/about).

52. Understanding
Classification

Classifications arrange resources to support discovery, selection,
combination, integration, analysis, and other purposeful activity in
every organizing system. A classification of diseases facilitates
diagnosis and development of medical procedures, as well as
accounting and billing. In addition, classifications facilitate
understanding of a domain by highlighting the important resources
and relationships in it, supporting the training of people who work
in the domain and their acquisition of specialized skills for it.

We consider classification to be systematic when it follows
principles that govern the structure of categories and their
relationships. However, being systematic and principled does not
necessarily ensure that a classification will be unbiased or satisfy
all users' requirements. For example, the zoning, environmental,
economic development, and political district classifications that
overlay different parts of a city determine the present and future
allocation of services and resources, and over time influence
whether the city thrives or decays. These classifications reflect
tradeoffs and negotiations among numerous participants, including
businesses, lobbyists, incumbent politicians, donors to political
parties, real estate developers, and others with strong self-
interests.

Classification Is Purposeful

Categories often arise naturally, but by definition, classifications
do not because they are systems of categories that have been
intentionally designed for some purpose. Every classification brings

                                                         Understanding Classification | 749
together resources that go together, and in doing so differentiates
among them. However, bringing resources together would be
pointless without reasons for finding, accessing, and interacting
with them later.

Classifications Are Reference Models

A classification creates a semantic or conceptual roadmap to a
domain by highlighting the properties and relationships that
distinguish the resources in it. This reference model facilitates
learning, comprehension, and the use of organizing systems within
the domain. Standard classifications like those used in libraries
enable people to rely on one system that they can use to locate
resources in many libraries. Standard business, job, and product
classifications enable the reliable collection, analysis, and
interchange of economic data and resources.

Another important use of standard classifications created by people
is as a "gold standard" for comparison with unsupervised
computational classifications carried out on the same collection
of resources or in the same domain. Presumably, no unsupervised
classifier could exactly reproduce the classifications created by
careful experts.

Classifications Support Interactions

A classification creates structure in the organizing system that
increases the variety and capability of the interactions it can
support. With physical resources, classification increases useful co-
location; in kitchens, for example, keeping resources that are used
together near each other (e.g., baking ingredients) makes cooking
and cleanup more efficient (see "activity-based" classification in
"Classification by Activity Structure").

750 | Understanding Classification
   Classification makes systems more usable when it is manifested
   in the arrangement of resource descriptions or controls in user
   interface components like list boxes, tabs, buttons, function menus,
   and structured lists of search results.1
   A typical mapping between the logic of a classification scheme and a
   user interface is illustrated in Figure: Classification and Interactions.

1. The application of classification and organizing principles
  more generally to the design of user interfaces to
  facilitate information access, navigation, and use is often
  called "Information Architecture." See (Morville and
  Rosenfeld 2006).

                                                             Understanding Classification | 751
Good user interface design creates a clear mapping between the
logic of a classification scheme and the selection methods and
arrangements presented to users. Categories that are mutually
exclusive imply different tabs or other visualizations that imply a
single selection, for example.
How a business classifies its product or service strongly influences
whether a customer can find it; this is the essential task of
marketing. The business of "search engine optimization" exists to
help a firm with a web presence choose the categories and

752 | Understanding Classification
   descriptive terms that will improve its ranking in search results and
   attract the number of types of customer it desires.2

   How a customer interacts with a supplier is influenced by how the
   supplier classifies its offerings in its shopping aisles or catalogs; the
   "science of shopping" uses creative classifications and co-location
   of goods to shape browsing behavior and encourage impulse
   buying.3

   In business-to-business contexts, standard classifications for
   business processes and their application interfaces enable firms
   to more easily build and maintain supply chains and distribution
   networks that interconnect many business partners.4

   optimization "cookbook" for do-it-yourselfers. See
   (Malaga 2008) for a critique of typical SEO practices.

4. The RosettaNet standards are used by thousands of firms
   as specifications and implementations of business-to-
   business processes in several industries, especially
   component manufacturing and electronics. The
   specifications are defined using a three-level hierarchy
   of process clusters, segments, and partner interface
   processes (PIPs) to enable firms to find a level of process
   abstraction that works best for them. See
   http://RosettaNet.org.

          Classification In A Novel User Interface

          The meat from animals used as food is classified into
       numerous "cuts" based on its origin. In the US, these
       classifications are standardized by the Department of
       Agriculture to ensure that meat is labeled correctly. The
       most natural way to convey the classification system is
       to label the parts of the animal in a diagram, because
       this binds each logical category to the "user interface."

Classification Is Principled

"Principles for Creating Categories" explained principles for
754 | Understanding Classification
creating categories, including enumeration, single properties,
multiple properties and hierarchy, probabilistic co-occurrence of
properties, theory and goal-based categorization. It logically follows
that the principles considered in designing categories are embodied
in classifications that use those categories. However, when we say,
"classification is principled," we are going further to say that the
processes of assigning resources to categories and maintaining the
classification scheme over time must also follow principles.

The design and use of a classification system involves many choices
about its purposes, scope, scale, intended lifetime, extensibility,
and other considerations. Principled classification means that once
those design choices are made they should be systematically and
consistently followed.

Principled does not necessarily equate to "good," because many
of the choices can be arbitrary and others may involve tradeoffs
that depend on the nature of the resources, the purposes of the
classification, the amount of effort available, the complexity of the
domain, and the capabilities of the people doing the classification
and of the people using it (see "Category Design Issues and
Implications"). Every classification system is biased in one way or
another (see "Bibliographic Classification").

Consider the classifications of resources in a highly-organized
kitchen. (See "Organizing a Kitchen"). Tableware, dishes, pots and
pans, spices and food provisions, and other resources have
dedicated locations determined by a set of intersecting
requirements and organizing principles. There is no written
specification, and other people organize their kitchens differently.

On the other hand, complex institutional classification systems like
those used in libraries or government agencies are implemented
with detailed specifications, methods, protocols, and guidelines.
The people who apply these methods in the field have studied the
protocols in school or they have received extensive on-the-job

                                                         Understanding Classification | 755
   training to ensure that they apply them correctly, consistently, and
   in accordance with the specifications and guidelines.

  Principles Embodied in the Classification Scheme

   Some of the most important principles that lead us to say that
   classification is principled are those that guide the design of the
   classification scheme in the first place. These principles are
   fundamental in the discipline of library science but they apply more
   broadly to other domains.

   The warrant principle concerns the justification for the choice of
   categories and the names given to them. The principle of literary
   warrant holds that a classification must be based only on the
   specific resources that are being classified. In the library context,
   this ad hoc principle that builds a classification from a particular
   collection principle is often posed in opposition to a more
   philosophical or epistemological perspective, first articulated by
   Francis Bacon in the seventeenth century, that a classification
   should be universal and must handle all knowledge and all possible
   resources.5

   The principle of scientific warrant argues that only the categories
   recognized by the scientists or experts in a domain should be used
   in a classification system, and it is often opposed by the principle
   of use or user warrant, which chooses categories and descriptive

5. See (Gaukroger 2001) and (Weinberger 1985) for an
   introduction to Bacon's philosophy, and (Miksa 1984) for
   an analysis of Bacon's influence on systems of library
   classification.

    756 | Understanding Classification
terms according to their frequency of use by everyone, not just
experts.6

With classifications of physical resources like those in a kitchen, we
see object warrant, where similar objects are put together, but more
frequently the justifying principle will be one of use warrant, where
resources are organized based on how they are used.

          Starbucks Coffee Sizes: "Anti-User" Warrant?
          The Starbucks coffee chain seemingly goes out of its
       way to confuse its customers by calling the smallest
       (twelve ounces) of its three coffee sizes the "tall" size,
       calling its sixteen-ounce size a "grande," and calling its
       largest a "venti," which is Italian for twenty (ounces).
       Outside of Starbucks, something that is "tall" is never
       also considered "small." Ironically, despite having more
       than five thousand coffeehouses in over fifty countries,
       Starbucks has none in Italy where venti would be in the
       local language.

A second principle embodied in a classification scheme concerns
the breadth and depth of the category hierarchy. We discussed this
in "Category Design Issues and Implications" but in the context of
classification this principle has additional implications and is framed
as the extent to which the scheme is enumerative ("Classification vs.
Physical Arrangement"). The decision to classify broadly or precisely
depends largely on the variety or heterogeneity of the resources
that the system of categories has been designed to organize.
Because of the diversity of resources for a sale in a department

6. (Svenonius 2000, Ch. 8).

                             Understanding Classification | 757
   store, a broad classification is necessary to accommodate
   everything in the store. Kitchen goods will be grouped together in
   a few aisles on a single floor. But a specialty kitchen store or a
   wholesale kitchen supply store for restaurants would classify much
   more precisely because of the restricted resource domain and the
   greater expertise of those who want to buy things there. An entire
   section might be dedicated just to knives, organized by knife type,
   manufacturer, quality of steel, and other categories that are not
   used in the kitchen section of the department store.7

   The precision or enumerativeness of a classification scheme
   increases the similarity of resources that are assigned to the same
   category and sharpens the distinctions between resources in
   different categories. However, when different classifications must
   be combined, mismatches in their precision or granularity can
   create challenges (see "Reorganizing Resources for Interactions").

  Principles for Assigning Resources to Categories

   The uniqueness principle means the categories in a classification
   scheme are mutually exclusive. Thus, when a logical concept is
   assigned to a particular category, it cannot simultaneously be
   assigned to another category. Resources, however, can be assigned
   to several categories if they embody several concepts represented
   by those different categories. This can present a challenge when a
   physical storage solution is based on storing resources according
   to its assigned category in a logical classification system. This is
   not a serious problem for resource types like technical equipment

  http://kitchenknives.com/.

   758 | Understanding Classification
or tools, for which the properties used to classify them are highly
salient, and that have very narrow and predictable contexts of use.
It is also not a problem for highly-specialized information resources
like scientific research reports or government economic data, which
might end up in only one specialized class. However, many
resources are inherently more difficult to classify because they have
less salient properties or because they have many more possible
uses.

We face this kind of problem all the time. For example, should we
store a pair of scissors in the kitchen or in the office? One solution
is to buy a second pair of scissors so that scissors can be kept in
both locations where they are typically used, but this is not practical
for many types of resources and this principle would be difficult to
apply in a systematic manner.

Many books are about multiple subjects. A self-help book about
coping with change in a business setting might reasonably be
classified as either about applied psychology or about business. It
is not helpful that book titles are often poor clues to their content;
Who Moved My Cheese? is in fact a self-help book about coping with
change in a business setting. Its Library of Congress Classification
is BF 637, "Applied Psychology," and at UC Berkeley it is kept in the
business school library.

The general solution to satisfying the uniqueness principle in library
classifications when resources do not clearly fit in a single category
is to invent and follow a detailed set of often arbitrary rules. Usually,
the primary subject of the book is used for assigning a category,
which will then determine the book's place on a shelf.

However, another rule might state that if a book treats two subjects
equally, the subject that is covered first determines the
classification. For some classifications a "table of preference" can
trump other rules at the last minute. Not surprisingly, the rules for

                                                         Understanding Classification | 759
   categorizing books take a long time to learn and are not always easy
   to apply.8

  Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time

   Most personal classifications are created in response to a specific
   situation to solve an emerging organizational challenge. As a
   consequence, personal classification systems change in an ad hoc
   or opportunistic manner during their limited lifetimes. For example,
   the classification schemes in your kitchen or closet are
   deconstructed and disappear when you move and take your
   possessions to a different house or apartment. Your efforts to re-
   implement the classifications will be influenced by the configuration
   of shelves and cabinets in your new residence, so they will not be
   exactly the same.

   In contrast, the institutional classification schemes for many library
   resources, culturally or scientifically-important artifacts, and much
   of the information created or collected by businesses, governments
   and researchers might have useful lives of decades or centuries.
   Classification systems like these can only be changed incrementally
   to avoid disruption of the work flows of the organization. We
   described maintaining resources as an activity in all organizing

8. For example, the introductory text for the Dewey
   Decimal Classification(DDC) is 38 pages long
   (http://www.oclc.org/dewey/resources/scholar.htm). A
   full set of online training modules "focused on the needs
   of experienced librarians needing Dewey application
   training" runs 30 hours (http://www.oclc.org/dewey/
   resources/teachingsite/courses/default.htm).

    760 | Understanding Classification
   systems ("Maintaining Resources") and the issues of persistence,
   effectivity, authenticity, and provenance that emerge with
   resources over time ("Resources over Time"). Much of this previous
   discussion applies in a straightforward manner to maintaining
   classifications over time.

   However, some additional issues arise with classifications over time.
   The warrant principle ("Principles Embodied in the Classification
   Scheme") implicitly treats the justification for designing and naming
   categories as a one-time decision. This is reasonable if you are
   organizing a collection of bibliographic resources or common types
   of physical resources like printed books, clothing or butterflies.
   However, in domains where the resources are active, change their
   state or implementation, or otherwise have a probabilistic character
   it might be necessary to revisit warrant and the decisions based
   on it from time to time. Put another way, if the world that you
   are sampling from or describing has some randomness or change
   in it, the categories and descriptions you imposed on it probably
   need to change as well. It often happens that the meaning of an
   underlying category can change, along with its relative and absolute
   importance with respect to the other categories in the classification
   system. Categories sometimes change slowly, but they can also
   change quickly and radically as a result of technological, process, or
   geopolitical innovation or events. Entirely new types of resources
   and bodies of knowledge can appear in a short time. Consider what
   the categories of "travel," "entertainment," "computing," and
   "communication" mean today compared to just a decade or two ago.

   Changes in the meaning of the categories in a classification threaten
   its integrity, the principle that categories should not move within
   the structure of the classification system.9

9. (Taylor and Joudrey 2009, p. 392) define integrity as the
   stability of notations (class identifiers) in a classification

                                                              Understanding Classification | 761
One way to maintain integrity while adapting to the dynamic and
changing nature of knowledge is to define a new version of a
classification system while allowing earlier ones to persist, which
preserves resource assignments in the previous version of the
classification system while allowing it to change in the new one. If
we adopt a logical perspective on classification ("Classification vs.
Tagging") that dissociates the conceptual assignment of resources
to categories from their physical arrangement, there is no reason
why a resource cannot have contrasting category assignments in
different versions of a classification.

However, the conventional library with collections of physical
resources cannot easily abandon its requirement to use a
classification to arrange books on shelves in specific places so they
can be located, checked out, and returned to the same location.

This constraint does not preclude the versioning of library
classifications, but it increases the inertia and limits the degree
of change when revisions are made because of the cost and
coordination considerations of rearranging books in all the world's
libraries.

A related principle about maintaining classifications over time is
flexibility, the degree to which the classification can accommodate
new categories. Computer scientists typically describe this
principle as extensibility, and library scientists sometimes describe

so that resources are never given new notations when
the category meaning changes. This is especially
pertinent in a physical world where class notations are
affixed to resources (books in a traditional library, for
example) and where the changing of meaning would
necessitate the changing of many numbers.

     it as hospitality. In any case the concern is the same and we are
     all familiar with it. When you buy a bookshelf, clothes wardrobe,
     file cabinet, or computer, it makes sense to buy one that has some
     extra space to accommodate the books, clothes, or files you will
     acquire over some future time frame. As with other choices that
     need to be made about organizing systems, how much extra space
     and "organizing room" you will acquire involves numerous tradeoffs.

     Classification schemes can increase their flexibility by creating
     extra "logical space" when they are defined. Library classifications
     accomplish this by using naming or numbering schemes for
     classification that can be extended easily to create new
     subcategories.10

     Classification schemes in information systems can also anticipate
     the evolution of document or database schemas.11

10. For example, the Universal Decimal Classification(UDC)
    intentionally left the main class 4 blank in order to have
    space for currently unknown subjects on the highest
    hierarchy level. (http://www.udcc.org/udcsummary/php/
    index.php). The Library of Congress Classification(LCC)
    also left space on the highest hierarchical level by not
    using all letters in the alphabet. Classifications also leave
    spaces in the enumeration of more specific classes.

    to the challenges and approaches for changing deployed

Classification Is Biased

The discipline of organizing is fundamentally about choices of
properties and principles for describing and arranging resources.
We discussed choices about describing resources in "The Process
of Describing Resources", choices for creating resource categories
in "Principles for Creating Categories", and choices for creating
classifications in this chapter. The choices made reflect the
purposes, experiences, professions, politics, values, and other
characteristics and preferences of the people making them. As a
result, every system of classification is biased because it takes a
point of view that is a composite of all of these influences.

          Statistical Bias and Variance
          Statistical bias is the systematic error in
       measurements introduced by miscalibration of the
       measurement instrument, by ineffective measurement
       techniques, an algorithm that makes incorrect
       assumptions, or some environment interference, all of
       which distort the measured value in a predictable way.
       Measurement bias contrasts with the variability or
       variance of a measurement, the amount of dispersion
       around an average or expected value, most often due to
       random factors. Some variance arises because the
       property being measured is not the same for all
       instances, as we would expect for measurements of the

contains several hundred sources. See http://se-
pubs.dbs.uni-leipzig.de/.

764 | Understanding Classification
       weight of a random sample of people, or in the set of
       tags or topics assigned to a random sample of news
       articles by people or algorithms. By analyzing a large
       enough set of instances it is possible to determine the
       most likely values of the property and also to estimate
       the amount of random error.

          High variance in the measurements for a sample of
       resources when we expect all of them to have more
       similar values can be a quality problem. High bias, on
       the other hand, might be less of a quality problem,
       because systematic sources of inaccuracy might be
       easier to correct.

But first we need to point out that there are at least two quite
different senses of "bias" that people reading this book are likely to
encounter. The colloquial sense of bias we discuss in this section
reflects value-based decisions in organizing systems that implicitly
or explicitly favor some interactions or users over others. In
contrast, statistical bias is systematic error or distortion in a
measurement. (See the sidebar, Statistical Bias and Variance.)

          Precise and accurate dart throws demonstrate low
       bias and low variance (lower left in the figure). Precise
       but inaccurate darts reflect high bias and low variance
       (upper left). Imprecise but accurate ones have low bias
       but high variance (lower right). Finally, a lack of accuracy
       and precision shows both high bias and high variance
       (upper right).

The claim that classification is biased might seem surprising,
because many classification systems are formal and institutional,
created by governments or firms participating in standards
organizations. We expect these classifications to be impartial and
objective. However, consider the classification of people as
"employed" or "unemployed." Many people think that any
employable person who is not currently employed would be
counted as unemployed. But the US government's Department of
Labor only counts someone as unemployed if they have actively

766 | Understanding Classification
looked for work in the past month, effectively removing anyone
who has given up on finding work from the unemployed category
by assigning them to a "discouraged worker" category. In 2012 this
classification scheme allowed the government to report that
unemployment was about 8% and falling, when in fact it was closer
to 20% and rising. The political implications of this classification are
substantial.12

Classification bias is often intentionally or unintentionally shown
in data visualizations, including choropleth maps, in which map
regions are colored, patterned, or otherwise distinguished
according to a statistical variable being displayed on the map.
Choropleths are commonly used to display election results, with
the districts or states won by each candidate shown in different
colors; in the United States, the convention is to show those won by
Democratic Party candidates in blue, and those won by Republicans
in Red. These election choropleths are often misleading because
coloring an entire state in the winner's colors ignores population
density and the regional concentrations of votes that differ from the
majority.

          California Election Map:
          A "Blue" State with More "Red" Counties

          California voters are reliably "blue" as a whole, but
       with election results divided by county, it is clear that
       this majority is amassed in the large cities along the
       coast, and inland and rural counties are more reliably
       "red" in their voting.
768 | Understanding Classification
     A more subtle way in which choropleths encode bias reflects the
     decisions made to organize the data into the categories that are
     represented by different colors or patterns. Choropleth categories
     might present data divided into equal range intervals, into sets with
     the same number of observations, or into categories that reflect
     clusters or natural breaks in the observed data. Small changes in the
     data ranges or proportions that are then assigned to each category
     can communicate entirely different stories with the same data. To
     learn "how to lie with maps" or how to prevent being lied to, refer to
     the classic book with that title by Mark Monmonier.13

     Friedman and Nissenbaum's Bias In Computer Systems offers a
     framework for conceptualizing the various types of bias that may be
     present in technical systems. Friedman and Nissenbaum define bias
     as "a system that systematically and unfairly discriminates against
     individuals or groups of individuals in favor of others" Their
     taxonomy includes pre-existing, technical, and emergent bias.14

     Pre-existing bias is the type people are most familiar with: it occurs
     when an organizing system's design embodies personal or societal
     biases that exist at the time of its creation, either intentionally
     or inadvertently, and sometimes despite one's best intentions to
     prevent it.

     Technical bias arises from limitations and constraints of technical
     systems that result in unfairness when the system is applied to the
     real world. Automated decision-making is especially ripe for this

13. (Monmonier 1996) is a highly-readable treatment of
    intentional and inadvertent bias in mapmaking. A web
    search for "lying with maps" yields a large number of
    examples. See also When Maps Lie" by Wiseman

     sort of bias: alphabetical ordering, processes that rely on pseudo-
     random number generation, and other automated ways of sorting
     or grouping resources may systematically create different
     opportunities for different user groups (e.g., people or companies
     whose names begin with "A").

     Emergent bias is related to the interplay between actual users and
     a technical system. Problems of this type arise when, due to the
     designer's incomplete understanding of the user population, or a
     change in that population over time, there is a mismatch between
     users and the system. User interfaces are especially susceptible
     to this form of bias, given their need to reflect the habits and
     capacities of intended users. Unfairness can emerge when an
     unexpected user group uses the system, or as new societal
     knowledge arises that the system is not able to incorporate or
     respond to.

     Both pre-existing and emergent bias may be difficult to assess
     accurately; the former may be difficult for the biased to see or admit
     to, and the latter, arising due to unanticipated circumstances after
     implementation, is hard to predict.

     Bowker and Star have written extensively about biases in
     classification systems but acknowledge that many people do not see
     them:

                    Information scientists work every day on the design,
                    delegation and choice of classification systems and
                    standards, yet few see them as artifacts embodying
                    moral and aesthetic choices that in turn craft people's
                    identities, aspirations and dignity.15
                    (Bowker and Star 2000)

15. (Bowker and Star 2000, p. 4).

     770 | Understanding Classification
Bowker and Star describe many examples where seemingly neutral
and benign classifications implement controversial assumptions. A
striking example is found in the ethnic classifications of the United
States Census and the categories to which US residents are required
to assign themselves. These categories have changed nearly every
decade since the first census in 1790 and strongly reflect political
goals, prevailing cultural sensitivities or lack thereof, and non-
scientific considerations. Some recent changes included a "multi-
racial" category, which some people viewed as empowering, but
which was attacked by African-American and Hispanic civil rights
groups as diluting their power.16

A more positive way to think about bias in classification is that the
choices made in an organizing system about resource selection,
description, and arrangement come together to convey the values
of the organizers. This makes a classification a rhetorical or
communicative vehicle for establishing credibility and trust with
those who interact with the resources in the classification. Seen in
this light, an objective or neutral classification is not only unrealistic
as a goal; it may also consume valuable time and energy when
instead it might be more desirable to seize the opportunity to
interpret the resources in a creative way to communicate a
particular message to a particular user group. Melanie Feinberg
makes the point that "fair trade" or "green" supermarkets
differentiate themselves by a relatively small proportion of the

States  census,  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

character of the classifications."

    goods they offer compared with ordinary stores, but these
    particular items signal the values that their customers care most
    about.17
    Bias is clearly evident in the most widely used bibliographic
    classifications, the Library of Congress and the Dewey Decimal,
    which we discuss next.

 53. Bibliographic
 Classification

   Much of our thinking about classification comes from the
   bibliographic domain. Libraries and the classification systems for
   the resources they contain have been evolving for millennia, shaped
   by the intellectual, social, and technological conditions of the
   societies that created them. As early as the third millennium BCE,
   there were enough written documents--papyrus scrolls or clay
   tablets--that the need arose to organize them. Some of the first
   attempts, by Mesopotamian scribes, were simple lists of documents
   in no particular order. The ancient Greeks, Romans, and Chinese
   created more principled systems, both sorting works by features
   such as language and alphabetical order, and placing them into
   semantically significant categories such as topic or genre. Medieval
   European libraries were tightly focused on Christian theology, but
   as secular books and readers proliferated thanks to new
   technologies and increased literacy, bibliographic classifications
   grew broader and more complex to accommodate them. Modern
   classification systems are highly nuanced systems designed to
   encompass all knowledge; however, they retain some of the same
   features and biases of their forebears.1

1. One of the earliest known libraries--at Nippur in
  Mesopotamia--was small enough that its catalog needed
  no particular organization: the list of titles in the
  collection fit onto two easily scanned clay tablets. As
  collections grew, scribes made it easier to browse the
  contents of a collection by adding "colophons," brief

                                                               Bibliographic Classification | 773
descriptions containing a document's title, author, and
place in a sequence of tablets (Casson 2002). A further
step was the sorting of works into categories. A temple
in the ancient Egyptian city of Edfu placed books into
different trunks based on their topics, including royal
duties, temple management, and timekeeping, as well as
two trunks each for astronomy and protection from
crocodiles. The fabled library of Alexandria in ancient
Greece used categories based on Aristotle's three modes
of thought: theoretical (e.g. mathematics, physics,
metaphysics), practical (ethics, politics, economics), and
poetic (poetry, music, and art), plus a fourth "meta-
category," logic, that applied to all of them. Callimachus,
one of the library's directors, created the Pinakes, a
library catalog whose top-level distinction was between
poetry and prose (followed by genre, author, and work).
A few centuries later, librarians in the Chinese Wei and
Jin dynasties (third-fifth centuries CE) settled on four
major categories--classics, philosophy, history, and
literature--that lasted well into the twentieth century.
(Shamurin 1955) Unlike the Greek system, which
classified authors, the Chinese system classified
individual works; some authors have suggested that this
reflects Western cultures' greater emphasis on the
individual. Medieval libraries adapted ancient practices
for their own needs: monastery libraries had separate
cabinets for topics such as Bibles, Church history, and

774 | Bibliographic Classification
We will briefly describe the most important systems for
bibliographic classification, especially the Dewey Decimal
Classification(DDC) and Library of Congress Classification(LCC)
systems. However, there are several important ways in which
bibliographic classification is distinctive and we will discuss those
first:

Scale, Complexity, and Degree of Standardization:

      Department stores and supermarkets typically offer tens of

Christian poets, and divided their collections into
Christian and secular literature (meanwhile, scholars in
the intellectually flourishing Muslim world classified
knowledge into Muslim and non-Muslim sciences) (Christ
1984). Today's classification systems reflect both their
debt to earlier systems and the biases of their own
cultures: the first category of the Universal Decimal
Classification, just like Aristotle's "logic" category, is a
meta-category covering organization, documentation,
and information science, while the first top-level
category of the Chinese Classification System is
"Marxism, Leninism, Maoism, and Deng Xiaoping theory."

(Taylor and Joudrey 2009, Ch. 3) is a historical review
of library classification. (Svenonius 2000) reviews the
evolution of the theoretical foundations. (Kilgour 1998)
focuses on the evolution of the book and the story of the
co-evolution of libraries and classification comes along
for the ride.

                                                            Bibliographic Classification | 775
         thousands of different items (as measured by the number of
         "stock keeping units" or SKUs), and popular online commerce
         sites like Amazon.com and eBay are of similar scale. However,
         the standard product classification system for supermarkets
         has only about 300 categories.2 The classifications for online
         stores are typically deeper than those for physical stores, but
         they are highly idiosyncratic and non-standard. In contrast,
         scores of university libraries have five million or more distinct
         items in their collections, and they almost all use the same
         standard bibliographic classification system that has about
         300,000 distinct categories.3

   Legacy of Physical Arrangement, User Access, and Re-Shelving:

         A corollary to the previous one that distinguishes bibliographic
         classification systems is that they have long been shaped and
         continue to be shaped by the legacy of physical arrangement,
         user access to the storage locations, and re-shelving that they
         support. These requirements constrain the evolution and
         extensibility of bibliographic classifications, making them less
         able to keep pace with changing concepts and new bodies of
         knowledge. Amazon classifies the products it sells in huge

2. Supermarkets typically carry anywhere from 15,000 to
   60,000 SKUs (depending on the size of the store), and
   may offer a service deli, a service bakery, and/or a
   pharmacy. 300 standard product categories
   (http://www.fmi.org/research-resources/supermarket-
   facts).

         warehouses, but its customers do not have to pick out their
         purchases there, and most goods never return to the
         warehouse. Amazon can add new product categories and
         manage the resources in warehouses far more easily than
         libraries can.

            With digital libraries, constraints of scale and physical
         arrangement are substantially eliminated, because the storage
         location is hidden from the user and the resources do not need
         to be returned and re-shelved. However, when users can search
         the entire content of the library, as they have learned to expect
         from the web, they are less likely to use the bibliographic
         classification systems that have painstakingly been applied to
         the library's resources.

  The Dewey Decimal Classification

   The Dewey Decimal Classification(DDC) is the world's most widely
   used bibliographic system, applied to books in over 200,000
   libraries in 135 countries. It is a proprietary and de facto standard,
   and it must be licensed for use from the Online Computer Library
   Center(OCLC).4

   In 1876, Melvil Dewey invented the DDC when he was hired to
   manage the Amherst College library immediately after graduating.
   Dewey was inspired by Bacon's attempt to create a universal
   classification for all knowledge and considered the DDC as a
   numerical overlay on Bacon with 10 main classes, each divided into
   10 more, and so on. Despite his explicit rejection of literary warrant,

                                                                Bibliographic Classification | 777
however, Dewey's classification was strongly influenced by the
existing Amherst collection, which reflected Amherst's focus on the
time on the "education of indigent young men of piety and talents
for the Christian ministry."5

The resulting nineteenth-century Western bias in the DDC's
classification of religion seems almost startling today, where it
persists in the 23rd revision (see Figure: "Religion" in Dewey Decimal
Classification.). "Religion" is one of the 10 main classes, the 200
class, with nine subclasses, Six of these nine subclasses are topics
with "Christian" in the name; one class is for the Bible alone; and
another section is entitled "Natural theology." Everything else
related to the world's many religions is lumped under 290, "Other
religions."

"Religion" in Dewey Decimal Classification

200 Religion
   210 Natural Theology
   220 Bible
   230 Christian theology
   240 Christian moral and devotional theology
   250 Christian orders and local church
   260 Christian social theology
   270 Christian church history
   280 Christian sects and denominations
   290 Other religions

The notational simplicity of a decimal system makes the DDC easy
to use and easy to subdivide existing categories, So-called
subdivision tables allow facets for language, geography or format to

   Amherst is aggressively co-ed and secular.

778 | Bibliographic Classification
   be added to many classes, making the classification more specific.
   But the overall system is not very hospitable to new areas of
   knowledge.

  The Library of Congress Classification

   The US Library of Congress is the largest library in the world today,
   but it got off to a bad start after being established in 1800. In 1814,
   during the War of 1812, British troops burned down the US Capitol
   building where the library was located and the 3000 books in the
   collection went up in flames.6 The library was restarted a year later

6. That was not a typo. The "War of 1812" lasted well into
   1815. The persistence of an inaccurate name for this war
   reflects its unique characteristics. Wars (in the English
   language) are generally named for the location of the
   fighting or the enemy being fought (the Mexican-
   American War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the
   Iraq War), or for a particular ideal or ambition (the
   Revolutionary War, the Civil War). The War of 1812 does
   not satisfy any of these naming conventions; the war was
   fought across a huge range of geography from eastern
   Canada to Louisiana, between a diverse range of groups
   from Canadians and Native American tribes, with
   national armies getting involved very late in the war.
   While nominally fought over freedom the seas, the war
   quickly morphed into one about territorial ambition in
   North America. Of course, if the world were a place

                                                                Bibliographic Classification | 779
   when Congress purchased the personal library of former president
   Thomas Jefferson, which was over twice the size of the collection
   that the British burned. Jefferson was a deeply intellectual person,
   and unlike the narrow historical and legal collection of the original
   library, Jefferson's library reflected his "comprehensive interests in
   philosophy, history, geography, science, and literature, as well as
   political and legal treatises."7

   Restarting the Library of Congress around Jefferson's personal
   collection and classification had an interesting implication. When
   Herbert Putnam formally created the Library of Congress
   Classification (LCC) in 1897, he meant it not as a way to organize all
   the world's knowledge, but to provide a practical way to organize
   and later locate items within the Library of Congress's collection.
   However, despite Putnam's commitment to literary warrant, the
   breadth of Jefferson's collection made the LCC more intellectually
   ambitious than it might otherwise had been, and probably
   contributed to its dominant adoption in university libraries.

   The LCC has 21 top-level categories, identified by letters instead
   of using numbers like the DDC (see Figure: Top Level Categories
   in the Library of Congress Classification.). Each top-level category
   is divided into about 10-20 subclasses, each of which is further
   subdivided. The complete LCC and supporting information takes up
   41 printed volumes.

  where people could agree on naming standards for wars,
  it is likely we would no longer have wars. See

   Bias is apparent in the LCC as it is in the DDC, but is somewhat
   more subtle. A library for the US emphasizes its own history. "Naval
   science" was vastly more important in the 1800s when it was given
   its own top level category, separated from other resources about
   "Military science" (which had a subclass for "Cavalry").8

   The LCC is highly enumerative, and along with the uniqueness

     principle, this creates distortions over time and sometimes requires
     contortions to incorporate new disciplines. For example, it might
     seem odd today that a discipline as broad and important as
     computer science does not have its own second level category
     under the Q category of science, but because computer science
     was first taught in math departments, the LCC has it as the QA76
     subclass of mathematics, which is QA.9

   The BISAC Classification

     A very different approach to bibliographic classification is
     represented in the Book Industry Standards Advisory Committee
     classification(BISAC). BISAC is developed by the Book Industry Study
     Group(BISG), a non-profit industry association that "develops,
     maintains, and promotes standards and best practices that enable
     the book industry to conduct business more efficiently." The BISAC
     classification system is used by many of the major businesses within
     the North American book industry, including Amazon, Baker &
     Taylor, Barnes & Noble, Bookscan, Booksense, Bowker, Indigo,
     Ingram and most major publishers.10

 9. Cognitive Science has an even harder time finding its
    proper place in the LCC because it emerged as the
    intersection of psychology, linguistics, computer science,
    and other disciplines. Cognitive science books can be
    found scattered throughout the LCC, with
    concentrations in BF, P, and QA.

10. The Book Industry Study Group(BISG) first and foremost
    is focused on resource description and classification as

      782 | Bibliographic Classification
    The BISAC classifications are used by publishers to suggest to
    booksellers how a book should be classified in physical and online
    bookstores. Because of its commercial and consumer focus, BISAC
    follows a principle of use warrant, and its categories are biased
    toward common language usage and popular culture. Some top-
    level BISAC categories, including Law, Medicine, Music, and
    Philosophy, are also top-level categories in the LCC. However, BISAC
    also has top-level categories for Comics & Graphic Novels. Cooking,
    Pets, and True Crime.

    The differences between BISAC and the LCC are understandable
    because they are used for completely different purposes and
    generally have little need to come into contact. This changed in
    2004, when Google began its ambitious project to digitize the
    majority of the world's books. (See the sidebar, What Is a Library?).
    To the dismay of many people in the library and academic
    community, Google initially classified books using BISAC rather
    than the LCC.11

    In addition, some new public libraries have adopted BISAC rather
    than the DDC because they feel the former makes the library
    friendlier to its users. Some librarians believe that their online
    catalogs need to be more like web search engines, so a less precise

   means to business ends; this purpose contrasts with
   goals of DDC or LOC. BISG classifications are used for
   barcodes and shipping labels to support supply chain and
   inventory management, marketing, and promotion
   activities. See http://www.bisg.org/.

     classification that uses more familiar category terms seems like a
     good choice.12

12. What some call the "Perry Rebellion" or the "Dewey
    Dilemma" began in 2007 when the new Perry Branch
    Library in Gilbert, Arizona opened with its books
    classified using the BISAC rather than Dewey
    classifications. (Fister 2009). This is a highly inflamed
    controversy that pits advocates of customer service and
    usability against the library establishment, which
    despises the idea of turning to retailing as inspiration
    when designing and operating a library. Even if BISAC
    gets more widely adopted in public libraries it is
    unimaginable that it can be used in research libraries.

54. Faceted Classification

We have noted several times that strictly enumerative
classifications constrain how resources are assigned to categories
and how the classification can evolve over time. Faceted
classifications are an alternative that overcome some of these
limitations. In a faceted classification system, each resource is
described using properties from multiple facets, but a person
searching for resources does not need to consider all of the
properties (and consequently the facets) and does not need to
consider them in a fixed order, which an enumerative hierarchical
classification requires.

Faceted classifications are especially useful in web user interfaces
for online shopping or for browsing a large and heterogeneous
museum collection. The process of considering facets in any order
and ignoring those that are not relevant implies a dynamic
organizational structure that makes selection both flexible and
efficient. We can best illustrate these advantages with a shopping
example in a domain that we are familiar with from "Multiple
Properties".

If a department store offers shirts in various styles, colors, sizes,
brands, and prices, shoppers might want to search and sort through
them using properties from these facets in any order. However, in
a physical store, this is not possible because the shirts must be
arranged in actual locations in the store, with dress shirts in one
area, work shirts in another, and so on.

Assume that the shirt store has shirts in four styles: dress shirts,
work shirts, party shirts, and athletic shirts. The dress shirts come
in white and blue, the work shirts in white and brown, and the party
and athletic shirts come in white, blue, brown, and red. White dress
shirts come in large and medium sizes.

                                                                   Faceted Classification | 785
Suppose we are looking for a white dress shirt in a large size. We
can think of this desired shirt in two equivalent ways, either as a
member of a category of "large white dress shirts" or a shirt with
"dress," "white," and "large" values on style, color, and size facets.
Because of the way the shirts are arranged in the physical store, our
search process has to follow a hierarchical structure of categories.
We go to the dress shirt section, find white shirts, and then look
for a large one. This process corresponds to the hierarchy shown
in Figure: Enumerative Classification with Style Facet Followed by
Color Facet.
Enumerative Classification with
Style Facet Followed by Color Facet

In an enumerative classification system the order of the facets
determines the classification hierarchy. For example, a store might
classify shirts first using a style facet, next with a color facet, and
finally with a size facet. This ordering could result in two piles of
dress shirts, one blue and one white, in which each pile contains
shirts of large and medium sizes.
Although unlikely, a store might choose to organize its shirts by

786 | Faceted Classification
color. In our search for a "white dress shirt in a large size," if we
consider the color first, because shirts come in four colors, there
are four color categories to choose from. When we choose the white
shirts, there is no category for work shirts because there are no
work shirts that come in white. We then choose the dress shirts, and
then finally find the large one. (Figure: Enumerative Classification
with Color Facet Followed by Style Facet.)
This department store example shows that for a physical
organization, one property facet guides the localization of
resources; all other facets are subordinated under the primary
organizing property. In hierarchical enumerative classifications, this
means that the primary organizing facet determines the primary
form of access. The shirts are either organized by style and then
color, or by color then style, which enforces an inflexible query
strategy (style first or color first).
Enumerative Classification with
Color Facet Followed by Style Facet

An alternative ordering of the same shirt facets changes the
                                                                    Faceted Classification | 787
classification hierarchy. If the first facet considered is color, style is
next, and finally size, this ordering could result in two piles of white
shirts, one for dress shirts and one for athletic shirts, in which each
pile contains shirts of large and medium sizes.
In an online store, however, descriptions of the shirts are being
searched and sorted instead of the real shirts, and different
organizations are possible. When the shirts are described using a
faceted classification system, we treat all facets independently (i.e.,
they can all be the primary facet).
We can enumerate all the properties needed to assign resources
appropriately, but we create the categories (i.e., union of properties
from different facets) only as needed to sort resources with a
particular combination of properties.
An additional aspect of the flexibility of faceted classification is that
a facet can be left out of a resource description if it is not needed
or appropriate. For example, because party shirts are often multi-
colored with exotic patterns, it is not that useful to describe their
color. Likewise, certain types of athletic shirts might be very loose-
fitting, and as a result not be given a size description, but their
color is important because it is tied to a particular team. Figure:
Faceted Classification. shows how these two resource types can be
classified with the faceted Shirt classification. Resource 1 describes
a party shirt in medium; resource 2 describes an athletic shirt in
blue without information about size.

Faceted Classification

788 | Faceted Classification
In a pure faceted classification, not every facet needs to apply to
every resource, and there is no requirement for a predetermined
order in which the facets are considered.

A faceted classification scheme like that shown in Figure: Faceted
Classification. eliminates the requirement for predetermining a
combination and ordering of facets like those in Figure:
Enumerative Classification with Style Facet Followed by Color Facet.
and Figure: Enumerative Classification with Color Facet Followed by
Style Facet. Instead, imagine a shirt store where you decide when
you begin shopping which facets are important to you ("show me all
the medium party shirts," "show me the blue athletic shirts") instead
of having to adhere to whatever predetermined (pre-combined)
enumerative classification the store invented. In a digital organizing
system, faceted classification enables highly flexible access because
prioritizing different facets can dynamically reorganize how the
collection is presented.

                                                                   Faceted Classification | 789
Foundations for Faceted Classification

In library and information science texts it is common to credit
the idea of faceted classification to S.R. Ranganathan, a Hindu
mathematician working as a librarian. Ranganathan had an almost
mystical motivation to classify everything in the universe with a
single classification system and notation, considering it his dharma
(the closest translation in English would be "fundamental duty" or
"destiny"). Facing the limitations of Dewey's system, where an item's
essence had to first be identified and then the item assigned to
a category based on that essence, Ranganathan believed that all
bibliographic resources could be organized around a more abstract
variety of aspects.

In 1933 Ranganathan proposed that a set of five facets applied to all
knowledge:

Personality

      The type of thing.

Matter

      The constituent material of the thing.

Energy

      The action or activity of the thing.

Space

      Where the thing occurs.

Time

      When the thing occurs.

This classification system is known as colon classification (or

790 | Faceted Classification
PMEST) because the notation used for resource identifiers uses a
colon to separate the values on each facet. These values come from
tables of categories and subcategories, making the call number very
compact. Colon classification is most commonly used in libraries in
India.1

For example, a book on "research in the cure of tuberculosis of lungs
by x-ray conducted in India in 1950" has a Personality facet value of
Medicine, a Matter facet value of Lungs with tuberculosis, an Energy
facet value of Treatment using X-rays, a Space facet value of India,
and a Time facet value of 1950. When the alphanumeric codes for
these values are looked up in the classification tables, the composed
call number is L,45;421:6;253:f.44'N5.2

Ranganathan deserves credit for implementing the first faceted
classification system, but people other than librarians generally
credit the idea to Nicolas de Condorcet, a French mathematician
and philosopher. About 140 years before Ranganathan, Condorcet
was concerned that "systems of classification that imposed a given
interpretation upon Nature... represented an insufferable obstacle
to... scientific advance." Condorcet thus proposed a flexible
classification scheme for "arranging a large number of subjects in
a system so that we may straightway grasp their relations, quickly
perceive their combinations, and readily form new combinations."3

Condorcet's system was based on five major facet categories,
divided into 10 terms each, yielding 10^5 or 100,000 combinations:

Objects
      domains of study.

Methods
      for studying objects and describing the knowledge gained.

Points of view
      for studying objects.

Uses and utility
      of knowledge.

Ways
      in which knowledge can be acquired.4

essay in French, but fortunately for us Baker's analysis is
in English, This motivation of Condorcet's classification
scheme sounds like the description of a data warehouse
or business intelligence system in which transactional
data can be "sliced and diced" into new combinations
to answer questions in support of strategic decision-
making. See (Watson and Wixon 2007).

792 | Faceted Classification
Condorcet and Ranganathan proposed different facets, but both
hoped that their five top-level facets would be sufficient for a
universal classification system. People have generally rejected the
idea of universal facets, but Ranganathan's proposals continue to
influence the development of the Library of Congress Subject
Headings (LCSH).5

Faceted classification is most commonly used in narrow domains,
each with its own specific facets. This makes intuitive sense because
even if resources can be distinguished with a general classification,
doing so requires lengthy notations, and it is much harder to add to
a general classification than to a classification created specifically
for a single subject area. We could probably describe shirts using the
PMEST facets, but style, color, and size seem more natural.

Faceted Classification in Description

Elaine Svenonius defines facets as "groupings of terms obtained
by the first division of a subject discipline into homogeneous or
semantically cohesive categories."6 The relationships between
these facets results in a controlled vocabulary ("Identity, Identifiers,
and Names") governing the resources we are organizing. From this
controlled vocabulary we can generate many descriptions that are

5. LCSH uses facets for Topic, Place, Time, and Form (but
   they can be ordered in a variety of ways, not as rigidly
   as PMEST. (Anderson and Hoffman 2006) argue for a fully
   faceted syntax in LCSH.

   complex but formally structured, enabling us to describe things for
   which terms do not yet exist.

   Getty's Art & Architecture Thesaurus(AAT) is a robust and widely
   used controlled vocabulary consisting of generic terms to describe
   artifacts, objects, places and concepts in the domains of "art,
   architecture, and material culture."7

   AAT is a thesaurus with a faceted hierarchical structure. The AAT's
   facets are "conceptually organized in a scheme that proceeds from
   abstract concepts to concrete, physical artifacts:"

   Associated Concepts

         Concepts, philosophical and critical theory, and phenomena,
         such as "love" and "nihilism."

   Physical Attributes

         Material characteristics that can be measured and perceived,
         like "height" and "flexibility."

   Styles and Periods

         Artistic and architectural eras and stylistic groupings, such as
         "Renaissance" and "Dada."

   Agents

         Basically, people and the various groups and organizations with
         which they identify, whether based on physical, mental, socio-
         economic, or political characteristics--e.g., "stonemasons" or
         "socialists."

7. The Getty AAT is online at http://www.getty.edu/
  research/tools/vocabularies/aat/index.html.

   794 | Faceted Classification
Activities
      Actions, processes, and occurrences, such as "body painting"
      and "drawing." These are different from the "Objects" facet,
      which may also contain "body painting," in terms of the actual
      work itself, not the creation process.

Materials
      Concerned with the actual substance of which a work is made,
      like "metal" or "bleach." "Materials" differ from "Physical
      Attributes" in that the latter is more abstract than the former.

Objects
      The largest facet, objects contains the actual works, like
      "sandcastles" and "screen prints."

Within each facet is a strict hierarchical structure drilling down
from broad term to very specific instance.

how a particular instance may be described on a number of
dimensions for the purpose of organizing the item and retrieving
information about it. And by using a standard controlled vocabulary,
catalogers and indexers make it easier for users to understand and

   adapt to the way things are organized for the purpose of finding
   them.8

  A Classification for Facets

   There are four major types of facets.

   Enumerative facets
         Have mutually exclusive possible values. In our online shirt
         store, "Style" is an enumerative facet whose values are "dress,"
         "work," "party," and "athletic."

   Boolean facets
         Take on one of two values, yes (true) or no (false) along some
         dimension or property. On a sportswear website, "Waterproof"
         would be a Boolean facet because an item of clothing is either
         waterproof or it is not.

   Hierarchical facets
         Organize resources by logical inclusion ("Inclusion"). At
         Williams-Sonoma's website, the top-level facet includes
         "Cookware," "Cooks' Tools," and "Cutlery." At wine.com the
         "Region" facet has values for "US," "Old World," and "New

           World," each of which is further divided geographically. 9 Also
           see taxonomic facets.
     Spectrum facets
           Assume a range of numerical values with a defined minimum
           and maximum. Price and date are common spectrum facets.
           The ranges are often modeled as mutually exclusive regions
           (potential price facet values might include "$0--$49,"
           "$50--$99," and "$100--$149").

   Designing a Faceted Classification System

     It is important to be systematic and principled when designing
     a faceted classification. In some respects the process and design
     concerns overlap with those for describing resources, and much
     of the advice in "The Process of Describing Resources" is relevant
     here.10

 9. You might have thought that the US was in the new
    world, but according to wine.com, the new world of wine
    includes Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, and
    South Africa. The geography under the US facet is equally
    distorted by the uneven distribution of quality wine
    making regions, so the values of that facet are California.
    Oregon, Washington, and Other US.

    and Put It On the Web Nov. 2003.

      798 | Faceted Classification
Design Process for Faceted Classification

We advocate a five step process for designing a faceted
classification system.

 1. Define the purposes of the classification ("Determining the
      Purposes", "Classification Is Purposeful") and specify the
      collection of concepts or resources to be classified.

2. For each facet, determine its logical type ("A Classification for
      Facets") and possible values. Specify the order of the values for
      each facet so that they make sense to users; useful orderings
      are alphabetical, chronological, procedural, size, most popular
      to least popular, simple to complex, and geographical or
      topological.

3. Analyze and describe a representative sample of resource
      instances to identify properties or dimensions as candidate
      facets (See "Identifying Properties").

4. Examine the relationships between the facets to create sub-
      facets if necessary. Determine how the facets will be combined
      to generate the classifications.

5. Test the classification on new instances, and revise the facets,
      facet values, and facet grammar as needed.

                                                                   Faceted Classification | 799
   Design Principles and Pragmatics

    Here is some more specific advice about selecting and designing
    facets and facet values:

    Orthogonality

          Facets should be independent dimensions, so a resource can
          have values of all of them while only having one value on each of
          them. In an online kitchen store, one facet might be "Product"
          and another might be "Brand." A particular item might be
          classified as a "Saucepan" in the "Product" facet and as
          "Calphalon" in the "Brand" one. Other saucepans might have
          other brands, and other Calphalon products might not be
          saucepans, because Product and Brand are orthogonal.

    Semantic Balance

          Top-level facets should be the properties that best differentiate
          the resources in the classification domain. The values should
          be of equal semantic scope so that resources are distributed
          among the subcategories. Subfacets of "Cookware" like
          "Sauciers and Saucepans" and "Roasters and Brasiers" are
          semantically balanced as they are both named and grouped by
          cooking activity.11

    Coverage

          The values of a facet should be able of classifying all instances
          within the intended scope.

11. Should remind you of issues of lexical gap in "The Lexical
   Perspective".

    800 | Faceted Classification
     Scalability

           Facet values must accommodate potential additions to the set
           of instances. Including an "Other" value is an easy way to ensure
           that a facet is flexible and hospitable to new instances, but it
           not desirable if all new instances will be assigned that value.

     Objectivity

           Although every classification has an explicit or implicit bias
           ("Classification Is Biased"), facets and facet values should be
           as unambiguous and concrete as possible to enable reliable
           classification of instances.

     Normativity

           To make a faceted classification as useful by as many people as
           possible, the terms used for facets and facet values should not
           be idiosyncratic, metaphorical, or require special knowledge to
           interpret.12

     As we will see in "Computational Classification", classification can
     sometimes be done by computers rather than by people. Computer
     algorithms can analyze resource properties and descriptions to
     identify dimensions on which resources differ and the most
     frequent descriptive terms, which can then be used to design a
     faceted classification scheme. Resources can then be assigned to
     the appropriate categories, either without human intervention or in

12. Semantic balance is a bit hard to define, but you can often
    tell when facet values are not balanced. A cookware facet
    whose values include saucepans, frying pans, stock pots,
    and pizza pans will not evenly distribute resources across
    the facets.

                                                                         Faceted Classification | 801
collaboration with a human who trains the algorithm with classified
instances.

 55. Classification by Activity
 Structure

   Institutional classification systems are often strongly hierarchical
   and taxonomic because their many users come to them for diverse
   purposes, making a context-free or semantic organization the most
   appropriate. However, in narrow domains that offer a more limited
   variety of uses it can be much more effective to classify resources
   according to the tasks or activities they support. A task or activity-
   based classification system is called a taskonomy, a term invented
   by anthropologists Janet Dougherty and Charles Keller after their
   ethnographic study of how blacksmiths organized their tools.
   Instead of keeping things together according to their semantic
   relationships in what Donald Norman called "hardware store
   organization," the blacksmiths arranged tools in locations where
   they were used-- "fire tools," "stump tools," "drill press rack tools,"
   and so on.1

1. See (Dougherty and Keller 1985) for the ethnography of
  blacksmithing, and also (Norman 2006), who extends the
  taskonomy idea to the design of user interfaces for cell
  phones and other computing devices. You probably have
  not worked as blacksmith, but you have certainly used
  taskonomic classification. For example, a student writing
  a term paper or doing a course project checks out books
  from the library's taxonomic classification system (or
  prints them out from the web) and then organizes them
  in piles on a desk or on the floor according to the plan for

                                                                            Classification by Activity
                                                                                       Structure | 803
   Personal organizing systems are often taskonomic. Think about the
   way you cook when you are following a recipe. Do you first retrieve
   all the ingredients from their storage places, and arrange them in
   activity-based groups in the preparation area?2
   Looking at the relationship between tasks and tools in this way can
   help a cook determine the best way to organize tools in a kitchen.
   Cutting items would necessarily be kept together near a prep area;
   having to run across the kitchen to another area where a poultry

 56. Computational
 Classification

   Because of its importance, ubiquity, and ease of processing by
   computers, it should not be surprising that a great many
   computational classification problems involve text. Some of these
   problems are relatively simple, like identifying the language in which
   a text is written, which is solved by comparing the probability of
   one, two, and three character-long contiguous strings in the text
   against their probabilities in different languages. For example, in
   English the most likely strings are "the", "and", "to", "of", "a", "in", and
   so on. But if the most likely strings are "der", "die", "und", and "den"
   the text is German and if they are "de", "la", "que", "el", and "en" the
   text is Spanish.

   More challenging text classification problems arise when more
   features are required to describe each instance being classified and
   where the features are less predictable. The unknown author of
   a document can sometimes be identified by analyzing other
   documents known to be written by him to identify a set of features
   like word frequency, phrase structure, and sentence length that
   create a "writeprint" analogous to a fingerprint that uniquely
   identifies him. This kind of analysis was used in 2013 to determine
   that Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling had written a crime fiction
   novel entitled The Cuckoo's Calling under the pseudonym Robert
   Galbraith.1

   Another challenging text classification problem is sentiment

  1997-2007), (Rowling as "Galbraith" 2013),

   806 | Computational Classification
   analysis, determining whether a text has a positive or negative
   opinion about some topic. Much academic and commercial research
   has been conducted to understand the sentiment of Twitter tweets,
   Facebook posts, email sent to customer support applications, and
   other similar contexts. Sentiment analysis is hard because messages
   are often short so there is not much to analyze, and because and
   because sarcasm, slang, clichés, and cultural norms obscure the
   content needed to make the classification.

   A crucial consideration whenever supervised learning is used to
   train a classifier is ensuring that the training set is appropriate. If
   we were training a classifier to detect spam messages using email
   from the year 2000, the topics of the emails, the words they contain,
   and perhaps even the language they are written in would be
   substantially different than messages from this year. Up to date
   training data is especially important for the classification algorithms
   used by Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and similar social sites that
   classify and recommend content based on popularity trends.

   When the relevant training data is constantly changing and there
   is a great deal of it, there is a risk that by the time a model can
   learn to classify correctly it is already out of date. This challenge
   has led to the development of streaming algorithms that operate on
   data as it comes in, using it as a live data source rather than as a
   static training set. Streaming algorithms are essential for tackling
   datasets that are too large to store or for models that must operate
   under intense time pressure. Streaming approaches complement
   rather than replace those that work with historical datasets because
   they make different tradeoffs between accuracy and speed. The
   streaming system might provide real-time alerting and
   recommendations, while historical analyses are made on the batch-
   oriented system that works with the entire data collection.2

          Stop and Think: Sentiment Analysis
          Sometimes, a text message might seem
       complimentary, but really is not. Is the customer happy
       if he tweets "Nice job, United. You only lost one of my
       bags this time." Think of some other short messages
       where sarcasm or slang makes sentiment analysis
       difficult. How would you write a product or service
       review that is unambiguously positive, negative, or
       neutral? How would you write a review whose

57. Key Points in Chapter
Eight

  · What is classification?
      Classification is the systematic assignment of resources to a
      system of intentional categories, often institutional ones.
      (See "Introduction")

  · What is a classification system?
      A classification system is foremost a specification for the logical
      arrangement of resources because there are usually many
      possible and often arbitrary mappings of logical locations to
      physical ones.
      (See "Classification vs. Physical Arrangement")

  · How does classification affect the potential interactions in an
      organizing system?
      A classification creates structure in the organizing system that
      increases the variety and capability of the interactions it can
      support.
      (See "Classifications Support Interactions")

  · Why are classifications always biased in some way?
      Classifications are always biased by the purposes, experiences,
      professions, politics, values, and other characteristics and
      preferences of the people making them.
      (See "Classification Is Biased")

                                                          Key Points in Chapter Eight | 809
  · According to Friedman and Nissenbaum, what are the three
      types of bias in technical systems?

      Three types of bias in technical systems are pre-existing,
      technical, and emergent bias.

      (See "Classification Is Biased")

  · What are enumerative classification schemes?

      Classification schemes in which all possible categories to which
      resources can be assigned are defined explicitly are called
      enumerative.

      (See "Classification Schemes")

  · What is a taxonomic classification scheme?

      When multiple resource properties are considered in a fixed
      sequence, each property creates another level in the system
      of categories and the classification scheme is hierarchical or
      taxonomic.

      (See "Classification Schemes")

  · What is the relationship between classification and
      standardization?

      Classification and standardization are not identical, but they
      are closely related. Some classifications become standards, and
      some standards define new classifications.

      (See "Classification and Standardization")

  · What is a standard?

      A standard is a published specification that is developed and
      maintained by consensus of all the relevant stakeholders in
      some domain by following a defined and transparent process.

810 | Key Points in Chapter Eight
   (See "Specifications vs. Standards")

· Why are standard semantics important?

   Standard semantics are especially important in industries or
   markets that have significant network effects where the value
   of a product depends on the number of interoperable or
   compatible products.

   (See "Institutional Semantics")

· What is literary warrant?

   The principle of literary warrant holds that a classification must
   be based only on the specific resources that are being classified.

   (See "Principles Embodied in the Classification Scheme")

· What is the uniqueness principle?

   The uniqueness principle means the categories in a
   classification scheme are mutually exclusive. Thus, when a
   logical concept is assigned to a particular category, it cannot
   simultaneously be assigned to another category.

   (See "Principles for Assigning Resources to Categories")

· How is the uniqueness principle followed when resources do
   not clearly fit in a single category?

   The general solution to satisfying the uniqueness principle in
   library classifications when resources do not clearly fit in a
   single category is to invent and follow a detailed set of often-
   arbitrary rules.

   (See "Principles for Assigning Resources to Categories")

· What motivates category change?

   Categories sometimes change slowly, but they can also change

                                                          Key Points in Chapter Eight | 811
      quickly and radically as a result of technological, process, or
      geopolitical innovation or events.

      (See "Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time")

  · What is the relationship among flexibility, extensibility and
      hospitality in a classification system?

      Flexibility, extensibility, and hospitality are synonyms for the
      degree to which the classification can accommodate new
      resources.

      (See "Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time")

  · What distinguishes bibliographic classification?

      Bibliographic classification is distinctive because of a legacy of
      physical arrangement and its scale and complexity.

      (See "Bibliographic Classification")

  · What distinguishes faceted classification systems?

      Faceted classification systems enumerate all the categories
      needed to assign resources appropriately, but instead of
      combining them in advance in a fixed hierarchy, they are
      applied only if they are needed to sort resources with a
      particular combination of properties.

      (See "Faceted Classification")

  · What is orthogonality in a faceted classification system?

      Facets should be independent dimensions, so a resource can
      have values of all of them while only having one value on each
      of them.

      (See "Design Principles and Pragmatics")

  · What is semantic balance in a faceted classification system?

812 | Key Points in Chapter Eight
   Top-level facets should be the properties that best differentiate
   the resources in the classification domain. The values should
   be of equal semantic scope so that resources are distributed
   among the subcategories. Subfacets of "Cookware" like
   "Sauciers and Saucepans" and "Roasters and Brasiers" are
   semantically balanced as they are both named and grouped by
   cooking activity.

   (See "Design Principles and Pragmatics")

· What is scalability in a faceted classification system?

   Facet values must accommodate potential additions to the set
   of instances. Including an "Other" value is an easy way to ensure
   that a facet is flexible and hospitable to new instances, but it
   not desirable if all new instances will be assigned that value.

   (See "Design Principles and Pragmatics")

· What is the relationship between classification and tagging?

   Most tagging seems insufficiently principled to be considered
   classification, except when tags are treated as category labels
   or when decisions that make tagging more systematic turn a set
   of tags into a tagsonomy.

   (See "Classification vs. Tagging")

· What is a taskonomy?

   A task or activity-based classification system is called a
   taskonomy.

   (See "Classification by Activity Structure")

· What is the relationship between supervised learning and
   classification?

   Supervised learning techniques start with a designed

58. Introduction (IX)

Throughout this book, we have emphasized the importance of
separately considering fundamental organizing principles,
application-specific concepts, and details of implementation. The
three-tier architecture we introduced in "The Concept of
"Organizing Principle"" is one way to conceptualize this separation.
In "The Implementation Perspective ", we contrasted the
implementation-focused perspective for analyzing relationships
with other perspectives that focus on the meaning and abstract
structure of relationships. In this chapter, we present this contrast
between conceptualization and implementation in terms of
separating the content and form of resource descriptions.

In the previous chapters, we have considered principles and
concepts of organizing in many different contexts, ranging from
personal organizing systems to cultural and institutional ones. We
have noted that some organizing systems have limited scope and
expected lifetime, such as a task-oriented personal organizing
system like a shopping list. Other organizing systems support broad
uses that rely on standard categories developed through rigorous
processes, like a product catalog.

By this point you should have a good sense of the various conceptual
issues you need to consider when deciding how to describe a
resource in order to meet the goals of your organizing system.
Considering those issues will give you some sense of what the
content of your descriptions should be. In order to focus on the
conceptual issues, we have deferred discussion of specific
implementation issues. Implementation involves choosing the
specific form of your descriptions, and that is the topic of this
chapter.

We can approach the problem of how to form resource descriptions
from two perspectives: structuring and writing. From one

                                                                           Introduction (IX) | 817
perspective, resource descriptions are things that are used by both
people and computational agents. From this perspective, choosing
the form of resource descriptions is a kind of design. This is easy
to see for certain kinds of resource descriptions, notably signs and
maps found in physical environments like airport terminals, public
libraries, and malls. In these spaces, resource descriptions are quite
literally designed to help people orient themselves and find their
way. But any kind of resource description, not just those embedded
in the built environment, can be viewed as a designed object.
Designing an object involves making decisions about how it should
be structured so that it can best be used for its intended purpose.
From a design perspective, choosing the form of a resource
description means making decisions about its structure.

In "The Structural Perspective", we took a structural perspective
on resources and the relationships among them. In this chapter,
we will take a structural perspective on resource descriptions. The
difference is subtle but important. A structural perspective on
resource relationships focuses on how people or computational
processes associate, arrange, and connect those resources. A
structural perspective on resource descriptions focuses on how
those associations, arrangements, and connections are explicitly
represented or implemented in the descriptions we create.
Mismatches between the structure imposed on the resources being
organized and the structure of the descriptions used to implement
that organization could result in an organizing system that is
complex, inefficient, and difficult to maintain, as you will see in our
first example (Example: Description structured as a dictionary).

The structures of resource descriptions enable or inhibit particular
ways of interacting with those descriptions, just as the descriptions
themselves enable or inhibit particular ways of interacting with the
described resources. (See "Designing Resource-based Interactions",
and Interactions with Resources) Keep in mind that resource
descriptions are themselves information resources, so much of
what we will say in this chapter is applicable to the structures and

818 | Introduction (IX)
forms of information resources in general. Put another way, the
structure and form of information resources informs the design of
resource descriptions.
From another perspective, creating resource descriptions is a kind
of writing. I may describe something to you orally, but such a
description might not be very useful to an organizing system unless
it were transcribed. Organizing systems need persistent
descriptions, and that means they need to be written. In that sense,
choosing the form of a resource description means making
decisions about notation and syntax.
Modern Western culture tends to make a sharp distinction between
designing and writing, but there are areas where this distinction
breaks down, and the creation of resource descriptions in
organizing systems is one of them. In the following sections, we will
use designing and writing as two lenses for looking at the problem
of how to choose the form of resource descriptions. Specifically,
we will examine the spectrum of options we have for structuring
descriptions, and the kinds of syntaxes we have for writing those
descriptions.

                                                                           Introduction (IX) | 819
59. Structuring Descriptions

Choosing how to structure resource descriptions is a matter of
making principled and purposeful design decisions in order to solve
specific problems, serve specific purposes, or bring about some
desirable property in the descriptions. Most of these decisions are
specific to a domain: the particular context of application for the
organizing system being designed and the kinds of interactions
with resources it will enable. Making these kinds of context-specific
decisions results in a model of that domain. (See "Abstraction in
Resource Description".)

Over time, many people have built similar kinds of descriptions.
They have had similar purposes, desired similar properties, and
faced similar problems. Unsurprisingly, they have converged on
some of the same decisions. When common sets of design decisions
can be identified that are not specific to any one domain, they often
become systematized in textbooks and in design practices, and may
eventually be designed into standard formats and architectures for
creating organizing systems. These formally recognized sets of
design decisions are known as abstract models or metamodels.
Metamodels describe structures commonly found in resource
descriptions and other information resources, regardless of the
specific domain. While any designer of an organizing system will
usually create a model of her specific domain, she usually will not
create an entirely new metamodel but will instead make choices
from among the metamodels that have been formally recognized
and incorporated into existing standards. The resulting model is
sometimes called a "domain-specific language." Reusing standard
metamodels can bring great economical advantages, as developers
can reuse tools designed for and knowledge about these
metamodels, rather than having to start from scratch.

In the following sections, we examine some common kinds of

820 | Structuring Descriptions
structures used as the basis for metamodels. But first, we consider
a concrete example of how the structure of resource descriptions
supports or inhibits particular uses. As we explained in Foundations
for Organizing Systems, the concept of a resource de-emphasizes
the differences between physical and digital things in favor of
focusing on how things, in general, are used to support goal-
oriented activity. Different kinds of books can be treated as
information resources regardless of the particular mix of tangible
and intangible properties they may have. Since resource
descriptions are also information resources, we can similarly
consider how their structures support particular uses, independent
of whether they are physical, digital, or a mix of both.
A Batten Card

An example of a punch card used by Batten to describe a particular
patent in a patent collection. Each card represented an individual
description term, and each punch position on a card represented a
particular patent.

                                                               Structuring Descriptions | 821
   During World War II, a British chemist named W. E. Batten
   developed a system for organizing patents.1 The system consisted of
   a language for describing the product, process, use, and apparatus
   of a patent, and a way of using punched cards to record these
   descriptions. Batten used cards printed with matrices of 800
   positions (see Figure: A Batten Card.). Each card represented a
   specific value from the vocabulary of the description language, and
   each position corresponded to a particular patent. To describe
   patent #256 as covering extrusion of polythene to produce cable
   coverings, one would first select the cards for the values polythene,
   extrusion, and cable coverings, and then punch each card at the
   256th position. The description of patent #256 would thus extend
   over these three cards.
   The advantage of this structure is that to find patents covering
   extrusion of polythene (for any purpose), one needs only to select
   the two cards corresponding to those values, lay one on top of the
   other, and hold them up to a light. Light will shine through wherever
   there is a position corresponding to a patent described using those
   values. Patents meeting a certain description are easily found due to
   the structure of the cards designed to describe the patents.

             Punchcard Machine

1. This discussion of Batten's cards is based on (Lancaster
  1968, pages 28-32). Batten's own explanation is in (Batten
  1951).

   822 | Structuring Descriptions
          Punchcards were an important information input and
       storage medium for decades, even before the invention
       of computers. The Hollerith keyboard punch was used
       to transcribe the information collected in the 1890 US
       census. The template being used in this photo is for
       recording information about a farm. The punch cards
       were tabulated by electromechanical machines. A
       merger of four tabulating machine companies in 1911
       created a company whose current name is IBM.

          This keyboard punch machine is in the collection of
       the Computer History Museum in Mountain View,
       California.

          (Photo by R. Glushko.)

Of course, this system has clear disadvantages as well. Finding the
concepts associated with a particular patent is tedious, because
every card must be inspected. Adding a new patent is relatively
easy as long as there is an index that allows the cards for specific

                                                               Structuring Descriptions | 823
concepts to be located quickly. However, once the cards run out of
space for punching holes, the whole set of cards must be duplicated
to accommodate more patents: a very expensive operation. Adding
new concepts is potentially easy: simply add a new card. But if we
want to be able to find existing patents using the new concept, all
the existing patents would have to be re-examined to determine
whether their positions on the new card should be punched: also an
expensive operation.

The structure of Batten's cards supported rapid selection of
resources given a partial description. The kinds of structures we
will examine in the following sections are not quite so elaborate as
Batten's cards. But like the cards, each kind of structure supports
more efficient mechanical execution of certain operations, at the
cost of less efficient execution of others.

Kinds of Structures

Sets, lists, dictionaries, trees, and graphs are kinds of structures
that can be used to form resource descriptions. As we shall see,
each of these kinds is actually a family of related structures. These
structures are abstractions: they describe formal structural
properties in a general way, rather than specifying an exact physical
or textual form. Abstractions are useful because they help us to see
common properties shared by different specific ways of organizing
information. By focusing on these common properties, we can more
easily reason about the operations that different forms support and
the affordances that they provide, without being distracted by less
relevant details.

824 | Structuring Descriptions
  Blobs

   The simplest kind of structure is no structure at all. Consider the
   following description of a book: Sebald's novel uses a walking tour
   in East Anglia to meditate on links between past and present, East
   and West.2 This description is an unstructured text expression with
   no clearly defined internal parts, and we can consider it to be a
   blob. Or, more precisely, it has structure, but that structure is the
   underlying grammatical structure of the English language, and none
   of that grammatical structure is explicitly represented in a surface
   structure when the sentence is expressed. As readers of English
   we can interpret the sentence as a description of the subject of
   the book, but to do this mechanically is difficult.3 On the other
   hand, such a written description is relatively easy to create, as the
   describer can simply use natural language.

   A blob need not be a blob of text. It could be a photograph of a
   resource, or a recording of a spoken description of a resource. Like
   blobs of text, blobs of pixels or sound have underlying structure that
   any person with normal vision or hearing can understand easily.4

2. (Silman 1998). (Sebald 1995).

3. The technique of diagramming sentences was invented in
   the mid-19th century by Stephen W. Clark, a New York
   schoolmaster; (Clark2010) is an exact reprinting of a
   nearly 100 year old edition of his book A Practical
   Grammar. A recent tribute to Clark is (Florey 2012).

4. It is easy to underestimate the incredible power of the
   human perceptual and cognitive systems to apply neural
   computation and knowledge to enable vision and hearing

                                                                   Structuring Descriptions | 825
   But we can treat these blobs as unstructured, because none of the
   underlying structure in the visual or auditory input is explicit, and
   we are concerned with the ways that the structures of resource
   descriptions support or inhibit mechanical or computational
   operations.5

  Sets

   The simplest way to structure a description is to give it parts and
   treat them as a set. For example, the description of Sebald's novel
   might be reformulated as a set of terms: Sebald, novel, East Anglia,
   walking, history. Doing this has lost much of the meaning, but
   something has been gained: we now can easily distinguish Sebald
   and walking as separate items in the description.6 This makes it

   to seem automatic. Computers are getting better at
   extracting features from visual and auditory signals to
   identify and classify inputs, but our point here is that
   none of these features are explicitly represented in the
   input "blob" or "stream."

5. As we commented earlier, an oral description of a
   resource may not be especially useful in an organizing
   system because computers cannot easily understand it.
   On the other hand, there are many contexts in which an
   oral description would be especially useful, such as in a
   guided tour of a museum where visitors can use audio
   headsets.

6. What was lost was the previously invisible structure

    826 | Structuring Descriptions
   easier to find, for example, all the descriptions that include the term
   walking. (Note that this is different from simply searching through
   blob-of-text descriptions for the word walking. When treated as a
   set, the description Fiji, fire walking, memoir does not include the
   term walking, though it does include the term fire walking.)

   Sets make it easy to find intersections among descriptions. Sets
   are also easy to create. In "Classification vs. Tagging" we looked at
   "folksonomies," organizing systems in which non-professional users
   create resource descriptions. In these systems, descriptions are
   structured as sets of "tags." To find resources, users can specify a
   set of tags to obtain resources having descriptions that intersect at
   those tags. This is more valuable if the tags come from a controlled
   vocabulary, making intersections more likely. But enforcing
   vocabulary control adds complexity to the description process, so a
   balance must be struck between maximizing potential intersections
   and making description as simple as practical.7

   A set is a type or class of structure. We can refine the definition
   of different kinds of sets by introducing constraints. For example,
   we might introduce the constraint that a given set has a maximum
   number of items. Or we might constrain a set to always have the
   same number of items, giving us a fixed-size set. We can also
   remove constraints. Sets do not contain duplicate items (think of
   a tagging system in which it does not make sense to assign the
   same tag more than once to the same resource). If we remove this

  provided by the grammar, which made us assign roles to
  each of these terms to create a semantic interpretation.

7. It is rarely practical to make things as simple as possible.
  According to Einstein, we should endeavor to "Make
  everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."

                                                                   Structuring Descriptions | 827
uniqueness constraint, we have a different structure known as a
"bag" or "multiset."

Lists

Constraints are what distinguish lists from sets. A list, like a set,
is a collection of items with an additional constraint: their items
are ordered. If we were designing a tagging system in which it was
important that the order of the tags be maintained, we would want
to use lists, not sets. Unlike sets, lists may contain duplicate items.
In a list, two items that are otherwise the same can be distinguished
by their position in the ordering, but in a set this is not possible. For
example, we might want to organize the tags assigned to a resource,
listing the most used tag first, the least frequently used last, and the
rest according to their frequency of use.

Again, we can introduce constraints to refine the definition of
different kinds of lists, such as fixed-length lists. If we constrain
a list to contain only items that are themselves lists, and further
specify that these contained lists do not themselves contains lists,
then we have a table (a list of lists of items). A spreadsheet is a list of
lists.

Dictionaries

One major limitation of lists and sets is that, although items can
be individually addressed, there is no way to distinguish the items
except by comparing their values (or, in a list, their positions in the
ordering). In a set of terms like Sebald, novel, East Anglia, walking,
history, for example, one cannot easily tell that Sebald refers to the
author of the book while East Anglia and walking refer to what it
is about. One way of addressing this problem is to break each item
in a set into two parts: a property and a value. So, for example, our

828 | Structuring Descriptions
   simple set of tags might become author: Sebald, type: novel, subject:
   East Anglia, subject: walking, subject: history. Now we can say that
   author, type, and subject are the properties, and the original items in
   the set are the values.

   author

         Sebald
   type

         novel
   subject1

         East Anglia
   subject2

         walking
   subject3

         history
   This kind of structure is called a dictionary, a map or an associative
   array. A dictionary is a set of property-value pairs or entries. It
   is a set of entries, not a list of entries, because the pairs are not
   ordered and because each entry must have a unique key.8 Note that
   this specialized meaning of dictionary is different from the more
   common meaning of "dictionary" as an alphabetized list of terms
   accompanied by sentences that define them. The two meanings

8. This structural metamodel only allows one value for each
   property, which means it would not work for books with
   multiple authors or that discuss multiple subjects.

                                                                   Structuring Descriptions | 829
   are related, however. Like a "real" dictionary, a dictionary structure
   allows us to easily find the value (such as a definition) associated
   with a particular property or key (such as a word). But unlike a
   real dictionary, which orders its keys alphabetically, a dictionary
   structure does not specify an order for its keys.9

   Dictionaries are ubiquitous in resource descriptions. Structured
   descriptions entered using a form are easily represented as
   dictionaries, where the form items' labels are the properties and
   the data entered are the values. Tabular data with a "header row"
   can be thought of as a set of dictionaries, where column headers
   are the properties for each dictionary, and each row is a set of
   corresponding values. Dictionaries are also a basic type of data
   structure found in nearly all programming languages (referred to as
   associative arrays).

   Again, we can introduce or remove constraints to define specialized
   types of dictionaries. A sorted dictionary adds an ordering over
   entries; in other words, it is a list of entries rather than a set. A
   multimap is a dictionary in which multiple entries may have the
   same key.

  Trees

   In dictionaries as they are commonly understood, properties are
   terms and values are their corresponding definitions. The terms and
   values are usually words, phrases, or other expressions that can be

9. Going the other direction is not so easy, however: just
   as real dictionaries do not support finding a word given
   a definition, neither do dictionary structures support
   finding a key given a value.

    830 | Structuring Descriptions
ordered alphabetically. But if generalize the notion of a dictionary
as abstract sets of property-value pairs, the values can be anything
at all. In particular, the values can themselves be dictionaries. When
a dictionary structure has values that are themselves dictionaries,
we say that the dictionaries are nested. Nesting is very useful for
resource descriptions that need more structure than what a (non-
nested) dictionary can provide.
Figure: Four Nested Dictionaries. presents an example of nested
dictionaries. At the top level there is one dictionary with a single
entry having the property a. The value associated with a is a
dictionary consisting of two entries, the first having property b and
the second having property c. The values associated with b and with
c are also dictionaries.
Four Nested Dictionaries

If we nest dictionaries like this, and our "top" dictionary (the one
that contains all the others) has only one entry, then we have a kind
of tree structure. Figure: A Tree of Properties and Values. shows the
same properties and values as Figure: Four Nested Dictionaries., this

                                                               Structuring Descriptions | 831
time arranged to make the tree structure more visible. Trees consist
of nodes (the letters and numbers in Figure: A Tree of Properties
and Values.) joined by edges (the arrows). Each node in the tree
with a circle around it is a property, and the value of each property
consists of the nodes below (to the right of) it in the tree. A node
is referred to as the parent of the nodes below it, which in turn
are referred to as the children of that node. The edges show these
"parent of" relationships between the nodes. The node with no
parent is called the root of the tree. Nodes with no children are
called leaf nodes.
A Tree of Properties and Values

An alternative representation of nested dictionaries is as a tree. The
lowest level or leaf nodes of the tree contain property values.
As with the other types of structures we have considered, we can
832 | Structuring Descriptions
     define different kinds of trees by introducing different types of
     constraints. For example, the predominant metamodel for XML is
     documents is a kind of tree called the XML Information Set or
     Infoset. 10

     The XML Information Set defines a specific kind of tree structure by
     adding very specific constraints, including ordering of child nodes,
     to the basic definition of a tree. The addition of an ordering
     constraint distinguishes XML trees from nested dictionaries, in
     which child nodes do not have any order (because dictionary entries
     do not have an ordering). Ordering is an important constraint for
     resource descriptions, since without ordering it is impossible to, for
     example, list multiple authors while guaranteeing that the order of

10. The XML Information Set (Cowan2004)

    RDF/XML is one example where meta models meet. In
    Document Design Matters, (Wilde and Glushko 2008b)
    point out that "If the designer of an exchange format uses
    a non-XML conceptual metamodel because it seems to
    be a better fit for the data model, XML is only used as the
    physical layer for the exchange model. The logical layer
    in this case defines the mapping between the non-XML
    conceptual model, and any reconstruction of the
    exchange model data requires the consumer to be fully
    aware of this mapping. In such a case, it is good practice
    to make users of the API aware of the fact that it is
    using a non-XML metamodel. Otherwise they might be
    tempted to base their implementation on a too small set
    of examples, creating implementations which are brittle
    and will fail at some point in time."

                                                                     Structuring Descriptions | 833
authors will be maintained. Figure: A Tree of Properties and Values.
depicts a kind of tree with a different set of constraints: all non-leaf
nodes are properties, and all leafs are values. We could also define a
tree in which every node has both a property and a value. Trees exist
in a large variety of flavors, but they all share a common topology:
the edges between nodes are directed (one node is the parent and
the other is the child), and every node except the root has exactly
one parent.

Trees provide a way to group statements describing different but
related resources. For example, consider the description structured
as a dictionary here:

Description Structured as a Dictionary

author given names  Winfried Georg
author surname  Sebald
title  Die Ringe des Saturn
pages  371

The dictionary groups together four property-value pairs
describing a particular book. (The arrows are simply a schematic
way to indicate property-value relations. Later in the chapter we
look at ways to "write" these relations using some specific syntax.)

But really the first two entries are not describing the book; they are
describing the book's author. So, it would be better to group those
two statements somehow. We can do this by nesting the entries
describing the author within the book description, creating a tree
structure:

Nesting an Author Description Within a Book Description

834 | Structuring Descriptions
author 
given names  Winfried Georg
surname  Sebald
title  Die Ringe des Saturn
pages  371

Using a tree works well in this case because we can treat the book
as the primary resource being described, making it the root of our
tree, and adding on the author description as a "branch."

We also could have chosen to make the author the primary
resource, giving us a tree like the one in Example: Nesting book
descriptions within an author description.

Nesting Book Descriptions Within an Author Description

given names  Winfried Georg
surname  Sebald
books authored 
1. title  Die Ringe des Saturn
pages  371
2. title  Austerlitz
pages  416

Note that in this dictionary, the value of the books authored property
is a list of dictionaries. Making the author the primary or root
resource allows us to include multiple book descriptions in the
tree (but makes it more difficult to describe books having multiple
authors). A tree is a good choice for structuring descriptions as
long as we can clearly identify a primary resource. In some cases,
however, we want to connect descriptions of related resources
without having to designate one as primary. In these cases, we need
a more flexible data structure.

                                                               Structuring Descriptions | 835
Graphs

Suppose we were describing two books, where the author of one
book is the subject of the other, as in Example: Two related
descriptions:

Two Related Descriptions

1. author  Mark Richard McCulloch
title  Understanding W. G. Sebald
subject  Winfried Georg Sebald
2. author  Winfried Georg Sebald
title  Die Ringe des Saturn

By looking at these descriptions, we can guess the relationship
between the two books, but that relationship is not explicitly
represented in the structure: we just have two separate dictionaries
and have inferred the relationship by matching property values. It
is possible that this inference could be wrong: there might be two
people named Winfried Georg Sebald. How can we structure these
descriptions to explicitly represent the fact that the Winfried Georg
Sebald that is the subject of the first book is the same Winfried Georg
Sebald who authored the second?

One possibility would be to make Winfried Georg Sebald the root
of a tree, similar to the approach taken in Example: Nesting book
descriptions within an author description, adding a book about
property alongside the books authored one. This solution would
work fine if people were our primary resources, and it thus made
sense to structure our descriptions around them. But suppose that
we had decided that our descriptions should be structured around
books, and that we were using a vocabulary that took this
perspective (with properties such as author and subject rather than
books authored and books about). We should not let a particular

836 | Structuring Descriptions
    structure limit the organizational perspective we can take, as
    Batten's cards did. Instead, we should consciously choose structures
    to suit our organizational perspective. How can we do this?

    If we treat our two book descriptions as trees, we can join the two
    branches (subject and author) that share a value. When we do this,
    we no longer have a tree, because we now have a node with more
    than one parent (Figure: Descriptions Linked into a Graph.). The
    structure in Figure: Descriptions Linked into a Graph. is a graph.
    Like a tree, a graph consists of a set of nodes connected by edges.
    These edges may or may not have a direction ("Directionality"). If
    they do, the graph is referred to as a "directed graph." If a graph is
    directed, it may be possible to start at a node and follow edges in
    a path that leads back to the starting node. Such a path is called
    a "cycle." If a directed graph has no cycles, it is referred to as an
    "acyclic graph."

    A tree is just a more constrained kind of graph. Trees are directed
    graphs because the "parent of" relationship between nodes is
    asymmetric: the edges are arrows that point in a certain direction.
    (See "Symmetry".) Furthermore, trees are acyclic graphs, because
    if you follow the directed edges from one node to another, you
    can never encounter the same node twice. Finally, trees have the
    constraint that every node (except the root) must have exactly one
    parent.11

    In Figure: Descriptions Linked into a Graph. we have violated this
    constraint by joining our two book trees. The graph that results is

11. Technically, what is described here is referred to as
   "rooted tree" by mathematicians, who define trees more
   generally. Since trees used as data structures are always
   rooted trees, we do not make the distinction here.

                                                                    Structuring Descriptions | 837
still directed and acyclic, but because the Winfried George Sebald
node now has two parents, it is no longer a tree.

          Stop and Think: Social Network Properties
          Compare the concept of "friend" in Facebook with
       that of "follower" in Twitter, in terms of the semantic
       properties discussed in "Properties of Semantic
       Relationships" and the graph properties discussed in
       this section.

Graphs are very general and flexible structures. Many kinds of
systems can be conceived of as nodes connected by edges: stations
connected by subway lines, people connected by friendships,
decisions connected by dependencies, and so on. Relationships can
be modeled in different ways using different kinds of graphs. For
example, if we assume that friendship is symmetric (see
"Symmetry"), we would use an undirected graph to model the
relationship. However, in web-based social networks friendship is
often asymmetric (you might "friend" someone who does not
reciprocate), so a directed graph is more appropriate.
Descriptions Linked into a Graph

838 | Structuring Descriptions
Descriptions can be linked to form a graph when the value assigned
to two different properties is the same.
Often it is useful to treat a graph as a set of pairs of nodes, where
each pair may or may not be directly connected by an edge. Many
approaches to characterizing structural relationships among
resources (see "Structural Relationships between Resources") are
based on modeling the related resources as a set of pairs of nodes,
and then analyzing patterns of connectedness among them. As we
will see, being able to break down a graph into pairs is also useful
when we structure resource descriptions as graphs.
In "The Document Processing World" we will use XML to model the
graph shown in Figure: Descriptions Linked into a Graph. by using
"references" to connect a book to its title, authors and subject. This
will allow us to develop sophisticated graphs of knowledge within a

                                                               Structuring Descriptions | 839
     single XML document instance. (See also the sidebar, Inclusions and
     References)12

   Comparing Metamodels: JSON, XML and RDF

     Now that we are familiar with the various kinds of metamodels
     used to structure resource descriptions, we can take a closer look
     at some specific metamodels. A detailed comparison of the
     affordances of different metamodels is beyond the scope of this
     chapter. Here we will simply take a brief look at three popular
     metamodels--JSON, XML, and RDF--in order to see how they
     further specify and constrain the more general kinds of metamodels
     introduced above.

   JSON

     JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
           JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) is a textual format for
           exchanging data that borrows its metamodel from the
           JavaScript programming language. Specifically, the JSON
           metamodel consists of two kinds of structures found in
           JavaScript: lists (called "arrays" in JavaScript) and dictionaries

12. This feature relies upon the existence of an XML schema.
    An XML schema can declare that certain attributes are of
    type ID, IDREF or IDREFS. Whether an XML DTD or one
    of the many schema languages that have been developed
    under the auspices of the W3C or ISO.

     840 | Structuring Descriptions
           (called "objects" in JavaScript). Lists and dictionaries contain
           values, which may be strings of text, numbers, Booleans (true
           or false), or the null (empty) value. Again, these types of values
           are taken directly from JavaScript. Lists and dictionaries can be
           values too, meaning lists and dictionaries can be nested within
           one another to produce more complex structures such as tables
           and trees.

     Lists, dictionaries, and a basic set of value types constitute the
     JSON metamodel. Because this metamodel is a subset of JavaScript,
     the JSON metamodel is very easy to work with in JavaScript. Since
     JavaScript is the only programming language that is available in all
     web browsers, JSON has become a popular choice for developers
     who need to work with data and resource descriptions on the web.
     (See "Writing Systems" later in this chapter.) Furthermore, many
     modern programming languages provide data structures and value
     types equivalent to those provided by JavaScript. So, data
     represented as JSON is easy to work with in many programming
     languages, not just JavaScript.

   XML Information Set

     The XML Information Set metamodel is derived from data structures
     used for document markup. (See "Metadata".) These markup
     structures--elements and attributes--are well suited for
     programmatically manipulating the structure of documents and
     data together.13
     XML Infoset

           The XML Infoset is a tree structure, where each node of the

13. http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/.

                                                                     Structuring Descriptions | 841
           tree is defined to be an "information item" of a particular type.
           Each information item has a set of type-specific properties
           associated with it. At the root of the tree is a "document item,"
           which has exactly one "element item" as its child. An element
           item has a set of attribute items, and a list of child nodes. These
           child nodes may include other element items, or they may be
           character items. (See "Kinds of Structures" below for more on
           characters.) Attribute items may contain character items, or
           they may contain typed data, such as name tokens, identifiers
           and references. Element identifiers and references (ID/IDREF)
           may be used to connect nodes, transforming a tree into a graph.
           (See the sidebar, Inclusions and References.)14

     Figure: A Description Structure. is a graphical representation of how
     an XML document might be used to structure part of a description
     of an author and his works. This example demonstrates how we
     might use element items to model the domain of the description,
     by giving them names such as author and title. The character items

14. The XML Infoset is one of many metamodels for XML,
    including the DOM and XPath. Typically, an XML Infoset
    is created as a by-product of parsing a well-formed XML
    document instance. An XML document may also be
    informed by its DTD or schema with information about
    the types of attribute values, and their default values.
    Attributes of type ID, IDREF and IDREFs provide a
    mechanism for intra-document hypertext linking and
    transclusion. An XML document instance may contain
    entity definitions and references that get expanded when
    the document is parsed, thereby offering another form of
    transclusion.

     842 | Structuring Descriptions
that are the children of these elements hold the content of the
description: author names, book titles, and so on. Attribute items
are used to hold auxiliary information about this content, such as its
language.
A Description Structure

An XML document can be described as a tree in which elements are
nodes that can contain character content directly or attributes that
contain character content.
This example also demonstrates how the XML Infoset supports
mixed content by allowing element items and character items to
be "siblings" of the same parent element. In this case, the Infoset
structure allows us to specify that the book description can be
displayed as a line of text consisting of the original title and the
translated title in parentheses. The elements and attributes are used

                                                               Structuring Descriptions | 843
     to indicate that this line of text consists of two titles written in
     different languages, not a single title containing parentheses.

     If not for mixed content, we could not write narrative text with
     hypertext links embedded in the middle of a sentence. It gives us
     the ability to identify the subcomponents of a sentence, so that we
     could distinguish the terms "Sebald," "walking" and "East Anglia" as
     an author and two subjects.

               Inclusions and References
               An XML Infoset is typically the result of processing a
            well-formed XML document instance.15 Schemas
            associated with XML document instances "inform" the
            corresponding XML Infoset. Thus, the "truth value" of
            any XML Infoset is dependent upon its related
            schemas.16 Traditionally, any documentation that is

15. A well-formed XML document instance, when
    processed, will yield an XML Information Set, as
    described here. Information sets may also be
    constructed by other means, such as transforming from
    another information set. See the section on Synthetic
    Infosets at http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-
    infoset/#intro.synthetic for details.

    types, comments, processing instructions, unparsed
    entities and notations, and more.

       A well-formed XML document instance for which
    there are associated schemas, such as a DTD, may
    contribute information to the Infoset. Notably, schemas
    may associate data types with element and attribute
    information items, and it may also specify default or
    fixed values for attributes. A DTD may define entities
    that are referenced in the document instance and are
    expanded in-place when processed. These contributions
    can affect the truth value of the document.
17. The SGML standard explicitly stated that
    documentation describing or explaining a DTD is part of
    the document type definition. The implication being that
    a schema is not just about defining syntax, but also
    semantics. Moreover, since DTDs do not make possible
    to describe all possible constraints, such as co-
    occurrence constraints, the documentation could serve
    as human-consumable guidance for implementers as
    well as content creators and consumers.

                                                                    Structuring Descriptions | 845
               The XML family offers several mechanisms to create
            inclusion relationships: by employing element
            references; by way of entity definition and reference; by
            using XML Inclusions(XInclude) or XLink. These
            inclusions and references can also inform the XML
            Infoset, if they are processed.

               Any XML node may refer to another node simply by
            referencing it by its assigned ID. Assuming attributes
            are declared, the Infoset exposes this information as a
            references property as an ordered list of element
            information items. That is to say that an element may
            contain other element nodes by subordination, or by
            reference.18

               XInclude "specifies a processing model and syntax for
            general purpose inclusion. Inclusion is accomplished by

    schema. Attributes whose type is ID must have a valid
    XML name value that is unique within that XML
    document; an attribute of type IDREF whose value
    corresponds to a unique ID has a "references" property
    whose value is the element node that corresponds to the
    element with that ID. An attribute of type IDREFS whose
    value corresponds to a list of unique ID has a
    "references" property whose value is a list of element
    node(s) that corresponds to the element(s) with
    matching IDs.

             mechanism for addressing whole documents, specific
             information items, ranges of information items, and
             even parts of information items, which has led to its
             widespread adoption in document processing.19

                XLink "allows elements to be inserted into XML
             documents in order to create and describe links
             between resources. It uses XML syntax to create
             structures that can describe links similar to the simple
             unidirectional hyperlinks of today's HTML, as well as
             more sophisticated links."20

                Entities are similar to macros found in many
             programming languages; a value is assigned to a token,
             the token is referenced wherever the value is needed,
             and macro expansion happens when the XML document
             instance is read into the Infoset.21 Entities are a handy

     Orchard, and Walsh 2010).

21. Within the document's DTD, one simply declares the
     entity and its corresponding value, which could be
     anything from an entire document to a phrase and then
     it may be referenced in place within the XML document
     instance. The entity reference is replaced by the entity

                                                                      Structuring Descriptions | 847
       feature, but since they are expanded on their way in,
       entities do not survive as information items in the XML
       Infoset. The ID/IDREF feature is more popular than the
       use of entities because it carries more information into
       the XML Infoset.

Using schemas to define data representation formats is a good
practice that facilitates shared understanding and contributes to
long-term maintainability in institutional or business contexts. An
XML schema represents a contract among the parties subscribing
to its definitions, whereas JSON depends on out-of-band
communication among programmers. The notion that "the code is
the documentation" may be fashionable among programmers, but
modelers prefer to design at a higher level of abstraction and then
implement.

The XML Infoset presents a strong contrast to JSON and does not
always map in a straightforward way to the data structures used in
popular web scripting languages. Whereas JSON's structures make
it easier for object-oriented programmers to readily exchange data,
they lack any formal schema language and cannot easily handle
mixed content.

In Figure: Descriptions Linked into a Graph., we structured our

value in the XML Infoset. Entities, as nameable wrappers,
effectively disappear on their way into the XML Infoset.

848 | Structuring Descriptions
resource description as a graph by treating resources, properties,
and values as nodes, with edges reflecting their combination into
descriptive statements. However, a more common approach is to
treat resources and values as nodes, and properties as the edges
that connect them. Figure: Treating Properties as Edges Rather
Than Nodes. shows the same description as Figure: Descriptions
Linked into a Graph., this time with properties treated as edges.
This roughly corresponds to the particular kind of graph metamodel
defined by RDF. ("Resource Description Framework (RDF)")
Treating Properties as Edges Rather Than Nodes

We can treat each component of a description as a pair of nodes
(a resource and a value) with an edge (the property) linking them.

                                                               Structuring Descriptions | 849
Here, we have two book resources that are related to four values
through five properties. The single value node, "Winfried George
Sebald" is the subject of one book while being the author of the
second book. The books are depicted as boxes, the edges as labeled
arrows and the values as text strings.
We have noted that we can treat a graph as a set of pairs of nodes,
where each pair may be connected by an edge. Similarly, we can
treat each component of the description in Figure: Treating
Properties as Edges Rather Than Nodes. as a pair of nodes (a
resource and a value) with an edge (the property) linking them. In
the RDF metamodel, a pair of nodes and its edge is called a triple,
because it consists of three parts (two nodes and one edge). The
RDF metamodel is a directed graph, so it identifies one node (the
one from which the edge is pointing) as the subject of the triple, and
the other node (the one to which the edge is pointing) as its object.
The edge is referred to as the predicate or (as we have been saying)
property of the triple.
Listing Triples Individually

850 | Structuring Descriptions
Lists each of the triples individually. Here, each statement relates
one resource to one value through an edge. Thus, we have two
distinct "Winfried George Sebald" value nodes. The books are
depicted as boxes, the edges as labeled arrows and the values as text
strings.

Figure: Listing Triples Individually. lists separately all the triples in
Figure: Treating Properties as Edges Rather Than Nodes. However,
there is something missing in Figure: Listing Triples Individually..
Figure: Treating Properties as Edges Rather Than Nodes. clearly
indicates that the Winfried George Sebald who is the subject of book
1 is the same Winfried George Sebald who is the author of book 2. In
Figure: Listing Triples Individually. this relationship is not clear. How
can we tell if the Winfried George Sebald of the third triple is the
same as the Winfried George Sebald of the triple statement? For that
matter, how can we tell if the first three triples all involve the same

                                                               Structuring Descriptions | 851
book 1? This is easy to show in a diagram of the entire description
graph, where we can have multiple edges attached to a node. But
when we disaggregate that graph into triples, we need some way of
uniquely referring to nodes. We need identifiers ("Choosing Good
Names and Identifiers"). When two triples have nodes with the same
identifier, we can know that it is the same node. RDF achieves this by
associating URIs with nodes. (See "Resource Description Framework
(RDF)")

The need to identify nodes when we break down an RDF graph
into triples becomes important when we want to "write" RDF
graphs--create textual representations of them instead of depicting
them--so that they can be exchanged as data. Tree structures do
not necessarily have this problem, because it is possible to textually
represent a tree structure without having to mention any node
more than once. Thus, one price paid for the generality and
flexibility of graph structures is the added complexity of recording,
representing or writing those structures.

Choosing Your Constraints

This tradeoff between flexibility and complexity illustrates a more
general point about constraints. In the context of managing and
interacting with resource descriptions, constraints are a good thing.
As discussed above, a tree is a graph with very specific constraints.
These constraints allow you to do things with trees that are not
possible with graphs in general, such as representing them textually
without repeating yourself, or uniquely identifying nodes by the
path from the root of the tree to that node. This can make managing
descriptions and the resources they describe easier and more
efficient--if a tree structure is a good fit to the requirements of
the organizing system. For example, an ordered tree structure is a
good fit for the hierarchical structure of the content of a book or
book-like document, such as an aircraft service manual or an SEC

852 | Structuring Descriptions
     filing. On the other hand, the network of relationships among the
     people and organizations that collaborated to produce a book might
     be better represented using a graph structure. XML is most often
     used to represent hierarchies, but is also capable of representing
     network structures.

   Modeling within Constraints

     A metamodel imposes certain constraints on the structure of our
     resource descriptions. But in organizing systems, we usually need
     to further specify the content and composition of descriptions of
     the specific types of resources being organized. For example, when
     designing a system for organizing books, it is not sufficient to say
     that a book's description is structured using XML, because the XML
     metamodel constrains structure and not the content of
     descriptions. We need also to specify that a book description
     includes a list of contributors, each entry of which provides a name
     and indicates the role of that contributor. This kind of specification
     is a model to which our descriptions of books are expected to
     conform. (See "Abstraction in Resource Description".)

     When designing an organizing system we may choose to reuse a
     standard model. For example, ONIX for Books is a standard model
     (conforming to the XML metamodel) developed by the publishing
     industry for describing books.22

22. Online Information Exchange(ONIX) is the international
    standard for representing and communicating book
    industry product information in electronic form:
    http://www.editeur.org/11/Books/.

                                                                     Structuring Descriptions | 853
     If no such standard exists, or existing standards do not suit our
     needs, we may create a new model for our specific domain. But
     we will not usually create a new metamodel: instead we will make
     choices from among the metamodels, such as JSON, XML, or RDF,
     that have been formally recognized and incorporated into existing
     standards. Once we have selected a metamodel, we know the
     constraints we have to work with when modeling the resources and
     collections in our specific domain.23

    Specifying Vocabularies and Schemas

     Creating a model for descriptions of resources in a particular
     domain involves specifying the common elements of those
     descriptions, and giving those elements standard names. (See "The
     Process of Describing Resources") The model may also specify how
     these elements are arranged into larger structures, for example,
     how they are ordered into lists nested into trees. Metamodels vary
     in the tools they provide for specifying the structure and
     composition of domain-specific models, and in the maturity and
     robustness of the methods for designing them.24 RDF and XML each

23. Do not take on the task of creating a new XML model
    lightly. Literally thousands of XML vocabularies have
    been created, and some represent hundreds or
    thousands of hours of effort. See (Bray 2005) for advice
    on how to reduce the risk of vocabulary design if you
    cannot find an existing one that satisfies your
    requirements.

24. See (Glushko and McGrath 2005) for a synthesis of best

      854 | Structuring Descriptions
     provide different, metamodel-specific tools to define a model for a
     specific domain. But not every metamodel provides such tools.

     In XML, models are defined in separate documents known as
     schemas. An XML schema defining a domain model provides a
     vocabulary of terms that can be used as element and attribute
     names in XML documents that adhere to that model. For example,
     Onix for Books schema specifies that an author of a book should be
     called a Contributor, and that the page count should be called an
     Extent. An XML schema also defines rules for how those elements,
     attributes, and their content can be arranged into higher-level
     structures. For example, the Onix for Books specifies that the
     description of a book must include a list of Contributor elements,
     that this list must have at least one element in it, and that each
     Contributor element must have a ContributorRole child
     element.

     If an XML schema is given an identifier, XML documents can use
     that identifier to indicate that they use terms and rules from that
     schema. An XML document may use vocabularies from more than
     one XML schema.25 Associating a schema with an XML instance

    practices for creating domain-specific languages in
    technical publishing and business-to-business document
    exchange contexts. You need best practices for big
    problems, while small ones can be attacked with ad hoc
    methods.

25. Unless an XML instance is associated with a schema,
    it is fair to say that it does not have any model at all
    because there is no way to understand the content and
    structure of the information it contains. The assignment

                                                                     Structuring Descriptions | 855
enables validation: automatically checking that vocabulary terms
are being used correctly.26

of a schema to an XML instance requires a "Document

Type Declaration." If some of the same vocabulary terms

occur in more than one XML schema, with different

meanings in each, using elements from more than one

schema in the same instance requires that they be

distinguished using namespaces. For example, if an

element named "title" means the "title of the book" in one

schema and "the honorific associated with a person" in

another, instances might have elements with namespace

prefixes like <book:title>The Discipline of

Organizing</book:title>                            and

<hon:title>Professor</hon:title>. Namespaces are a

common source of frustration in XML, because they seem

like an overly complicated solution to a simple problem.

But in addition to avoiding naming collisions, they are

important in schema composition and organization.

26. What "correctly" means depends on the schema language
    used to encode the conceptual model of the document
    type. The XML family of standards includes several
    schema languages that differ in how completely they can
    encode a document type's conceptual model. The
    Document Type Definition(DTD) has its origins in
    publishing and enforces structural constraints well; it
    expresses strong data typing through associated
    documentation resources. XML Schema Definition

      856 | Structuring Descriptions
If two descriptions share the same XML schema and use only that
schema, then combining them is straightforward. If not, it can be
problematic, unless someone has figured out exactly how the two
schemas should "map" to one another. Finding such a mapping
is not a trivial problem, as XML schemas may differ semantically,
lexically, structurally, or architecturally despite sharing a common
implementation form. (See Describing Relationships and Structures.)

Tree structures can vary considerably while still conforming to the
XML Infoset metamodel. Users of XML often specify rules for
checking whether certain patterns appear in an XML document
(document-level validation). This is less often done with RDF,
because graphs that conform to the RDF metamodel all have the
same structure: they are all sets of triples. This shared structure
makes it simple to combine different RDF descriptions without
worrying about checking structure at the document level. However,
sometimes it is desirable to check descriptions at the document
level, as when part of a description is required. As with XML, if
consumers of those descriptions want to assert that they expect
those descriptions to have a certain structure (such as a required
property), they must check them at the document level.

Because the RDF metamodel already defines structure, defining a
domain-specific model in RDF mainly involves specifying URIs and
names for predicates. A set of RDF predicate names and URIs is
known as an RDF vocabulary. Publication of vocabularies on the web
and the use of URIs to identify and refer to predicate definitions are

Language(XSD) is better for representing transactional
document types but its added expressive power tends to
make it more complex.

     key principles of Linked Data and the Semantic Web. (Also see "The
     Semantic Web and Linked Data", as well as later in this chapter.)27

     For example, the Resource Description and Access(RDA) standard
     for cataloging library resources includes a set of RDF vocabularies
     defining predicates usable in cataloging descriptions. One such
     predicate is:

                   <http://rdvocab.info/Elements/extentOfText>

     which is defined as "the number and type of units and/or subunits
     making up a resource consisting of text, with or without
     accompanying illustrations." The vocabulary further specifies that
     this predicate is a refinement of a more general predicate:

                   <http://rdvocab.info/Elements/extent>

     which can be used to indicate, "the number and type of units and/
     or subunits making up a resource" regardless of whether it is textual
     or not.

     JSON lacks any standardized way to define which terms can be used.
     That does not mean one cannot use a standard vocabulary when
     creating descriptions using JSON, only that there is no agreed-upon
     way to use JSON to communicate which vocabulary is being used,
     and no way to automatically check that it is being used correctly.

   Controlling Values

     So far, we have focused on how models specify vocabularies of
     terms and how those terms can be used in descriptions. But models

27. For example, see Linked Open Vocabularies at
    http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/index.html.

      858 | Structuring Descriptions
     may also constrain the values or content of descriptions.
     Sometimes, a single model will define both the terms that can be
     used for property names and the terms that can be used for
     property values. For example, an XML schema may enumerate a list
     of valid terms for an attribute value.28

     Often, however, there are separate, specialized vocabularies of
     terms intended for use as property values in resource descriptions.
     Typically these vocabularies provide values for use within
     statements that describe what a resource is about. Examples of

28. Attribute values can be constrained in a schema by
    specifying a data type, a default value, and a list of
    potential values. Data types allow us to specify whether
    a value is supposed to be a name, a number, a date, a
    token or a string of text. Having established the data
    type, we can further constrain the value of an attribute
    by specifying a range of values, for a number or a date,
    for example. We can also use regular expression patterns
    to describe a data type such as a postal code, telephone
    number or ISBN number. Specifying default values and
    lists of legal values for attributes simplifies content
    creation and quality assurance processes. In Schematron,
    a rule-based XML schema language for making test
    assertions about XML documents, we can express
    constraints between elements and attributes in ways that
    other XML schema languages cannot. For example, we
    can express the constraint that if two <title> elements
    are provided, then each must contain a unique string
    value and different language attribute values.

                                                                     Structuring Descriptions | 859
     such subject vocabularies include the Library of Congress Subject
     Headings(LOC-SH) and the Medical Subject Headings(MeSH).29
     Other vocabularies may provide authoritative names for people,
     corporations, or places. Classification schemes are yet another kind
     of vocabulary, providing the category names for use as the values in
     descriptive statements that classify resources.

     Because different metamodels take different approaches to
     specifying vocabularies, there will usually be different versions of
     these vocabularies for use with different metamodels. For example
     the LCSH are available both as XML conforming to the Metadata
     Authority Description Standard(MADS) schema, and as RDF using
     the Simple Knowledge Organization System(SKOS) vocabulary.

     Specifying a vocabulary is just one way models can control what
     values can be assigned to properties. Another strategy is to specify
     what types of values can be assigned. For example, a model for
     book descriptions may specify that the value of a pages property
     must be a positive integer. Or it could be more specific; a course
     catalog might give each course an identifier that contains a two-
     letter department code followed by a 1-3 digit course number.
     Specifying a data type like this with a regular expression narrows
     down the set of possible values for the property without having to
     enumerate every possible value. (See the sidebar.)

     In addition to or in lieu of specifying a type, a model may specify
     an encoding scheme for values. An encoding scheme is a specialized
     writing system or syntax for particular types of values. For example,
     a model like Atom for describing syndicated web content requires a
     publication date. But there are many different ways to write dates:
     9/2/76, 2 Sept. 1976, September 2nd 1976, etc. Atom also

    subjects.html; MeSH at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/.

      860 | Structuring Descriptions
specifies an encoding scheme for date values. The encoding scheme
is RFC3339, a standard for writing dates. When using RFC3339, one
always writes a date using the same form: 1976-09-02.30

          Regular Expressions
          Regular expressions have been used to describe
       patterns in text documents since the early days of
       computing and came into widespread use when Ken
       Thompson incorporated them into early UNIX text
       processing tools, such as ed and grep. There are too
       many variations of regular expression syntax for us to
       detail them here, but it is worthwhile to consider them
       briefly while we are on the subject of controlling
       values.31

          Regular expressions are employed by modern text
       processing tools for selection and retrieval purposes. In
       search and replace applications, one might search for
       the string "Chapter [1-5]" to express your intent to
       select chapters 1 through 5, or "it[']?s" to locate

30. The Atom Publishing Protocol is IETF RFC 5023,

introduction is (Sayre 2005). IETF RFC is

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt.

31. There is no single authority on the subject of regular

expressions or their syntax. A good starting point is the

Wikipedia article on the subject:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression.

                                   Structuring Descriptions | 861
       every use of "it's" and "its" in a manuscript; this
       capability is highly valued by anyone who has had to edit
       a book. Programmers and data modelers use regular
       expressions to describe expected encoding schemes
       when they design documents, data elements, databases,
       and encoding schemes. You experience regular
       expression processing when you enter a phone number
       or postal code into a Web-based form. Many data
       modeling, programming and XML schema languages
       employ regular expressions to control data entry and
       validation of values. In the context of controlling values,
       we can use regular expressions to describe data values
       as varied as identifiers, names, dates, telephone
       numbers, and postal codes. We can, likewise, define
       rules for white space handling and punctuation within a
       data value.

Encoding schemes are often defined in conjunction with
standardized identifiers. (See "Make Names Informative".) For
example, International Standard Book Numbers(ISBN) are not just
sequences of Arabic numerals: they are values written using the
ISBN encoding scheme. This scheme specifies how to separate the
sequence of numerals into parts, and how each of these parts should
be interpreted. The ISBN 978-3-8218-4448-0 has five parts, the
first three of which indicate that the resource with this identifier
is 1) a product of the book publishing industry, 2) published in a
German-speaking country, and 3) published by the publishing house
Eichborn.

Encoding schemes can be viewed as very specialized models of
particular kinds of information, such as dates or book identifiers.
But because they specify not only the structure of this information,

862 | Structuring Descriptions
but also how it should be written, we can also view them as
specialized writing systems. That is, encoding schemes specify how
to textually represent information.
In the second half of this chapter, we will focus on the issues
involved in textually representing resource descriptions--writing
them. Graphs, trees, dictionaries, lists, and sets are general types
of structures found in different metamodels. Thinking about these
broad types and how they fit or do not fit the ways we want to model
our resource descriptions can help us select a specific metamodel.
Specific metamodels such as the XML Infoset or RDF are formalized
and standardized definitions of the more general types of structures
discussed above. Once we have selected a metamodel, we know
the constraints we have to work with when modeling the resources
and collections in our specific domain. But because metamodels
are abstract and exist only on a conceptual level, they can only
take us so far. If we want to create, store, and exchange individual
resource descriptions, we need to make the structures defined by
our abstract metamodels concrete. We need to write them.

60. Writing Descriptions

Suppose that I am organizing books, and I have decided that it is
important for the purposes of this organizing to know the title of
each book and how many pages it has. Before me I have a book,
which I examine to determine that its title is Die Ringe des Saturn
and it has 371 pages. Example: Basic ways of writing part of a book
description. lists a few of the ways to write this description. Let us
examine these various forms of writing to see what they have in
common and where they differ.

Basic Ways Of Writing Part Of A Book Description

 The title is Die Ringe des Saturn and it has 371 pages.

 { book: {"title":"Die Ringe des Saturn","pages":371} }

 <book pages="371"> <title>Die Ringe des Saturn</title>
 </book>

We examine the notations, writing systems and syntax of each of
these description forms, and others, in the following sections.

                                                                    Writing Descriptions | 865
  Notations

   First, let us look at the actual marks on the page. To write you must
   make marks or--more likely--select from a menu of marks using a
   keyboard. In either case, you are using a notation: a set of characters
   with distinct forms.1 The Latin alphabet is a notation, as are Arabic
   numerals. Some more exotic notations include the symbols used
   for editorial markup and alchemical symbols.2 The characters in a
   notation usually have an ordering. Arabic numerals are ordered 1 2
   3 and so on. English-speaking children usually learn the ordering of
   the Latin alphabet in the form of an alphabet song.3

   A character may belong to more than one notation. The examples

   ASCII is an example of a notation that has been codified and
   standardized for use in a digital environment. A traditional notation
   like the Latin alphabet can withstand a certain degree of variation
   in the form of a particular mark. Two people might write the letter
   A rather differently, but as long as they can mutually recognize
   each other's marks as an "A," they can successfully share a notation.
   Computers, however, cannot easily accommodate such variation.
   Each character must be strictly defined. In the case of ASCII, each
   character is given a number from 0 to 127, so that there are 128 ASCII
   characters.5 When using a computer to type ASCII characters, each
   key you press selects a character from this "menu" of 128 characters.
   A notation that has had numbers assigned to its characters is called
   a character encoding.

   ASCII

5. Only 95 of these characters are actually "marks" in the
   sense of being visible and printable. The other 33 ASCII
   characters are "control codes" that indicate things like
   horizontal and vertical tabs, the ends of printed lines,
   form feeds, and transmission control. We can think of
   many of these as special auxiliary marks, similar to the
   kind of symbols editors and proofreaders use to annotate
   texts.

The most ambitious character coding in existence is Unicode, which
as of version 6.0 assigns numbers to 109,449 characters.6 Unicode
makes the important distinction between characters and glyphs. A
character is the smallest meaningful unit of a written language.
In alphabet-based languages like English, characters are letters; in
languages like Chinese, characters are ideographs. Unicode treats
all of these characters as abstract ideas (Latin capital A) rather than

6. The Unicode standard is maintained by a global non-
   profit organization. Everything you need to know is at
   http://www.unicode.org/.

    868 | Writing Descriptions
   specific marks (A A A A). A specific mark that can be used to depict
   a character is a glyph. A font is a collection of glyphs used to depict
   some set of characters. A Unicode font explicitly associates each
   glyph with a particular number in the Unicode character encoding.
   The inability of computers to use contextual understanding to
   bridge the gap between various glyphs and the abstract character
   depicted by those glyphs turns out to have important consequences
   for organizing systems.

   Different notations may include very similar marks. For example,
   modern music notation includes marks for indicating the pitch of
   note, known as accidentals. One of these music notation marks is
    ("sharp"). The sharp sign looks very much like the symbol used
   in English as an abbreviation for the word number, as in We're #1!7
   If you were to write a sharp sign and a number sign by hand, they
   would probably look identical. In a non-digital environment, we
   would rely on context to understand whether the written mark was
   being used as part of music notation, or mathematical notation, or
   as an English abbreviation.

   Computers, however, have no such intuitive understanding of
   context. Unicode encodes the number sign and the sharp sign as
   two different characters. As far as a computer using Unicode is
   concerned,  and # are completely different, and the fact that they
   have similar-looking glyphs is irrelevant. That is a problem if, for
   example, a cataloger has carefully described a piece of music by

7. The Chinese character  (water well) looks like the #
  character too. The # symbol was historically used to
  denote pounds, the Imperial unit of weight, as in 10#
  of potatoes. In the United Kingdom, the # character is
  called"hash." We could go on, but we will leave it to you
  to discover more.

                                                                        Writing Descriptions | 869
   correctly using the sharp sign, but a person looking for that piece of
   music searches for descriptions using the number sign (since that is
   what you get when you press the keyboard button with the symbol
   that most closely resembles a sharp sign).8

  Writing Systems

   A writing system employs one or more notations, and adds a set of
   rules for using them. Most writing systems assume knowledge of
   a particular human language. These writing systems are known as
   glottic writing systems. But there are many writing systems, such
   as mathematical and musical ones, that are not tied to human
   languages in this way. Many of the writing systems used for
   describing resources belong to this latter group, meaning that (at
   least in principle) they can be used with equal facility by speakers of
   any language.

   Glottic writing systems, being grounded in natural human
   languages, are difficult to describe precisely and comprehensively.
   Non-glottic writing systems, on the other hand, can be described
   precisely and comprehensively using an abstract model. That is
   the connection between the structural perspective taken in the
   previous section, and the textual perspective taken in this section. A
   non-glottic writing system is described by a particular metamodel,

8. To add to the confusion, while the American standard
   (ASCII) places the # character at position 23, the British
   equivalent (BS 4730) places the currency symbol £ at the
   same position. As a result, improperly configured
   computers sometimes display # in place of £ and vice
   versa.

    870 | Writing Descriptions
     and structures that fit within the constraints of a given metamodel
     can be textually represented using one or more writing systems that
     are described by that metamodel.

     Some writing systems are closely identified with specific
     metamodels. For example, XML and JSON are both 1) metamodels
     for structuring information and 2) writing systems for textually
     representing information. In other words, they specify both the
     abstract structure of a description and how to write it down. It
     is possible to conceive of other ways to textually represent the
     structure of these metamodels, but for each of these metamodels
     just one writing system has been standardized.9

     RDF, on the other hand, is only a metamodel, not a writing system.
     RDF only defines an abstract structure, not how to write that
     structure. So how do we write information that is structured as
     RDF? It turns out that we have many choices. Unlike XML and JSON,
     several different writing systems for the RDF metamodel have been
     standardized, including N-Triples, Turtle, RDFa, and RDF/XML.10
     Each of these is a writing system that is abstractly described by the
     RDF metamodel.

 9. Recently, an alternative writing system for
    XML-structured data has been standardized: Efficient
    XML Interchange(EXI). However it is not yet widely used.

10. RDF/XML is a bit confusing; it is a writing system that
    uses XML syntax to textually represent RDF structure.
    This means that while XML tools can read and write RDF/
    XML, they cannot manipulate the graph structures it
    represents, because they were designed to work with
    XML's tree structures.

                                                                           Writing Descriptions | 871
    Writing systems provide rules for arranging characters from a
    notation into meaningful structures. A character in a notation has
    no inherent meaning. Characters in a notation only take on meaning
    in the context of a writing system that uses that notation. For
    example: what does the letter I from the Latin alphabet mean? That
    question can only be answered by looking at how it is being used in a
    particular writing system. If the writing system is American English,
    then whether I has a meaning depends on whether it is grouped
    with other letters or whether it stands alone. Only in the latter
    case does it have an assignable meaning. However in the arithmetic
    writing system of ancient Rome, which also uses as a notation the
    letters of the Latin alphabet, I has a different meaning: one.
    This example also serves to illustrate how the ordering of a notation
    can differ from the ordering of a writing system that uses that
    notation. According to the ordering of the Latin alphabet, the
    twelfth letter L comes before the twenty-second letter V. But in the
    Roman numeric writing system, V (the number 5) comes before L
    (the number 50). Unless we know which ordering we are using, we
    cannot arrange L and V "in order."11

    Roman Numerals

11. Although we use alphabetic characters today to
   represent Roman numerals, originally they were
   represented by unique symbols.

    872 | Writing Descriptions
Roman Number Arabic Number

I  1

V  5

X  10

L  50

C  100

D  500

M  1000

This kind of difference in ordering can arise in more subtle ways
as well. When we alphabetically order names, we first compare the
first character of each name, and arrange them according to the
ordering of the writing system. The first known use of alphabetical
ordering was in the Library of Alexandria about two thousand years
ago, when Zenodotus arranged the collection according to the first
letter of resource names.12 If the first characters of two names
are the same, we compare the second character, and so on. We
can also apply this same kind of ordering procedure to sequences
of numerals. If we do, then 334 will come before 67, because 3
(the first character of the first sequence) comes before 6 (the first
character of the second sequence) according to the ordering of
our notation (Arabic numerals). However, it is more common when
ordering sequences of numerals to treat them as decimal numbers,

12. It took a few hundred years before alphabetization
    became recursive and applied to letters other than the
    first (Casson 2002, p. 37). Alphabetization relies on the
    ordering of the writing system, not the notation. For
    example, Swedish and German are two writing systems
    that assign different orderings to the same notation.

                                                                          Writing Descriptions | 873
     and thus to use the ordering imposed by the decimal system. In the
     decimal writing system, 67 precedes 334, since the latter is a greater
     number.

     This difference is important for organizing systems. Computers will
     sort values differently depending on whether they are treating
     sequences of numerals as numbers or just as sequences. Some
     organizing systems mix multiple ways of ordering the same
     characters. For example, Library of Congress call numbers have
     four parts, and sequences of Arabic numerals can appear in three
     of them. In the second part, indicating a narrow subject area, and
     fourth part, indicating year of publication, sequences of numerals
     are treated as numbers and ordered according to the decimal
     system. In the third part, however, sequences of numerals are
     treated as sequences and ordered "notationally" as in the example
     above (334 before 67).

     Differences in ordering demonstrate just one way that multiple
     writing systems may use the same notation differently. For example,
     the American English and British English writing systems both use
     the same Latin alphabet, but impose slightly different spelling
     rules.13 The Japanese writing system employs a number of
     notations, including traditional Chinese characters (kanji) as well as
     the Latin alphabet (rmaji). Often, writing systems do not share the
     same exact notation but have mostly overlapping notations. Many

13. For example, the American spelling of the words "center"
    and "color" contrasts slightly with the English spelling
    of "centre" and "colour." There are too many examples
    to include here. Wikipedia has a comprehensive analysis
    of American and British spelling differences at

     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

    American_and_British_English_spelling_differences.

     874 | Writing Descriptions
     European languages, for example, extend the Latin alphabet with
     characters such as Å and Ü that add additional marks, known as
     diacritics, to the basic characters.14

     In organizing systems it is often necessary to represent values from
     one writing system in another writing system that uses a different
     notation, a process known as transliteration. For example, early
     computer systems only supported the ASCII notation, so text from
     writing systems that extend the Latin alphabet had to be converted
     to ASCII, usually by removing (or sometimes transliterating)
     diacritics. This made the non-ASCII text usable in an ASCII-based
     computerized organizing system, at the expense of information loss.

     Even in modern computer systems that support Unicode, however,
     transliteration is often needed to support organizing activities by
     users who cannot read text written using its original system. The
     Library of Congress and the American Library Association provide
     standard procedures for transliterating text from over sixty
     different writing systems into the (extended) Latin alphabet.

14. ASCII's 128 characters are insufficient to represent these
    more complex character sets, so a new family of
    character encodings was created, ISO-8859, in which
    each encoding enumerates 256 characters. Each
    encoding thus has more space to accommodate the
    additional characters of regionally-specific notations.
    ISO 8859-5, for example, has extensions to support the
    Cyrillic alphabet.

                                                                          Writing Descriptions | 875
   Syntax

     The examples in Example: Basic ways of writing part of a book
     description. express the same information using different writing
     systems. The examples use the same notation (ASCII) but differ in
     their syntax: the rules that define how characters can be combined
     into words and how words can be combined into higher-level
     structures.15

       · Consider the first entry: The title is Die Ringe des Saturn and it
           has 371 pages. The leading capital letter and the period ending
           this sequence of characters indicate to us that this is a
           sentence. This sentence is one way we might use the English
           writing system to express two statements about the book we
           are describing. A statement is one distinct fact or piece of
           information. In glottic writing systems like English, there is
           usually more than one sentence we could write to express the
           same statement. For example, instead of it has 371 pages we
           might have written the number of pages is 371. English writing
           also enables us to construct complex sentences that express
           more than one statement.16

15. In discussions of glottic writing systems, "syntax" usually
    refers only to the rules for combining words into
    sentences. In discussions of programming languages,
    "syntax" has the broader sense we use here.

16. Compound sentences contain two independent clauses
    joined by a conjunction, such as "and," "or," "nor," "but."
    For example: I went to the store and I bought a book."
    Complex sentences contain an independent clause joined

     876 | Writing Descriptions
             In contrast, when we create descriptions of resources in an
          organizing system, we generally use non-glottic writing
          systems in which each sentence only expresses a single
          statement, and there is just one way to write a sentence that
          expresses a given statement.17 These restrictions make these
          writing systems less expressive, but simplify their use. In
          particular, since there is a one-to-one correspondence
          between sentences and statements, we can drop the distinction
          and just talk about the statements of a description.

             Now we return to our example and look at the structure
          of the statement, The title is Die Ringe des Saturn and it has
          371 pages. Spaces are used to separate the text into words,
          and English syntax defines the functions of those words. The
          verb is in this statement functions to link the word title to
          the phrase Die Ringe des Saturn. This is typical of the kind of

    by one or more dependent clauses. For example: "I read
    the book that I bought at the store."

17. In truth, even non-glottic writing systems designed to
    encode resource descriptions unambiguously can have
    variant forms of the same statement. For example, XML
    permits some variation in the way the same Infoset may
    be textually represented. Often these variations involve
    the treatment of content that may under some
    circumstances be treated as optional, such as white
    space. The difference is that in writing systems designed
    for resource description, these variations can be
    precisely enumerated and rules developed to reconcile
    them, while this is not generally true for glottic writing
    systems.

                                                                          Writing Descriptions | 877
           statements found in a resource description. Each statement
           identifies and describes some aspect of the resource. In this
           case, the statement attributes the value Die Ringe des Saturn to
           the property title.

              As we saw when we looked at description structures, we
           can analyze descriptions as involving properties of resources
           and their corresponding values or content. In a writing system
           like English, it is not always so straightforward to determine
           which words refer to properties and which refer to values.
           (This is why blobs are not ideal description structures.) Writing
           systems designed for expressing resource descriptions, on the
           other hand, usually define syntax that makes this determination
           easier. In our dictionary examples above, we used an arrow
           character  to indicate the relationship between properties
           and values.

              This ease of distinguishing properties and values comes at a
           price, however. The syntax of English is forgiving: we can read
           a sentence with somewhat garbled syntax such as 371 pages it
           has and often still make out its meaning.18 This is usually not
           the case with writing systems intended for expressing resource
           descriptions. These systems strictly define their rules for how
           characters can be combined into higher-level structures.
           Structures that follow the rules are well formed according to
           that system.

       · Take for example the second entry in Example: Basic ways of
           writing part of a book description..

           { book: {"title":"Die Ringe des Saturn","pages":371} }

18. Fortunately for Yoda. There are many web services for
    converting English to Yoda-speak; an example is

     878 | Writing Descriptions
   This fragment is written in JSON. As explained earlier in this
   chapter, JSON is a metamodel for structuring information using
   lists and dictionaries. But JSON is also a writing system, which
   borrows its syntax from JavaScript. The JSON syntax uses
   brackets to textually represent lists [1,2,3] and braces to
   textually represent dictionaries {title:"Die Ringe des
   Saturn", "pages":371}. Within braces, the colon character
   : is used to link properties with their values, much as is was
   used in the previous example. So "pages":371 is a statement
   assigning the value 371 to the property pages.

· The third fragment is written in XML.

   <book pages="371"> <title>Die Ringe des Saturn</title> </boo

   Like JSON, XML is a metamodel and also a writing system.
   Here we have XML elements and attributes. XML elements are
   textually represented as tags that are marked using the special
   characters <, > and /. So, this fragment of XML consists of
   a book element with a child element, title, and a pages
   attribute, each of which has some text content. In this case,
   pages="371" is a statement assigning the value 371 to the
   property pages. The difference is syntax is subtle; quotation
   marks surround the value and equal sign = is used to assign the
   property to its value.

· The fourth is a fragment of HTML.

   <div class="book">The title is <span class="title">Die Ring

   The writing system that HTML employs is close enough to XML
   to ignore any differences in syntax. In this example, the CLASS
   attribute contains the property name and the property value is
   the element content.

· The fifth entry is a fragment of Turtle, one of the writing
   systems for RDF.

                                                                  Writing Descriptions | 879
      <http://lccn.loc.gov/96103072> <http://rdvocab.info/Elements

      Turtle provides a syntax for writing down RDF triples. Each
      triple consists of a subject, predicate, and object separated by
      spaces. Recall that RDF uses URIs to identify subjects,
      predicates, and some objects; these URIs are written in Turtle
      by enclosing them in angle brackets < >. Triples are separated
      by period . characters, but triples that share the same subject
      can be written more compactly by writing the subject only
      once, and then writing the predicate and object of each triple,
      separated by a semicolon ; character. This is what we see in
      Example: Nesting an author description within a book
      description: two triples that share a subject.

The two fragments in Example: Writing part of a book description
in Semantic XML. demonstrate namespaces, terms from the Dublin
Core and DocBook namespaces, and the facility with which XML
embraces semantic encoding of description resources.

Writing Part Of A Book Description In Semantic XML

 <book xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"

 docbookx.dtd"> <bookinfo> <title>Die Ringe des
 Saturn</title> <pagenums>371
 p.</pagenums>...</bookinfo> ... </book>

  · The first example extends the third fragment from Example:
      Basic ways of writing part of a book description.; the
      xmlns:dc="..." segment is a namespace declaration, which
      is associating dc with the quoted URI, which happens to be the
      Dublin Core Metadata Initiative(DCMI); the child <dc:title>

880 | Writing Descriptions
           element and the attached dc:extent="371" tell us that the
           corresponding values are attributable to the title and extent
           properties, respectively, from the Dublin Core namespace.

       · The next fragment employs DocBook DTD namespace; we now
           have a <pagenums> element for which the meaning is
           contextually obvious; the title is still a title; an extra layer of
           markup reflects the fact that it could be metadata in the source
           file of a book that is being edited, is in production or is on your
           favorite tablet right now.19

               Microformats, RDFa and Microdata
               When Tim Berners-Lee deployed HTML, its syntax
            contained the basic elements and attributes needed to
            make formal statements about the document as a whole
            by using <LINK/>, or about specific parts of the
            document by using the <A> element. Each of these
            elements have four attributes in common: the famous
            HREF attribute contains a URI that names an object
            resource; the NAME attribute allows the element to be

       the target end of a link; the REL and REV attributes
       contain descriptions of the link relations.

          Microformats, RDFa and Microdata are the latest
       generation of metadata extensions to HTML. Each
       approach is widely used on the web and by search
       engines. As such, they are potential targets when
       transforming into HTML from richer semantic formats.

          Microformats are the simplest of the three. It uses
       controlled vocabularies of terms in REL/REV, and in the
       CLASS attribute, to declare high-level information
       types.

          RDFa is RDF in Attributes. That is, RDFa is a formal
       specification for writing RDF expressions by using
       attributes in XML and HTML documents. It uses an
       ABOUT attribute to name the subject of the relation; the
       REL and REV attributes; HREF is joined by SRC and
       RESOURCE to name the object of the link; a TYPEOF
       attribute declares a type; PROPERTY and CONTENT
       attributes are used to attribute a value to an object's
       property.

          Microdata is similar, inasmuch as it uses attributes
       extensively. The presence of an ITEMSCOPE attribute
       identifies an item while the ITEMTYPE attribute value
       identifies its type; ITEMID declares an items name or
       unique identifier; ITEMPROP is a name value pair, and;
       ITEMREF relates this item to other elements that are
       outside of the scope of the container element.

The two fragments in Example: Writing part of a book description
in RDFa or microdata. demonstrate RDFa and microdata formats,
which each rely upon specific attributes to establish the type of the

882 | Writing Descriptions
property values contained by the HTML elements. In each example,
the book title is contained by a <span> element. Whereas RDFa
relies upon the property attribute, the microdata example employs
the itemprop attribute to specify that the contents of the element
is, effectively, a "title" in exactly the same sense as we know that the
contents of <dc:title> is a "title."

61. Worlds of Description

In the previous two sections we have considered descriptions as
designed objects with particular structures and as written
documents with particular syntaxes. As we have seen, there are
many possible choices of structure and syntax. But these choices
are never made in isolation. Just as an architect or designer must
work within the constraints of the existing built environment, and
just as any author must work with existing writing systems,
descriptions are always created as part of a pre-existing "world"
over which any one of us has little control.

In the final part of this chapter, we will consider how choices of
structure and syntax have converged historically into broad
patterns of usage. For lack of a better term, we call these broad
patterns "worlds." "World" is not a technical term and should not be
taken too literally: the broad areas of application sketched here have
considerable overlap, and there are many other ways one might
identify patterns of description structure and syntax. That said, the
three worlds described here do reflect real patterns of description
form that influence tool and technology choices. In your own work
creating and managing resource descriptions, it is likely that you
will need to think about how your descriptions fit into one or more
of these worlds.

The Document Processing World

The first world we will consider is concerned primarily with the
creation, processing and management of hybrid narrative-
transactional documents such as instruction manuals, textbooks,
or annotated medieval manuscripts. (See The Document Type
Spectrum). These are quite different kinds of documents, but they

884 | Worlds of Description
   all contain a mixture of narrative text and structured data, and they
   all can be usefully modeled as tree structures. Because of these
   shared qualities, tools as different as publishing software, supply-
   chain management software, and scholarly editing software have
   all converged on common XML-based solutions. ("The XML world"
   would be another appropriate name for the document-processing
   world.)

   This convergence was no accident, because XML was designed
   specifically to address the problem of how to add structure and
   data to documents by "marking them up." XML is the descendant
   of Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML), which in turn
   descended from International Business Machines(IBM)'s
   Generalized Markup Language, which was invented to enable the
   production and management of large-scale technical
   documentation. The explicitness of markup makes it well-suited for
   representing structure and content type distinctions in institutional
   contexts, where the scope, scale, and expected lifetime of
   organizing systems for information implies reuse by unknown
   people for unanticipated purposes.

   The abstract data model underlying XML is called the XML
   Information Set or Infoset. The Infoset defines a document as a
   partially ordered tree of "information items." Every XML document
   can thus be understood as a specific kind of tree, although not every
   tree structure is expressible as an XML document.1

1. It should be noted that the content of the Infoset for a
  given document may be affected by knowledge of any
  related DTDs or schemas. That is to say that, upon
  examination of a given XML document instance, its
  Infoset may be augmented with some useful information,

                                                                      Worlds of Description | 885
As we discussed in Inclusions and References, XML has the ability to
describe graphs by incorporating the use of ID and IDREF attribute
types to create references among element information items within
the same document. This modest form of hypertext linking allows us
to present the following document fragment that approximates the
graph we saw modeled in Figure: Descriptions Linked into a Graph.

Inclusions and References.)

886 | Worlds of Description
processing world are optimized for manipulating and combining
tree structures. A "toolchain" is set of tools intended to be used
together to achieve some goal.

          The XML Toolchain
          The XML toolchain is quite comprehensive. It consists
       of tools for creating XML documents (XML editors),
       tools for expressing logical document and data models
       (DTD, XML Schema, REgular LAnguage for XML Next
       Generation(RELAX NG), Schematron), tools for
       transforming XML documents (XSLT), tools for
       describing document processing "pipelines" (XProc: An
       XML Pipeline Language), and tools for storing and
       querying collections of XML documents (XML databases,
       queried using XML Query Language(XQuery)). Used
       together, these tools provide very powerful means of
       working with tree-structured documents. XML editors
       incorporate knowledge of DTDs, schemas,
       transformations, style sheets, queries, databases and
       pipelines. Pipelines choreograph the plumbing and
       inter-dependencies involved in processing a complex
       dataset and publishing a useful result in one or more
       output formats.

For programmers who do not to use the XML toolchain, other
programming languages also provide libraries for working with
XML. This fact has led some to propose, and others to believe,
that XML is a kind of universal format for exchanging data among
systems. However, programmers have observed that a random XML
Infoset does not map easily to the data structures commonly found
in many programming languages. "Working with XML" frequently
means translating from XML tree structures to data structures

                                                                   Worlds of Description | 887
native to another language, usually meaning lists and dictionaries.
This translation can be problematic and often means giving up many
of the strengths of XML. By the same token, there are decades
more practical experience working with markup languages and
institutional publishing than there is with JSON and RDF.

XML is not a universal solution for every possible problem. That
does not mean that it is not the best solution for a wide variety
of problems, including yours. To gauge whether your resource
descriptions are, or ought to be, part of the document-processing
world, ask yourself the following questions:

  · Do my resource descriptions contain mixtures of narrative text,
      hypertext, structured data and a variety of media formats?

  · Can my descriptions easily be modeled using tree structures,
      hypertext links, and transclusion?

  · Are the vocabularies I need or want to use made available using
      XML technologies?

  · Do I need to work with a body of existing descriptions already
      encoded as XML?

  · Do I need to interoperate with processes or partners that utilize
      the XML toolchain?

  · Do I need to publish my resource descriptions in multiple
      formats from a single source?

If the answer to one or more of these questions is "yes," then
chances are good that you are working within the document
processing world, and you will need to become familiar with
conceptualizing your descriptions as trees and working with them
using XML tools.

888 | Worlds of Description
The Web World

The second "world" emerged in the early 1990s with the creation
of the World Wide Web. The web was developed to address a need
for simple and rapid sharing of scientific data. Of course, it has
grown far beyond that initial use case, and is now a ubiquitous
infrastructure for all varieties of information and communication
services. ("The browser world" would be another appropriate name
for what we are calling the Web World.)

Documents, data, and services on the web are conceptualized as
resources, identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers(URI), and
accessible through representations transferred via Hypertext
Transfer Protocol(HTTP). Representations are sequences of bytes,
and could be HTML pages, JPEG images, tabular data, or practically
anything else transferable via HTTP. No matter what they are,
representations transferred over the web include descriptions of
themselves. These descriptions take the form of property-value
pairs, known as "HTTP headers." The HTTP headers of web
representations are structured as dictionaries.

Dictionary structures appear many other places in web
infrastructure. URIs may include a query component beginning with
a ? character. This component is used for purposes such as
providing query parameters to search services. The query
component is commonly structured as a dictionary, consisting of
a series of property-value pairs separated by the & character. For
example, the following URI:

https://www.google.com/search?q=sebald&tbs=qdr:m

includes the query component q=sebald&tbs=qdr:m. This is a
dictionary with the properties q and tbs, respectively specifying
the search term and temporal constraints on the search.

Data entered into an HTML form is also structured as a dictionary.

                                                                   Worlds of Description | 889
   When an HTML form is submitted, the entered data is used either
   to compose the query component of a URI, or to create a new
   representation to be transferred to a web server. In either case, the
   data is structured as a set of properties and their corresponding
   values.

   HTML documents are structured as trees, but descriptions
   embedded within HTML documents can also be structured as
   dictionaries. HTML documents may include a dictionary of
   metadata elements, each of which specifies a property and its value.
   Recently support for microdata was added to HTML, which is
   another method of adding dictionaries of property-value pairs to
   documents. Using microdata, authors can annotate web content
   with additional information, making it easier to automatically
   extract structured descriptions of that content.2 Microformats are
   another method for doing this by mapping existing HTML attributes
   and values to (nested) dictionary structures.3

   Dictionary structures are easy to work with in any programming
   language, and they pervade various popular frameworks for

2. Microdata is an invention of WHATWG and exists and
   part of what they call a "living standard." It was supported
   by Google, so it was widely used and there exist
   numerous controlled vocabularies, including those for
   creative works, persons, events and organizations.
   Support for microdata has since been withdrawn from
   Apple Safari and Google Chrome browsers.

3. Microformats is a non-standard that emerged from the
   community and has been sponsored by CommerceNet
   and Microformats.org.

    890 | Worlds of Description
programming the Web. In the programming languages used to
implement web services, HTTP headers and query parameters are
easily mapped to dictionary data structures native to those
languages. On the client side, there is only one programming
language that runs within all web browsers: JavaScript. The
dictionary is the fundamental data structure within JavaScript as
well.

Thus it is unsurprising that JSON, a dictionary-structured,
JavaScript-based syntax, has become the de facto standard for
application-to-application interchange of data on the web in
contexts that do not involve business transactions. Web services
providing structured data intended for programmatic use can make
that data available as JSON, which is well-suited for use either
by JavaScript programs running within browsers, or by programs
written in other languages running outside of browsers (e.g., smart
phone applications).

It is now commonly accepted that there are useful differences of
approach between the document-processing world and the Web
World. This does not mean that the two worlds do not have
significant overlaps. Some very important web representation types
are XML-based, such as the Atom syndication format. Trees will
continue to be the structure of choice for web representations that
consist primarily of narrative rather than transactional data. But
for structured descriptions that are intended to be accessed and
manipulated on the Web, dictionary structures currently rule.

To gauge whether your resource descriptions are or ought to be
part of the Web world, ask yourself the following questions:

· Is the web the primary platform upon which I will be making my
   descriptions available?

· Are my resource descriptions  primarily  structured,
   transaction-oriented data?

                                Worlds of Description | 891
  · Can my descriptions easily be modeled as lists of properties and
      values (dictionaries)?

  · Are the vocabularies I need or want to use made available
      primarily using HTML technologies such as microdata or
      microformats?

  · Do I need to make my descriptions easily usable for use within
      a wide array of programming languages?

If the answer to one or more of these questions is "yes," then
chances are good that you are working within the Web World, and
you will need to become familiar with conceptualizing your
descriptions as dictionaries and working with them using
programming languages such as JavaScript.

The Semantic Web World

The last world we consider is still somewhat of a possible world,
at least in comparison with the previous two. While the document
processing world and the web world are well-established, the
Semantic Web world is only starting to emerge, despite having been
envisioned over a decade ago.

The vision of a Semantic Web world builds upon the web world,
but adds some further prescriptions and constraints for how to
structure descriptions. The Semantic Web world unifies the concept
of a resource as it has been developed in this book, with the web
notion of a resource as anything with a URI. On the Semantic Web,
anything being described must have a URI. Furthermore, the
descriptions must be structured as graphs, adhering to the RDF
metamodel and relating resources to one another via their URIs.

892 | Worlds of Description
   Advocates of Linked Data further prescribe that those descriptions
   must be made available as representations transferred over HTTP.4

   This is a departure from the web world. The web world is also
   structured around URIs, but it does not require that every resource
   being described have a URI. For example, in the web world a list
   of bibliographic descriptions of books by W.G. Sebald might be
   published at a specific URI, but the individual books themselves
   might not have URIs. In the Semantic Web world, in addition to the
   list having a URIs, each book would have a URI too, in addition to
   whatever other identifiers it might have.5

   Making an HTTP request to an individual book URI may return
   a graph-structured description of that book, if best practices for
   Linked Data are being followed. This, too, is a departure from the
   web world, which is agnostic about the form representations or
   descriptions of resources should take (although as we have seen,
   dictionary structures are often favored on the web when the clients
   consuming those descriptions are computer programs). On the
   Semantic Web, all descriptions are structured as RDF graphs. Each
   description graph links to other description graphs by referring to

4. (Bizer, Heath, and Berners-Lee 2009).

5. It is worth noting that URIs are not required to have
   anything at their endpoints. Resolvability of URIs is
   evangelized as a best practice for Linked Data but not a
   requirement within the broader Semantic Web paradigm.
   Merely asserting that a URI is associated with a book is
   enough. If the URI can return a description or a resource,
   so much the better, but if not, at least you can talk about
   the book by referring to the same URI.

                                                                       Worlds of Description | 893
   these related resources using their URIs. Thus, at least in theory,
   all description graphs on the Semantic Web are linked into a single
   massive graph structure. In practice, however, it is far from clear
   that this is an achievable, or even a desirable, goal.

   Although the Semantic Web is in its infancy, a significant number
   of resource descriptions have already been made available in
   accordance with the principles outlined above. Descriptions
   published according to these principles are often referred to as
   "Linked Data." Prominent examples include: DBpedia, a graph of
   descriptions of subjects of Wikipedia articles; the Virtual
   International Authority File(VIAF), a graph of descriptions of names
   collected from various national libraries' name authority files;
   GeoNames, a graph of descriptions of places; and Data.gov.uk, a
   graph of descriptions of public data made available by the UK
   government.6

   Despite the growing amount of Linked Data, tools for working with
   graph-structured data are still immature in comparison to the XML
   toolchain and Web programming languages. Although there is an
   XML syntax for RDF, using the XML toolchain to work with graph-
   structured data is generally a bad idea. And just as most
   programming languages do not support natively working with tree
   structures, most do not support natively working with graph
   structures either. Storing and querying graph-structured data
   efficiently requires a graph database or triple store.

   Still, the Semantic Web world has much to recommend it. Having a
   common way of identifying resources (the URI) and a single shared
   metamodel (RDF) for all resource descriptions makes it much easier
   to combine descriptions from different sources. To gauge whether

    894 | Worlds of Description
your resource descriptions are or ought to be part of the Semantic
Web world, ask yourself the following questions:

  · Is the web the primary platform upon which I will be making my
      descriptions available?

  · Is it important that I be able to easily and freely aggregate the
      elements of my descriptions in different ways and to combine
      them with descriptions created by others?

  · Are my descriptions best modeled as graph structures?
  · Have the vocabularies I need or want to use been created using

      RDF?
  · Do I need to work with a body of existing descriptions that have

      been published as Linked Data?
If the answer to one or more of these questions is "yes," then
chances are good that you should be working within the Semantic
Web world, and you ought to become familiar with conceptualizing
your descriptions as graphs and working with them using Semantic
Web tools.

  · What are two perspectives on forming resource descriptions?
      We can approach the problem of how to form resource
      descriptions from two perspectives: structuring and writing.
      (See "Introduction")

  · Are metamodels domain-specific?
      Metamodels describe structures commonly found in resource
      descriptions and other information resources, regardless of the
      specific domain.
      (See "Structuring Descriptions")

  · What do blobs, sets, lists, dictionaries, trees, and graphs have in
      common?
      Blobs, sets, lists, dictionaries, trees, and graphs are all kinds of
      structures that can be used to form resource descriptions.
      (See "Kinds of Structures")

  · What is a list?
      A list, like a set, is a collection of items with an additional
      constraint: their items are ordered.
      (See "Lists")

  · What is a dictionary?
      A dictionary, also known as a map or an associative array, is a
      set of property-value pairs or entries.

   (See "Dictionaries")
· What is a nested dictionary?

   Nested dictionaries form a tree.
   (See "Dictionaries")
· What is a tree?
   Trees consist of nodes joined by edges.
   (See "Trees")
· What are the two kinds of data structures used by JSON?
   JSON consists of two kinds of structures: lists (called arrays in
   JavaScript) and dictionaries (called objects in JavaScript).
   (See "JSON")
· What is the XML Infoset?
   The XML Infoset is a tree structure, where each node of the tree
   is defined to be an information item of a particular type.

   Using schemas to define data representation formats is a good
   practice that facilitates shared understanding and contributes
   to long-term maintainability.
   (See "XML Information Set")
· What is RDF?
   The RDF metamodel is a directed graph, so it identifies one
   node (the one from which the edge is pointing) as the subject
   of the triple, and the other node (the one to which the edge is

      (as we have been saying) property of the triple.
      (See "RDF")
  · What is an encoding scheme?
      An "encoding scheme" is a specialized writing system or syntax
      for particular types of values. Encoding schemes specify how to
      textually represent information.
      (See "Notations")
  · What is a writing system?

      A writing system employs notations, and adds a set of rules for
      using them.
      (See "Writing Systems")
  · How could one notation be used in multiple writing systems?
      Differences in ordering demonstrate just one way that multiple
      writing systems may use the same notation differently.
      (See "Writing Systems")

63. Introduction (X)

Picture a dim room in the basement of a Detroit police station, lined
with metal shelves: the shelves contain boxes and boxes of cold
case files, evidence meticulously logged and categorized for no one
to look at, documenting murders that will never be solved. Or the
library of a small-town historical society in New Jersey: struggling
with budget cuts, the board of directors has been forced to close its
doors, locking its treasures inside, carefully curated and preserved
but inaccessible to the public. Or a valuable data store encoded in
an orphaned storage format: business records in a legacy database
system that will not run on modern computers, census data on
proprietary magnetic tape reels from the 1970s, your unfinished
novel on a series of eight-inch floppy disks. You know the data is
there, but you cannot interact with it.

An organizing system without interactions is a sad one indeed.

Interactions are the answer to two of the fundamental questions we
posed back in Foundations for Organizing Systems: why and when
are the resources organized?

The question of "why?" has been in the background (and often the
foreground) of every chapter in this book thus far; whenever we
select a resource for inclusion in an organizing system, describe
it, or arrange it according to an organizing principle, we have an
interaction in mind. We include a resource in our system because
our users will need it; we assign a resource to one or more
categories to help our users find it, understand it, and connect it
with other resources in a meaningful way.

In this chapter we will pivot from design for interactions to the
design of interactions--and to do this we must pause to consider the
question of "when?" In "When Is It Being Organized?", we contrasted
organization done "on the way in" with that done "on the way out,"

                                                                           Introduction (X) | 903
but this distinction is not always a particularly relevant one.
Consider a bookshelf: if you do not organize its resources on the
way in (i.e., when you put a book on the shelf), you cannot really
organize them on the way out; you just have a disorganized
bookshelf. When the time comes to retrieve a book, you'll have to
employ a brute-force linear search algorithm--reading every spine
until you find the one you want, and it will not make the remaining
books on the shelf any more organized.

But digital resources and networked organizing systems are an
entirely different story. In fact, we argue that they blur the
traditional boundary between the academic disciplines of
"information organization" and "information retrieval"; with the
World Wide Web, ubiquitous digital information, and effectively
unlimited processing, storage, and communication capability driven
by cloud computing architecture and Moore's law, billions of people
create and browse websites, blog, tag, tweet, and upload and
download content of all media types without thinking "I am
organizing now" or "I am retrieving now." When people use their
smartphones to search the web or run applications, location
information transmitted from their phone is used to filter and
reorganize the information they retrieve. Arranging results to make
them fit the user's location is a kind of computational curation, but
because it takes place quickly and automatically we hardly notice it.
Likewise, almost every application that once seemed predominantly
about information retrieval is now increasingly combined with
activities and functions that most would consider to be information
organization.

Thus we come to the question of when a system's resources are
organized: we may apply the techniques of computational
information retrieval to a set of resources that simply are not
organized the way we need them to be in order to support our
desired interaction. Maybe the system was designed poorly or for
a different purpose than the one we are pursuing; maybe we are
attempting to collect or aggregate resources from multiple

904 | Introduction (X)
organizing systems, each of which has its own separate purposes
and design flaws. Regardless of the reasons, what we are essentially
doing is reorganizing these resources on the fly, or "on the way
out," following many of the same principles and procedures we've
covered in the preceding eight chapters of this book.

          Most Common Museum Interaction

          Because museums often contain extremely rare or
       valuable resources that do not circulate, their most
       popular items are mobbed by visitors. The crowding
       often makes it impossible to get a good look at the rare
       item. This ironic situation is typified by the crowd
       control cordon that creates a 20-foot barrier around La
       Gioconda (aka "The Mona Lisa") at Musée du Louvre in
       Paris.

The fundamental interaction of any organizing system is accessing
resources or resource descriptions, whether physically or digitally.
Sometimes we must combine or merge resources or resource
descriptions to access them effectively; this poses numerous
strategy, design, and implementation challenges, as producers often
use different identifiers, description or cataloging formats, and
practices for similar resources. Different service providers use
different technologies, have different information policies, and
follow different processes developed in their separate organizing
systems.

Some organizing systems have the power to determine the
description standards that others must use. Walmart, the largest
retailer in the United States, has devised an organizing system for
its supply chain that supports access and movement of physical
goods with maximal efficiency and effectiveness. This system saves
the corporation money on inventory management and distribution,
but to maximize savings, Walmart requires its suppliers to employ
the same data model, follow company-set standards, and adopt new
technologies such as bar codes and RFID tags that support the
highly efficient interactions it requires.1

and process decisions on its suppliers and partners. See

       aggregating their listings to allow users to browse them
       all from a single page.

          (Screenshot by Ian MacFarland.)

Other organizing systems must adapt to whatever their
counterparts develop. Online retailer Shopstyle.com presents a
typical ecommerce interface, allowing shoppers to browse a
multitude of fashion and beauty products organized into familiar
categories. But behind the scenes, Shopstyle is aggregating the
catalogs of more than 250 online stores and providing a seamless
access interaction for all their merchandise. It does not actually
sell anything: it directs shoppers to those third-party stores to
make their purchases. Rather than moving physical resources like
Walmart, Shopstyle's most important interactions involve moving
and combining digital resource descriptions.

Still others choose to abide by what a standard-setting body
decides, or participate in laborious, democratic processes to align

                                                                           Introduction (X) | 907
their organizing practices and interactions.2 Libraries and museums

2. In order to more easily use and reuse content, as well

as have the ability to integrate different learning tools

into a single Learning Management System (LMS), Global

Learning Consortium, an organization composed of 140

members from leading educational institutions and

education-related companies, has released specifications

to make this possible. Called Common Cartridge and

Learning                Tools  Interoperability

(http://www.imsglobal.org/commoncartridge.html), the

specifications provide a common format and guidelines

to construct tools and create content that can be easily

imported into learning management systems. Common

Cartridge(CC) specifications give detailed descriptions of

the directory structure, metadata and information

models associated with a particular learning object. For

example, a learning package from a provider from

McGraw-Hill may contain content from a book, some

interactive quizzes, and some multimedia to support the

text. CC specifies how files would be organized within

a directory, how links would be represented, how the

package would communicate with a backend server, how

to describe each of the components, and the like. This

would enable a professor or a student using any capable

learning management system to import a "cartridge" or

learning material and have it appear in a consistent

manner with all other learning materials within the LMS.

are the classic examples of this. The most important interaction in
a library, of course, is borrowing: checking out a book to use it off
the premises, and checking it back in when you're done. Patrons
search descriptions in a catalog to find books on a certain topic,
by a certain author, or with a certain title, and access them by
fetching them from the stacks or asking a librarian to retrieve them.
As institutions that serve the public interest, libraries adhere to

This means that content providers need not maintain
multiple versions of the same content just to conform to
the formats of different systems, allowing them to focus
their resources on creating more content as opposed to
maintaining the ones they already have. Looking at this
in the context of the interoperability framework, we see
that while information from providers are in a structured
digital form, the main problem was that users were
consuming the content using competing systems that
had their own data formats by which to accept content.
Huge publishers, wanting to increase distribution of their
product, offered their content in all these different
formats. While the specifications that the LMS created
refer to the technical considerations in creating content
and tools, the process of getting to that point involved a
lot of organizational and political discussions. Internally,
content and LMS providers needed to set aside the
necessary resources to refactor their products to
conform to the standards. Externally, competing
providers had to collaborate with one another to create
the specifications.

                                                                           Introduction (X) | 909
   standards and democratic processes to ensure consistent and
   familiar user experiences for patrons, but also to enable powerful
   search interactions such as union catalogs, where resource
   descriptions from multiple libraries are merged before they are
   offered for search. Union catalogs allow patrons to find out with a
   single search whether a resource is available from any library that is
   accessible to them.3

   Museums serve the public interest as well, and employ standards
   and democratic procedures for similar reasons as libraries, but their
   visitors generally look at their resources rather than borrowing
   them. Museums enable people to discover or experience resources
   by exhibiting artifacts in creative contexts, and when they
   implement this interaction digitally, as in a website, they vastly
   increase the opportunity for public access. Virtual collections are
   accessible to remote patrons who are unable to visit the physical
   museum, and they allow access to resources that are not currently
   on view.

   The digitization of museum resources also allows visitors to
   experience them from a perspective that might not be possible
   in a physical museum. For example, in Google's Art Project, users
   can zoom in to view fine details of digitized paintings.4 Museums
   are starting to leverage technology and the popularity of Web 2.0
   features such as tagging and social networking to attract new
   audiences.5

   Implemented in 2004, the MuseumFinland project aims to provide

a portal for publishing heterogeneous museum collections on the
Semantic Web.6 Institutions such as the Getty Information Institute
and the International Committee for Documentation of the
International Council of Museums have worked on standards that
ensure worldwide consistency in how museums manage
information about their collections.7

How can these differences be handled in order to provide seamless
interactions within and across organizing systems? Which
requirements have to be met in order to provide the interactions
that are desired? How are different interaction types implemented?
Finally, how can the quality of interactions be evaluated with respect
to their requirements? These are the main questions for
interactions that we will try to answer.

        Navigating This
            Chapter

          This chapter concentrates on the processes that
       develop interactions based on leveraging the resources
       of organizing systems to provide valuable services to
       their users (human or computational agents). It will
       discuss the determination of the appropriate
       interactions ("Determining Interactions"), the
       organization of resources for interactions
       ("Reorganizing Resources for Interactions"), the
       implementation of interactions ("Implementing
       Interactions"), and their evaluation and adaptation
       ("Evaluating Interactions"). Although the fundamental
       questions pertain to all types of organizing systems, this
       chapter focuses on systems that use computers to
       satisfy their goals.

912 | Introduction (X)
64. Determining Interactions

Creating a strategy for successfully implementing interactions
involves an intricate balance between the resources, the organizing
system that arranges and manages them, its producers, and its
intended users or consumers. The design of interactions is driven
by user requirements and their impact on the choices made in the
implementation process. It is constrained by resource and technical
system properties and by social and legal requirements.
Determining the scope and scale of interactions requires a careful
analysis of these individual factors, their combination, and the
consequences thereof.

          Stop and Think: Constraint vs Flexibility
          Think of an information organization project you were
       involved in. Can you recall ways in which you were
       constrained in representing an idea by the organizing
       system the project was implemented with? In what ways
       was the project negatively affected by the
       implementation? In what ways might the constraint
       have had a positive effect?

It is useful to distinguish decisions that involve choices, where
multiple feasible alternatives exist, from decisions that involve
constraints, where design choices have been eliminated or rendered
infeasible by previous ones. The goal when creating an organizing
system is to make design decisions that preserve subsequent
choices or that create constraints that impose design decisions that
would have been preferred anyway.

                                                              Determining Interactions | 913
User Requirements

Users (human or computational agents) search or navigate
resources in organizing systems not just to identify them, but also
to obtain and further use the selected resources (e.g., read, cluster,
annotate, buy, copy, distribute, adapt, etc.). How resources are used
and by whom affects how much of the resource or its description is
exposed, across which channels it is offered, and the precision and
accuracy of the interaction.

An organizing system should enable interactions that allow users
to achieve their goals. The more abstract and intermediated the
interaction between a user and an organizing system becomes, the
more precisely the requirements must be expressed. User
requirements can be stated or implied, depending on the
sophistication and functional capabilities of the system.

In a closet, which is a personal organizing system for physical
resources, the person searching with an intent to find a particular
shirt might think, "Where is my yellow Hawaiian shirt?" but does
not need to communicate the search criteria to anyone else in
an explicit way. In a business or institutional organizing system,
however, the user needs to describe the desired resource and
interact with the system to select from candidate resources. This
interaction might involve a human intermediary like a salesperson
or reference librarian, or a computational one like a search engine.

A user's information need usually determines the kind and content
of resources required. User information needs are most often
expressed in search queries (whatever is typed into a search box) or
manifest themselves in the selection of one or more of the system
categories that are offered for browsing. Queries can be as simple
as a few keywords or very complex and specialized, employing
different search fields or operators; they may even be expressed
in a query language by expert users. Techniques such as spelling

914 | Determining Interactions
correction, query expansion, and suggestion assist users in
formulating queries. Techniques like breadcrumb navigation and
faceted filtering assist users in browsing an organizing system's
category system. Some systems allow the query to be expressed
in natural language and then transform it into a description that
is easier for the system to process. Queries for non-textual
information like photos or videos are typically expressed as text, but
some systems compute descriptions from non-textual queries such
as images or audio files. For example, a user can hum a tune or draw
or drag an image into an image query box.
Information needs of computational agents are determined by rules
and criteria set by the creators of the agents (i.e., the function
or goal of the agent). When a computational agent interacts with
another computational agent or service by using its API, in the ideal
case its output precisely satisfies those information needs.

          Google Image Search

          Google's Image Search tool can accept an image file as

                                                              Determining Interactions | 915
          an input rather than text, and will find visually similar
          images as well as making its best guess of the image's
          subject matter.

             (Screenshot by Ian MacFarland.)

   While search queries are explicitly stated user information needs,
   organizing systems increasingly attempt to solicit the user's context
   or larger work task in order to provide more suitable or precise
   interactions. Factors such as level of education, physical disabilities,
   location, time, or deadline pressure often specify and constrain the
   types of resources needed as well as the types of interactions the
   user is willing or able to engage in. Implicit information can be
   collected from user behavior, for example, search or buying history,
   current user location or language, and social or collaborative
   behavior (other people with the same context). Methods for
   explicitly soliciting user requirements include observation, surveys,
   focus groups, interviews, work task analysis and many more.1

   Designers of organizing systems must recognize that people are

1. A conceptual framework for analyzing users and their
  work tasks for design requirements is (Fidel 2012). A
  general survey of design methods is given in (Hanington
  and Martin 2012). Designing particularly for successful
  interactions (services) is discussed in (Polaine, Løvlie and
  Reason). (Resmini and Rosati 2011) describe designing for
  engaged users using cross-channel, cross-media
  information architecture.

   916 | Determining Interactions
not perfectly capable and rational decision makers. Limited memory
and attention capacities prevent people from remembering
everything and make them unable to consider more than a few
things or choices at once. As a result of these fundamental
limitations, people consciously and unconsciously reduce the
cognitive effort they make when faced with decisions.

          Behavioral Economics
          Classical economics assumes that humans are
       perfectly rational goal-oriented actors who act to
       achieve maximal satisfaction or utility. In contrast,
       behavioral economics recognizes the cognitive and
       emotional constraints on human behavior and assumes
       that people are biased and flawed decision makers.
          Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky systematized the
       psychological foundations for behavioral economics,
       building on the work of Herbert Simon, who first
       proposed to understand people as "boundedly rational."
       Kahneman and Tversky identified the systematic biases
       that prevent people from making optimal decisions and
       the heuristics they use to save cognitive effort.
       Kahneman contrasts classical and behavioral economics
       as follows:

                         Psychological theories of intuitive
                      thinking cannot match the elegance and
                      precision of formal normative models of
                      belief and choice, but this is just another
                      way of saying that rational models are
                      psychologically unrealistic.

                         (Kahneman 2003, p 1449)

                                                               Determining Interactions | 917
              Sunstein and Thaler popularized the application of
           behavioral economics as "libertarian paternalism," with
           the goal of encouraging the design of organizing
           systems and policies that maintain or increase freedom
           of choice but which at the same time influence people
           to make choices that they would judge as good ones.
           This perspective is nicely captured by the title of their
           best-selling book, Nudge. Many government agencies
           and businesses in the US and elsewhere are building
           "nudging" principles into policies and products in the
           areas of social services, healthcare, and financial
           services because of the complexity of their offerings.

              Behavioral economics complements the discipline of
           organizing by offering insights into the thinking and
           behavior of typical users that can lead to classifications
           and choices that make them more effective and
           satisfied. However, the principles of behavioral
           economics can be used to design organizing systems
           that manipulate people into taking actions and making
           choices that they might not intend or that are not in
           their best interests. (See Dark Patterns.)2

   One important way in which this affects how people behave
   demonstrates what Barry Schwartz calls The Paradox of Choice. You
   might think that people would prefer many options rather than just

2. (Simon 1982), (Tversky and Kahneman 1974),
   (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), (Kahneman 2003), and
   (Thaler 2008).

    918 | Determining Interactions
   a few because that would better enable them to select a resource
   that best meets their requirements. In fact, because considering
   more choices requires more mental effort, this can cause stress
   and indecision and might cause people to give up. For example,
   when there were 24 different types of jam offered at an upscale
   market, more people stopped to taste than when only 6 choices
   were offered, but a greater percentage of people who were
   presented a smaller number of options actually made a purchase.3

   We see the same phenomenon when we compare libraries and
   bookstores. A rational book seeker should prefer the detailed
   classification system used in libraries over the very coarse BISAC
   system used in bookstores. However, many people say that the
   detailed system makes them work too hard, leading to calls that new
   libraries adopt the bookstore organizing system. (See "The BISAC
   Classification")

   People can avoid making choices if a system proposes or pre-selects
   an option for them that becomes a default choice if they do nothing.
   Often people will make a cursory assessment about how well the
   option satisfies a requirement and if it is good enough they will not
   consider any other alternatives.4

   The study of the limits to human rationality in decision-making is
   the centerpiece of the discipline known as Behavioral Economics.

   Organizing systems should plan for interactions based on non-

4. A comprehensive review of the power of defaults in
   software and other technical systems from the
   perspectives of law, computer science, and behavioral
   economics is (Kesan and Shah 2006)

                                                                   Determining Interactions | 919
purposeful user behavior. A user who does not have a particular
resource need in mind might interact with an organizing system
to see what it contains or to be entertained or educated. Imagine
a user going to a museum to avoid the heat outside. Their
requirement is to be out of the heat and--possibly--to see
interesting things. A visitor to a zoo might go there to view a specific
animal, but most of the time, visitors follow a more or less random
path among the zoo's resources. Similarly, web surfing is random,
non-information-need-driven behavior. This type of requirement
cannot be satisfied by providing search capabilities alone; other
interaction types (e.g., browsing, suggestions) must be provided as
well.

Lastly, not all users are human beings, typing in search queries
or browsing through catalogs. An organizing system should plan
for interaction scenarios where computational agents access the
system via APIs (application programming interfaces), which require
heavily standardized access procedures and resource descriptions
in order to enable interactions.

Socio-Political and Organizational Constraints

An important constraint for interaction design choices is the access
policies imposed by the producers of organizing systems, as already
described in "Access Policies". If resources or their descriptions are
restricted, interactions may not be able to use certain properties
and therefore cannot be supported.

Inter-organizational or socio-political constraints are imposed
when certain parties in an interaction, or even producers of an
organizing system, can exert power over other parties and therefore
control the nature of the interaction (or even the nature of the
resource descriptions). We can distinguish different types of
constraints:

920 | Determining Interactions
Information and economic power asymmetry

      Some organizations are able to impose their requirements for
      interactions and their resource description formats upon their
      clients or customers. For example, Google and Apple each have
      the power to control the extent of interoperability attainable in
      products, services, or applications that utilize their numerous
      platforms through mandated APIs and the process by which
      third-party applications are approved. The asymmetry between
      these dominant players and the myriad of smaller entities
      providing peripheral support, services, or components can
      result in de facto standards that may pose significant burden for
      small businesses and reduce overall competition.

Standards

      Industry-wide or community standards can be essential in
      enabling interoperability between systems, applications, and
      devices. A standard interface describes the data formats and
      protocols to which systems should conform.5 Failure to adhere
      to standards complicates the merging of resources from
      different organizing systems. Challenges to standardization
      include organizational inertia; closed policies, processes, or
      development groups; intellectual property; credentialing; lack
      of specifications; competing standards; high implementation
      costs; lack of conformance metrics; lack of clarity or awareness;
      and abuse of standards as trade barriers.

Public policy

      Beyond businesses and standards-setting organizations, the

5. (von Riegen 2006).

                       Determining Interactions | 921
government sector wields substantial influence over the
implementation and success of possible interactions in
organizing systems. As institutions with large and inalienable
constituents, governments and governmental entities have
similar influences as large businesses due to their size and
substantial impact over society at large. Different forms of
government around the world, ranging from centrally planned
autocracy to loosely organized nation-states, can have far-
reaching consequences in terms of how resource description
policies are designed. Laws and regulations regarding data
privacy prevent organizing systems from recording certain user
data, therefore prohibiting interactions based on this
information.6

6. A good example for the importance of standards and

interoperability rules is E-government. E-government

refers to the ability to deliver government services

through electronic means. These services can range from

government-to-citizen,          government-to-business,

government-to-employees, government-to-government,

and vice-versa (Guijarro 2007), (Scholl 2007). This could

range from a government unit providing a portal where

citizens can apply for a driver's license or file their taxes,

to more complex implementations such as allowing

different government agencies to share certain pertinent

information with one another, such as providing

information on driver's license holders to the police.

Because the government interacts with heterogeneous

entities and their various systems, e-government

planners must consider how to integrate and

922 | Determining Interactions
interoperate with different systems and data models.
Countries belonging to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development(OECD) have continuously
refined their strategies for e-government.

   An example of a highly successful implementation of
a business-to-government implementation is the use of
the Universal Business Language(UBL) by the
Government of Denmark. UBL is a "royalty-free library
of standard electronic XML business documents such as
purchase orders and invoices" [oasis-open.org]. The
Government of Denmark localized these standards, and
mandated all organizations wanting to do business with
the government to use these formats for invoicing. By
automating the matching process between an electronic
order and an electronic invoice, the government expects
total potential savings of about 160 million Euros per year
[UBL case study], thus highlighting the need for a
standard format by which businesses can send in orders
and invoices electronically.

   Recognizing that its position as government entails
that all types of suppliers, big or small, must have equal
opportunity to sell its products and services, the
Government of Denmark not only set data format
standards, it also gave several options by which
information can be exchanged. Paper-based invoices
would be sent to scanning agencies that would scan and
create electronic versions to be submitted to the

          It is easy to take standards for granted, but without
       them our lives would run less smoothly because many
       products and services would not work very well or even
       be dangerous to use. If you search for the phrase "ISO
       Standard" along with almost anything, there is a good
       chance that you will find something. Try "currency,"
       "food," "sunglasses," "tea," "water," "wine," and then a
       few of your own.

Even within the same firm or organization, constraints on
interaction design may result from contradictory policies for
organizing systems or even require the implementation of separate,
disjoint systems that cannot be integrated without additional
investment. Siloed business functions may be resistant to the
merging of resources or resource descriptions in order to gain
competitive advantage or command resources over other business
functions.

Often characterized by different kinds of value contribution,
different policies, processes, and practices, organizational units
must clearly define and prioritize different interaction goals, align
and coordinate processes, and build collaboration capabilities to
achieve a high level of interoperability within the organizing system
or between different organizing systems in the organization.

In addition to information exchange, organizational interoperability

and consumption issues that the government of Denmark

also aims to provide services that are widely available, easily
identifiable, and accessible across the enterprise.

Nevertheless, inter-organizational constraints are inherently less
deterministic than intra-organizational ones, because it is possible
that a decision-maker with broad authority can decide that some
interaction is important enough to warrant the change of
institutional policies, formats, or even category systems. (See
"Institutional Categories".)

          Regulatory Constraints: Right to be Forgotten
          A controversial idea known as the "right to be
       forgotten" gained the force of law in the European
       Union in May 2014 after the EU`s highest court ruled
       that people could ask search engines such as Google,
       which dominates the European market, to remove
       certain kinds of personal information from their search
       results.
          The ruling had its foundations in the EU`s 1995 Data
       Protection Directive, a data retention policy crafted in a
       time before the dominance of the Internet and search
       engines. While many privacy advocates hailed it as a
       victory, others in the technology and media firms have
       decried it as censorship. Either way, it has highlighted
       the need for the European Commission to update and
       modernize its data policy; a proposal has been before
       the European Parliament since 2012, and plans for its
       adoption were underway as of summer 2014. (Source:
       EC fact sheet on the "right to be forgotten" ruling.)

 65. Reorganizing Resources
 for Interactions

   Once the scope and range of interactions is defined according to
   requirements and constraints, the resources and the technology
   of the organizing system have to be arranged to enable the
   implementation of the desired interactions.

   Commonly, interactions are determined at the beginning of a
   development process of the organizing system. It follows that most
   required resource descriptions (which properties of a resource are
   documented in an organizing system) need to be clarified at the
   beginning of the development process as well; that is, resource
   descriptions are determined based on the desired interactions that
   an organizing system should support. Most of these processes have
   been described in detail in Resource Description and Metadata,
   Describing Relationships and Structures and The Forms of Resource
   Descriptions.

   Resources from different organizing systems are often aggregated
   to be accessed within one larger organizing system (warehouses,
   portals, search engines, union catalogs, cross-brand retailers),
   which requires resources and resource descriptions to be
   transformed in order to adapt to the new organizing system with
   its extended interaction requirements.1 Elsewhere, legacy systems

1. Major library system vendors now market so-called
  discovery portals to their customers, which allow
  libraries to integrate their local catalogs with central
  indexes of journal and other full-text databases. The

   926 | Reorganizing Resources for
   Interactions
often need to be updated to accommodate new standards,
technologies, and interactions (e.g, mobile interfaces for digital
libraries). That means that the necessary resources and resource
descriptions for an interaction need to be identified, and, if
necessary, changes have to be made in the description of the
resources. Sometimes, resources are merged or transformed in
order to perform new interactions.

Identifying and Describing Resources for
Interactions

Individual and collection resource descriptions need to be carefully
considered in order to record the necessary information for the
designed interactions. (See The Forms of Resource Descriptions.) The
type of interaction determines whether new properties need to be
derived or computed with the help of external factors and whether
these properties will be represented permanently in the organizing

advantages of discovery portals are the seamless access
for patrons to all the library's electronic materials
(including externally licensed databases) while
maintaining a local and customized look and feel. By
providing out-of-the-box solutions, vendors on the other
hand bind libraries more closely to their products.

(http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/

system (e.g., an extended topical description added due to a user
comment) or created on the fly whenever a transaction is executed
(e.g., a frequency count).

Determining which resources or resource descriptions will be used
in an interaction is simple when all resources are included (e.g., in
a simple search interaction over all resources in a data warehouse).
Sometimes resources need to be identified according to more
selective criteria such as resources exhibiting a certain property
(e.g., all restaurants in your neighborhood with four stars on Yelp in
an advanced search interaction).

Transforming Resources for Interactions

When an organizing system and its interactions are designed with
resources or resource descriptions from legacy systems with
outdated formats or from multiple organizing systems or when the
new organizing systems has a different purpose and requires
different resource properties, resources and their descriptions need
to be transformed. The processing and transformation steps
required to produce the expected modification can be applied at
different layers:

Infrastructure or notation transformation

      When resources are aggregated, the organizing systems must
      have a common basic infrastructure to communicate with one
      another and speak the same language. This means that
      participating systems must have a common set of
      communication protocols and an agreed upon way of

928 | Reorganizing Resources for Interactions
         representing information in digital formats, i.e., a notation
         ("Notations"), such as the Unicode encoding scheme.2

   Writing system transformation

         During a writing system transformation (The Forms of Resource
         Descriptions), the syntax or vocabulary--also called the data
         exchange format--of the resource description will be changed

2. While data encoding describes how information is
   represented, and data exchange formats describe how
   information is structured, communication protocols
   refer to how information is exchanged between systems.
   These protocols dictate how these documents are
   enclosed within messages, and how these messages are
   transmitted across the network. Things such as message
   format, error detection and reporting, security and
   encryption are described and considered. Nowadays,
   there are a number of communication protocols that are
   used over networks, including File Transfer Protocol(FTP),
   Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) commonly used in
   the Internet, Post Office Protocol(POP) commonly used
   for e-mail, and other protocols under the Transmission
   Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP) suite.
   Different product manufacturers normally also have
   more proprietary protocols that they employ, including
   Apple Computer Protocols Suite and Cisco Protocols. In
   addition, different types of networks would also have
   corresponding protocols, including Mobile Wireless
   Protocols and such.

                                             Reorganizing Resources for Interactions | 929
    to conform to another model, e.g., when library records are

    mapped from the MARC21 standard to the Dublin Core format

    in order to be aggregated, or when information in a business

    information system is transformed into an EDI or XML format
    so that it can be sent to another firm.3 Sometimes customized

3. Electronic Data Interchange(EDI), is used to exchange

formatted messages between computers or systems.

Organizations use this format to conduct business

transactions electronically without human intervention,

such as in sending and receiving purchase orders or

exchange invoice information and such. There are four

main standards that have been developed for EDI,

including the UN/EDIFACT standard recommended by

the United Nations(UN), ANSI ASC X12 standard widely

used in the US, TRADACOMS standard that is widely used

in the UK, and the ODETTE standard used in the

European automotive industry. These standards include

formats for a wide range of business activities, such as

shipping notices, fund transfers, and the like. EDI

messages are highly formatted, with the meaning of the

information being transmitted being highly dependent

on its position in the document. For instance, a line in

an  EDI  document                              with

BEG*00*NE*MOG009364501**950910*CSW11096^ corresponds

to a line in the X12 standard for Purchase Orders

(standard 850). "BEG" specifies the start of a Purchase

Order Transaction Set. The asterisk (*) symbol delineates

between items in the line, with each value corresponding

930 | Reorganizing Resources for Interactions
      vocabularies are used to represent certain types of properties.
      These vocabularies were probably introduced to reduce errors
      or ambiguity or abbreviate common organizational resource
      properties. These customized vocabularies need to be
      explained and agreed upon by organizations combining
      resources to prevent interoperability problems.

Semantic transformation

      Agreeing on a category or classification system (Categorization:
      Describing Resource Classes and Types & Classification:
      Assigning Resources to Categories) is crucial so that organizing
      systems agree semantically--that is, so that resource properties
      and descriptions share not only technology but also meaning.
      For example, because the US Census has often changed its
      system of race categories, it is difficult to compare data from

to a particular field or information component described
in the standard. "NE," for example, corresponds to the
Purchase Order Type Code, which in this instance is
"New Order." As can be seen in the example, the
description of the information being transmitted is not
readily available within the document. Instead, parties
exchanging the information must agree on these formats
beforehand, and need to ensure that the information
instance is at the right position within the document so
that the receiving party can correctly interpret it.

         different censuses without some semantic transformation to
         align the categories.4
   Resource or resource description transformation

         Resources or resource descriptions are often directly
         transformed, as when they are converted to another file format.
         In computer-based interactions like search engines, text
         resources are often pre-processed to remove some of the
         ambiguity inherent in natural language. These steps,
         collectively called text processing, include decoding, filtering,
         normalization, stopword elimination, and stemming. (See the
         sidebar, Text Processing)

              Text Processing
              Decoding

                    A digital resource is first a sequence of bits.
                 Decoding transforms those bits into characters
                 according to the encoding scheme used, extracting
                 the text from its stored form. (See "Notations".)
              Filtering

                    If a text is encapsulated by formatting or non-
                 semantic markup, these characters are removed
                 because this information is rarely used as the basis
                 of further interactions.

4. This and more examples for difficult categorizations can
   be found in: (Bowker and Star 2000).

    932 | Reorganizing Resources for Interactions
Tokenization

      Segments the stream of characters (in an
   encoding scheme, a space is also a character) into
   textual components, usually words. In English, a
   simple rule-based system can separate words using
   spaces. However, punctuation makes things more
   complicated. For example, periods at the end of
   sentences should be removed, but periods in
   numbers should not. Other languages introduce
   other problems for tokenization; in Chinese, a space
   does not mark the divisions between individual
   concepts.

Normalization

      Normalization removes superficial differences in
   character sequences, for example, by transforming
   all capitalized characters into lower-case. More
   complicated normalization operations include the
   removal of accents, hyphens, or diacritics and
   merging different forms of acronyms (e.g., U.N. and
   UN are both normalized to UN).

Stopword elimination

      Stopwords are those words in a language that
   occur very frequently and are not very semantically
   expressive. Stopwords are usually articles,
   pronouns, prepositions, or conjunctions. Since they
   occur in every text, they can be removed because
   they cannot distinguish them. Of course, in some
   cases, removing stopwords might remove

                             Reorganizing Resources for Interactions | 933
                 semantically important phrases (e.g., "To be or not
                 to be").

              Stemming
                    These processing steps normalize inflectional and

                 derivational variations in terms, e.g., by removing
                 the "-ed" from verbs in the past tense. This
                 homogenization can be done by following rules
                 (stemming) or by using dictionaries (lemmatization).
                 Rule-based stemming algorithms are easy to
                 implement, but can result in wrongly normalized
                 word groups, for example when "university" and
                 "universe" are both stemmed to "univers."

  Transforming Resources from Multiple or Legacy Organizing
  Systems

   The traditional approach to enabling heterogeneous organizing
   systems to be accessed together has been to fully integrate them,
   which has allowed the "unrestricted sharing of data and business
   processes among any connected applications and data sources" in
   the organization.5 This can be a strategic approach to improving the
   management of resources, resource descriptions, and organizing
   systems as a whole, especially when organizations have disparate
   systems and redundant information spread across different groups

5. (Linthicum 1999).

    934 | Reorganizing Resources for Interactions
   and departments. However, it can also be a costly approach, as
   integration points may be numerous, with vastly different
   technologies needed to get one system to integrate with another.
   Maintenance also becomes an issue, as changes in one system may
   entail changes in all systems integrating with it.6

6. Allowing unrestricted access to data and business
   processes also becomes a problem when working across
   organizations. Fully integrating systems between two
   companies, for instance, may entail the exposure of
   business intelligence and information that should be kept
   private. This type of exposure is too much for most
   businesses, regardless of whether the relationship with
   the other business is collaborative rather than
   competitive. There are security issues to be considered,
   as collaborating organizations would need to access
   private networks and secure servers. The heterogeneity
   in supporting organizing systems along with the need to
   quickly evolve with the rapid changes in an organization's
   competitive and collaborative environment has pushed
   organizations to shift from more vertical, isolated
   structures to a more loosely coupled, ecosystem
   paradigm This has led to more componentized and
   modularized systems that need only to exchange
   information or transform resources when an interaction
   requires it.

   The emerging paradigm then is to enable independent
   systems to interoperate, or to have "the ability of two or

                                              Reorganizing Resources for Interactions | 935
   Planning the transformation of resources from different organizing
   systems to be merged in an aggregation is called data mapping or
   alignment. In this process, aspects of the description layers (most
   often writing system or semantics) are compared and matched
   between two or more organizing systems. The relationship between
   each component may be unidirectional or bidirectional.7 In

  more systems or components to exchange information
  and to use the information that has been exchanged."
  Because the focus is in the exchange of resources or
  resource descriptions, independent systems need not
  necessarily know other systems' underlying logic or
  implementation, for example, how they store resources.
  What is important is knowing what kind of resource is
  expected and in what format (notation, writing system,
  semantics), and what kind of information is returned for
  a particular. This is a strategic approach to exchanging
  resources, as systems can remain highly independent of
  each other. Changes in one system need not necessarily
  affect how other systems work as long as the information
  that is sent and received through an interface stays the
  same. This allows greater adaptability, as changes to
  system logic or business processes can be done in self-
  contained modules without necessarily affecting others.
  The transformation then happens in an intermediate
  space where the agreements on resource descriptions
  are fixed.

7. To illustrate the difference between a unidirectional and

   936 | Reorganizing Resources for Interactions
addition, resource properties and values that are semantically

bidirectional map, consider two systems, the

Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical

Terms(SNOMED-CT) and the International Classification

of  Diseases,  Tenth      Revision,      Clinical

Modification(ICD-10-CM).

SNOMED-CT is a medical language system for clinical

terminology maintained by the International Health

Terminology    Standards                 Development

Organization(IHTSDO) and a designated electronic

exchange standard for clinical health information for US

Federal Government systems (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/

research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html).

The ICD-10-CM, on the other hand, is an international
diagnostic classification system for general
epidemiological, health management, and clinical use
maintained by the World Health Organization(WHO) and
used for coding and classifying morbidity data from
inpatient/outpatient records, physicians offices, and
most National Center for Health Statistics(NCHS) surveys
(http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/).

Because many different SNOMED-CT concepts can be
mapped to a single ICD-9-CM code, a map in this
direction cannot be used in reverse without introducing
confusion and ambiguity.

                                         Reorganizing Resources for Interactions | 937
     equivalent might have different names (the vocabulary problem of
     "The Vocabulary Problem"). The purpose of mapping may vary from
     allowing simple exchanges of resource descriptions, to enabling
     access to longitudinal data, to facilitating standardized reporting.8
     The preservation of version histories of resource description
     elements and relations in both systems is vital for verifying the
     validity of the data map.

     Similar to mapping, a straightforward approach to transformation
     is the use of crosswalks, which are equivalence tables that relate
     resource description elements, semantics, and writing systems
     from one organizing system to those of another.9 Crosswalks not
     only enable systems with different resource descriptions to
     interchange information in real-time, but are also used by third-
     party systems, such as harvesters and search engines to generate
     union catalogs and perform queries on multiple systems as if they
     were one consolidated system.10

     In the digital library space, WorldCat allows users to access many
     library databases to locate items in their community libraries and,
     depending on patron privileges, to request items through their local
     libraries from libraries all over the world. For this powerful tool to
     accurately locate holdings in each library, two resource description
     standards are involved. At the book publisher, wholesaler, and
     retailer end, the international standard Online Information
     Exchange(ONIX) is used to standardize books and serials metadata

 9. (NISO 2004).

    http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june06/chan/06chan.html.

      938 | Reorganizing Resources for Interactions
     throughout the supply chain.11 ONIX is implemented in book
     suppliers' internal and customer-facing information systems to
     track products and to facilitate the generation of advance
     information sheets and supplier catalogs.12 At the library end, the
     Machine-Readable Cataloging(MARC) formats manage and
     communicate bibliographic and related information.13 When a
     member library acquires a title, information in ONIX format is sent
     from the supplier to the Online Computer Library Center(OCLC)
     where it is matched with a corresponding MARC record in the
     WorldCat database by using an ONIX to MARC crosswalk.14 This
     enables WorldCat to provide accurate real-time holdings
     information of its member libraries.

     As the number of organizing systems increases, crosswalks and
     mappings become increasingly impractical if each pair of organizing
     systems requires a separate crosswalk. A more efficient approach
     would be the use of one vocabulary or format as a switching
     mechanism (also called a pivot or hub language) for all other
     vocabularies to map towards.15 Another possibility, which is often

used in asymmetric power relationships between organizing
systems, is to force all systems to adhere to the format that is used
by the most powerful party.

Modes of Transformation

The conceptual relationships between different descriptions can be
mapped out manually when creating simple maps. This, however,
becomes more difficult as maps become more complex, due to
the number of properties being mapped or when there are more
structural or granularity issues to consider.
The use of automatic tools to create these alignments become vital
in ensuring their accuracy and robustness. Graphical mapping tools
provide users with a graphical user interface to connect description
elements from source to target by drawing a line from one to the

standards, including Machine-Readable Cataloging/
Anglo-American Cataloging Rules(MARC) and Dublin
Core(DC). In this instance, the "Creation Date" element in
CDWA is mapped to "260c Imprint -- Date of Publication,
Distribution, etc." in MARC/AACR and to "Date.Created"
in DC. Although this creates a two-step look-up in real-
time, a direct mapping of this element from MARC/AACR
to DC is no longer necessary for systems to interoperate.

940 | Reorganizing Resources for Interactions
     other.16 Other tools perform automatic mappings based on
     predetermined rules and criteria.17

16. More commonly, graphical data mapping tools are
    included in an extract, transform, and load (ETL)
    database suite that provides additional powerful data
    transformation capabilities. Whereas data mapping is the
    first step in capturing the relationships between different
    systems, data transformation entails code generation
    that uses the resulting maps to produce an executable
    transformational program that converts the source data
    into target format. ETL databases extract the information
    needed from the outside sources, transform these into
    information that can be used by the target system using
    the necessary data mappings, and then loads it into the
    end system.

17. Languages such as XSLT and Turing eXtender
    Language(TXL) facilitate the ease of data transformation
    while various commercial data warehousing tools provide
    varying functionalities such as single/multiple source
    acquisition, data cleansing, and statistical and analytical
    capabilities. Based on XML, XSLT is a declarative language
    designed for transforming XML documents into other
    documents. For example, XSLT can be used to convert
    XML data into HTML documents for web display or PDF
    for print or screen display. XSLT processing entails taking
    an input document in XML format and one or more XSLT

     We often perform manual run-time transformations for decisions
     that require consulting more than one organizing system in our
     daily lives. For example, when planning a vacation, we use a variety
     of systems to negotiate a wide set of ad hoc requirements such as
     our resources and time, our fellow travelers and their availability,
     and the bookings for hotel and transportation, as well as desirable
     destinations and their various offerings. We somehow reconcile the
     different descriptions used in each of the systems and match these
     against each other so that the relevant information can be combined
     and compared. Even though the systems use different formats,
     vocabularies and structures, they are targeted toward human users
     and are relatively easy to interpret. For automatic run-time
     transformations, which need to be handled computationally,
     designers face the challenge of creating more structured processes
     for merging information from different systems.18

     The time of the transformation--at design time when organizing
     system resources are merged, or at run time when a certain
     interaction is performed-- depends on the nature of the
     collaboration between organizing systems. Design-time
     transformations depend on highly cooperative environments where
     specific design requirements (like mapping rules and criteria) can
     be negotiated ahead of the system implementation. In cases where
     high-flexibility, ad hoc or real-time transformations would not be
     possible due to a lack of cooperation (such as the ShopStyle.com),
     run-time transformation processes may provide appropriate
     alternatives. Some low-level incompatibilities between organizing
     systems, such as the presence of syntactical, encoding, and

    style sheets through a template-processing engine to
    produce a new document.

18. (Carney et al. 2005).

     942 | Reorganizing Resources for Interactions
     particular structural and content issues, can also be rectified by
     implementing run-time transformation techniques, creating more
     loosely-coupled interoperating systems.

   Granularity and Abstraction

     Within writing system and semantic transformations, issues of
     granularity and level of abstraction ("Determining the Scope and
     Focus" and "Category Abstraction and Granularity") pose the most
     challenges to cross-organizing system interoperability.19
     Granularity refers to the level of detail or precision for a specific
     information resource property. For instance, the postal address of
     a particular location might be represented as several different data
     items, including the number, street name, city, state, country and
     postal code (a high-granularity model). It might also be represented
     in one single line including all of the information above (a low-
     granularity model). While it is easy to create the complete address
     by aggregating the different information components from the high-
     granularity model, it is not as easy to decompose the low-
     granularity model into more specific information components.

     This does not mean, however, that a high-granularity model is
     always the best choice, especially if the context of use does not
     require it, as there are corresponding tradeoffs in terms of
     efficiency and speed in assembling and processing the resource
     information. (See the sidebar, AccuWeather Request Granularity)

     The level of abstraction is the degree to which a resource
     description is abstracted from the concrete use case in order to fit

19. For an in-depth discussion of interoperability challenges,
    see Chapter 6 of (Glushko and McGrath 2005).

     a wider range of resources. For example, many countries have an
     address field called state, but in some countries, a similar regional
     division is called province. In order to accommodate both concepts,
     we can abstract from the original concrete concepts and establish a
     more abstract description of administrative region. Granularity and
     abstraction differences can occur at every resource property layer
     when resources need to be transformed; therefore, they need to be
     recognized and analyzed at every layer.

                AccuWeather Request Granularity
                Requests for AccuWeather data have exploded in the
             last years, due to automated requests from mobile
             devices to keep weather apps updated. The company
             has dealt with this challenge by truncating the GPS
             coordinates sent by the mobile device when it requests
             weather data (a transformation to lower granularity). If
             the request with the truncated coordinates is identical
             to one recently made, a cached version of the content is
             served, resulting in 300 million to 500 million fewer
             requests a day.20

    Accuracy of Transformations

     Automatic mapping tools can only be as accurate as the
     specifications and criteria that are included in the mapping
     guidelines. Intellectual checks and tests performed by humans are
     almost always necessary to validate the accuracy of the

20. (AT&T 2011).

      944 | Reorganizing Resources for Interactions
     transformation. Because description systems vary in expressive
     power and complexity, challenges to transformations may arise
     from differences in semantic definitions, rules regarding whether
     an element is required or requires multiple values, hierarchical or
     value constraints, and controlled vocabularies.21 As a result of these
     complexities, absolute transformations that ensure exact mappings
     will result in a loss of precision if the source description system is
     substantially richer than the target system.

     In practice, relative crosswalks where all elements in a source
     description are mapped to at least one target, regardless of
     semantic equivalence, are often implemented. This lowers the
     quality and accuracy of the mapping and can result in "down
     translation" or "dumbing down" of the system for resource
     description. As a result of mapping compromises due to different
     granularity or abstraction levels, transformations from different
     organizing systems usually result in less granular or specific
     resource descriptions. Consequently, whereas some interactions
     are now enabled (e.g., cross-organizing system search), others that
     were once possible can no longer be supported. For example,
     conflating geographical and person subject fields from one system
     (e.g., geographical subject = Alberta, person subject = Virginia) to a
     joint subject field (e.g. subject = Alberta, Virginia) to transform to the
     resource description of another system does not allow for searches
     that distinguish between these specific categories anymore.

               Stop and Think: Dumbing Down
               Can you think of an example where resource

       description elements from one system are available for
       interaction in another due to a transformation, where
       the target system does not retain all the details of the
       descriptions in the source?

66. Implementing
Interactions

The next sections describe some common interactions in digital
organizing systems. One way to distinguish among them is to
consider the source of the algorithms that are used in order to
perform them. We can mostly distinguish information retrieval
interactions (e.g., search and browse), machine learning interactions
(e.g., cluster, classify, extract) or natural language processing
interactions (e.g., named entity recognition, summarization,
sentiment analysis, anaphoric resolution). Another way to
distinguish among interactions is to note whether resources are
changed during the interaction (e.g., annotate, tag, rate, comment)
or unchanged (search, cluster). Yet another way would be to
distinguish interactions based on their absolute and relative
complexity, i.e., on the progression of actions or steps that are
needed to complete the interaction. Here, we will distinguish
interactions based on the different resource description layers they
act upon.

Activities in Organizing Systems, introduced the concept of
affordance or behavioral repertoire--the inherent actionable
properties that determine what can be done with resources. We will
now look at affordances (and constraints) that resource properties
pose for interaction design. The interactions that an individual
resource can support depend on the nature and extent of its
inherent and described properties and internal structure. However,
the interactions that can be designed into an organizing system can
be extended by utilizing collection properties, derived properties,
and any combination thereof. These three types of resource
properties can be thought of as creating layers because they build
on each other.

                                                            Implementing Interactions | 947
The further an organizing system moves up the layers, the more
functional capabilities are enabled and more interactions can be
designed. The degree of possible interactions is determined by the
extent of the properties that are organized, described, and created
in an organizing system. This marks a correlation between the
extent of organization and the range of possible interactions: The
more extensive the organization and the number of identifiable
resource properties, the larger the universe of "affordable"
interactions.

Interactions can be distinguished by four layers:

Interactions based on properties of individual resources

      Resource properties have been described extensively in
      Resources in Organizing Systems and Resource Description and
      Metadata. Any information or property that describes the
      resource itself can be used to design an interaction. If a
      property is not described in an organizing system or does not
      pertain to certain resources, an interaction that needs this
      information cannot be implemented. For example, a retail site
      like Shopstyle cannot offer to reliably search by color of
      clothing if this property is not contained in the resource
      description.

Interactions based on collection properties

      Collection-based properties are created when resources are
      aggregated. (See Foundations for Organizing Systems.) An
      interaction that compares individual resources to a collection
      average (e.g., average age of publications in a library or average
      price of goods in a retail store) can only be implemented if the
      collection average is calculated.

Interactions based on derived or computed properties

      Derived or computed properties are not inherent in the

948 | Implementing Interactions
      resources or collections but need to be computed with the
      help of external information or tools. The popularity of a digital
      resource can be computed based on the frequency of its use,
      for example. This computed property could then be used to
      design an access interaction that searches resources based on
      their popularity. An important use case for derived properties
      is the analysis of non-textual resources like images or audio
      files. For these content-based interactions, intrinsic properties
      of the resources like color distributions are computationally
      derived and stored as resource properties. A search can then
      be performed on color distributions (e.g., a search for outdoor
      nature images could return resources that have a high
      concentration of blue in the upper half and a high
      concentration of green on the bottom: a meadow on a sunny
      day).

Interactions based on combining resources

      Combining resources and their individual, collection or derived
      properties can be used to design interactions based on joint
      properties that a single organizing system and its resources
      do not contain. This can lead to interactions that individual
      organizing systems with their particular purposes and resource
      descriptions cannot offer.

Whether a desired interaction can be implemented depends on the
layers of resource properties that have been incorporated into the
organizing system. How an interaction is implemented (especially
in digital organizing systems) depends also on the algorithms and
technologies available to access the resources or resource
descriptions.

In our examples, we write primarily about textual resources or
resource descriptions. Information retrieval of physical goods (e.g.,
finding a favorite cookie brand in the supermarket) or non-textual
multimedia digital resources (e.g., finding images of the UC Berkeley

                                                            Implementing Interactions | 949
logo) involves similar interactions, but with different algorithms and
different resource properties.

Interactions Based on Instance Properties

Interactions in this category depend only on the properties of
individual resource instances. Often, using resource properties on
this lower layer coincides with basic action combinations in the
interaction.

Boolean Retrieval

In a Boolean search, a query is specified by stating the information
need and using operators from Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) to
combine the components. The query is compared to individual
resource properties (most often terms), where the result of the
comparison is either TRUE or FALSE. The TRUE results are returned
as a result of the query, and all other results are ignored. A Boolean
search does not compare or rank resources so every returned
resource is considered equally relevant. The advantage of the
Boolean search is that the results are predictable and easy to
explain. However, because the results of the Boolean model are not

950 | Implementing Interactions
   ranked by relevance, users have to sift through all the returned
   resource descriptions in order to find the most useful results.12

  Tag / Annotate

   A tagging or annotation interaction allows a user (either a human
   or a computational agent) to add information to the resource itself
   or the resource descriptions. A typical tagging or annotation
   interaction locates a resource or resource description and lets the

1. Each of the four information retrieval models discussed
   in the chapter has different combinations of the
   comparing, ranking, and location activities. Boolean and
   vector space models compare the description of the
   information need with the description of the information
   resource. Vector space and probabilistic models rank the
   information resource in the order that the resource can
   satisfy the user's query. Structure-based search locates
   information using internal or external structure of the
   information resource.

2. Our discussion of information retrieval models in this
   chapter does not attempt to address information
   retrieval at the level of theoretical and technical detail
   that informs work and research in this field (Manning
   et al. 2008), (Croft et al. 2009). Instead, our goal is to
   introduce IR from a more conceptual perspective,
   highlighting its core topics and problems using the
   vocabulary and principles of IO as much as possible.

                                                                 Implementing Interactions | 951
   user add their chosen resource property. The resulting changes
   are stored in the organizing system and can be made available for
   other interactions (e.g., when additional tags are used to improve
   the search). An interaction that adds information from users can
   also enhance the quality of the system and improve its usability.3

  Interactions Based on Collection Properties

   Interactions in this category utilize collection-level properties in
   order to improve the interaction, for example, to improve the
   ranking in a search or to enable comparison to collection averages.

  Ranked Retrieval with Vector Space or Probabilistic Models

   Ranked retrieval sorts the results of a search according to their
   relevance with respect to the information need expressed in a
   query. The Vector Space and Probabilistic approaches introduced
   here use individual resource properties like term occurrence or
   term frequency in a resource and collection averages of terms and
   their frequencies to calculate the rank of a resource for a query.4
   The simplicity of the Boolean model makes it easy to understand
   and implement, but its binary notion of relevance does not fit our
   intuition that terms differ in how much they suggest what a
   document is about. Gerard Salton invented the vector space model

3. A good discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of
   tagging in the library field can be found in (Furner 2007).

4. (Manning et al. 2008), Ch. 1.

    952 | Implementing Interactions
of information retrieval to enable a continuous measure of
relevance.5 In the vector space model, each resource and query in
an organizing system is represented as a vector of terms. Resources
and queries are compared by comparing the directions of vectors
in an n-dimensional space (as many dimensions as terms in the
collection), with the assumption is that "closeness in space" means
"closeness in meaning."

In contrast to the vector space model, the underlying idea of the
probabilistic model is that given a query and a resource or resource
description (most often a text), probability theory is used to
estimate how likely it is that a resource is relevant to an information
need. A probabilistic model returns a list of resources that are
ranked by their estimated probability of relevance with respect to
the information need so that the resource with the highest
probability to be relevant is ranked highest. In the vector space
model, by comparison, the resource whose term vector is most
similar to a query term vector (based on frequency counts) is ranked
highest.6

Both models utilize an intrinsic resource property called the term
frequency (tf). For each term, term frequency (tf) measures how
many times the term appears in a resource. It is intuitive that term
frequency itself has an ability to summarize a resource. If a term
such as "automobile" appears frequently in a resource, we can
assume that one of the topics discussed in the resource is

5. Salton was generally viewed as the leading researcher in
   information retrieval for the last part of the 20th century
   until he died in 1995. The vector model was first
   described in (Salton, Wong, and Yang 1975).

                                  Implementing Interactions | 953
automobiles and that a query for "automobile" should retrieve this
resource. Another problem with the term frequency measure
occurs when resource descriptions have different lengths (a very
common occurrence in organizing systems). In order to compensate
for different resource description lengths that would bias the term
frequency count and the calculated relevance towards longer
documents, the length of the term vectors are normalized as a
percentage of the description length rather than a raw count.

Relying solely on term frequency to determine the relevance of a
resource for a query has a drawback: if a term occurs in all resources
in a collection it cannot distinguish resources. For example, if every
resource discusses automobiles, all resources are potentially
relevant for an "automobile" query. Hence, there should be an
additional mechanism that penalize a term appearing in too many
resources. This is done with inverse document frequency, which
signals how often a term or property occurs in a collection.

Inverse document frequency (idf) is a collection-level property. The
document frequency (df) is the number of resources containing a
particular term. The inverse document frequency (idf) for a term
is defined as idft = log(N/dft), where N is the total number of
documents. The inverse document frequency of a term decreases
the more documents contain the term, providing a discriminating
factor for the importance of terms in a query. For example, in a
collection containing resources about automobiles, an information
retrieval interaction can handle a query for "automobile accident"
by lowering the importance of "automobile" and increasing the
importance of "accident" in the resources that are selected as result
set.

As a first step of a search, resource descriptions are compared
with the terms in the query. In the vector space model, a metric
for calculating similarities between resource description and query
vectors combining the term frequency and the inverse document

954 | Implementing Interactions
   frequency is used to rank resources according to their relevance
   with respect to the query.7

   The probability ranking principle is mathematically and
   theoretically better motivated than the vector space ranking
   principle. However, multiple methods have been proposed to
   estimate the probability of relevance. Well-known probabilistic
   retrieval methods are Okapi BM25, language models (LM) and
   divergence from randomness models (DFR).8 Although these models
   vary in their estimations of the probability of relevance for a given
   resource and differ in their mathematical complexity, intrinsic
   properties of resources like term frequency and collection-level
   properties like inverse document frequency and others are used for
   these calculations.

  Synonym Expansion with Latent Semantic Indexing

   Latent semantic indexing is a variation of the vector space model
   where a mathematical technique known as singular value
   decomposition is used to combine similar term vectors into a
   smaller number of vectors that describe their "statistical center."
   9 This method is based mostly on collection-level properties like
   co-occurrence of terms in a collection. Based on the terms that
   occur in all resources in a collection, the method calculates which

   and references on the vector space model.

                                                                Implementing Interactions | 955
     terms might be synonyms of each other or otherwise related. Put
     another way, latent semantic indexing groups terms into topics. Let
     us say the terms "roses" and "flowers" often occur together in the
     resources of a particular collection. The latent semantic indexing
     methodology recognizes statistically that these terms are related,
     and replaces the representations of the "roses" and "flower" terms
     with a computed "latent semantic" term that captures the fact that
     they are related, reducing the dimensionality of resource
     description (see "Vocabulary Control as Dimensionality Reduction").
     Since queries are translated into the same set of components, a
     query for "roses" will also retrieve resources that mention "flower."
     This increases the chance of a resource being found relevant to
     a query even if the query terms do not match the resource
     description terms exactly; the technique can therefore improve the
     quality of search.

     Latent semantic indexing has been shown to be a practical
     technique for estimating the substitutability or semantic
     equivalence of words in larger text segments, which makes it
     effective in information retrieval, text categorization, and other NLP
     applications like question answering. In addition, some people view
     it as a model of the computational processes and representations
     underlying substantial portions of how knowledge is acquired and
     used, because latent semantic analysis techniques produces
     measures of word-word, word-passage, and passage-passage
     relations that correlate well with human cognitive judgments and
     phenomena involving association or semantic similarity. These
     situations include vocabulary tests, rate of vocabulary learning,
     essay tests, prose recall, and analogical reasoning.10

     Another approach for increasing the quality of search is to add
     similar terms or properties to a query from a controlled vocabulary

10. See (Dumais 2003).

      956 | Implementing Interactions
    or classification system. When a query can be mapped to terms
    in the controlled vocabulary or classes in the classification, the
    inherent semantic structure of the vocabulary or classification can
    suggest additional terms (broader, narrower, synonymous) whose
    occurrence in resources can signal their relevance for a query.

   Structure-Based Retrieval

    When the internal structure of a resource is represented in its
    resource description a search interaction can use the structure to
    retrieve more specific parts of a resource. This enables parametric
    or zone searching, where a particular component or resource
    property can be searched while all other properties are
    disregarded.11 For example, a search for "Shakespeare" in the title
    field in a bibliographic organizing system will only retrieve books
    with Shakespeare in the title, not as an author. Because all resources
    use the same structure, this structure is a collection-level property.

    A common structure-based retrieval technique is the search in
    relational databases with Structured Query Language(SQL). With
    the help of tools to facilitate selection and transformation,
    particular tables and fields in tables and in many combination or
    with various constraints can be applied to yield highly precise
    results.

    A format like XML enables structured resource descriptions and is
    therefore very suitable for search and for structured navigation and
    retrieval. XPath (see "Structural Relationships within a Resource")
    describes how individual parts of XML documents can be reached
    within the internal structure. XML Query Language(XQuery), a

                                                                 Implementing Interactions | 957
structure-based retrieval language for XML, executes queries that
can fulfill both topical and structural constraints in XML documents.
For example, a query can be expressed for documents containing
the word "apple" in text, and where "apple" is also mentioned in a
title or subtitle, or in a glossary of terms.

Clustering / Classification

Clustering ("Categories Created by Clustering") and computational
classification ("Key Points in Chapter Eight") are both interactions
that use individual and collection-level resource properties to
execute their operation. During clustering (unsupervised learning),
all resources are compared and grouped with respect to their
similarity to each other. During computational classification
(supervised learning), an individual resource or a group of resources
is compared to a given classification or controlled vocabulary in an
organizing system and the resource is assigned to the most similar
class or descriptor. Another example for a classification interaction
is spam detection. (See "Key Points in Chapter Eight".) Author
identification or characterization algorithms attempt to determine
the author of a given work (a classification interaction) or to
characterize the type of author that has or should write a work (a
clustering interaction).

Interactions Based on Derived Properties

Interactions in this category derive or compute properties or
features that are not inherent to the resources themselves or the
collection. External data sources, services, and tools are employed
to support these interactions. Building interactions with
conditionality based on externally derived properties usually

958 | Implementing Interactions
increases the quality of the interactions by increasing the system's
context awareness.

            sensors to analyze shopper activity in retail stores and

            traffic and which items customers interact with most.

   Popularity-Based Retrieval

     Google's PageRank (see "Structural Relationships between
     Resources") is the most well-known popularity measure for
     websites.12 The basic idea of PageRank is that a website is as popular
     as the number of links referencing the website. The actual
     calculation of a website's PageRank involves more sophisticated
     mathematics than counting the number of in-links, because the
     source of links is also important. Links that come from quality
     websites contribute more to a website's PageRank than other links,
     and links to qualitatively low websites will hurt a website's
     PageRank.
     An information retrieval model for web pages can now use PageRank
     to determine the value of a web page with respect to a query.
     Google and other web search engines use many different ranking
     features to determine the final rank of a web page for any search,
     PageRank as a popularity measure is only one of them.

12. (Page et al. 1999).

     960 | Implementing Interactions
Other popularity measures can be used to rank resources. For
example, frequency of use, buying frequency for retail goods, the
number of laundry cycles a particular piece of clothing has gone
through, and even whether it is due for a laundry cycle right now.

Citation-Based Retrieval

Citation-based retrieval is a sophisticated and highly effective
technique employed within bibliographic information systems.
Bibliographic resources are linked to each other by citations, that is,
when one publication cites another. When a bibliographic resource
is referenced by another resource, those two resources are
probably thematically related. The idea of citation-based search is
to use a known resource as the information need and retrieve other
resources that are related by citation.

Citation-based search can be implemented by directly following
citations from the original resource or to find resources that cite
the original resource. Another comparison technique is the
principle of bibliographic coupling, where the information retrieval
system looks for other resources that cite the same resources as
the original resource. Citation-based search results can also be
ranked, for example, by the number of in-citations a publication has
received (the PageRank popularity measure actually derives from
this principle).

Translation

During translation, resources are transformed into another
language, with varying degrees of success. In contrast to the
transformations that are performed in order to merge resources
from different organizing systems to prepare them for further
interactions, a translation transforms the resource after it has been

                                                            Implementing Interactions | 961
retrieved or located. Dictionaries or parallel corpora are external
resources that drive a translation.

During a dictionary-based translation, every individual term
(sometimes phrases) in a resource description is looked up in a
dictionary and replaced with the most likely translation. This is
a simple translation, as it cannot take grammatical sentence
structures or context into account. Context can have an important
impact on the most likely translation: the French word avocat
should be translated into lawyer in most organizing systems, but
probably not in a cookbook collection, in which it is the avocado
fruit.

Parallel corpora are a way to overcome many of these challenges.
Parallel corpora are the same or similar texts in different languages.
The Bible or the protocols of United Nations(UN) meetings are
popular examples because they exist in parallel in many different
languages. A machine learning algorithm can learn from these
corpora to derive which phrases and other grammatical structures
can be translated in which contexts. This knowledge can then be
applied to further resource translation interactions.

Interactions Based on Combining Resources

Interactions in this category combine resources mostly from
different organizing systems to provide services that a single
organizing system could not enable. Sometimes different organizing
systems with related resources are created on purpose in order to
protect the privacy of personal information or to protect business
interests. Releasing organizing systems to the public can have
unwanted consequences when clever developers detect the
potential of connecting previously unrelated data sources.

962 | Implementing Interactions
Mash-Ups

A mash-up combines data from several resources, which enables
an interaction to present new information that arises from the
combination.13 For example, housing advertisements have been
combined with crime statistics on maps to graphically identify

Mash-ups are usually ad-hoc combinations at the resource level
and therefore do not impact the "mashed-up" organizing systems'
internal structures or vocabularies; they can be an efficient
instrument for rapid prototyping on the web. On the other hand,

     fail in its operation as soon as the underlying organizing systems
     change.

   Linked Data Retrieval and Resource Discovery

     In "The Semantic Web World", linked data relates resources among
     different organizing system technologies via standardized and
     unique identifiers (URIs). This simple approach connects resources
     from different systems with each other so that a cross-system
     search is possible.14 For example, two different online retailers
     selling a Martha Stewart bedspread can link to a website describing
     the bedspread on the Martha Stewart website. Both retailers use the
     same unique identifier for the bedspread, which leads back to the
     Martha Stewart site.
     Resource discovery or linked data retrieval are search interactions
     that traverse the network (or semantic web graph) via connecting
     links in order to discover semantically related resources. A search
     interaction could therefore use the link from one retailer to the
     Martha Stewart website to discover the other retailer, which might
     have a cheaper or more convenient offer.

67. Evaluating Interactions

Managing the quality of an interaction with respect to its intent
or goal is a crucial part of every step from design through
implementation and especially during operation. Evaluating the
quality of interactions at different times in the design process
(design concept, prototype, implementation, and operation) reveals
both strengths and weaknesses to the designers or operators of the
organizing system.

During the design and implementation stages, interactions need
to be tested against the original goals of the interaction and the
constraints that are imposed by the organizing system, its resources
and external conditions. It is very common for processes in
interactions to be tweaked or tuned to better comply with the
original goals and intentions for the interaction. Evaluation during
these stages often attempts to provide a calculable way to measure
this compliance and supports the fine-tuning process. It should be
an integral part of an iterative design process.

During the later implementation and operation stages, interactions
are evaluated with respect to the dynamically changing conditions
of the organizing system and its environment. User expectations
as well as environmental conditions or constraints can change and
need to be checked periodically. A systematic evaluation of
interactions ensures that changes that affect an interaction are
observed early and can be integrated in order to adjust and even
improve the interaction. At these stages, more subjective evaluation
aspects like satisfaction, experience, reputation, or "feel" also play
a role in fine-tuning the interactions. This subjective part of the
evaluation process is as important as the quantitative, objective
part. Many factors during the design and implementation processes
need to be considered and made to work together. Ongoing quality
evaluation and feedback ensures that interactions work as intended.

966 | Evaluating Interactions
Evaluation aspects can be distinguished in numerous ways: by the
effort and time to perform them (both data collection and analysis);
by how quantifiable they are or how comparable they are with
measures in other organization systems; by what component of the
interaction or organizing system they focus on; or by the discipline,
expertise, or methodologies that are used for the evaluation.

A common and important distinction is the difference between
efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. An interaction is efficient
when it performs its actions in a timely and economical manner,
effective when it performs its actions correctly and completely,
satisfactory when it performs as expected. Satisfaction is the least
quantifiable of the evaluation aspects because it is highly dependent
on individual tastes and experiences.

Let us assume that Shopstyle.com develops a new interaction that
lets you compare coat lengths from the offerings of their various
retailers. Once the interaction is designed, an evaluation takes place
in order to determine whether all coats and their lengths are
integrated in the interaction and whether the coat lengths are
measured and compared correctly. The designers would not only
want to know whether the coat lengths are represented correctly
but also whether the interaction performs efficiently. When the
interaction is ready to be released (usually first in beta or test
status), users and retailers will be asked whether the interaction
improves their shopping experience, whether the comparison
performs as they expected, and what they would change. These
evaluation styles work hand in hand in order to improve the
interaction.

Efficiency

When evaluating the efficiency of an organizing system, we focus
on the time, energy and economic resources needed in order to

                                                                 Evaluating Interactions | 967
achieve the interaction goals of the system. Commonly, the fewer
resources are needed for achieving a successful interaction, the
more efficient the interaction.

Efficiency measures are usually related to engineering aspects such
as the time to perform an action, number of steps to perform an
interaction, or amount of computing resources used. Efficiency with
respect to the human costs of memory load, attention, and cognitive
processing is also important if there is to be a seamless user
experience where users can interact with the system in a timely
manner.

For a lot of organizing system interactions, however, effectiveness is
the more important aspect, particularly for those interactions that
we have looked at so far. If search results are not correct, then
users will not be satisfied by even the most usable interface. Many
interactions are evaluated with respect to their ability to return
relevant resources. Why and how this is evaluated is the focus of the
remainder of this section.

Effectiveness

Effectiveness evaluates the correct output or results of an
interaction. An effective interaction achieves relevant, intended or
expected results. The concept of relevance and its relationship to
effectiveness is pivotal in information retrieval and machine
learning interactions. ("Relevance") Effectiveness measures are
often developed in the fields that developed the algorithm for the
interaction, information retrieval, or machine learning. Precision
and recall are the fundamental measures of relevance or
effectiveness in information retrieval or machine learning
interactions. ("The Recall / Precision Tradeoff")

968 | Evaluating Interactions
Relevance

Relevance is widely regarded as the fundamental concept of
information retrieval, and by extension, all of information science.
Despite being one of the more intuitive concepts in human
communication, relevance is notoriously difficult to define and has
been the subject of much debate over the past century.

Historically, relevance has been addressed in logic and philosophy
since the notion of inference was codified (to infer B from A, A must
be relevant to B). Other fields have attempted to deal with relevance
as well: sociology, linguistics, and psychology in particular. The
subject knowledge view, subject literature view, logical view,
system's view, destination's view, pertinence view, pragmatic view
and the utility-theoretic interpretation are different perspectives
on the question of when something is relevant.1

In 1997, Mizzaro surveyed 160 research articles on the topic of
relevance and arrived at this definition: "relevance can be seen as
a point in a four-dimensional space, the values of each of the four
dimensions being: (i) Surrogate, document, information; (ii) query,
request, information need, problem; (iii) topic, context, and each
combination of them; and (iv) the various time instants from the
arising of problem until its solution."2

This rather abstract definition points to the terminological
ambiguity surrounding the concept.

1. Space does not permit significant discussion of these
  views here, see (Saracevic 1975), and (Schamber et al.
  1990).

                    Evaluating Interactions | 969
For the purpose of organizing systems, relevance is a concept for
evaluating effectiveness that describes whether a stated or implicit
information need is satisfied in a particular user context and at
a particular time. One of the challenges for the evaluation of
relevance in organizing systems is the gap between a user's
information need (often not directly stated), and an expression of
that information need (a query). This gap might result in ambiguous
results in the interaction. For example, suppose somebody speaks
the word "Paris" (query) into a smart phone application seeking
advice on how to travel to Paris, France. The response includes
offers for the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas. Does the result satisfy the
information need? What if the searcher receives advice on Paris but
has already seen every one of the resources the organizing system
offers? What is the correct decision on relevance here?

The key to calculating effectiveness is to be aware of what is being
measured. If the information need as expressed in the query is
measured, the topical relevance or topicality--a system-side
perspective is analyzed. If the information need as in a person's
mind is measured, the pertinence, utility, or situational relevance--a
subjective, personal perspective is analyzed. This juxtaposition is
the point of much research and contention in the field of
information retrieval, because topical relevance is objectively
measurable, but subjective relevance is the real goal. In order to
evaluate relevance in any interaction, an essential prerequisite is
deciding which of these notions of relevance to consider.

The Recall / Precision Tradeoff

Precision measures the accuracy of a result set, that is, how many
of the retrieved resources for a query are relevant. Recall measures
the completeness of the result set, that is, how many of the relevant
resources in a collection were retrieved. Let us assume that a
collection contains 20 relevant resources for a query. A retrieval

970 | Evaluating Interactions
   interaction retrieves 10 resources in a result set, 5 of the retrieved
   resources are relevant. The precision of this interaction is 50% (5
   out of 10 retrieved resources are relevant); the recall is 25% (5 out of
   20 relevant resources were retrieved).3

   It is in the nature of information retrieval interactions that recall
   and precision trade off with each other. To find all relevant
   resources in a collection, the interaction has to cast a wide net
   and will not be very precise. In order to be very precise and return
   only relevant resources to the searcher, an interaction has to be
   very discriminating and will probably not find all relevant resources.
   When a collection is very large and contains many relevant
   resources for any given query, the priority is usually to increase
   precision. However, when a collection is small or the information
   need also requires finding all relevant documents (e.g., in case law,
   patent searches, or medical diagnosis support), then the priority is
   put on increasing recall.

   The completeness and granularity of the organizing principles in
   an organizing system have a large impact on the trade-off between
   recall and precision. (See Resources in Organizing Systems.) When
   resources are organized in fine-grained category systems and many
   different resource properties are described, high-precision
   searches are possible because a desired resource can be searched
   as precisely as the description or organization of the system allows.
   However, very specialized description and organization may
   preclude certain resources from being found; consequently, recall

3. Recall and precision are only the foundation of measures
   that have been developed in information retrieval to
   evaluate the effectiveness of search algorithms. See
   (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro 2011), (Manning et al. 2008) Ch.
   8; (Demartini and Mizzaro 2006).

                                                                      Evaluating Interactions | 971
might be sacrificed. If the organization is superficial--like your sock
drawer, for example--you can find all the socks you want (high
recall) but you have to sort through a lot of socks to find the right
pair (low precision). The trade-off between recall and precision is
closely associated with the extent of the organization.

Satisfaction

Satisfaction evaluates the opinion, experience or attitude of a user
towards an interaction. Because satisfaction depends on individual
user opinions, it is difficult to quantify. Satisfaction measures arise
out of the user's experience with the interaction--they are mostly
aspects of user interfaces, usability, or subjective and aesthetic
impressions.

Usability measures whether the interaction and the user interface
designed for it correspond with the user's expectations of how
they should function. It particularly focuses on the usefulness of
the interaction. Usability analyzes ease-of-use, learnability, and
cognitive effort to measure how well users can use an interaction to
achieve their task.

Although efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction are measured
differently and affect different components of the interaction, they
are equally important for the success of an interaction. Even if an
interaction is fast, it is not very useful if it arrives at incorrect
results. Even if an interaction works correctly, user satisfaction is
not guaranteed. One of the challenges in designing interactions is
that these factors invariably involve tradeoffs. A fast system cannot
be as precise as one that prioritizes the use of contextual
information. An effective interaction might require a lot of effort
from the user, which does not make it very easy to use, so the user
satisfaction might decrease. The priorities of the organizing system
and its designers will determine which properties to optimize.

972 | Evaluating Interactions
Let us continue our Shopstyle coat-length comparison interaction
example. When the coat length calculation is performed in an
acceptable amount of time and does not consume a lot of the
organizing systems resources, the interaction is efficient. When all
coat lengths are correctly measured and compared, the interaction
is effective. When the interaction is seamlessly integrated into the
shopping process, visually supported in the interface, and not
cognitively exhausting, is it probably satisfactory for a user, as it
provides a useful service (especially for someone with irregular body
dimensions). What aspect should Shopstyle prioritize? It will
probably weigh the consequences of effectiveness versus efficiency
and satisfaction. For a retail- and consumer-oriented organizing
system, satisfaction is probably one of the more important aspects,
so it is highly likely that efficiency and effectiveness might be
sacrificed (in moderation) in favor of satisfaction.

   and making choices that they might not intend or that are not
   in their best interests.

   (See the sidebar, Behavioral Economics)

· What activities, with respect to resources, are typically

69. Introduction (XI)

Foundations for Organizing Systems defined an organizing system
as "an intentionally arranged collection of resources and the
interactions they support." An organizing system emerges as the
result of decisions about what is organized, why it is organized, how
much it is organized, when it is organized, and how or by whom
it is organized. These decisions and the tradeoffs they embody are
manifested in the four common activities of organizing
systems--selecting resources, organizing them, designing and
supporting interactions with them, and maintaining them--which
we described in Chapter 2. Chapters 4-10 progressively explained
each of the parts of the organizing system: resources, resource
descriptions, resource categories and collections, and interactions
with resources--introducing additional concepts and methods
associated with each of these parts.

Along the way we described many types of organizing systems.
Sometimes we discussed broad categories of organizing systems,
like those for libraries, museums, business information systems, and
compositions of web-based services. At other times we described
specific instances of organizing systems, like those in the Seed
Library, the Flickr photo sharing site, Amazon's drop shipment
store, and your home kitchen or closet.

We can now build on the foundation created by Chapters 1-10 to
create a "roadmap" that organizes and summarizes the design issues
and choices that emerge during an organizing system's lifecycle.
These design choices follow patterns that help us understand
existing organizing systems better, while also suggesting how to
invent new ones by making a different set of design choices.

The roadmap is extensively annotated with references to the
preceding chapters where the issues and choices mentioned in the
roadmap were introduced and discussed in detail. We will use this

                                                                           Introduction (XI) | 981
roadmap to analyze a variety of case study examples in Case Studies,
and to explore the "design neighborhood" around each of them. The
design questions from Foundations for Organizing Systems serve as
a template to give each case study the same structure, which we
hope enables instructors, students, and others who read this book
to add to this collection of case studies by contributing their own at
DisciplineOfOrganizing.org.

        Navigating This
            Chapter

          We begin with a look at "The Organizing System
       Lifecycle" which proposes four phases, each of which is
       discussed in its own section. The first phase, which
       largely determines the extent and complexity of the
       resource descriptions needed for organizing and
       interactions, is "Defining and Scoping the Organizing
       System Domain". The second phase, which is highly
       shaped by economic factors and technology constraints
       or choices, is "Identifying Requirements for an
       Organizing System". "Designing and Implementing an
       Organizing System", emphasizes the need for clearly

982 | Introduction (XI)
separating requirements from implementation, a
principle we call architectural thinking. The final phase
is discussed in "Operating and Maintaining an
Organizing System", where we distinguish the
maintenance of specific resources and descriptions
from the maintenance of the system as a whole.

                                                                 Introduction (XI) | 983
70. The Organizing System
Lifecycle

System lifecycle models exhibit great variety; for our purposes it
suffices to use a generic four-phase model that distinguishes a
domain definition and scoping phase, a requirements phase, a
design and implementation phase, and an operational and
maintenance phase. These phases are brief and mostly inseparable
for some simple organizing systems, more sequential for others, and
more systematic and iterative for complex organizing systems.

Most of the specific decisions that must be made for an organizing
system are strongly shaped by the initial decisions about its domain,
scope (the breadth or variety of the resources), and scale (the
number of resource instances). In organizing systems with limited
scope and scale, most of these decisions are made in an informal,
unanalyzed, and holistic manner. For example, when we arrange our
bookshelves or closets it is not necessary to think explicitly about
scoping, requirements, design, implementation, and operational
phases. For complex organizing systems, however, especially those
in information-intensive domains, it is important to follow a more
systematic methodology.

Initial decisions about scope and requirements can create lasting
technology and process legacies that impact operational efficiency
and flexibility. They can also have profound and unforeseen
ramifications for the users of the system and other people affected
by the work the system enables. A rigorous, well-documented
planning process can help organizers minimize unfair and
ineffective outcomes, justify their difficult tradeoffs and decisions,
and figure out what went wrong so they can learn from their
mistakes.

984 | The Organizing System
Lifecycle
The consequences of releasing technical systems and tools into the
world always include social, business, political, and legal dimensions
in addition to technical ones. Some of these implications are due
to the context in which the system will operate ("Implementing
Interactions"). Others are due to the fact that the work of organizing
system designers, architects, and developers is shaped by their
experiences, values, beliefs, and circumstances--the often hidden
constraints and influences of their social position, education,
cultural context, and mental models of the world. Inevitably, the
work of information professionals involves "carving up the world at
its joints," creating classifications, models, and architectures that
support interactions with resources. In practice this often
translates to creating artificial "joints" where none truly exist, which
will always favor some and injure others. No modeling is ever
completely faithful to reality for all people with all experiences (nor
is it intended to be), so those people not considered target users for
a system, or who have unique circumstances, may end up feeling
slighted or ignored and may actually suffer as a result.

71. Defining and Scoping the
Organizing System Domain

The most fundamental decision for an organizing system is defining
its domain, the set or type of resources that are being organized.
This is why "What is Being Organized?" ("What Is Being Organized?")
was the first of the design decisions we introduced in Foundations
for Organizing Systems.
We refine how we think about an organizing system domain by
breaking it down into five interrelated aspects:

 1. the scope and scale of the collection
2. the number and nature of users
3. the time span or lifetime over which the organizing system will

      operate
4. the physical or technological environment in which the

      organizing system is situated
5. the relationship of the organizing system to other ones that

      overlap with it in domain or scope

Addressing these issues is a prerequisite for prioritizing
requirements for the organizing system, proposing the principles of
its design, and implementing the organizing system.

Scope and Scale of the Collection

The scope of a collection is the dominant factor in the design of

986 | Defining and Scoping the
Organizing System Domain
   an organizing system, because it largely determines the extent and
   complexity of the resource descriptions needed by organizing
   principles and interactions ("Scope, Scale, and Resource
   Description"). The impact of broad scope arises more from the
   heterogeneity of the resources in a collection than its absolute
   scale. It takes more effort to manage a broad and large collection
   than a narrow and small one; it takes less effort to manage a large
   collection if it has a narrow scope. A cattle ranch can get by with just
   one worker for every thousand cows, unlike zoos, which typically
   have a small number of instances of many types of animals. A zoo
   needs many more workers because each animal type and sometimes
   even individual animals can have distinct requirements for their
   arrangement and care.

   Consider a business information system being designed to contain
   millions of highly structured and similar instances of a small number
   of related resource types, such as purchase orders and their
   corresponding invoices.1 The analysis to determine the appropriate
   properties and principles for resource description and organization

1. For some kinds of resources with highly regular
  structure, the distinction between the resource and its
  description is a bit arbitrary. A transactional document
  like a payment contains at its core a specification of the
  amount paid, which we could consider the payment
  resource. Information about the payer, the payee, the
  reason for the payment, and other essential information
  might be viewed as descriptions of the payment resource.
  In a payment or financial management system, the entire
  document might be treated as the resource.

                           Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain | 987
   is straightforward, and any order or invoice is an equally good
   instance to study.2

   Contrast this large but very narrow collection with a small but
   very broad one that contains a thousand highly variable instances
   of dozens of different resource types. This heterogeneity makes it
   difficult to determine if an instance is representative of its resource
   type, and every resource might need to be analyzed. This variability
   implies a large and diverse set of resource descriptions where
   individual resource instances might not be described with much
   precision because it costs too much to do it manually ("Resource
   Description by Professionals"). We can extrapolate to understand
   why organizing systems whose resource collections are both broad
   and deep, like those of Amazon or eBay, have come to rely on
   machine learning techniques to identify description properties and

2. The results of this analysis can be represented in a
   conceptual model or document /database schema that
   can guide the automated creation of the resource
   instances and their descriptions ("Abstraction in
   Resource Description"). Furthermore, these models or
   schemas can also be used in "model-based" or "model-
   driven" architectures to generate much of the software
   that implements the functionality to store the instances
   and interchange them with other information systems;
   "imagine if the construction worker could take his
   blueprint, crank it through a machine, and have the
   foundation for the building simply appear." Quote comes
   from (Miller and Mukerji 2003). See also (Kleppe, Warmer,
   and Bast 2003).

   construct resource taxonomies ("Automated and Computational
   Resource Description", "Categories Created by Clustering").3

   A partial remedy or compromise when the resource instances are
   highly dissimilar is to define resource types more broadly or
   abstractly, reducing the overall number of types. We illustrated this
   approach in "Principles Embodied in the Classification Scheme"
   when we contrasted how kitchen goods might be categorized
   broadly in a department store but much more precisely in a
   wholesale kitchen supply store. The broader categories in the
   department store blur many of the differences between instances,
   but in doing so yield a small set of common properties that can be
   used to describe them. Because these common properties will be
   at a higher level of abstraction, using them to describe resources
   will require less expertise and probably less effort ("Scope, Scale,
   and Resource Description", "Category Abstraction and Granularity").
   However, this comes at a cost: Poets, painters, composers,
   sculptors, technical writers, and programmers all create resources,
   but describing all of them with a "creator" property, as the Dublin
   Core requires, loses a great deal of precision.

   Challenges caused by the scale of a collection are often related to
   constraints imposed by the physical or technological environment
   in which the collection exists that limit how large the collection can
   be or how it can be organized. (See "Organizing Physical Resources")
   Only a few dozen books can fit on a small bookshelf but thousands
   of books can fit in your two-car garage, which is a typical size
   because most people and families do not have more than two cars.

is orders of magnitudes too small to store your collection.4 Even
collections of digital things can be limited in size by their
technological environment, which you might have discovered when
you ran out of space for your songs and photos on your portable
media player.

Estimating the ultimate size of a collection at the beginning of an
organizing system's lifecycle can reduce scaling issues related to
storage space for the resources or for their descriptions. Other
problems of scale are more fundamental. Larger collections need
more people to organize and maintain them, creating
communication and coordination problems that grow much faster
than the collection, especially when the collection is distributed in
different locations.

The best way to prevent problems of scope and scale is through
standardization. Standardization of resources can take place if they
are created by automated means so that every instance conforms
to a schema or model ("Implementing Categories Defined by
Properties").5 Standards for describing bibliographic resources
enable libraries to centralize and share much resource description,
and using the same standards for resources of diverse types helps
address the challenge of broad scope by reducing the need for close
monitoring and coordination. Analogous standards for describing

information resources, services, or economic activities business,
governmental, or scientific information systems to systematically
manage hundreds of millions or even billions of transactional
records or pieces of data ("Scope, Scale, and Resource Description").

Number and Nature of Users

An organizing system might have only one user, as when an
individual creates and operates an organizing system for a clothes
closet, a home bookcase or file cabinet, or for digital files and
applications on a personal computer or smart phone. Collections
of personal resources are often organized for highly individualized
interactions using ad hoc categories that are hard to understand
for any other user ("Individual Categories"). Personal collections or
collections used by only a small number of people typically contain
resources that they themselves selected, which makes the most
typical interaction with the organizing system searching for a
familiar known resource ("User Requirements").

At the other extreme, an organizing system can have national or
even global scope and have millions or more users like the Library
of Congress classification system, the United Nations Standard
Products and Services Code, or the Internet Domain Name System.
These organizing systems employ systems of institutional
categories ("Institutional Categories") that are designed to support
systematically specified and purposeful interactions, often to search
for previously unknown resources. In between these extremes are
the many kinds of organizing systems created by informal and
formal groups, by firms of every size, and by sets of cooperating
enterprises like those that carry out supply chains and other
information-intensive business processes.

The nature and number of users strongly shapes the contents of
an organizing system and the interactions it must be designed to

                       Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain | 991
support. (See "User Requirements") Some generic categories of
users that apply in many domains are customers, clients, visitors,
operators, and managers. We can adapt the generic interactions
supported by most organizing systems ("Determining the
Purposes") to satisfy these generic user types. For example, while
most organizing systems allow any type of user to browse or search
the collection to discover its content, only operators or managers
are likely to have access to information about the browsing and
searching activities of customers, clients, or visitors.

Once we have identified the organizing system's domain more
precisely we can refine these generic user categories, classifying
users and interactions with more precision. For example, the
customers of university libraries are mostly professors and
students, while the customers of online stores are mostly shoppers
seeking to find something to purchase. Library customers borrow
and return resources, often according to different policies for
professors and students, whereas online stores might only allow
resources to be returned for refunds or exchanges under limited
circumstances.

Just as it is with collection scope, the heterogeneity of the user
base is more critical than its absolute size. An airport bookstore
typically has a narrowly focused collection and treats its customers
as generic travelers browsing imprecisely for something to fill their
time in the terminal or on the airplane. In contrast, the local public
library will have a much broader collection because it has to meet
the needs of a more diverse user base than the airport bookstore,
and it will support a range of interactions and services targeted to
children learning to read, school students, local businesses, retirees,
and other categories of users. A company library will focus its
collection on its industry segment, making it narrower in coverage
than a local or university research library, but it might provide
specialized services for marketing, engineering, research, legal, or
other departments of the firm.

992 | Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain
   Each category of users, and indeed each individual user, brings
   different experiences, goals, and biases into interactions with the
   organizing system. As a result, organizing systems in the same
   domain and with nominally the same scope can differ substantially
   in the resources they contain and the interactions they support for
   different categories of users. The library for the Centers for Disease
   Control and the WebMD website both contain information about
   diseases and symptoms, but the former is primarily organized to
   support research in public health and the latter is organized for
   consumers trying to figure out why they are sick and how to get
   well. These contrasting purposes and targeted users are manifested
   in different classification systems and descriptive vocabularies.6

   The designers of these systems do not necessarily share the same
   biases as their users, and more importantly, they may not always
   understand them completely or correctly. This is precisely why
   good design is iterative: successive cycles of evaluation and revision
   can shape crude, provisional, and misguided ideas into wildly
   successful ones. But such nimbleness is not always feasible in highly
   complex, political, or bureaucratic institutional contexts. Even then,
   as Bowker and Star conclude, transparency is the best corrective for
   these sorts of design failures. Designers who recognize that their
   systems have real consequences for real people should commit to
   an ongoing process of negotiation that enables those affected by the
   technology to voice and push back against any detrimental effect it
   might have on them and their communities. This helps set the stage
   for effective operation and maintenance of the system ("Properties,
   Principles and Technology Perspective").

Expected Lifetime

The scope and scale of a collection and the size of its user
population are often correlated with the expected lifetime of its
organizing system. Because small personal organizing systems are
often created in response to a specific situation or to accomplish
a specific task, they generally have short lifetimes ("Individual
Categories").

The expected lifetime of the organizing system is not the same
as the expected lifetime of the resources it contains because
motivations for maintaining resources differ a great deal. (See
"Motivations for Maintaining Resources") As we have just noted,
some organizing systems created by individuals are tied to specific
short-term tasks, and when the task is completed or changes, the
organizing system is no longer needed or must be superseded by
a new one. At the other extreme are libraries, museums, archives,
and other memory institutions designed to last indefinitely because
they exist to preserve valuable and often irreplaceable resources.

However, most business organizing systems contain relatively
short-lived resources that arise from and support day-to-day
operations, in which case the organizing system has a long expected
lifetime with impermanent resources. Finally, just to complete our 2
x 2 matrix, the auction catalog that organizes valuable paintings or
other collectibles is a short-lived single-purpose organizing system
whose contents are descriptions of resources with long expected
lifetimes.

Physical or Technological Environment

An organizing system is often tied to a particular physical or
technological environment. A kitchen, closet, card cabinet, airplane

994 | Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain
   cockpit, handheld computer or smartphone, and any other physical
   environment in which resources are organized provides affordances
   to be taken advantage of and constraints that must be
   accommodated by an organizing system ("Affordance and
   Capability").7

   The extent of these physical and technological constraints affects
   the lifetime of an organizing system because they make it more
   difficult to adapt to changes in the set of resources being organized
   or the reasons for their organization. A desk or cabinet with fixed
   "pigeon holes" or drawers affords less flexible organization than a
   file cabinet or open shelves. A building with hard-walled offices
   constrains how people interact and collaborate more than an open
   floor plan with modular cubicles does. Business processes
   implemented in a monolithic enterprise software application are
   tightly coupled; those implemented as a choreography of loosely-

7. Service design, architecture, and user interaction design
  are the primary disciplines that care about the influence
  of layout and spatial arrangement on user interaction
  behavior and satisfaction. One type of physical
  framework is the "Servicescape" (Bitner 1992), the man-
  made physical context in which services are delivered.
  For example, the arrangement of waiting lines in banks,
  supermarkets, and post offices or the use of centrally-
  visible "take a number" systems strongly influence the
  encounters in service systems (Zhou and Soman 2003).
  Related concepts for describing the use of features and
  orienting mechanisms in "the built environment" come
  from the "Wayfinding" (Arthur and Passini 1992) literature
  in urban planning and architecture.

                           Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain | 995
coupled web services can often transparently substitute one service
provider for another.

Relationship to Other Organizing Systems

The same domain or set of resources can have more than one
organizing system, and one organizing system can contain multiple
others. The organizing system for books in a library arranges books
about cooking according to the Library of Congress or Dewey
Decimal classifications and bookstores use the BISAC ones, mostly
using cuisine as the primary factor ("Bibliographic Classification").
In turn, cookbooks employ an organizing system for their recipes
that arranges them by type of dish, main ingredient, or method of
preparation. Within a cookbook, recipes might follow an organizing
system that standardizes the order of their component parts like
the description, ingredients, and preparation steps.

Sometimes these multiple organizing systems can be designed in
coordination so they can function as a single hierarchical, or nested,
organizing system in which it is possible to emphasize different
levels depending on the user's task or application. Most books and
many documents have an internal structure with chapters and
hierarchical headings that enable readers to understand smaller
units of content in the context of larger ones ("Structural
Relationships within a Resource"). Similarly, a collection of songs
can be treated as an album and organized using that level of
abstraction for the item, but each of those songs can also be treated
as the unit of organization, especially when they are embodied in
separate digital files.

Organizing systems overlap and intersect. People and enterprises
routinely interact with many different organizing systems because
what they do requires them to use resources in ways that cut across
context, device, or application boundaries. Just consider how many

996 | Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain
different organizing systems we use as individuals for managing
personal information like contacts, appointments, and messages. As
company employees we create and organize information in email,
document repositories, spreadsheets, and CRM and ERP systems.
Now consider this at an institutional scale in the inter-enterprise
interactions among the organizing systems of physicians, hospitals,
medical labs, insurance companies, government agencies, and other
parties involved in healthcare. Consider how many of these are
"mash-ups" and composite services that combine information and
resources from independently designed systems.
We have come to expect that the boundaries between organizing
systems are often arbitrary and that we should be able to merge or
combine them when that would create additional value. It is surely
impossible to anticipate all of these ad hoc or dynamic intersections
of organizing systems, but it is surely necessary to recognize their
inevitability, especially when the organizing systems contain digital
information and are implemented using web architectures.

72. Identifying Requirements
for an Organizing System

The two parts of the definition of an organizing system explicitly
suggest two categories of requirements, those that specify the
intentional arrangement of the resources and those that specify the
interactions with the resources. These categories of requirements
both depend on resource descriptions, which are implied by but not
explicitly called out in the definition of an organizing system.

Because description, arrangement, and interaction are interrelated
it is impossible to describe them separately without some
redundancy. Nevertheless, in this book we have done that on
purpose because taking different perspectives on organizing
systems in Chapters 2-10 has enabled us to introduce a broad range
of concepts, issues, and methods:

  · Every organizing system must enable users to interact with its
      collection of resources (Chapters 3 and 10);

  · The possible interactions depend primarily on the nature and
      extent of the descriptions associated with the resources
      (Chapters 4, 5 and 6);

  · Intentional arrangement emerges when one or more resource
      descriptions are used by organizing principles (Chapters 7 and
      8);

  · Different implementations of the same organizing principle can
      determine the efficiency or effectiveness of the interactions it
      enables. (Chapter 10).

If you are creating a personal organizing system or otherwise small-
scale one with only a small number of users, you might think there

                                                              Identifying Requirements for an
                                                                       Organizing System | 999
   is little reason to think explicitly about requirements. However, any
   project benefits from the discipline of being more systematic about
   its purposes and their priorities. In addition, being explicit about
   requirements enables traceability and impact analysis. Traceability
   means being able to relate an interaction or feature of a system
   to the requirement it satisfies; impact analysis runs the causal link
   between requirements and features in the opposite direction to
   assess what or who will be affected if requirements change.1

 Requirements for Interactions

   When we describe interactions in a generic or broad way as we
   did in Activities in Organizing Systems we see that all organizing
   systems have some common interactions, but most of the time we
   want to pay attention to the more specific interactions that are
   designed to create value in a particular organizing system because
   of the kind of resources it contains ("Interaction and Value
   Creation"). The domain, scope, and scale of the organizing system
   determines which interactions are possible and which ones must
   be explicitly supported, but the priorities of different interactions
   are more often determined by decisions about intended users. (See
   "Number and Nature of Users".)

   For most organizing systems other than personal ones, the set of
   interactions that are implemented in an organizing system is

1. An easy to remember framework for prioritizing
  requirements is MoSCoW, which classifies them as Must,
  Should, Could, and Won't (Desoky 2010). (Winkler and
  Pilgrim 2010) is a comprehensive review of academic
  research and best practices for requirements traceability.

   1000 | Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System
   strongly determined by business model considerations, funding
   levels, or other economic factors. For-profit firms often
   differentiate themselves by the number and quality of the
   interactions they support with their resources, some by supporting
   many of them and some by supporting a minimal number. This
   differentiation is strongly shaped by and also shapes user
   preferences; some people prefer self-service or unmediated
   interactions, while others prefer full service and mediated
   interactions.2 Non-profit institutions like public libraries and
   museums are also subject to these constraints, but unfortunately
   they have fewer options for adjusting service levels or changing
   their targeted user populations when their funding is reduced.3

2. "Customer segments" or "customer models" are well-
   established constructs in product and service marketing
   and operations (Batt 2000) (Zeithami, Rust, and Lemon
   2001). They are key parts of strategies for acquiring
   customers, increasing market share, and retaining
   customers. Customer segments can be identified using
   numerous overlapping criteria, including demographic
   variables, product or behavior choices, and preferred
   interaction locations or channels. For example, an airline
   might segment its customers according to their age,
   gender, home airport, ticketing class, and travel
   frequency.

3. Funding cuts for public libraries lead to reduced staffing,
   reduced hours, and reduced acquisitions and many of
   them serve populations facing economic challenges of
   their own. (Johnson 2010).

                             Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System | 1001
   Some requirements for interactions come along with technology
   requirements, to have resources in a particular format, to conform
   to a particular specification or standard in order to operate in some
   technology environment, or to interoperate with other parties or
   their organizing systems.

   An essential requirement in every organizing system is ensuring
   that the supported interactions can be discovered and invoked by
   their intended users. In organizing systems with physical resources,
   good designers enhance the inherent affordances of resources with
   navigation and orientation aids that direct users to points of
   interactions ("Affordance and Capability"). With digital resources
   and information-intensive organizing systems, interactions are not
   immediately perceivable, and poor design can create overly
   complicated user interfaces in which many interactions are never
   discovered and thus never used.

   It is tricky to compare the overall capabilities of organizing systems
   in terms of the number or variety of their interactions because what
   matters more is how much value they create. Organizing systems
   with active resources can create value on their own without an
   explicit user interaction ("Active or Operant Resources"). Other
   organizing systems exploit stored, computed, or contextual
   information to create value by eliminating the need for user
   interactions, such as location-based smartphone apps that push
   information to you when you are near some particular location or
   some person you know ("Affordance and Capability").4

4. Organizing systems differ in the extent they can initiate
   interactions or use information to make them
   unnecessary. In libraries the organizing systems are
   typically designed not to preserve user activity records
   longer than absolutely necessary; in commercial

    1002 | Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System
  About the Nature and Extent of Resource
  Description

   Interactions with resources within an organizing system often
   depend on descriptions of individual resources or descriptions of
   the collections that contain them. In the bibliographic domain,
   generic or common interactions make use of descriptions that can
   be associated with almost any type of resource, such as the name,
   creator, and creation date.5

   For example, any resource with a sortable name or identifier can
   be arranged alphabetically to enable it to be easily found, and any
   resource with a creation date can be discovered by a "what's new"
   query to a resource collection.

   Different types of resources must have differentiating properties,
   otherwise there would be no reason to distinguish them as different

   organizing systems, user activity records are the basis
   of business processes that create highly detailed user
   models (called "microsegments" or "microcategories")
   that enable personalized product and service offerings
   See (Taylor and Raden 2007), (Rosen 2012).

5. The Dublin Core was proposed in 1995 as a small
   vocabulary with 15 common elements that could be
   broadly applied. The emergence of many specialized
   derivatives of the Dublin Core since then illustrates the
   inherent tension between the simplicity of using a small
   set of common descriptive elements and the precision
   enabled by a large or more domain specific vocabulary.

                            Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System | 1003
types. These resource properties can be recorded in the terms of
a description language to support one or more interactions or to
answer one or more questions. Simply put, choices about the nature
and extent of resource description depend on which interactions or
questions are most frequent or important ("Describing Instances or
Describing Collections"). If a particular property of a resource has
no interactions that depend on it, there is no need to describe it.
However, if an interaction depends on a description of a particular
resource property, a missing description or one of inadequate
precision and granularity means that the interaction will be
impossible or inefficient to carry out because the resource will need
to be further analyzed to create or extract the required description.
An ISBN is a sufficient description to find a book in a directory, but
if the ISBN is the only description associated with the book you will
not be able to tell who wrote it. The tradeoffs imposed by the extent
and timing of resource description have been a recurring theme
in this book, with the tradeoff between recall and precision being
the most salient ("When Is It Being Organized?", "Affordance and
Capability", "Category Abstraction and Granularity", "The Recall /
Precision Tradeoff").

The properties of resources that are easiest to describe are not
always the most useful ones, especially for information resources.
Anyone can determine the number of pages in a book, but often
only a skilled cataloger can accurately describe what the book is
about, a far more important property. (""Description" as an Inclusive
Term" and "The Limits of Property-Based Categorization") For non-
text information resources this problem is magnified because the
content is often in a semantically opaque format that it optimized
for the devices that creates and processes it but which cannot
usefully be analyzed by people. ("The Semantic Gap" and
"Describing Non-text Resources")

Business strategy and economics strongly influence the extent of
resource description. In many museums and archives there are not
enough trained people and time to describe every pottery fragment

1004 | Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System
or document, and many resources are described only at an
aggregate level. In contrast, some people argue that the explosion
of content in physical and digital form mandates significant
investment in descriptions that facilitate resource discovery in a
crowded marketplace.6

Automated and computerized processes can create the resource
descriptions in an organizing system and their use is primarily
driven by scale ("Automated and Computational Resource
Description"). Search engines index web pages and analyze their link
structures because it would be impossible to treat the web as a
traditional library and organize it by human effort. The benefits of
digital cameras, video recorders, and similar devices would be far
fewer if people had to manually identify and describe each resource
when creating it. Instead, these devices can automatically assign
some contextual metadata. Similarly, competitive pressures on
vendors to provide real-time and context-sensitive information
services mandate automated collection of contextual information
like location from mobile phones, portable book readers and tablet
computers.

          Because he is presumably familiar with the contents
       of all of his books, interaction designer Juhan Sonin
       organized his library according to their spine colors.
       This organizing principle is a highly individual and
       aesthetic one, but it would probably not appeal to
       people unfamiliar with the collection and would bring
       chaos to a library of larger size.

We might seek some optimal degree of description given some set
of requirements or purposes for an organizing system and some
estimate of the organizing effort that could be applied; in practice
this is elusive for two reasons, both relating to scope and scale.
First, as the number of users of an organizing system increases,
it becomes more difficult to identify and anticipate all its possible
purposes and constraints it must satisfy. Even if most users share
the goals for the organizing system, any particular user might have

1006 | Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System
   some additional specialized use for some attributes or relationships
   that would require more description to satisfy.7

   Second, even if it were possible to implement some optimal degree
   of description in a particular organizing system, we would still
   encounter problems when multiple organizing systems exist in the
   same domain or in domains that intersect across context, device,
   or application boundaries. Since organizing systems are designed
   and evolve to satisfy the specific requirements of their particular
   context, companies will often describe the same resources
   differently, which creates integration and interoperability problems
   when companies need to exchange and combine information
   resources ("Transforming Resources for Interactions").

  About Intentional Arrangement

   Organizing principles depend on resource descriptions, so
   requirements for the former are always intertwined with those for
   the latter. Specifying requirements for the intentional arrangement
   of resources is analogous to specifying why and how resource
   categories can be created ("Principles for Creating Categories"). In

7. For example, we have often used a home kitchen as a
  setting for organizing systems. Suppose the home
  kitchen is to be used as the set for a cooking show and
  the designers want to arrange cookbooks to make the
  background visually pleasing. The designers would like to
  search for cookbooks on the basis of size and spine color,
  but these descriptive elements would be of little value to
  other users.

                            Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System | 1007
turn, the creation of resource categories often becomes a question
about the number and kind of resource properties that might be
analyzed and exploited by organizing principles.

We noted that there is a continuum of category formation that
ranges from minimal use of resource properties to more rigorous
use of multiple properties, and finally to statistical or composite
use of multiple properties, some of which are induced or inferred
rather than explicit. The simplest principle for defining a category
is by enumeration, just putting the resources into a set without any
specification of any properties they might share. The enumerated
resources might very well have common properties, but the
principle of enumeration ignores them; the only property that
matters for that principle is that the resources are in the same
set. This corresponds to the simplest principle of intentional
arrangement, that of collocation, just putting the resources in the
same location without any additional organization.

Collocated resources often acquire some additional arrangement
as a result of their use; consider how the books, papers, or other
resources gathered for some writing project often end up in piles
in your office or on your desk close to your work area. For a small
collection, the proximity-to-use organizing principle is the easiest
way to satisfy a requirement to minimize the time to find frequently
used resources.

As we have often seen, the scope and scale of the organizing system
is a dominant design consideration and it applies to principles of
resource arrangement too. The collocation principle of arrangement
is sufficient for small resource collections because it is not
necessary to define the optimal organization if the time to find any
particular resource is short even for an inefficient search method
of scanning the entire collection. Using the extrinsic property of
frequency of use makes search slightly more efficient, but only in
organizing systems where the user population is small or interacts
with the resources in similar ways. Otherwise, arranging resources

1008 | Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System
   to facilitate their frequent access for some users would hinder other
   users who never use them. Imagine if you shared your office desk
   with someone who works all night on other writing projects and
   leaves his frequently used resources in piles close to his work
   area--which becomes your work area in the morning.

   Larger resource collections usually require multiple organizing
   principles to manage the complexity that emerges when more users
   and more varied interactions must be supported. A valet parking
   lot might organize cars only by size to make optimal use of limited
   space when parking and fetching them, but when cars are organized
   for sale they would be organized by price, performance, seating
   capacity, manufacturer, and many other properties. It is essential
   to establish the priority of users and interactions because these
   requirements determine the order in which the principles are
   applied to arrange the resources. This ordering creates a logical
   resource hierarchy that affects the efficiency of interactions and the
   maintenance of the organizing system over time.

   Information resources are invariably challenging to arrange because
   their aboutness is not an easily perceived property and because of
   the open-ended purposes they can serve. Information collections
   with broad scope most often use a standard system of bibliographic
   classification ("Bibliographic Classification"). In contrast, special
   libraries have narrower collections that need to support domain-
   specific interactions for a relatively small set of users, and as a
   result they require more specialized organizational schemes.8 The

principles for resource arrangement in large firms of every type are
often required to conform with laws and regulations for accounting,
taxes, human resources, data retention and non retention, access
control, and other functions. (See "Governance in Business
Organizing Systems", "Mandated Classifications")

Dealing with Conflicting Requirements

Any individual, group, or enterprise can create an organizing system
that meets their specific requirements, but once this organizing
system involves two or more parties with different requirements,
there is a potential for conflict. Roommates or spouses sometimes
argue about how to organize items in the kitchen, in the
refrigerator, or in some other shared space. To a person who
arranges spices alphabetically and condiment jars by size, arranging
them according to cuisine or frequency of use makes no sense.
Similarly, if you are the sole user of a Dropbox or other cloud storage
account, you can organize it any way you want. You can use any
number of folders that need only make sense to you, or you can
leave everything unorganized in a single folder. However, if you
share the Dropbox account with another person, they are likely
to have different organizational needs or preferences. Perhaps you
tend to organize resources by file type, while they prefer to organize
resources by topic or project.

A small number of people can often agree on an organizing system
that meets the needs of each participant through informal
negotiations. The potential for conflict increases when more people

might even be stretched to include libraries of software
components.

1010 | Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System
   are involved, and "bottom-up" ad hoc negotiations to resolve every
   disagreement between every pair of participants just are not
   feasible. In many domains conflicts are avoided or suppressed
   because the parties have developed or agreed to conform to
   standards ("Classification and Standardization"). Nevertheless,
   conflicts in organizing principles for large-scale organizing systems
   are often resolved by parties with the legal authority or economic
   power to impose a solution on all the participants in a "top-down"
   manner.9

9. Some people call this the "Wal-Mart approach" to
   standardization. A firm with dominant market power
   does not need to negotiate standards because it can
   impose whatever standards it chooses on its partners as
   a condition of doing business with them. When there are
   conflicting requirements, different relationships within
   the set of participants trying to reach agreement, and
   different extents to which they are subject to the
   authority behind the desired agreement, it is not
   surprising that approaches "that require perfect
   coordination and altruism are of no practical interest"
   (Rosenthal et al. 2004, p 47).

73. Designing and
Implementing an Organizing
System

Requirements define what must be done but NOT how to do it;
that's the role of the design and implementation phases. Being
explicit about requirements and the intended scope and scale of
an organizing system before moving onto these phases in an
organizing system's lifecycle avoids two problems. The first is taking
a narrow and short-term focus on the initial resources in a
collection, which might not be representative of the collection when
it reaches its planned scope and scale. This can result in overly
customized and inflexible resource descriptions or arrangements
that cannot easily accommodate the future growth of the collection.
A second problem, often a corollary of the first, is not separating
design principles from their implementation in some specific
environment or technology.

Choosing Scope- and Scale-Appropriate
Technology

A simple organizing system to satisfy personal record keeping or
some short-lived information management requirements can be
implemented using folders and files on a personal computer or
by using "off the shelf" generic software such as web forms,
spreadsheets, databases, and wikis. Other simple organizing
systems run as applications on smart phones. Some small amount
of configuration, scripting, structuring or programming might be
involved, but in many cases this work can be done in an ad hoc

1012 | Designing and Implementing
an Organizing System
manner. The low initial cost to get started with these kinds of
applications must be weighed against the possible cost of having to
redo a lot of the work later because the resources and the resource
descriptions might not be easily exported to new ones.

More capable organizing systems that enable the persistent storage
and efficient retrieval of large amounts of structured information
resources generally require additional design and implementation
efforts. Flat word processing files and spreadsheets are not
adequate. Instead, XML document models and database schemas
often must be developed to ensure more control of and validation of
the information content and its descriptions. Software for version
and configuration management, security and access control, query
and transformation, and for other functions and services must also
be developed to implement the organizing system.

Technology for organizing systems will always evolve to enable new
capabilities. For example, cloud computing and storage are radically
changing the scale of organizing systems and the accessibility of the
information they contain. It might be possible to implement these
capabilities and services to an organizing system in an incremental
fashion with informal design and implementation methods. If
information models, processing logic, business rules and other
constraints are encoded in the software without explicit traceability
to requirements and design decisions the organizing system will be
difficult to maintain if the context, scope or requirements change.
This is why we have repeatedly emphasized the importance of
architectural thinking about organizing systems, beginning in "The
Concept of "Organizing Principle"" where we proposed that
organizing principles should ideally be expressed in a way that did
not assume how they would be implemented. (See also
""Information Architecture" and Organizing Systems",
"Classification vs. Physical Arrangement", and "Introduction")

Architectural Thinking

Much of the advice about designing and implementing an organizing
system can be summarized as "architectural thinking," introduced
in "The Concept of "Organizing Principle"". The overall purpose
of architectural thinking is to separate design issues from
implementation ones to make a system more robust and flexible.
Architectural thinking leads to more modularity and abstraction in
design, making it easier to change an implementation to satisfy
new requirements or to take advantage of new technologies or
procedures. It is also important to think architecturally about the
design of the vocabularies and schemas for resource description
and of classification systems to leave room for expansion to
accommodate new resource types ("Implementing Categories" and
"Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time"). Doing so
is easier if the descriptions are logically and physically distinct from
the resources they describe. A checklist the brings together useful
principles and processes for architectural thinking from all parts of
this book is in the nearby sidebar.

          Principles and Processes
          for Architectural Thinking

            · Explicitly define the purposes and users of the
                organizing system, recognizing that users might
                not agree on purposes or their priorities ("Why Is
                It Being Organized?").

            · Select resources ("Selection Criteria") and
                design interactions ("Interaction and Value

1014 | Designing and Implementing an Organizing System
   Creation") to support the primary or highest
   priority users.

· Specify information and interaction
   requirements in a conceptual and technology-
   neutral way ("The Concept of "Organizing
   Principle"") that conforms as much as possible to
   domain standards, schemas, or vocabularies
   ("Classification and Standardization").

· Implement user interactions with design
   patterns to make them more discoverable, usable,
   and effective (""Information Architecture" and
   Organizing Systems").

· Follow principles for good names ("Choosing
   Good Names and Identifiers") and good resource
   descriptions ("Principles of Good Description").

· Make an informed decision about the tradeoff
   between flexibility and complexity; a simpler
   system might be easier to adapt ("Principles for
   Maintaining the Classification over Time").

· Make design and technology decisions
   consistent with the expected life of the organizing
   system ("Operating and Maintaining an Organizing
   System").

          Stop and Think: What is a Library?
          The word "library" has several meanings that differ in
       how much architectural thinking they embody. When
       you tell someone you will meet them at the library for a
       cup of coffee and a study session it is a specific physical
       place. At other times you might use a more abstract
       notion of a library as an organizing system with a
       predictable type of collection, resource arrangement,
       and supported interactions. Both meanings are
       important for a city creating a new library. How would
       you ensure that both are considered in an effective way?

Nevertheless, architectural thinking requires more careful analysis
of resources and implementation alternatives, and most people do
not think this way, especially for personal and informal organizing
systems. You can imagine that someone might arrange a collection
of paperback books in a small bookcase whose shelf height and
width were perfectly suited for the paperbacks they currently own.
However, this organizing system would not work at all for large
format books, and a paperback could not be added to the collection
unless one was purged from the collection. It would be more
sensible to start with a bigger bookcase with adjustable shelves so
that the organizing system would have a longer lifetime.

You might think that large institutional organizing systems would
avoid these problems caused by tying a collection too tightly to
the physical environment in which it is initially organized, but
sometimes they do not. A famous example involves the art collection
of the Barnes Foundation, which had to keep its paintings in the
exact same crowded arrangements when the museum made a
controversial move from a small building to a larger one because the

1016 | Designing and Implementing an Organizing System
   donor had mandated that the paintings never be moved from their
   original settings. (See the sidebar, The Barnes Collection).

   For digital resources, inexpensive storage and high bandwidth have
   largely eliminated capacity as a constraint for organizing systems,
   with an exception for big data, which is defined as a collection of
   data that is too big to be managed by typical database software
   and hardware architectures.1 Even so, big data collections are often
   large but homogeneous, so their scale is not their most important
   challenge from an organizing system perspective ("Scope and Scale
   of the Collection").

             The Barnes Collection
             Albert Barnes was a chemist who made a fortune
          inventing a preventive treatment for gonorrhea and who
          then amassed perhaps the greatest private art collection
          ever, one that contained over 800 paintings by artists
          like Picasso, Renoir, Matisse, van Gogh, and Cezanne. In
          1922 Barnes built a museum for his collection in his
          residential neighborhood in Merion, PA, a suburb of
          Philadelphia. Barnes did not open his collection to the

1. Note that this definition does not include any specific
  size threshold, such as some number of terabytes
  (thousands of gigabytes). This allows the threshold size
  that makes a collection a big data one to increase as
  storage technology advances. It also recognizes that
  different industries or domains have different thresholds
  (Manyika et al 2011).

                             Designing and Implementing an Organizing System | 1017
           public and in his will mandated that the collection never
           be moved, loaned, or sold.

              In the decades after Barnes died in 1951 the Merion
           museum needed extensive repairs and security
           upgrades, and some people suggested that its remote
           location and access restrictions jeopardized its financial
           viability. However, a proposal to relocate the collection
           to Philadelphia seemingly violated the terms of the
           Barnes will.

              A legal fight dragged on for decades. Finally in 2004 a
           judge ruled that the collection could be moved to
           Philadelphia, but only if the new museum contained
           exact copies of the gallery rooms of the original
           museum and arranged the paintings exactly as they
           were in Merion. The new museum building, opened in
           2012, is ten times larger than the old one, but the
           collection takes up the same space as it did in Merion.
           The other 90% of the building is occupied by an
           auditorium, offices, classrooms, a gift shop, and other
           space that contains none of the collection.2

   described in (Anderson 2003). A documentary film with a
   conspiracy perspective is (Argott 2009). See also
   BarnesFoundation.org.

    1018 | Designing and Implementing an Organizing System
  Distinguishing Access from Control

   Because large resource collections are often used for multiple
   purposes by many different people or projects, they illustrate
   another important architectural issue for collections of digital
   resources. A requirement for access to resources does not imply
   a need to directly own or control them, and information-intensive
   and web-based businesses have increasingly adopted organizing
   system designs that involve storage of digital resources in the cloud,
   licensing of globally distributed resources, and outsourcing of
   information services. Designs that use these architectural concepts
   can realize functional and quality improvements because the
   location and identity of the service provider is hidden by an
   abstraction layer ("Value Creation with Physical Resources",
   "Distinguish Identifying and Resolving"). However, separating access
   from ownership has been a cultural challenge for some libraries and
   museums whose institutional identities emphasize the resources
   they directly control and the physical buildings in which they
   control them.3

  Standardization and Legacy Considerations

   As we noted with the Barnes Collection, a building becomes old
   and outdated over time. The technology used in digital organizing
   systems becomes obsolete faster than physical buildings do. The
   best way to slow the inevitable transformation of today's cutting
   edge technology to tomorrow's legacy technology is to design with
   standard data formats, description vocabularies and schemas, and

3. See (Sandler 2006), (Freeman et al. 2005).

                             Designing and Implementing an Organizing System | 1019
classification systems unless you have specific requirements that
preclude these choices.

Even a requirement to interoperate with an organizing system that
uses proprietary or non-standard specifications can usually be
satisfied by transforming from a standard format ("Institutional
Semantics", "Implementing Interactions"). Similarly, it is better to
design the APIs and data feeds of an organizing system in a generic
or standard way that abstracts from their hidden implementation.
This design principle makes it easier for external users to
understand the supported interactions, and also prevents
disclosure of any aspects of resource description or organization
that provide competitive advantage. For example, the way in which
a business classifies products, suppliers, customers, or employees
can be competitively important.

Two important design questions that arise with data transformation
or conversion, whether it is required by a technology upgrade or an
interoperability requirement, are when to do it and where to do it.
The job of converting all the resources in a collection can typically
be outsourced to a firm that specializes in format conversion or
resource description, and a batch or pre-emptive conversion of an
entire collection enables an upgraded or new organizing system
to operate more efficiently when it is not distracted by ongoing
conversion activity. On the other hand, if resources vary greatly
in their frequency of use, a "do-it-yourself on-demand" method is
probably more cost effective as long as the conversion does not
impact the interactions that need to be supported.

1020 | Designing and Implementing an Organizing System
74. Operating and
Maintaining an Organizing
System

After the organizing system has been designed and implemented
it can be put into its operation and maintenance phases. We will
look at these from two perspectives, first from the point of view
of individual resources, and then from the point of view of the
organizing system's design and implementation. These two
perspectives are not always clearly distinguished. Curation, for
example, is often used to describe actions taken to maintain
individual resources as well as those that result in new
arrangements of them.

Resource Perspective

Sometimes an organizing system is implemented with its organizing
structures and relationships waiting to be populated by resources
as they are acquired and described. The scope and scale of the
organizing system shapes how the descriptions are created and how
the descriptions are then used to assign resources to the logical or
physical containers of the organizing system. The most important
decisions to be made at this point involve determining an
appropriate mix of methods for creating the resource descriptions,
because their cost, quality, consistency, completeness, and
semantic richness depends on which human or computational
agents do the work ("Creating Resource Descriptions").

For web-based and consumer-focused organizing systems, it is
tempting to rely on users to assign descriptions, tags, or ratings

                                                                 Operating and Maintaining an
                                                                      Organizing System | 1021
to resources ("Tagging of Web-based Resources"). Some of these
systems attempt to improve the quality and precision of these
descriptions by providing forms, controlled vocabularies, or
suggestions. Finding a balance is tricky; too much direction and
control is demotivating to uncompensated volunteer describers,
and too little of it results in the proverbial "tag soup."

An essential operational and maintenance activity is evaluation of
resource descriptions, first with respect to the time and process
by which they are created, and second with respect to how and
when they support the designed interactions ("Evaluating Resource
Descriptions").

Some organizing systems are initiated with a fixed set of resources
that will not change in any way. For example, in an archive as most
narrowly defined, neither the individual resources nor the
organization of the collection as a whole will change. If an archive
of Abraham Lincoln letters is established, we know that Lincoln
will never revise any letters or write any new ones, and any new
classifications or descriptions devised by people studying the
archive will not be used to rearrange the letters.

Most organizing systems, however, need to support ongoing
interactions with a collection that changes over time as new
resources enter the collection and old ones leave. These selection
and collection management processes are explicit in libraries,
museums and similar institutions that maintain collections to satisfy
the changing needs and preferences of their user communities
("Looking "Upstream" and "Downstream" to Select Resources").

Properties, Principles and Technology Perspective

It is useful to consider how an organizing system as a whole is
operated and maintained over time. We can analyze how the

1022 | Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System
system's organizing properties, principles and technology might
change, and we can roughly order different types of change
according to their overall impact.

The most predictable maintenance activities for an organizing
system with an expected long lifetime ("Expected Lifetime") are
incremental changes in description vocabularies and classification
schemes ("Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time").
These need to evolve when new instances or contexts require
additional properties to maintain the distinctions between types
of resources, but the basic principles embodied in the organizing
systems are not affected.

Incremental category maintenance takes place even in personal
organizing systems where the categories are not always explicit.
The collection of clothes in a college student's closet and the
categories and properties for arranging them will change somewhat
when he graduates and takes a job in a downtown office building
where he needs to dress more formally than he did as a student.
He will learn that despite the common term in the category name,
"student casual" and "business casual" do not contain the same sets
of resources.

Category maintenance is an ongoing activity in institutional
organizing systems. The most commonly used bibliographic
classification systems all have numbering and naming schemes that
allow for subdivision and extension to create new subcategories
to accommodate resources about new fields of knowledge and
technology.

As another example, the Association for Computing Machinery(ACM)
professional society created a keyword classification in 1964 to
organize articles in its many publications, but relentless change in

                           Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System | 1023
   the computing field driven by Moore's Law has required the ACM to
   significantly revise the system almost every decade.1

   In contrast, changes in business organizing systems are more likely
   to be driven by economic factors. Resource properties for managing
   collections of resource and the information that describes them
   often change over time as a result of new products and services,
   mergers and acquisitions, or refined customer segmentation. More
   substantial changes in business organizing systems reflect the need
   to comply with laws and regulations that impose new requirements
   for tracing money flows or transactions. These mandated
   classifications and processes might require new organizing
   principles, not just incremental properties ("Mandated
   Classifications").

   The choice of implementation technology influences how easy it is
   to handle these types of changes in organizing systems. In databases
   this problem is known as "schema migration." With XML
   implementations, schemas can be designed with "extension" or
   "codelist" elements to enable changes that will not invalidate
   existing information. Business processes that are driven by
   "executable specifications" like the Business Process Execution
   Language(BPEL) can be easily modified because the BPEL XML
   instance is used to configure the software that carries out the
   process it describes.2

1. No classification scheme ever devised is as unstable as
   the ACM's because new computing concepts,
   technologies, and application areas are constantly
   emerging. Even the society's name seems outdated.

2. For a formal computer science treatment of BPEL see (Fu,
   Bultan, and Su 2004); for a commercial perspective see

    1024 | Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System
   Another very predictable type of activity over time with organizing
   systems is a technology upgrade that improves its quality or
   capabilities without affecting the organizing principles. A student
   might replace his handwritten lecture notes with typed notes on a
   laptop or tablet computer but not significantly change the way the
   notes are organized.

   Institutional organizing systems are adopting tiered storage
   systems that automatically move resources between different types
   of storage media to meet performance, availability and recovery
   requirements. For example, firms with high financial impact of
   downtime like banks run critical organizing systems with copies in
   "failsafe" or "hot" modes that are synchronized with the production
   environments to prevent any interruptions in information access if
   the latter are disrupted. On the other hand, resources needed for
   regulatory compliance can be kept on lower cost disk storage.

   The most challenging kinds of maintenance activities for organizing
   systems involve changes to the principles for arranging resources
   along with changes in the implementing technology. An example
   is the ambitious effort to introduce semantic web and linked data
   concepts in bibliographic organizing systems ("Bibliographic
   Organizing Systems", "The Semantic Web World"). And change
   comes faster to businesses than to libraries and museums. New
   technologies can have a disruptive impact on business organizing
   system, forcing major changes to enable strategy changes that
   involve faster finding, retrieval, or delivery of informational or
   physical goods.3

3. This means that the organizing systems used by business

                               Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System | 1025
Sometimes major changes to organizing principles and technologies
can be introduced incrementally, with changes "rolled out" to
different sets of resources or user groups during a transition period.
However, sometimes the changes are inherently "all or none"
because it is impossible to have two conflicting organizing systems
operating in the same context. An easy to understand example of
an organizing system that changed radically is the system governing
which side of the road you drive on, which was changed in Samoa in
2009. (See the sidebar, Driving in Samoa).

          Driving in Samoa
          Whether you travel by bus, car, or bicycle, you always
       keep to one side of the road. The convention of driving
       on either the right side or the left side is a legal
       standard that everyone takes for granted. However, you
       must follow it to ensure safe driving and avoid collisions
       and crashes.
          This standard of which side of the road you drive on
       was not decided arbitrarily, but rather, it was adopted as
       a result of history, convention, and the need for
       organization. If you were the only person to use the
       road, you could choose to travel on any side you wanted,
       even travel right down the middle. As soon as more than

applications more often employ configuration
management, version control, model-based code
generation, and other computing techniques that
robustly support the need for qualitative changes in the
organizing systems.

1026 | Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System
one person needs to use the same road, the risk of
collisions compels the creation of a coordinating
standard.

   In 2009, the government of Samoa took the rare step
of changing the side of the road standard from driving
on the right to driving on the left. The original standard
reflected the influence of German colonization in the
early 1900s. However, Samoa is both geographically
close to and economically intertwined with Australia
and New Zealand, former British colonies that follow the
British convention of driving on the left side. This
proximity gives Samoa access to a nearby source of
used cars that would be attractive to Samoa's relatively
poor population. So, the Samoan government decided to
use its authority to change the driving standard so that
more of its people could afford to buy cars.

   As one could imagine, this decision was not
implemented without controversy and opposition.
While the decision benefited people currently without
cars, it negatively affected those who already owned
them. After a switch like this, what happens to the
current market value of the thousands of cars designed
to drive on the right? Opponents also claimed that the
switch would cause unprecedented safety hazards. If
even a small fraction of drivers were not able to
immediately get the hang of driving on the other side,
the accident rate could increase tremendously. Imagine
the current pool of buses designed with doors that open
on the right hand side--would they now let passengers
out in the middle of the street? Who would pay to have

                   Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System | 1027
           the buses modified to put doors on the left hand side?4

75. Key Points in Chapter
Eleven

  · What three initial characteristics of an organizing system
      influence most of the decisions about that organizing system?
      Most of the specific decisions that must be made for an
      organizing system are shaped by the initial decisions about its
      domain, scope, and scale.
      (See "The Organizing System Lifecycle")

  · What is the effect of broad scope in an organizing system?
      The impact of broad scope arises more from the heterogeneity
      of the resources and users in a collection rather than from their
      absolute number.
      (See "Scope and Scale of the Collection")

  · What is a practical effect of increasing collection size?
      Larger collections need more people to organize and maintain
      them, creating communication and coordination problems that
      grow much faster than the collection.
      (See "Scope and Scale of the Collection")

  · How do you avoid problems of scope and scale?
      Standardization is the best way to prevent problems of scope
      and scale.
      (See "Scope and Scale of the Collection")

  · What is an effect of a heterogeneous user community?

                                                        Key Points in Chapter Eleven | 1029
      Organizing systems in the same domain and with nominally
      the same scope can differ substantially in the resources they
      contain and the interactions they support if they have different
      categories of users.

      (See "Number and Nature of Users")

  · How can designers mitigate possible negative consequences of
      the system and technology they design?

      Designers who recognize that their systems have real
      consequences for people should commit to measures of
      transparency and an ongoing process of negotiation that
      enables those affected to voice concerns related to any
      detrimental effects the technology might have on them and
      their communities.

      (See "Number and Nature of Users")

  · What is the single biggest factor affecting the implementation
      of interactions?

      For most organizing systems other than personal ones, the set
      of interactions that are implemented in an organizing system is
      strongly determined by economic factors.

      (See "Requirements for Interactions")

  · What is the most essential requirement of interactions?

      An essential requirement in every organizing system is ensuring
      that the supported interactions can be discovered and invoked
      by their intended users.

      (See "Requirements for Interactions")

  · What is the role of computational agents in the creation and
      consumption of resource descriptions?

1030 | Key Points in Chapter Eleven
   Automated and computerized processes can create the
   resource descriptions in an organizing system and their use is
   primarily driven by scale.

   (See "About the Nature and Extent of Resource Description")

· What is the relationship between organizing principles and
   resource descriptions?

   Organizing principles depend on resource descriptions, so
   requirements for the former are always intertwined with those
   for the latter.

   (See "About Intentional Arrangement")

· What characteristics of resource descriptions impede growth?

   Overly customized and inflexible resource descriptions or
   arrangements cannot easily accommodate the future growth of
   the collection.

   (See "Designing and Implementing an Organizing System")

· What are the advantages of architectural thinking?

   Architectural thinking leads to more modularity and
   abstraction in design, making it easier to change an
   implementation to satisfy new requirements or to take
   advantage of new technologies or procedures.

   (See "Architectural Thinking")

· What is big data?

   For digital resources, inexpensive storage and high bandwidth
   have largely eliminated capacity as a constraint for organizing
   systems, with an exception for big data, which is defined as
   a collection of data that is too big to be managed by typical
   database software and hardware architectures.

      (See "Architectural Thinking")
  · What are the most predictable maintenance activities?

      The most predictable maintenance activities for an organizing
      system with an expected long lifetime are incremental changes
      in description vocabularies and classification schemes.
      Another very predictable type of activity over time with
      organizing systems is a technology upgrade that improves its
      quality or capabilities without affecting the organizing
      principles.
      (See "Properties, Principles and Technology Perspective")
  · What changes in organizing systems make maintenance
      especially difficult?
      The most challenging kinds of maintenance activities for
      organizing systems involve changes to the principles for
      arranging resources along with changes in the implementing
      technology.
      (See "Properties, Principles and Technology Perspective")
  · What six questions should be asked when approaching any
      organizing system?
      What resources are being organized? Why are the resources
      being organized? Who does the organizing? When are the
      resources organized? Where are the resources organized? How
      much are the resources organized?

Case Study Template

For the sake of consistency, we employ the questions posed in
Design Decisions in Organizing Systems as a template for the case

                                                                              Case Studies | 1035
studies. We remind you of six groups of design decisions, itemizing
the most important dimensions in each group:

  · What is being organized? What is the scope and scale of the
      domain? What is the mixture of physical things, digital things,
      and information about things in the organizing system? Is the
      organizing system being designed to create a new resource
      collection, catalog an existing and closed resource collection, or
      manage a collection in which resources are continually added
      or deleted? Are the resources unique, or are they
      interchangeable members of a category? Do they follow a
      predictable "life cycle" with a "useful life"? Does the organizing
      system use the interaction resources created through its use,
      or are these interaction resources extracted and aggregated for
      use by another organizing system? ("What Is Being Organized?")

  · Why is it being organized? What interactions or services will
      be supported, and for whom? Are the uses and users known
      or unknown? Are the users primarily people or computational
      processes? Does the organizing system need to satisfy personal,
      social, or institutional goals? ("Why Is It Being Organized?")

  · How much is it being organized? What is the extent,
      granularity, or explicitness of description, classification, or
      relational structure being imposed? What organizing principles
      guide the organization? Are all resources organized to the same
      degree, or is the organization sparse and non-uniform? ("How
      Much Is It Being Organized?")

  · When is it being organized? Is the organization imposed on
      resources when they are created, when they become part of the
      collection, when interactions occur with them, just in case, just
      in time, all the time? Is any of this organizing mandated by law
      or shaped by industry practices or cultural tradition? ("When Is
      It Being Organized?")

1036 | Case Studies
  · How or by whom, or by what computational processes, is
      it being organized? Is the organization being performed by
      individuals, by informal groups, by formal groups, by
      professionals, by automated methods? Are the organizers also
      the users? Are there rules or roles that govern the organizing
      activities of different individuals or groups? ("How (or by
      Whom) Is It Organized?")

  · Where is it being organized? Is the resource location
      constrained by design or by regulation? Are the resources
      positioned in a static location? Are the resources in transit or in
      motion? Does their location depend on other parameters, such
      as time? ("Where is it being Organized?")

As we discussed in "Where is it being Organized?", when location
is a constraint, it will typically be identified as such in the other
questions. As result, we will only examine "Where?" as distinct
design dimension in cases where it is warranted.

                                                                               Case Studies | 1037
 76. A Multi-generational
 Photo Collection

   Overview. Your grandfather has died, at age 91, and under his bed
   is a suitcase containing several photo albums with a few hundred
   photos. Some of them have captions, but many do not. What do you
   do with them?

   Your first thought was to create a digital photo archive of Grandpa's
   collection so that you and all your relatives could see them, and
   you would also want to generate accurate captions where none
   exist. Since you have an extensive digital photo collection of your
   own in a web-based application, perhaps you can combine the two
   collections to create a multi-generational photo organizing system.

   This project involves digitization, archiving, social media issues, and
   negotiations with and collecting information from other family
   members who might have different views about what to do.

      What is being organized? It is easy to find advice about how to
   digitize old photos, but there are more choices than you might
   think. What resolution and format should you use? Should you do
   the work yourself or send Grandpa's precious photos to a service
   and take the risk that they might get lost? Should you do any
   restoration or enhancement of the photos as part of the digitization
   process?1

   More fundamental design questions concern the scope and scale
   of the organizing system. If you are digitizing Grandpa's photos

1. (Ctein 2010) and (Taylor 2010) are popular guides for
  photo digitization and restoration.

                                                                        A Multi-generational Photo
                                                                                     Collection | 1039
   and combining them with yours, you are skipping a generation.
   Should not you also include photos from your parents and the rest
   of Grandpa's children? That generation has both printed photos
   and digital ones, but it is not as comfortable with computers as
   you are, and their digital photos are stored less systematically on
   a variety of CD-ROM, DVDs, flash memory sticks, and SD photo
   cards, making the digitizing and organizing work more complicated.
   Do these differences in storage media reflect an intentional
   arrangement that needs to be preserved? And what about that box
   full of Super 8 cartridges and VHS tapes with family videos on them,
   and the audio cassettes with recordings made at long-ago family
   gatherings?

   A family history management system that includes many different
   resource types is a much bigger project than the one you
   contemplated when you first opened Grandpa's suitcase. It is easier
   to consider using separate but related organizing systems for each
   media type, because there are many web-based applications you
   could use. In fact, there are far too many choices of web applications
   for you to consider. You might compare some for their functionality
   and usability, but given the long expected lifetime of your
   organizing system there are more critical considerations: whether
   the site is likely to last as long as your collection and, if it does
   not, how easily you can export your resources and resource
   descriptions.2

2. For example, http://web.appstorm.net/roundups/media-

   roundups/top-20-photo-storage-and-sharing-sites/

   reviews 20 photo storage and sharing sites and

   http://photo-book-review.toptenreviews.com/

   compares 10 sites for creating printed albums from
   digital photos in case you want to "round trip" from

    1040 | A Multi-generational Photo Collection
   Why is it being organized? The overall goal of preserving
Grandpa's photos needs no justification, but is preservation the
primary goal? Or, rather, is to enable access to the images for far-
flung family members? Or is it to create a repository for family
photos as they continue to be produced? Alternatively, is it less
about the images themselves and perhaps more about collecting
family history information contained in the photos, thus making the
collection of metadata (accurate information about when and where
the photo was taken, who is in it, etc.) most important?

These decisions determine requirements for the interactions that
the photo organizing system must support, but the repertoire of
interactions is mostly determined by the choice of photo storage
and sharing application. Some applications combine photo storage
in a cloud-based repository tied to a very powerful set of digital
photography tools, but this functionality comes with complexity
that would overwhelm your less technology-savvy relatives. They
would be happy just to be able to browse and search for photos.

   How much is it being organized? Because you realize that a
carefully designed set of categories and a controlled tagging
vocabulary will enable precise browsing and search, you chose an
application that supports grouping and tagging. But not everyone
should be allowed to group or tag photos, and maybe some of the
more distant relatives can view photos but not add any.

Will your categories and tags include all of those that Grandpa used
when he arranged pictures in albums and made notes on the back
of many of them? Do you want to allow annotations? Maybe this is
a picture from a vacation; if you go back to the same place, do you
want to create an association between the pictures?

Grandpa's photos and print photo books for family
members.

                                           A Multi-generational Photo Collection | 1041
   Do not forget to keep Grandpa's original albums in a safe place, not
   under a bed somewhere.

      When is it being organized? Once you create your categories and
   tags, you can require people to use them when they add new photos
   to the collection. Perhaps the existing resource descriptions can be
   completed or enhanced as a collective activity at a family reunion.
   Do not put this off too long--the people who can identify Grandpa's
   sister Gladys, her second husband, and his sister in an uncaptioned
   photo are getting on in years.

      How or by whom is it being organized? You have taken on the
   role of the editor and curator, but you cannot do everything and
   having a group of people involved will probably result in more
   robust organizing. A group can also better handle sticky situations
   like what to do if people get divorced or have a falling out with other
   family members; do pictures taken of or by them get deleted?

      Other considerations. Maintenance of this collection for an
   indefinite time raises the important issue or a succession plan for
   the curator. If only one name is on the account and only that person
   knows the password, you run the risk of losing access to the photos
   if that person dies. One of Grandpa's mistakes was dying without
   clearly specifying his intentions for his photo collection, so
   whatever you decide you should document carefully and include a
   continuity plan when you are no longer the curator.3

 77. Knowledge Management
 for a Small Consulting Firm

   Overview. A senior professor who has done part-time consulting for
   many years is very pleased when his latest book becomes a best-
   seller and he is inundated with new consulting opportunities. He
   decides to take a two-year leave of absence from his university to
   start a small consulting firm with several of his current and former
   graduate students as his junior consulting partners.

   An organizing system for knowledge management is required, but
   what gets designed will depend on the scoping decision. Is the
   goal of the system to support the consulting business, or also to
   support ongoing and future research projects that sooner or later
   will generate the consulting opportunities?

      What is being organized? The professor concludes that since
   his consulting is based on his research, he needs to include in
   the new knowledge management system his research articles and
   the raw and analyzed data that is discussed in the articles. These
   resources are already organized to a great extent according to the
   research project that led to their creation. These have been kept in
   the professor's university office.

   The professor also has a separate collection of consulting proposals,
   client reports, and presentations that he has made at client firms.
   Because of restrictive university rules about faculty consulting, the
   professor has always kept these resources in his home office rather
   than on campus.1

1. http://www.spo.berkeley.edu/guide/consultquick.html
  is an example of such a policy. Indeed, it is because of

                                                            Knowledge Management for a Small
                                                                             Consulting Firm | 1043
   In addition to these existing resource types, it will be necessary to
   create new ones that make systematic and explicit information that
   the professor has managed in an informal and largely tacit manner.
   This includes consulting inquiries, information about prospects, and
   information about specific people in client firms.

      Why is it being organized? The professor has usually just done
   one consulting project at a time, very opportunistically. He has often
   turned down projects that involved more work than he could do
   himself. He now sees the opportunity to do much more consulting
   and to take on more significant projects if he can leverage his
   expertise in a more efficient way.

   The professor can take on the "rainmaker" role to secure new
   consulting engagements and make the important decisions, and he
   is confident that he can train and support his new staff of current
   and former students to do much of the actual consulting work.

   The knowledge management system must enable everyone in the
   firm to access and contribute to project repositories that contain
   proposals, plans, work in progress, and project deliverables. Much of
   this work can be reused from one project to another, increasing the
   productivity of the firm and the quality of its deliverables.2

   Just as it is essential that the professor's knowledge is systematized
   and made available via a knowledge management system, so must
   the knowledge created by the new staff of consultants. The
   professor cannot expect that all of the students will work for him

   rules like these that the professor determined he needed
   to take a leave of absence from the university.

2. For a high-level theoretical framework about capturing
   value from knowledge assets see (Teece 1998); for a
   detailed case study see (Goodwin et al. 2012).

    1044 | Knowledge Management for a Small Consulting Firm
   forever, so any knowledge that they acquire and create in the course
   of their work will be lost to the firm unless it is captured along with
   the professor's.

   The consulting firm probably will not have an indefinite lifetime.
   After his leave of absence, the professor might return to his
   university duties, perhaps on a part-time basis. The knowledge
   management system will enable him to leave the firm in someone
   else's hands while enabling him to keep tabs on and possibly
   contribute to ongoing projects. Alternatively, if the firm is doing
   very well, perhaps the professor will resign his university position
   and take on the role of growing the firm. A larger consultancy might
   want to acquire the professor's firm, and the firm's valuation will in
   part be determined be the extent to which the firm's capabilities and
   resources are documented in the knowledge management system.

      How much is it being organized? A small firm has neither the
   money nor the people to invest in complex technology and a
   rigorous process for knowledge management, but appropriate
   technology is readily available and affordable. Decisions about
   organizing principles must be made that reflect the mix of
   consulting projects; resources might be organized in a shared file
   system by customer type, project type, the lead consultant, or all of
   these ways using a faceted classification approach.

   Standard document templates and style sheets for the resource
   types created by consultants can be integrated into word
   processors and spreadsheets. Contact and customer management
   functionality can be licensed as a hosted application.

   Many small teams make good use of wikis for knowledge
   management because they are very flexible in the amount of
   structure they impose.3

3. (Poole and Grudin 2010).

                           Knowledge Management for a Small Consulting Firm | 1045
      When is it being organized? The professor's decision to take a
   leave of absence reflects his belief that getting the firm started
   quickly is essential if he is to capitalize on his recent bestselling
   book to generate consulting business. This makes managing the
   prospect pipeline and the proposal-writing process the highest
   priority targets for knowledge management.
   Much of the other organizing work can emerge as adjuncts to
   consulting projects if some effort is made to coordinate the
   organizing across projects.

      How or by whom is it being organized? Because many of the early
   organizing decisions have implications for the types of customers
   and projects that the firm can take on, only the professor is capable
   of making most of them. The principal goal of the knowledge
   management system is to enable the professor to delegate work to
   his consulting staff, so he needs to enlist them in the design of the
   organizing system to ensure it is effective.

      Other considerations. As the consulting firm grows, it is
   inevitable that some consultants will be better than others at
   creating and using knowledge to create customer value, and they
   will expect to be compensated accordingly. It is essential for the
   ongoing success of the firm not to let this create disincentives for
   knowledge capture and sharing between consultants. The solution
   is to develop a company culture that promotes and rewards them.4

78. Smarter Farming in Japan

Overview. Unlike the first two case studies, this is an actual case
rather than a hypothetical or composite one. It shares with the
first two cases a focus on preserving valuable resources but in the
radically different domain of farming.

This case concerns an initiative by Fujitsu, a Japanese technology
firm, to apply "smart computing" and lean manufacturing
techniques to the agricultural sector, which lags in technology use.
Fujitsu is testing a "farm work management system" at six Japanese
farms. In this case study we will focus on the farm highlighted in a
2011 Wall Street Journal story.1

This test farm is located in southern Japan. It has 60 different crops
spread over 100 hectares (about 250 acres), an area slightly larger
than the central campus of the University of California at Berkeley.

   What is being organized? Sensors are deployed in each of 300
different farm plots to collect readings on temperature, soil, and
moisture levels. Video cameras also monitor each plot.

The 72 relatively unskilled workers on the farm are also managed
resources. Each of them carries a mobile phone for communication,
transmission of pictures, and GPS tracking of their location.

   Why is it being organized? The highest-level goal for Fujitsu is
to expand its reach as a technology firm by applying the concepts
of lean manufacturing, statistical process control, and continual
improvement to new domains. Farming is an obvious choice in Japan
because it is a relatively unproductive sector where the average
age is over sixty. It is essential that farms use more computing

1. (Wakabayashi 2011).

                        Smarter Farming in Japan | 1047
   capability to increase efficiency and to capture and reuse the scarce
   knowledge possessed by aging workers.

   The Fujitsu farm work management system supports numerous
   types of interactions to achieve these goals. For example, workers
   can send pictures of infected crops for diagnosis by an expert
   farmer in the farm's office, who can then investigate further by
   studying recorded video from the affected plot.

   As more farms deploy the Fujitsu system, the aggregated knowledge
   and sensor information can be analyzed to enable economies of
   scale that will allow separate and widely distributed farms to
   function as if they were all part of a single large firm with
   centralized management.2

      How much is it being organized? The current design of the
   system treats farm workers as relatively passive resources that are
   managed very closely. The system generates a daily schedule of
   planting, maintenance, harvesting, and other activities for each
   worker. At a daily wrap-up meeting the farm manager reviews each
   worker's performance based on GPS and sensor readings.

   The sensor data is analyzed and organized extensively by Fujitsu
   computers to make recommendations, both agricultural ones (e.g.,
   what crop grows best in each plot and the work schedule that
   optimizes quality and yield) and business ones (the profitability of
   growing this crop on this plot of land).

      When is it being organized? The farm work management system
   is continually organizing and reorganizing what it knows about the
   farm as it analyzes sensor and production information. In contrast,

2. (Hori, Kawashima, and Yamazaki 2010). Fujitsu expects
   that the system will eventually integrate business
   management functions, production history, and
   operational support for best practices.

    1048 | Smarter Farming in Japan
   the information created by the workers is captured but its analysis
   is deferred to an expert.

   It is conceivable that as the farm workers become more expert
   as a result of the guidance and instruction they receive from the
   system that they can be more autonomous and do more analysis
   and interpretation on their own. It is also likely that the inexorable
   forces of Moore's law will enable more data collection and more
   processing of the sensor data at its time of collection, which might
   result in increased real-time information exchange with the
   workers.

      How or by whom is it being organized? The physical organization
   of the farm, with 300 small plots of land with 60 different fruits
   and vegetables, is the legacy arrangement of the farm before the
   Fujitsu trial began. Because of the sizable investment that Fujitsu
   has made in the farm to deploy the system, it is likely that the farm
   manager defers to recommendations made by the system to change
   crop arrangements. So it is reasonable to conclude that most of the
   decisions about the organizing system are made by computational
   processes rather than by people.

      Other considerations. Fujitsu built this system for managing
   farms, but there are several other resource domains with similar
   challenges about capturing and reusing operational knowledge:
   vineyards, forests, and fish farms come to mind.3 It will be
   interesting to see if the farm work management system can be made
   more abstract and configurable so that the same system can be used
   in all of these domains.

   Farm crops, vineyards, trees, and fish pens do not move around,
   so a more challenging application of sensor technologies arises
   with cattle herd management. Nevertheless, sensors inserted in

3. See(Burrell, Brooke, and Beckwith 2004) for a study of the
   use of sensor networks in Oregon vineyards.

                                                                 Smarter Farming in Japan | 1049
   the genitals of a female dairy cow can trigger a text message to a
   herd manager's cell phone when the cow is in heat, preventing the
   economic loss of missing a reproductive cycle.4
   Somewhat more remote domains for potential application of
   systems that combine sensor networks with workforce
   management include sales, field support, and logistics.

   "sexting" by cows.

 79. Single-Source Textbook
 Publishing

   Overview. The fourth case is also an actual case--a self-referential
   one. It is a case study about the organizing system involved in
   the creation, production, and distribution of The Discipline of
   Organizing. See (Glushko 2015).

   We have known since the beginning of this project that this book
   should not just be a conventional text. A printed book is an
   intellectual snapshot that is already dated in many respects the day
   it is published. In addition, the pedagogical goal of The Discipline
   of Organizing as a textbook for information schools and similar
   programs is made more difficult by the relentless growth of
   computing capability and the resulting technology innovation in
   our information-intensive economy and culture. We think that the
   emergence of ebook publishing opens up innovative possibilities as
   long as we can use a single set of source files to produce and update
   the print and digital versions of this book.

      What is being organized? The content of this book began in early
   2010 as more than 1000 slides and associated instructor notes for a
   graduate course "Information Organizing and Retrieval" that Robert
   J. Glushko, the primary author and editor of The Discipline of
   Organizing, was teaching at the University of California, Berkeley.
   These slides and notes were created in XML and transformed to
   HTML for presentation in a web browser.1

1. (Wilde and Catin 2007). Looking back it seems ironic to

The first decision to be made about resource organization led to the
iterative sorting of the slides from 26 lectures into the 10 chapters
in the initial outline for the book. The second decision concerned
the granularity of the new content resources being created for the
book. The team of authors was organized by chapters, which made
chapters the natural granularity for file management and version
control. Because authors were widely dispersed we relied on the
Dropbox cloud storage service to synchronize work. Nevertheless,
the broad and deep topical coverage of the book meant that
chapters had substantial internal structure (four levels of headings
in some places), and many of these subsections became separately
identified resources that moved from chapter to chapter until they
found their natural home.

In addition to the text content and illustrations that make up the
printed text, we needed to organize short videos, interactive
examples, and other applications to incorporate in digital versions
of the book.

Finally, it has been essential to view the software that transforms,
assembles, formats, and assigns styles when turning source files
into deliverable artifacts as resources that must be managed. For
the first and second editions of the book, we were fortunate to
get much of the software required to build both print and ebooks
from O'Reilly and Associates, an innovative technology publisher
that has been developing a single-source publishing system called
Atlas. Because we have recently been experimenting with including
richer interactivity and navigation capability, reader-controlled
personalization, and other features that go beyond what Atlas
enables, we now use our own custom-built single-source publishing
system.

the files Word back to XML to enable single-source
publishing.

1052 | Single-Source Textbook Publishing
   Why is it being organized? Publishing print and ebook versions of
a text from the same source files is the only way to produce both in
a cost-effective and maintainable fashion. Approaches that require
any "hand-crafting" would make it impossible to revise the book on
a timely schedule. Furthermore, a survey of Berkeley students in the
summer of 2012 revealed a great diversity of preferred platforms
for reading digital books that included laptop computers, Apple and
Android tablets, and seven different dedicated ebook readers. Only
an automated single-source publishing strategy could produce all
these outputs.

The highly granular structure for the content resources that
comprise this book makes cross-referencing vastly more precise,
making it easier to use the book as a textbook and job aid. It will
also make it easier to maintain and adapt the text for use in online
courses. (The emerging best practice for online courses is to break
up lectures and study content into smaller units than used in
traditional classroom lectures.)

   How much is it being organized? The nature and extent of
resource organization for this book reflects its purpose of bringing
together multiple disciplines that recognize organizing as a
fundamental issue but from different perspectives. The book
contains many specialized topics and domain-specific examples
that might overwhelm the shared concepts. Our solution was to
write a lean core text and to move much of the disciplinary and
domain-specific content into tagged endnotes. These categories
of endnotes are somewhat arbitrary, but the authoring task of
identifying content to go into endnotes is a non-trivial one.

The extent of resource organization is also affected by the choice
of XML vocabulary, and we carefully considered whether to choose
DITA or DocBook. DITA has the benefit of having more native
support for modular authoring and transparent customization and

                                               Single-Source Textbook Publishing | 1053
   updating, but DocBook is much older and hence has better toolkits.
   We eventually chose DocBook.2

      When is it being organized? Despite the fact that the lecture
   notes with which the book began were in XML, we decided to
   author the book using Microsoft Word. Many of the authors had
   little experience with XML editors, and the highly developed
   commenting and revision management facilities in Word proved
   very useful. This tradeoff imposed the burden of converting files to
   XML during the production process, but only two of the authors
   were still working on the book at that stage, and both have decades
   of experience with hypertext markup languages.

      How or by whom is it being organized? The chapter authors
   used Word style sheets in a careful manner, tagging text with styles
   rather than using formatting overrides. This enabled a conversion
   vendor to convert most of the book from Word to XML semi-
   automatically. Some cleanup of the markup is inevitable because of
   the ambiguity created when the source markup with Word styles
   is less granular than the target markup in XML. We do not know
   whether the amount of work left for us was atypical.

   Nevertheless, waiting until the book was substantially finished to
   convert to XML meant that we were also deferring the effort to
   mark up the text with cross references, citations, glossary terms,
   and index entries, because these types of content were not included
   in the Word authoring templates and style sheets. As a result, a
   substantial amount of effort has been required of our copy and
   markup editor that could have been done by chapter editors if they
   had authored natively in XML. However, having a single markup
   editor has given this book a more consistent and complete

   resource for DITA-based publishing. The definitive
   source for DocBook has long been (Walsh 2010).

    1054 | Single-Source Textbook Publishing
bibliography, glossary, and index than would be have possible with
multiple authors.

   Other considerations. Because every bit of content in the book
is tagged as either "core" or discipline-specific, our source files
collectively represent a "family of books" with 2048 different
members, any one of which we can build by filtering the content
to include any combination from zero to eleven disciplines. It is
impractical to publish this many editions, but we hope to use this
flexibility to enable instructors to tailor the text for a wide range
of courses in many different academic disciplines and customize
the text for both graduate and undergraduate students. Better still
would be an approach that defers the generation of a particular
version of an ebook from "publishing time" to "reading time." The
same algorithms apply, but now the reader decides when and how
to apply them, enabling the dynamic configuration of the book's
content. This radical capability is experimental as of August 2015,
but we expect it to generally available before too long.
This design for a book challenges conventional definitions of book
editions and forces us to imagine new ways to acknowledge
collaborative authorship. But asking "What is The Discipline of
Organizing?," given these new authoring and publishing models,
is a similar question to the one asked in Resources in Organizing
Systems, "What is Macbeth?"

80. Organizing a Kitchen

By Emilie Hardman, April 2013.
   Overview. Just about everyone has a kitchen in their home or

apartment, and most kitchens contain many of the same resources.
These include pots and pans, dishes, bowls, drinking glasses,
silverware, and cooking tools of various kinds. Kitchens are also
often the location for organizing food items, cooking ingredients,
spices, wine, and other beverages. Kitchens also invariably contain
refrigerators and freezers for storing prepared and preserved food.
The organizing system for a kitchen is highly influenced by the
size, shape, and arrangement of the counters, cabinets, shelves, and
other parts of the physical environment of the kitchen. A person
building a new home might be able to design this kitchen
environment, but most people treat this as a given and work within
its affordances, often because there are limits to how much the
physical environment can be easily changed.

What is being organized? Our wine, wine glasses, cocktail glasses
and ingredients, as well as tea and coffee stuff were stored in the
cabinet by the fridge, close to the center worktable so people could
have easy access to them. Because of space limitations, this meant
that our water glasses had to be somewhere else, but as we would
usually put out water for dinner parties or have a pitcher and
glasses on a tray when people came over, we thought this was
reasonable, since the things people would most often be looking for
and need easy access to for themselves would be these more social
drinking glasses.

We also bought a freestanding worktable with a butcher's block
and stainless steel for pastry and chocolate work, as well as extra

                                                                   Organizing a Kitchen | 1057
counter space in general. It worked as a prep space and as an area
to lay out finished dishes or drinks for people to serve themselves
when we had parties.

Some kitchen tools were kept with the food items to which they
applied: for example, the coffee and the coffee grinder, or the
cutting board, toaster, bread knife and bread all together. Other
tools were kept with like tools: potato peelers, julienne tools, knives,
etc. This was probably because of the kind of flexibility something
like a potato peeler would have versus a coffee grinder; it also made
more sense to put lots of these little things together in a drawer
rather than leave them strewn out around the apples or potatoes.

Pots and pans had their own spaces and were stacked within one
another; same with dishes. Most frequently used things were given
preference over specialty tools.

Other things that were organized around the social dimensions
of the kitchen were some food items and serving elements. For
example, we used bowls to organize chocolate bars and treats that
might easily be grabbed to set out and serve. Similarly, we kept
stacks of serving bowls easily at hand so we could empty pretzels or
tortilla chips, olives, etc., quickly and casually.

   Why is it being organized? We wanted to emphasize a feeling of
comfort and openness in our kitchen, so people would feel free to
get what they wanted when they needed it. It also had to work on a
practical level to be an efficient work area in a small space, so those
concerns had to be balanced as well.

   When is it being organized? We ended up moving silverware
at one point because friends would consistently open a particular
drawer in our center work island to look for silverware. Initially, I
had specialized tools in that drawer because they were what I would
reach for when I was working on something like making chocolates,
but because of the continuous confusion, we moved those tools
to another drawer and put the silverware where people seemed to
expect it.

1058 | Organizing a Kitchen
The fridge and freezer was organized by type of food for orderliness,
ease of access, and immediacy of knowing when we had. We have
a pull-out freezer, so things could get a little hidden, but assuming
no one had compromised the system, you would know it was frozen
fruit all of the way down in one segment and flours in another.

Some food items demanded different placement or storage based
on their ripeness, the season, etc. In August we might be overrun
with tomatoes, for example, and the window sills would fill up with
them, whereas we would usually put them in a bowl if there were
just a few.

   How or by whom is it being organized? I think one thing to sum
up would be to say that my partner is a librarian and I am trained as
an archivist. We both care about classification and public service, so
as people who also entertain a lot, I think these very practical and
intuitive systems of grouping things is a motivation.

My father, an engineer who in his retirement does a lot of
woodworking, built two cabinets that would just fit into the space
and provide more storage than the two upper cabinets and three
base cabinets provided in the kitchen.

   Other considerations. The whole kitchen was not organized
around guests, though. We also arranged things to be practical for
cooking and for space saving. Food in the cabinets was organized
by general function: for example, there was a shelf of dried beans
in jars, another of dried chilies and spices--things that give flavor.
Spices were organized within that by general type in rows and then
alphabetically within those rows. This was because the rows helped
group things which might be likely used together (e.g., cinnamon,
cloves, mace, nutmeg) and alphabetically because so many of them
look the same from the outside; knowing that the oregano would
necessarily be shelved before the thyme was useful. Beans, though,
because they are more immediately identifiable, less used, and
certainly not as often used in concert (as one would with spices),
I was a little more loose with and sometimes just arranged to a
general aesthetic preference; if we had heirloom money beans, I

                                                                   Organizing a Kitchen | 1059
might have preferred to see them over the standard red lentils, for
example.

81. Earth Orbiting Satellites

By Daniel Brenners, December 2014.
   Overview. Twenty two thousand miles above our heads, a global

race for orbital real estate is underway. A single circular orbit
around the Earth, called the geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), is the
only area in space that allows a satellite to remain in a fixed point
in the sky above Earth's surface while it rotates.1 This prime location
allows for satellites to have consistent communication with the
ground below. Satellite television, a $100 billion industry, relies on
satellites within the GEO to broadcast signals to homes across the
world. Global positioning systems (GPS) and military applications
also depend on satellites within this thin ring around the Earth.
Unfortunately, space is severely limited in the GEO, and tension
is growing over who gets to send their satellites to this valuable
parking lot in the sky. The principles used to organize which
satellites get to be placed in the GEO have many unforeseen legal
and sociopolitical complications. As room becomes limited, it
becomes increasingly important to find a solution to the problem
of multiple organizing agents competing to organize this system to
support varying interactions.

   What is being organized? The scope of resources being
organized are the satellites being deployed to the GEO. These are
physical objects that have been launched into orbit. The satellites
are each unique and are able to provide a variety of interactions. The
only unifying attribute that they share is that they are computers
that are able to send and receive radio signals to and from Earth.
To stay in orbit, they are also able to adjust their position with
propulsion systems.

This organizing system is designed to manage a collection in which
resources are continually added and removed. The International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) records which portions of the
orbit are already occupied.2 Satellites cannot stay in the orbit

                                                               Earth Orbiting Satellites | 1061
forever, as they expend lots of energy performing computational
processes and maintaining orbit, and eventually run out of power.
The resources follow a lifecycle that is unique to each individual
resource, but the timescale is typically one to fifteen years.3

   Why is it being organized? Satellites are being organized in the
GEO to support several interactions. The GEO allows satellites to
move at the same rate as the Earth, giving it a stationary view of
more than 40 percent of the Earth's surface. Such a view is ideal
for broadcasting signals to large regions and performing remote
sensing, such as weather forecasting. They also serve as crucial
relay points to transfer telecommunications across the globe. Other
interactions that these satellites provide include surveillance,
scientific research, global positioning, navigation, and military
reconnaissance.3 Longitudinal positioning along the GEO shapes
which interactions can occur and which users can interact with the
satellite. For instance, a satellite directly over the Atlantic Ocean
may not be well suited to broadcast a television signal, but may be
positioned to relay signals from North America to Europe.

The users are practically everyone on Earth. Civilians use
geostationary satellites directly when they use GPS or need to have
a call relayed to distant regions of the world. Commercial
organizations, such as television providers, use these satellites to
broadcast signals down to viewers. Geostationary satellites are also
particularly useful for early warning systems used by the military to
detect ballistic events around the globe.

   How much is it being organized? If resources are able to be
placed in the GEO, they are placed in a vacant slot that the applicant
chooses, based on what types of interactions they want to support
and what users they want interacting with the satellite. To prevent
signal interference and collision, satellites need to be placed very
far apart, leaving only 2,000 total orbital slots where satellites can
be placed in the GEO.4 The ITU uses a first-come, first-served
organizing principle to decide which resources are placed into

1062 | Earth Orbiting Satellites
orbital slots, provided the applicant completes the lengthy
application process.

The organization applying for the slot chooses where to place its
satellite. The ITU catalogs these slots as degrees longitude, and
includes other resource descriptions such as the name of the
satellite, country of operator, types of users, mass, expected
lifetime, and contractor.3 Organizations choose to place satellites
around the longitude of the Earth that the satellite is supposed to
interact with. Since the latitude is fixed at zero degrees, countries
with the same longitude but different latitudes (countries directly
north or south of each other) must vie for the same slots.

   When is it being organized? Satellites are added as soon as they
can be approved by the ITU and launched into orbit. At the end of
their life cycle, the Federal Communications Commission mandates
that U.S. satellites are pushed into what is called the graveyard orbit,
which is a few hundred kilometers outside of the GEO.5 At this
point, another satellite can be added to the vacant slot via the ITU
application process.

   How or by whom is it being organized? Many organizing agents
are competing with each other to organize this system according
to their own needs. Applications to occupy the GEO come from
countries, scientific organizations, companies, and civilians.
Satellite TV companies such as DirecTV, Dish Network, and Intelsat
own a large number of the slots across the western hemisphere.
Countries such as the United States, Russia, and the United
Kingdom own a majority of the military satellites, and multinational
European organizations own a large share of orbital slots as well.3

   Other considerations. Although the ITU serves as an
authoritative entity for this organizing system, the reality is that
the ambiguous legality of ownership in outer space means that
anyone can attempt to organize this system. The ITU is in place to
perform the useful task of cataloging occupied slots and facilitating
the filling of vacancies, but it has no way of enforcing these
guidelines.

                                                              Earth Orbiting Satellites | 1063
This organizing system is interesting because many agents are
attempting to organize the same system. There are also interesting
social implications that stem from the system's principles of
organization. The first-come, first-served system of the ITU has
the effect of allowing only technologically advanced organizations
to manage the collection. It does not take into consideration that
by the time many countries are finally ready to use this type of
technology, there will be no more room in the GEO belt.

Ironically, the only legal claim to sovereignty that has been made
of this organizing system has been from countries that, generally,
have no means of organizing it themselves. In 1976 eight equatorial
countries, which lie directly below the GEO belt, stated that they
had exclusive rights over these slots in a document known as the
Bogotá Declaration.6 The tenuous claim was that the orbit is not
a part of outer space, because its existence is solely dependent
on Earth's gravity, and that the earth within the borders of the
equatorial countries creates GEO with its gravitational pull. Many
experts disagree, stating that the gravitational pull from the moon
and other celestial bodies defines the GEO, and state that the orbit
does indeed lie in outer space because it is further than 100
kilometers from Earth. This demarcation, known as the Kármán
line, is a widely accepted definition of when space begins.7 This
would then make the GEO fall within the 1967 Outer Space Treaty,
effectively leaving no possibility for ownership of the orbit.

Finding a dividing line between space and Earth's atmosphere is an
interesting topic, especially considering that ownership of valuable
resources may be decided based on what is included in the category
of space versus the category of atmosphere. In this case, the
Kármán line roughly represents the altitude at which an aircraft
would have to propel itself faster than the speed at which the Earth
rotates to establish enough lift to keep itself up. While this is not
intuitive (hardly carving nature at its joints), it does serve as a useful
demarcation that is not completely arbitrary. It can be seen as a
goal-based category, where the goal is using traditional means of

1064 | Earth Orbiting Satellites
traveling through the air using aeronautics. It makes sense that this
is the line the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale uses to divide
astronautics and aeronautics.

The limited availability of spots in the GEO, along with the relatively
small number of countries able to launch satellites, has the potential
to further divide countries. By the time most countries will be able
to launch satellites, there will likely not be any room left. Although
there are only around 400 satellites currently in geostationary orbit,
there are already more filings for ITU applications than there are
spots available.4 Only a select few countries will be able to take
advantage of the GEO, leaving others to depend on these countries
for communication, scientific research, and surveillance.
Furthermore, this could limit the interactions of these less
developed countries to those interactions dictated by the countries
with geostationary satellites. In particular, these developed
countries can greatly influence the information that citizens in
other countries can receive via satellite.

But even within the technologically advanced countries,
competition for orbital slots may be heating up. In early 2014, the US
unveiled its Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program
(GSSAP), which aims to create maneuverable satellites that monitor
and protect the precious GEO belt.8 This reveal comes only months
after China was seen practicing its anti-satellite missile
capabilities.9 In Russia, $300 million is being spent to construct
a craft that would act as a "space broom" to push satellites out
of geostationary orbit. The US has a similar program, named the
Phoenix project under DARPA, developing a robotic device that can
help maintain satellites and possibly dismantle others without
causing excess space debris.

Although this might simply be countries attempting to flex their
military muscles, these technologies represent a newfound ability
for countries to organize resources in the GEO to fit their own
agenda. Years ago, the countries that were able to get satellites into

                                                              Earth Orbiting Satellites | 1065
orbit were the ones that could reap the benefits. Now, it seems that
we may be entering an age where a country's ability to make room
for itself, possibly by force, will determine if it can make use of
precious interactions created by these limited resources.

Interface Redesign

By Gracen Brilmyer, December 2014.
   Overview. The CalBug project, housed out of the The Essig

Museum of Entomology at the University of California, Berkeley, is
a collaborative initiative between nine California institutions with
a goal to digitize over a million specimens. Digitization involves
imaging both specimens and their labels as well as storing their
collection info in a database. The CalBug project also is attempting
to georeference, or locate the original latitude and longitude
coordinates, for these million specimens (some dating back to the
18th century) so that they can be better used for research. The
project uses many student workers, graduate students, and
volunteers to capture the images and data. Over the past few years,
it has participated in the Notes from Nature project, which helps
connect citizen scientists to scientific research. Through the images
generated of the specimen labels by the team at the Essig Museum,
citizen scientists digitally transcribe the data that can be read from
the image. The Essig, after each label is transcribed by 24 citizen
scientists, runs an R program to find the most accurate
transcription and transfer it into the Essig's database. These
combined efforts have accumulated in over 209,000 specimen
records and over 400,000 images and counting. This project has a
large scope and an ever-increasing scale.

   What is being organized? The insect specimens in the CalBug
project are digitized on an individual level, with unique identifying
numbers, and new specimen records and their associated data are
continually being added to the digital collection. Both the
specimens and their data are being organized. Existing groups of
specimens are prioritized for digitization and new physical

1068 | CalBug and its Search
Interface Redesign
specimens are accessioned into the collection and are databased
upon arrival.

   Why is it being organized? An individual specimen's associated
data can be highly variable; however, as long as a specimen has the
time and place of its collection (no matter how vague) associated
with it, it is valuable research material. The physical specimens are
organized to facilitate the collection manager's use of the collection.
When physical specimens need to be borrowed, they must be
efficiently found, packaged, and sent out on loan, so fastidious
organization is key when locating thousands of specimens. The
digital organization of the collection also facilitates the duties of
museum staff and the collection manager by allowing for expanded
interaction with the collection by using the database. The digital
collection's web interface, undergoing a redesign as of the time of
this writing, makes the collection accessible for researchers and
novices alike, as well as to foster data sharing to other data
repositories. Since the specimen data follows digital curatorial
standards, a web interface that allows these fields to be easily
searchable and navigable can add to the use of the collection for a
broader audience, which is a major impetus for the redesign.

CalBug's redesigned web search interface

How much is it being organized? As discussed in the previous
section, the specimens and their information are subject to multiple
levels of organization, and each level of organization supports a
different type of user. The data of the CalBug Project is organized
according to Darwin Core (DwC), a standard "designed to facilitate
the exchange of information about the geographic occurrence of
species and the existence of specimens in collections."1 Certain
specimen attributes have concrete institutional parameters, such

1070 | CalBug and its Search Interface Redesign
as unique identifying numbers and taxonomic identification, while
others have less strict parameters (e.g. a precise location of where a
specimen is found), although they still must use specific DwC fields.
Although there are institutional taxonomies in place for information
associated with a specimen's collection and identification, the
CalBug search interface design in Figure: CalBug search interface
allows for an outward-facing reorganization of the existing fields.

   When is it being organized, and by whom? The categorization
and organization happens at multiple times for one specimen. If
identified, the specimen is already inserted into the taxonomic
classification scheme--the hierarchy of how species are related.
This scientific warrant is inherited and replicated in the physical
curation of the collection, and specimens are further sorted (within
a taxon) by geographic region. Aligning with taxonomic categories
provides a clear hierarchy for sorting and locating physical
specimens and, with changes in taxonomy having to be published,
makes collection maintenance fairly consistent.

The specimens are organized a second time when they are
databased, either by interns or through Notes from Nature. The
data is stored in a MySQL database that uses mostly DwC fields,
an institutional taxonomy for specimen data. The digitization of
specimens, through utilizing DwC institutional semantics, makes
collection maintenance, governance, and interaction easier, as the
collection manager can search in a multifaceted manner, better
understand the holdings of the museum, and track specimens for
loans. The unique specimen numbers allow for individual tracking,
and the other DwC fields provide multiple areas for accurate search
and retrieval.

For the CalBug web search interface, the specimens retain their
classification hierarchy within the database. However, the outward-
facing search fields aim to serve a broader audience, not just the
collection manager and museum staff. Thus the search application
organizes the resources a third time "on the way out" of the
database in response to a user query. As this design is optimized for

                                        CalBug and its Search Interface Redesign | 1071
researchers and students, the classification appears to focus more
on taskonomy instead of the institutional taxonomy (see Figure:
CalBug search interface). The 20 search fields provided in the search
interface, while actually searching through the ~100 fields in the
database, facilitate precise information retrieval. Although fewer
search fields might yield lower accuracy, user testing has shown
that the new search design improves accuracy by not requiring
users to know exactly which DwC field to query.
Crosswalk Table

This crosswalk table maps the fields in the CalBug search interface
to the underlying database columns.
The search is further expanded by having a `Search any field' box,
which literally looks in every DwC field for a term, as well as a
1072 | CalBug and its Search Interface Redesign
"Common Name" field, to support novice searches, such as "beetle"

and "butterfly" instead of "coleoptera" and "lepidoptera." The

intrinsic properties of the specimens lend the results to simple

(alphabetic and numeric) sorting as well as filtering (through the

"Refine" option) on the list view of the results pages. Additional

views of results, including a map view showing collection locations

and a grid view that displays specimen photos, help users locate

desired specimens and reorganize as needed to suit their needs.

83. Weekly Newspaper

By Ian MacFarland, December 2013.
   Overview. A weekly neighborhood newspaper in New York City

now covers the entire borough of Queens. Rather than publish a
single weekly edition for this highly diverse area of more than 2
million people, its owners have opted to produce 14 separate
editions, each centered on a different neighborhood. All editions
share a deadline, delivery schedule, and staff pool, but each has
unique content tailored to its target readers.

   What is being organized? The newspaper's resources--its
content--consist mainly of articles and photos generated by staff
and freelance contributors throughout the week. Often,
newspapers will assign their reporters to beats based on subject
matter (politics, education, "cops and courts," etc.), making them
domain experts who cover stories on that beat throughout a wide
geographical area. However, because of this paper's historical
orientation toward "hyper-local" neighborhood news, it has given
each of its seven full-time reporters a more granular geographical
beat that corresponds to two of the 14 editions' coverage areas,
within which they are responsible for general assignment reporting.
Most reporters also have a specialty for covering news that is of
more general interest throughout the borough, such as citywide
government or transportation issues, and they will include coverage
of these domains in their story budgets for the week as well. The
staff maintains a centralized story list that includes a handful of
resource descriptions for each story: its slug (an abbreviated,
descriptive name, including tags for its relevant neighborhoods), its
length, and whether it has "art."

   Why is it being organized? The media market in New York is
crowded and extremely competitive, and this newspaper believes its
competitive edge lies in its laser-focus on individual neighborhoods.
Furthermore, most of its readers are subscribers who receive the

1074 | Weekly Newspaper
paper in the mail, not newsstand buyers. As a result, the paper
generally eschews the familiar tabloid approach of splashing the
most salacious story of the week across the front page and usually
fronts two stories that are "small-bore" but extremely relevant to
the neighborhood, such as the doings of local school or government
officials, notable crimes, or human-interest stories featuring
neighborhood residents. The deeper into the paper one goes, the
less local its content becomes, and stories often appear in more
than one edition, in different locations and even with different
headlines, to tailor them to an appropriate level of localization.

On a more general level, of course, the paper must support the
conventional interactions all readers expect from newspapers.
Readers are rarely expected to progress through the paper from
front to back, so it supports a wide variety of reading styles; large
headlines and photos and concise, compelling story "ledes" (opening
paragraphs) facilitate skimming and scanning interactions, and
dividing the paper into sections, such as "Opinion," "Sports," and
"Arts & Entertainment," lets readers skip directly to their areas of
interest after turning past page one.

   How much is it being organized? The level of organization behind
the scenes at this small, local newspaper is surprisingly complex.
The primary organizing principle that determines a story's
placement is its relevance, which is a function of location
granularity (does it directly affect the people of this neighborhood?
Did it happen here?), significance (will readers find it important?),
and time (is it old news? Has anyone else reported it yet?).
Counterbalancing that is the economic reality of the struggling
newspaper industry, which results in often severely limited space
for the news (because paper and press time are costly physical
constraints) and manpower with which to produce all 14 editions
before deadline. The result is a hierarchical system in which the 14
editions are categorized into three zones; in each zone, about two-
thirds of the pages are common to all editions, and the remaining
third (including, most crucially, pages one through three) are unique

                                                                      Weekly Newspaper | 1075
to each single edition. Thus, for instance, a general-interest story
about transportation need not be laid out 14 separate times, but
one about a fatal car accident can appear on page one for the
neighborhoods where it occurred and where the victims were from,
and further back (or not at all) for other neighborhoods.

   When is it being organized? In a weekly news cycle, selection,
creation, and organizing of editorial resources is largely concurrent.
The story list is updated on a rolling basis throughout the week, and
an article or photo's placement in the paper is often planned based
on its intended subject matter well in advance of when the resource
is actually created. However, organizing must be completed long
before it reaches its intended users, because the final layouts must
be printed, collated, and mailed to readers, which, due to logistical
concerns, takes several days--so the paper is laid out on Tuesday
(as late as possible to maximize the window for ad sales), printed
on Wednesday, and delivered by the Postal Service on Thursday or
Friday.

   How or by whom is it being organized? Human
agents--specifically, editors--are the newspaper's primary
organizers. They rely heavily on the judgment of the reporters, who
are most familiar with their beats, to determine a story's relevance
and placement for each edition, as well as their own news judgment,
assessment of the story's quality, and estimation of where the story
will physically fit based on ad placements (which are decided first).
The implementation of their organizing system is carried out by
page layout designers, with some software automation on the part
of the paper's content management system.

   Other considerations. Part of the grind of a weekly news cycle
is that the effectivity of the paper's resources is never guaranteed;
when the next edition comes out, they all become yesterday's news,
and one never knows when new developments will render a story
irrelevant or incorrect; in fact, because of the latency between
layout and delivery, a story's effectivity may even expire before its
publication.

84. The CODIS DNA
Database

By Becca Stanger, December 2013.
   Overview. Operating on a local, state, and federal level, the

Combined DNA Index System(CODIS) is the FBI DNA database. As
of October 2013, the National DNA Index(NDIS), or the federal level
of the CODIS, contained over 10,647,800 offender profiles, 1,677,100
arrestee profiles, and 522,200 forensic profiles. Designed to help
solve crimes, this database has generated over 255,400 hits and
has aided over 216,200 investigations. While this organizing system
has played a crucial role in reducing crime by enabling more
interactions in the law enforcement agency than ever before, it
provokes numerous ethical questions worth exploring.

   What is being organized? The CODIS database maintains digital
records or "DNA profiles" for a wide range of people involved in
criminal justice cases, including convicted offenders, arrestees,
missing persons, and more. Specifically, these profiles are
measurements of one or two alleles of 13 predetermined unique
genetic sequence loci. These precise measurements provide enough
granularity for the profiles to uniquely identify a single individual.

These resource descriptions are generated, often with polymerase
chain reaction technology, from the original DNA specimen
resources by accredited laboratories nationwide. Upon creation, the
resources themselves--the specimens--are kept at the laboratories,
while the resource descriptions--the digital profiles--are added to
the CODIS database. No offender personal identifiers are assigned
to the profiles; however, information on the submitting agency,
specimen, and personnel is stored with the profile.

Rather than focusing on collecting resource descriptions, the FBI
could have chosen to collect the original resources themselves.

                                                            The CODIS DNA Database | 1077
Presumably, though, this level of coordination of physical resources
(e.g., shipping, storage, maintenance, etc.) would have placed an
additional cost on the federal government and required legislative
approval. Thus, it is understandable that the FBI would choose to
minimize cost and effort by focusing on the resource descriptions
alone.

   Why is it being organized? In the past, law enforcement agencies
were limited to solving crimes within their geographic region. A
detective working on a murder in California, for example, may never
have heard of a related murder in New York. The CODIS database
organizing system encourages that coordination between law
enforcement agencies in an effort to solve crimes.

With 10,647,800 offender profiles in the NDIS alone, though, the
massive CODIS database required an organizing system in order
to prove useful to the law enforcement agencies involved. The
successful creation and maintenance of this organizing system has
offered newfound interactions to a wide variety of government
officials. In addition to law enforcement agencies, judicial courts,
criminal defense agencies, and population statistics agencies can
access the CODIS organizing system, enabling them to perform a
wide variety of functions, including identifying potential suspects
in criminal investigations, identifying missing persons, collecting
population statistics, and exonerating convicted criminals.

   How much is it being organized? As mentioned previously, the
high degree of resource description granularity in measuring 13
specific genetic sequence loci enables DNA profiles to uniquely
identify each individual in the database. That being said, the DNA
profiles are not simply heaped into one massive database.

Instead, the databases are maintained on both a state and federal
level. A new profile might be checked against a smaller state
database as well as the larger national one. In addition, the
databases are divided into different indices dependent on the DNA
source, including an offender index, arrestee index, forensic index,
and missing persons index.

1078 | The CODIS DNA Database
This division of the database into separate indices poses a tradeoff
dilemma, though. If CODIS did not subdivide the database into
federal, state and source indices, it is possible the algorithm would
be able to find more obscure hits, since the search parameters
would be broadened. This increase in hit frequency might result in
more investigations aided.

The tradeoff, however, is that the broadened search parameters
would also necessitate a more complex search algorithm and a
longer search process. This delay would most likely lead to fewer
hits overall. Thus, in government institutions where time and
resources are limited, it is more important for the CODIS organizing
system users to generate a larger number of hits with subdivided
databases than more accurate hits in one collective database.
Categories in the CODIS organizing system help simplify the
interaction processes.

   When is it being organized? DNA profiles enter the CODIS
organizing system when participating, accredited local, state, and
federal laboratories submit them. Thus, the laboratory technicians
handling the resource and resource description decide on a case-
by-case basis how a given profile should be categorized and which
indices it should be added to and checked against.

That being said, the lab technicians are given strict standards on
how a given DNA profile should be categorized. These standards
vary state by state depending on state law.

   How or by whom is it being organized? Beyond laboratory and
state involvement in CODIS, the FBI ultimately maintains and
oversees the CODIS database. It maintains the software and search
algorithms, performs searches throughout the system, and oversees
strict quality assurance standards for all participating laboratories.

To avoid the risk of bias or error amongst lab technicians, the FBI
could potentially choose to instead perform the laboratory
processing and categorization themselves. This alteration, however,
would present new challenges, such as new federal costs related to

                                                            The CODIS DNA Database | 1079
maintaining and processing the resources mentioned previously. In
addition, pulling together all resources into a FBI processing center
would necessitate a meticulous record of the resource's originating
state to ensure resource descriptions are categorized in accordance
with state laws. The FBI's strict maintenance of standards and laws
is the best option for addressing the risk of error and bias.

   Other considerations. The CODIS organizing system presents a
wide range of intriguing ethical questions surrounding race, gender,
criminal justice, and privacy. Perhaps the most hotly debated issue
surrounding DNA databases arose when the private DNA testing
company 23andMe announced that it would discontinue the sale
of its genetic tests in response to FDA demands, prompting more
media questions than ever before on the maintenance and use of
DNA databases.
Likewise, many have questioned the legitimacy of the CODIS
maintenance of DNA profiles. The ACLU, for example, has noted the
possibility of "function creep" in the maintenance of a government
DNA database which could lead our country down a slippery slope
towards a "brave new world" where private genetic information
could be collected and used in abusive, discriminating manners.
With the commercial surveillance of 23andMe and government
surveillance by the NSA at the forefront of media attention, it is
possible we will see more attention turned to the legitimacy of the
maintenance of the CODIS organizing system in the coming years.

85. Honolulu Rail Transit

By Carlo Liquido, December 2015
   Overview. The Honolulu Rail Transit Project is an urban rail rapid

transit system under construction in Honolulu on the island of
O'ahu, Hawaii. Honolulu's notoriously bad traffic has plagued locals
and tourists for decades, and for almost as long, proposals to
address the traffic problems and pay for the solution have been
very contentious and political. Construction began in 2011 and is
expected to finish in 2019, but delays have been frequent.

   What resources are being used? The new railway transit system
under construction in O'ahu will run along the southwest region
of the island spanning a total of 20 miles, from East Kapolei to
Downtown Honolulu with a total of 21 stops strategically placed
throughout. There are a number of ways in which one could scope
this project. What are the cultural and political limitations? What
are the environmental effects and resources that will be indirectly
affected? What are the topographic constraints of a railway system
in Hawaii? In terms of the scope of my analysis, however, the
people--namely the things the organizing system is intended
for--are the primary resources. The principle guiding the organizing
system is to reduce traffic and make the traveling experience more
efficient as a whole.

          O'ahu Traffic

                                                                   Honolulu Rail Transit | 1081
          O'ahu traffic is usually congested, especially in and
       around Honolulu on the south and southeast sides of
       the island

          (Hawaii Dep. of Economic Development and Tourism.
       CC-BY-2.0.)

Why are the resources organized? The guiding principle behind
the organizing system of a rail transit system is to reduce traffic
and make commuting more efficient. According to the Department
of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, the amount of
traffic on almost every major highway on O'ahu has increased from
2012-2014. Moreover, the dearth of job creation on other parts of
the island, namely the west side, has focused traffic into and out of
downtown Honolulu, as shown in the first map.

This skewed traffic pattern, limited real estate, and inflexible road

1082 | Honolulu Rail Transit
infrastructure has necessitated an above-ground railway system
linking the west side of O'ahu with the burgeoning downtown area
of Honolulu. This new organizing system seeks to rebalance the
traffic system by reorganizing its resources, that is, by taking drivers
and bus commuters off the road and onto the rail. O'ahu has only
three major freeways, the H1, H2, and H3. The freeway H2
bottlenecks from the west into H1. Drivers and bus commuters are
organized in such a way that peak hours of traffic are unavoidable.
The new transit will conceivably provide an additional layer of
organization to the currently

   How much are the resources organized? There are 21 planned
stations that run along the 20-mile span of track. The train stations
are arranged to serve as many people as possible by concentrating
them in the most densely populated areas.

          Population Density

                                                                   Honolulu Rail Transit | 1083
          Population in Honolulu area is highly concentrated in
       lowland areas.

          (Hawaii Dep. of Economic Development and Tourism.
       CC-BY-2.0.)
Darker areas represent high-density tracts while lighter areas
represent low-density tracts. The densely-populated stretch from
Keahi Lagoon to Honolulu Downtown, also has the highest density
of traffic. It makes sense that this portion of the rail system
constitutes almost half the number of total stops in just a quarter of
the total mileage.

          Honolulu Area Income per Household

1084 | Honolulu Rail Transit
          Household income is lowest in the most densely
       populated areas.

          (Hawaii Dep. of Economic Development and Tourism.
       CC-BY-2.0.)

Income per household also plays a vital role in how these stops were
selected. The rail transit system predominately runs along areas of
low-income neighborhoods (tan and brown indicates low income
per household, while green indicates high income per household).
This design principle embodies an assumption that people with
lower incomes are more likely to rely on public transit.

   When are the resources organized? As with any construction
project of this magnitude, the organizing system was planned in
detail before construction--down to the number of pillars, the
amount of concrete, the imported steel for rail cars, etc. However,
after construction excavation revealed ancient burial sites, the
Native Hawaiian community demanded many changes to the

                                                                   Honolulu Rail Transit | 1085
project. The number of stops has remained the same but the route
has changed dramatically.

   How or by whom is it being organized? There are a number of
interested parties with varying degrees of power. At the forefront,
the government--that is, the State of Hawaii--makes the final
decision. However, the people of Hawaii directly influence their
decisions.
The protection of cultural resources, practices, and beliefs is
important in Hawaii, both as a matter of law and of culture. Private
archeology firms, state officials, and cultural descendants work
together to reduce and mitigate impacts to archaeologically
significant properties. The Oahu Island Burial Council, for instance,
is a state council created to help protect iwi kupuna (ancestral
bones). It stresses the importance of consulting recognized lineal
descendants before any excavation for the rail project is carried out.

   Where is it being organized? The "where" component of the
organizing system is not as important for the scope of this analysis
as other design questions. However, the physical nature of the
project highly constrains how the system can be organized. The
volcanic origin of O'ahu, does not allow for a below-ground rail
system. The limited real estate, similarly, does not allow for a
ground-level system. The sharp and steep volcanic ridges that cut
across the island are barriers that limit where the rail system might
go.

86. The Antikythera
Mechanism

By Murray Maloney, 2 March 2014.
   Overview. In 1900, a strange looking mechanical device was

recovered from a shipwreck off of the island of Antikythera, Greece.
Only in the 1970s was it determined that the device was an ancient
mechanical computer that performed astronomical calculations; it
had a manual crank control with a rate of one turn per day, forward
or backward in time; its user interface presented calendrical, solar,
lunar, and planetary positions.1

The Antikythera Mechanism persists through time as a collection
of artifacts and a model of intellectual achievement. Thought to
1088 | The Antikythera Mechanism
have been constructed by Archimedes at Syracuse or by Posidonius
at Rhodes, the mechanism was recovered from a ship wreck near
the Greek island of Antikythera in 1900-1. The significance of the
find only began to become apparent in the 1970s when researchers
applied modern scanning technology.2

   What is being organized? The Antikythera Mechanism was an
arrangement of resource descriptions that represented a classical
Alexandrian sol-lunar calendar, complete with an almanac of the
positions of the sun, moon, known planets, and specific stars over
time. The resource descriptions are represented simply by the
measurements of the gears, and the corresponding information that
is displayed on the front and rear panels, based on the position of
those gears. These resource descriptions accounted for the range of
known astronomical phenomena at the time.3

The organization of the mechanism consists of a main solar gear
connected to a hand crank and a collection of gear trains that
ultimately control the rotation of pointers indicating the calendar,
lunar position and phases, the position of the sun and of all the
known planets, and the nearest eclipse. The mechanism was housed
in a wood frame box with bronze panels whose physicality was
obviously intrinsic to the use of the device; the panels the back door
was inscribed with what seems to be a user's guide.

The Antikythera Mechanism calculated the position of the moon by
employing five gear trains to take into account the Saros, Metonic,
Callipic, and Exeligmos cycles. Thus, it was able to predict the dates
of solar and lunar eclipses.

Today, the Antikythera is a collection of the eighty-two fragments
that have been recovered from the ship wreck and sea bed, twenty
three of which are evidently inscribed. The fragments have been
dated to about 70 BCE based on the coincident presence of some
coins from Pergamum and Ephesus that were recovered in the
1970s.

   Why is it being organized? From a purely pragmatic perspective,

                                                         The Antikythera Mechanism | 1089
the Antikythera Mechanism was a relatively portable computational
device. that would have been used to accurately reckon a very
specific calendar system, and to predict the cycles of days, months,
years, and saro, as well as lunations, eclipses, and Olympic games. It
would be an invaluable tool for astronomers, mathematicians, civil
engineers, and cartographers of the time.
From a philosophical perspective, the Antikythera Mechanism was
built to prove that it could be done. It represents a fulfillment of
Aristotelian thought. Through the ages, the lure of scientific
answers to the mathematical riddles presented among the patterns
in the heavens has challenged our burgeoning intellects. The
Antikythera Mechanism realized then-modern thinking on
mathematics, engineering, astronomy and calendrical calculation in
a portable mechanical computational device.4

   How much is it being organized? Some of the major fragments
are on display at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens; the
others are stored.

          The Gears

          (Wiki Commons.)

The Antikythera Mechanism is reported to have had about thirty
gears within a frame whose size was less than the volume of a large
book. The level of miniaturization and the precision of fabrication

                                                         The Antikythera Mechanism | 1091
was not thereafter seen until the next millennium. The engineering
and machining would have required trial models, accurate plans,
and custom tooling. There have been various modern attempts to
re-create the Antikythera Mechanism, or at least to re-create the
model it seems to have manifested.5

   When is it being organized? The person who operates the
mechanism turns a hand-operated crank to establish a date, or
contra-wise confirms the current date by taking sightings and
comparing with the dial settings. The front face offers a solar-
lunar calendar dial, a tropical zodiac dial, and an almanac dial with
rising and setting times of various stars. The rear panel offers dials
representing the five lunar cycles.

The organization of the engineering data required to build, operate,
and maintain the Antikythera Mechanism is staggering to imagine,

                                                         The Antikythera Mechanism | 1093
yet it pales in comparison to the organization required to collect
and archive astronomical sightings on clay tablets for hundreds of
years.6 (See the sidebar, A Cuneiform Document at the Pergamon.)

The organization of the fragments of the Antikythera Mechanism is
in the hands of the Bronze Collection of the National Archeological
Museum in Athens.

   How or by whom is it being organized? Ancient Chaldean, Greek,
and Roman astronomers and engineers; modern divers, marine
archaeologists, curators and researchers. In 1978, Jacques Cousteau
led an expedition to the sea bed and returned some historical
artifacts, that, while unrelated to the Antikythera Mechanism itself,
provide additional historical context and may help date the
discovery.

The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project is a collaboration of
academic, industrial, and scientific researchers, who are applying
some of the world's most advanced technology to study the
capabilities and applications of the Antikythera Mechanism, as well
as its historical context and significance.

   Other considerations. From the perspective of one ship's unlucky
captain and crew, the Antikythera Mechanism was likely just a piece
of cargo, although it may have accompanied an equally unlucky
passenger carrying the world's first computer to Caesar's court in
Rome. It remains unknown how or why the device was aboard the
ship or what fate befell it, but that is a story for researchers and
historians to uncover in the fulness of time.

4. Aristotle's work on the subject On the Heavens (c 350 BCE) avers
     to the mathematical symmetry and perfection in the travels of
     the spheres, envisioning cycles and epicycles in motion.
        In 343 BCE, Aristotle was head of the Macedonian Academy,
     where he tutored Alexander and his future general, Soter
     Ptolemy. Following Alexander`s conquest of Babylon in 331 BCE,
     he ordered Kallisthenes to organize the translation of all
     historical astronomical observations, initiating the transfer of
     the world's greatest collection of astronomical observations,
     dating back to 747 BCE. Within a year, Callippus had developed
     a new calendar, designating the summer solstice of 330 BCE
     as an epoch for astronomers and calendrical calculation. The
     Callipic cycle of 76 years less a day, equates to 27,759 days, and
     940 lunations, is represented in the gearing of the mechanism.
        Ptolemy established his capital at Alexandria and founded a

87. Autonomous Cars

By Jason Danker, December 2015.
   Overview. Automation in cars is nothing new. Automatic

transmissions and cruise control have been around since 1939 and
1958 respectively, but these systems serve to aid, rather than
replace, human drivers. What is new is a near future potential for
fully autonomous cars, cars that are capable of full operation
without an attending human driver.

While other vehicles, such as light rail and monorail trains, have
been capable of fully automatic operation since 1967, these vehicles
have the luxury of operating in closed environments and only need
to be able to respond to a defined set of inputs. Autonomous cars do
not have this luxury. In operating "in the wild," the systems guiding
these cars may be forced to respond to any number of unanticipated
situations. As the automation system cannot enumerate all possible
situations, it must instead rely on continuous organization of its
operating environment.

This is clearly a technical challenge, but it also raises ethical and
legal issues. As autonomous cars act based on the organization of
sensory inputs, the organizing systems are necessarily developed
relative to ethical considerations, whether intentional or not. At the
most basic level, the organizing system will direct the autonomous
car in making decisions analogous to those posited in the trolley
problem, a famous thought experiment in ethics that forces a choice
between saving five endangered people or taking the life of an
innocent person who had not been in danger. Beyond ethics,
autonomous cars also raise legal questions: if an autonomous car
crashes, who is liable for the damages?

   What is being organized? An autonomous car will organize
information about the car itself, the objects in its vicinity, and
environmental conditions. The car must keep track of its

1098 | Autonomous Cars
movements, those of other objects, and the relative positions of
itself and the other objects. It must organize this information within
the environmental framework of lane markings, speed limits, road
signs, traffic signals, weather and traffic conditions, and numerous
other constraints. As autonomous cars become common, the cars
will likely communicate with one another and this information will
also need to be brought into the organizing system. The car will
also need to organize, and likely prioritize, inputs from human
occupants. Regardless of the exact implementation, the organizing
system will necessarily limit what is worthy of organization: it is
likely not possible, or desirable, to keep track of every insect in the
vicinity of the car.

   Why is it being organized? The car organizes its surroundings in
order to safely navigate to a destination. While this is the primary
interaction enabled by the organization, countless other
interactions support this primary interaction. The supporting
interactions fall into the two categories of prediction and reaction.
The systems being developed by Google use the information that
has been organized to predict what is most likely to happen next:
"It predicts that the cyclist will ride by and the pedestrian will cross
the street." The systems that have been launched by Tesla tend to be
more reactionary: "Side Collision Warning further enhances Model
S's active safety capabilities by sensing range and alerting drivers to
objects, such as cars, that are too close to the side of Model S."

   How much is it being organized? The extent of organization
varies based on the implementation. While Google uses on-board
sensors and extremely detailed street maps to implement self-
driving functionality, Tesla's Autopilot relies on-board sensors and
standard GPS data. While the exact extent of the organization is
not publicly available information, Google has publicly stated "the
system is engineered to work hardest to avoid vulnerable road users
(think pedestrians and cyclists), then other vehicles on the road, and
lastly avoid things that don't move." Given this, Google's categories,
and their hierarchy, appear to be defined by their vulnerability.

   When is it being organized? For information gathered by on-

                                                                       Autonomous Cars | 1099
board sensors, organization takes place as objects enter and leave
the vicinity of the autonomous car. The organization is ongoing as
the car's surrounding and environment are constantly changing. In
addition to the sensor data, autonomous cars also rely on map data
which is organized in advance. Google's cars rely on specialized,
highly detailed maps that are being developed as part of the self-
driving car project and, as such, are unable to drive on roads that
have not yet been mapped to the necessary level of detail. While
Tesla's Autopilot also relies on maps, it uses standard GPS maps and
is not similarly restricted.

   How or by whom is it being organized? The car's computational
processes are responsible for the organization. That said, the car is
restricted to organizing within the organizing system implemented
by the manufacturer. While Google and Tesla are two of the main
companies in this space, many traditional automotive companies
are also developing autonomous systems.

   Where is it being organized? Except for map data, the
organization takes place within the car's onboard systems. The
organization must take place in the car itself due to the potential
catastrophic consequences of a lag in information flow. Additionally,
ensuring all organization takes place within the car provides greater
security: a self-contained car is less susceptible to attack than a
network dependent one.

   Other considerations. While it is likely that fully autonomous cars
will be technologically feasible within a few years, the cars may still
require human interactions for legal reasons. This is clearly seen
in Tesla's press release for Autopilot: "The driver is still responsible
for, and ultimately in control of, the car." This human-in-the-loop
design principle creates a legal buffer for autonomous car
manufacturers by treating the "driver" as a "liability sponge" or
"moral crumple zone." As articulated by Madeleine Elish and Tim
Hwang, "the human in an autonomous system may become simply a
component--accidentally or intentionally--that is intended to bear
the brunt of the moral and legal penalties when the overall system
fails."

1100 | Autonomous Cars
While these issues will ultimately play out through a combination of
court rulings and policy decisions, it is interesting to note that there
is legal precedent that could either blame, or exonerate, the "driver"
of an autonomous car. Drawing parallels to aviation automation,
precedent suggests that the human "driver" will be held responsible
for liability claims arising from the operation of the car. On the other
hand, product liability law offers recourse for consumers when a
company's products fail. Many people have argued that this existing
legal framework is sufficient to handle the liability issues brought up
by autonomous vehicles.
Regardless of the legal complexities that will arise from specific
incidents, autonomous cars have great potential to reduce car
crashes and improve overall road safety. The promise of the
autonomous technology, even for partially autonomous systems, is
so great that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
is proposing updates to its safety ratings that will penalize
manufacturers that don't include autonomous technologies in their
vehicles.

88. IP Addressing in the

Global Internet

By Andrew McConachie, December 2013.
   Overview. Most people take for granted that the Internet just

works. They connect their computer to the Internet, it gets an IP
address, and they are able to communicate with a computer with a
different IP address on the other side of the planet. How did their
computer get the correct IP address? How does any computer or
router get the correct IP address? How did the routers and other
computers on the Internet get their IP addresses? Who decides
which computers and which routers get which IP addresses?

   What is being organized? At their simplest, an IPv4 address is
a 32-bit series of 0s and 1s. They are resources that are born-
digital, as they have no canonical physical representation. Their
digital canonical representation, with which we have all become
familiar, is called the "dotted quad" format and is 4 numbers
between 0-255 separated with dots. For example, 169.229.216.200 is
the IPv4 address for www.berkeley.edu.

Not all IP addresses are of equivalent classes. There are unicast,
multicast, broadcast, and experimental IPv4 addresses, and unicast
addresses can be either public or private. There are also two
different versions of IP addresses currently in use on the Internet,
IPv4 and IPv6. We will focus on IPv4 unicast public IP addresses,
since these are not only the most common, but also the most
important. This is roughly the range of IP addresses from 1.0.0.0
to 223.255.255.255, with some breaks in the middle for private IP
address space.

   Why is it being organized? IP addresses are the foundation of
network connectivity and the Internet; they identify each device on
a computer network and also serve as its address, so that routers
and other devices can locate and communicate with it. You cannot

1102 | IP Addressing in the Global
Internet
get online without one. IP addresses can be represented into blocks,
or subnetworks, using a prefix and a mask. For example,
169.229.216.0/24 represents all IP addresses in the range of
169.229.216.1 - 169.229.216.255. Internet routers do not have enough
memory to hold routes for every individual IP address on the
Internet. So by organizing the Internet into subnetworks based
loosely on a hierarchical model, routers are able to determine the
correct path for every destination in the network without actually
storing every address in their memory. If the organization of IP
addresses is not handled properly, Internet routers would exhaust
their memory space and parts of the Internet would become
unreachable.

   How much is it being organized? Currently there is too much
granularity in the global Internet routing table. For a router it takes
the same amount of memory to store a subnetwork with 255 IP
addresses as it does to store a subnetwork with 65536 addresses.
So if our main concern is to minimize memory usage in Internet
routers, thereby lowering operator costs and increasing stability,
we want as little granularity as possible in the Internet routing
table. The problem is that many organizations use non-contiguous
IP subnetworks that cannot be aggregated into larger subnetworks.
This results in routers having to store many small subnetworks
instead of fewer larger subnetworks, which will eventually lead to
memory exhaustion in older routers and possible reachability
issues. Currently the full Internet routing table is approaching
500,000 routes. Most network engineers expect problems once the
routing table grows past 512,000 entries, since router memory
limitations are always at bit boundaries.

   When is it being organized? IP addresses are organized once
someone configures one on a device or sets up a Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol(DHCP) server. If an organization exhausts
their supply of free IP addresses. it will have to make a request to
the upstream provider or Regional Internet Registry(RIR) for more
address space. In the early days of the Internet, large blocks of IP
addresses were given to organizations, but this led to many of the

                                              IP Addressing in the Global Internet | 1103
addresses in these blocks not being used. We are now reaching
a point where we no longer have new addresses to assign to
organizations.

Markets are now emerging for organizations to buy and sell IP
addresses, and the organizations who have held on to large amounts
of unused addressing space stand to make significant revenue from
selling their unused space. When these organizations sell their
unused IP address space, they will break up large allocations into
smaller subnetworks, thereby increasing granularity and further
accelerating the growth of the Internet routing table.

   How or by whom is it being organized? The Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers(ICANN) is currently responsible
for initial allocation of IP addresses. They allocate 8 blocks of IP
addresses to RIRs, who are then responsible for distributing
allocations to organizations that request them. These organizations
can then allocate IP addresses to smaller organizations, thus
forming a loose hierarchy of organizations, where each level lower
in the hierarchy receives a subset of the IP address space from
the organization above it. ICANN no longer has any /8 blocks of
IP addresses left to allocate to RIRs. Once all of the RIRs have
exhausted their last allocations from ICANN, organizations will have
to rely on secondary markets to increase their IP address space.

   Other Considerations. The world of IP addressing will soon get
a lot more interesting. The introduction of IPv6 as a replacement
for IPv4 has been slow in coming and, while gathering momentum,
continues at a snail's pace. As organizations start purchasing IP
addresses from one another, we should expect increased
granularity and decreased stability in the Internet routing
infrastructure. Whether or not normal Internet users notice will
ultimately be determined by how well equipment vendors and
engineers expediently address the coming problems.

89. The Art Genome Project

By David Eicke, December 2014.
   What is being organized? Artsy.net carries the ambitious mission

of making "all the world's art" accessible to anyone with an Internet
connection. This is not only challenging purely from a scale
perspective, with the number of artworks in the world daunting
even if it were not being incremented constantly, but it is also
challenging in that "art" is a nebulous term. Creators of music and
literature often refer to themselves and each other as "artists." The
same goes for dancers and other performers. Will their works be
included? The current collection seems to be mostly visual art, with
some architecture and design objects included.

Artsy's mission is to be carried out by their Art Genome Project,
which is the organizational engine that powers their search and
interactions. The name was inspired by Pandora's project, as was
their term for their organizing process: "genoming." Genoming is
not yet automated and still costly, so Artsy selects the art that is to
be "genomed" carefully. Their first priority is the works featured in
galleries with whom Artsy has contracts. Galleries pay to have their
work organized and searchable on the site. Those works, then, must
be genomed quickly in order to keep the company running. Artsy's
engine also takes in works from museums and other institutions
who do not have contracts with them, but many of those
institutions have image-rights concerns, and not all their artworks
can be published. In other cases, the images of the works are simply
too low-quality to be displayed.

   Why is it being organized? Why organize art? The simplest
answer is to educate. That said, art has been being organized into
movements and -isms for a very long time. The Getty Foundation
even created an authoritative art vocabulary called the Categories
for the Description of Works of Art a few decades ago. At first
glance, Artsy seems to be reinventing the wheel. However, the

                                                               The Art Genome Project | 1105
organizing system Artsy uses is unique in that it facilitates a special
kind of interaction with its body of published works.

The way resources are organized on Artsy is a cross between a
hierarchical structure and a graph structure. They have over 1,000
characteristics (which they call "genes") to describe their resources.
These characteristics can have to do with art movements, formal
qualities, techniques, subject, etc. The emphasis here, however, is
on relationships between works of art. For example, one of the
genes Artsy uses is "eye-contact," and if you have a photo taken last
month where the subject is looking directly into the camera and an
oil painting from hundreds of years ago where the subject's eyes are
looking at the painter, those two can be one click away from each
other. No other organizing system could facilitate that sort of easy
link between two such disparate works.

This free-flowing linkage between works enables the "berry-
picking" model of knowledge seeking, where a user searching for
something doesn't necessarily have to know what he or she is
searching for. A user could begin her exploration with only a vague
notion that she enjoys this long-legged rhinoceros sculpture by
Salvador Dali. She may not know what she likes about it, but she
will see his other work there. Maybe she finds a painting she likes
in the "other works by Dali" section, and she clicks on it. Then the
characteristics of this painting are listed in the interface, and she
is free to click on any one of them. She might click on "Surrealism"
and find more works from that movement. She may click on
"waterscapes" and find other oceanic imagery. She is free to explore
and discover art in a self-directed way and free to discover what she
likes and why she likes it. The director of Artsy's Art Genome Project
says the system was intended to parallel a professor who is adept at
"riffing" on things.

   How much is it being organized? As mentioned above, Artsy
currently uses over 1,000 characteristics ("genes") to describe its
resources. These characteristics can describe anything from the
art's form to the art's subject to the technique used to create the

1106 | The Art Genome Project
art. Experts assign these genes to the artworks and then assign
those genes a weight from 0 to 100, depending on the salience of
the characteristic within the work. Aside from the genes, the art
is described in terms of physical dimensions (how much space it
takes up), whether it has been sold or not, its gallery, its price (if for
sale), its creation date, and, of course, who created it. Having such a
rich set of descriptions has allowed Artsy to create a public API for
developers to use all of this information as they see fit.

   When is it being organized? Description of Artsy's resources is
an ongoing process. Their ingested collection of art is much larger
than their published collection. Most of the artworks are waiting to
be genomed, with some of them waiting for permissions or image-
rights paperwork to process. Another factor in determining when
something is organized is the signing of new contracts with
galleries. Works from galleries with contracts have first priority, and
Artsy experts genome those works as they come in.

While these experts are assigning genes on a rolling basis, they
are also drawing upon hundreds of years of art history scholarship
when assigning them. For example, the Arsty experts did not come
up with Dadaism as an organizational concept. So, in a way, some of
these works were organized long ago.

   How or by whom is it being organized? Artsy has a team of art
historians and experts working to describe the resources that Artsy
has ingested (and those that it will ingest). They have done some
experiments with image-recognition software, but its descriptions
are simply not rich enough to facilitate the sorts of interactions
the organization is trying to facilitate. The strategy of employing
experts has its obvious downsides, however. It does not scale well,
and it is reminiscent of Yahoo's early strategy of employing
librarians to describe web content. There will also be inevitable
biases in human resource description.

   Other considerations. With such a grand ambition, one thing that
may stand in Artsy's way of becoming an authoritative organizing
system in the art space is that they are for-profit. Even if they are

                                                               The Art Genome Project | 1107
able to avoid too much bias in the interest of revenue generation,
the perception remains that they are less interested in classifying
art for educational purposes and more interested in making money.

90. Making a Documentary
Film

By Suhaib Syed, December 2013.
   Overview. As part of a small crew, I was in pursuit of making

a documentary film shedding light on the problems in the higher
education system in India. We had traveled far and wide, capturing
many thought-provoking stories, illuminating interviews, and
shocking truths. Due to the relatively small crew and a tight
schedule, we ended up with our raw footage being labeled in a
generic format (MVI_1234 etc.). I, being the director, had the task
of assisting the editor in renaming and reorganizing the files to
make our lives easier, do justice to all the efforts that were put
into capturing all the clips, and incorporate them in an impactful
manner.

   What is being organized? The primary resources being organized
were the video clips (digital, shot on DSLRs) acquired during the
shoot. In this context, they could be classified as passive resources
having no real capability to produce any significant value on their
own, and which had to be acted upon or interacted with to produce
any effect. But the key problem here was to formulate usable
resource descriptions based on the following resource properties:
Intrinsic static

      Date and time of creation, duration of the clip, type of external
      lighting used, camera used, lens used, exposure, ISO, white
      balance, frame rate, compression type

Extrinsic static

      Shot sequence number (assigned to each story element during
      story-boarding), shot movement type (dolly, follow focus, zoom,
      macro, etc.)

                                                         Making a Documentary Film | 1109
During this particular stage, the intrinsic and extrinsic dynamic
properties did not play a large role in the resource descriptions.

We had done a lot of work on story-boarding and identified the right
level of granularity so that we could capture each shot sequence
separately, so we directly used the shot sequence number as an
important part of the resource description. This helped us keeping
our descriptions short and meaningful.

Additionally, we realized that the corresponding audio clips
captured along with the video also had to be organized, but since
the two were intricately linked to each other we decided to use
the same name as the corresponding video clip, the only difference
being the extension. We relied on the editing software to capture
the intrinsic static properties of the audio files (e.g., bit rate and
compression type).

   Why is it being organized? Essentially, we were organizing these
digital resources to find, identify, and select them so as to weave a
powerful narrative enabling us to convey the truth in an impactful
manner.

Hence, the interactions were directly with the primary resource.

The interactions that had to be supported by our organization
scheme involved:

  · Finding the clips related to a particular story-board section

  · Selecting the best set of clips to be included in the film based on
      relevance to story, progression, continuation and several other
      inter-connected factors

  · Manipulating the clip (i.e., color-correcting, white balancing,
      and stabilizing) to create an aesthetic effect

  · Matching the video of a clip to corresponding audio recording

1110 | Making a Documentary Film
  · Adding the right background score based on sentiment being
      portrayed in the clips and the progression of the story

  · Providing subtitles in case of a foreign language or incoherent
      speech

How much is it being organized? Since the scope and size of our
organizing system was relatively limited and all the resources were
already available, we were able to make some bold decisions without
causing a lot of problems. We formed a controlled, vertical
vocabulary for resource description by deliberately choosing
certain resource properties over others. Our main objective was
to keep the description as short as possible and at the same time
convey the most valuable information that would help us interact
with the resources (i.e., the video clips).

We could have easily opted for a date- and time-stamp based id
and every resource in a collection (i.e., clips specific to one camera)
would have a unique identifier, but we realized that our cameras
already attached this information to the file along with the technical
details like frame rate, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and white
balance, which our operating system and editing software could
easily capture, display, and search through, hence, we decided not
to use these details.

We also decided not to include important lighting condition
properties (kino-flo, LeikoLite, etc.) and location, because the first
frame in most of our clips consisted of the clap-board which
contained all of this information, and our editing software showed
all the video files as thumbnails using first frame of the video.

Thus we leveraged all of these to form a controlled vocabulary that
placed the shot sequence number first, followed by the take number
followed by camera identifier (e.g., camA, camB, etc.). For instance:
2A_1_camB.

                                                           Making a Documentary Film | 1111
However, we did realize that these decisions were specific to our OS
and video editing software and hence lacked interoperability.

   When is it being organized? In our case, although we intended to
organize the resources as soon as they were acquired, we failed and
then came up with an organizing system after all the resources were
acquired. We leveraged this fact to our benefit and formed a more
specific description system.

   How or by whom is it being organized? Ideally it is the role of the
first assistant cinematographer (AC), even 2nd or 3rd AC (depending
on the budget), to make sure all the file names are stored properly
and all the cards properly backed up. But due to our limitations we
(i.e., the director and cinematographer) collaborated to organize the
set of raw footage.

   Other considerations. One important consideration that we left
out in the discussion was the need for certain people appearing in
the documentary to have their identity hidden by means of facial
blurring and voice modulation. Although we could not
accommodate this interaction of identifying which clips had footage
of people who did not want to reveal themselves, we could easily
add the special effects over an entire sequence once all the clips
were brought together.

91. The Dabbawalas of

Mumbai

By Pratibha Rathore, December 2014.
   Overview. The Mumbai dabbawala tiffin service is the source of

much fascination from around the world, and I am no different:
I worked in Mumbai for two years and used the services of
dabbawalas to get my lunch box (called a "dabba") delivered from
home to my office, which was about 44 miles away. Without the
use of any technology or digital resources, this organizing system
has been coordinating the delivery of home-cooked lunches to
thousands of Indian office workers for over a century, charging
just a small fee of $3-7 per month. The community of dabbawalas
has been able to create value for its customers by optimizing and
standardizing the principles of its operations and devising an
organizing system that is down to earth and human-centric.

   What is being organized? The primary resources in the
dabbawala system are the dabbas that are delivered to respective
customer's offices and organized using a simple but effective color-
coding system. The secondary resource is the workforce, consisting
of 5,000-6,000 people known as dabbawalas, who organize
themselves and their supporting supply chain and logistics
operations to deliver the dabbas to the right location and at the
right time each day without failure. The dabbawala community,
called the Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Association (MTBSA), follows
a flat organization structure, meaning the motivation to perform
consistently is a matter of personal drive and accountability.

   Why is it being organized? The primary reason people use the
service of the dabbawalas is to eat a proper, home-prepared meal
during lunch, a way to connect with their family while busy at work.
The interactions supported by the dabbawala organizing system
provide two significant benefits to the customers: managing their

                                                           The Dabbawalas of Mumbai | 1113
budgets while eating healthy, and leveraging time constraints. Most
of the office-goers usually leave by 7 a.m. to commute from the
suburbs of Mumbai, traveling south to the main commercial area of
Mumbai and returning back home after 7 p.m. The railway network
during the peak hours is jam-packed with commuters hanging onto
the trains with one hand; therefore, carrying one's lunch at that
time is not feasible. Most of the commuters cannot afford to eat
takeout every day, and eating on the roadside is unhealthy and
unhygienic. In addition, catering to the diverse food habits and taste
needs of employees is very difficult for office canteens to manage.
Thankfully, the dabbawala system solves all these problems with 100
percent customer satisfaction by delivering to each employee his
lunch filled with food prepared at his home.

   How much is it being organized? The Mumbai lunch box system
is a successful and a socially sustainable enterprise. The number
of dabbas delivered per day to offices and back home is around
300,000; that means 600,000 transactions per day. Although the
number of transactions is very large, each person handles a small
subset of transactions at a time. The scope of the organizing system
and the scale of operations pretty much remain consistent, with the
addition or deletion of few dabbas every month. Most interestingly,
despite the lack of computers, mobile technology, or any automated
processes, a dabba goes astray only once every two months, making
less than one mistake in every 6 million deliveries. Now that's
efficiency! The system is able to achieve consistency in its
operations because of successful implementation of several
organizing principles. Firstly, containers used to house the lunch
boxes are of a standard shape and size. Second, the color coding
done on the dabbas takes advantage of people's visual acuity,
following a human-centric design approach. Third, the sequence of
transactions to deliver each dabba from its source to destination
and back to source is repeatable, predictable, systematic, and
iterative in nature, enabling easy tracking and monitoring. Finally,
governance within the community is achieved by instilling ethics,

1114 | The Dabbawalas of Mumbai
values, and principles in employees and by holding employees
accountable at all times.

   When is it being organized? The interactions between
dabbawalas to deliver the dabbas follow a "hub and spoke" process
model. During a dabba's journey from kitchen to consumer, it is
handled by between three and twelve different deliverymen. The
typical day for a dabbawala begins at 9:30 a.m., and he spends about
an hour collecting all the 25-30 dabbas from the assigned set of
homes in his designated area. The households are expected to have
the lunch box ready when he arrives for collection. When he is done
with collection, he goes to the local train station and gathers with
the other dabbawalas of his area. Next, the dabbas are sorted in the
order of stops on that rail line and handed off to the dabbawala who
is responsible for that particular station for delivery to their final
destination. At every departure station, the dabbas are passed out
according to their next destinations. The same process is repeated
when returning empty dabbas back to homes.

A model of the dabbawalla delivery process

How or by whom is it being organized? The key to this successful
delivery management system is the color coding done on the
dabbas. The dabbawalas use simple design measures such as signs,
different colors, numbers, dashes, dots, letters, and simple symbols
to indicate various parameters such as origination suburb, route to
take, destination station, who is responsible, the street, building,
floor, etc. As most of the dabbawals are illiterate, the choice of
syntax for markings is done in such a way to ensure it is easy to
understand and implement. The vocabulary used to implement and
describe markings on the dabbas follows a standardized and self-
descriptive process, thereby eliminating ambiguity and variability
and making the organizing system more effective. Since only
numbers and letters are used, the syntax for description of the
primary resource (dabbas) is intentionally made to be independent

1116 | The Dabbawalas of Mumbai
of any local language, so that everyone can learn, understand, and
process without any confusion, bias, or information overload.
Dabba Routing Codes

A breakdown of the coding system used to identify and route a
dabba.
At each stage of the process, only one part of this code needs to be
read, which works as a signal and thus allows picking up the right
dabbas very quickly. It is also particularly efficient for traceability,
since any dabbawala seeing a dabba knows which path it has to
take. In case a dabba is lost or forbidden somewhere, any dabbawala
is able to put it back on the right track. There is no need for the
structure of color coding to be more granular than described above,
as dabbawalas know the collection areas by heart. Furthermore,
the process of adding a new resource to the organizing system is
straightforward and structured. If a new resource--that is, a new

                                                           The Dabbawalas of Mumbai | 1117
customer--is added to the system, the dabbawala will do the
complete journey to check the address of delivery and coordinate
with other colleagues in the community to see who has a free place
in his crate to add one more dabba. Once the sequence of delivery
has been established and all the necessary stops for exchange
decided, the address on the dabba is marked and it becomes part of
the whole system.

   Other considerations. It would be interesting to know if this
delivery model could be used by other cities as the problem of
longer commute and need for homemade food for lunch by office
workers is always there in major cities. In my view, standardization
of operations and understanding cultural and regional biases can
provide opportunities for other cities to implement this model, at
the same time providing jobs to many semi-skilled workforces.

About Data Center Resources

By Hassan Jannah, December 2013.
   Overview. Nowadays, there is an app for almost everything! Yet,

we show little or no regard to what happens behind our shiny
little screen until something breaks down and our lives descend to
near chaos. That is the conundrum of IT guys. The truth is that IT
solutions are, in many cases, fragile things that need constant care.
This is no easy task. In fact, most of the cost and effort involved
in IT solutions is maintenance. A million things could go wrong.
Words like preventive maintenance, service monitoring, business
continuity, and disaster recovery are examples of the different
activities done to maximize availability and expedite
troubleshooting. Everyone involved with these activities needs
access to resources. Above all, they all need access to information.

   What is being organized? IT data centers have both physical and
digital resources. Physical resources include the facility (i.e.,
building), utilities, computer hardware (e.g., network switches,
cables, servers, storage, etc.), and, also people. Digital resources
are much fuzzier to define. A simplistic approach could classify
them into data and applications. Each category can be further sub-
classified into an entire ontology. The complexity increases when
you consider the great number of potential resource types that can
be created by combining physical and digital resources. Capturing,
storing, and maintaining information about these resources is a big
challenge. A lot of information can be retrieved from the resources
themselves. Usually, each team responsible for supporting a certain
group of resources would store information in spreadsheets and
documents. More organized teams would use databases or
knowledge management systems. More diligent organizations
would have a central repository for everything.

                                                           Managing Information About Data
                                                                         Center Resources | 1119
What many fail to capture is the information about how all of these
different clusters of resources are interconnected. That is often
a much bigger and complex challenge. That information could be
either buried deep in these systems (e.g., the user name used to
run a certain service), or is stored in people's brains. The added
value of an organizing system for data about data center resources
can be multiplied if effectively organized information about their
interactions.

   Why is it being organized? Running an IT data center is complex,
resource-intensive, and risky. Customers require around the clock
availability of services with no room for failure. The consequences
of such failures go beyond financial loss and customer
dissatisfaction. They could affect people's safety and, even, national
security. Cyber threats have become a constant threat for IT service
providers, especially those that host highly sensitive data or serve
critical operations. People can survive if their emails were
inaccessible for an hour. However, what are the ramifications of
a total failure of the IT infrastructure of the New York Stock
Exchange? What if the airport systems of Heathrow airport failed?
These are some of the conditions that IT data center managers must
work in. Furthermore, technology advances have created highly
diverse, complex, and integrated solutions. New resources are
introduced frequently as old resources are retired. These activities
require careful planning and execution to prevent the intricate eco-
system from crashing. Having all the information required to plan
these activities would mitigate that risk.

Nevertheless, when something wrong does happen, having the
required information is equally important to expedite fixing it. In
fact, availability of information increases with the severity of the
problem. How can you rebuild a system if you do not know how
to connect its parts? How much are the resources organized? The
granularity of the data required about data center resources varies
between organizations and also between stakeholders of the same

1120 | Managing Information About Data Center Resources
organization. The information can be classified into operational, and
planning information.

   How much is it being organized? Operational information is
required for running day-to-day operations. These include
information about resources and how they are interconnected.
Many organizations put most of their focus on organizing
operational information with high granularity. The granularity could
be influenced by economic, political, and intellectual factors. Higher
granularity means that more time and money are required to
organize the information.

The level of granularity used to describe a resource type can be
driven by the motives of the team leading the activity. For example,
a hardware systems support team would invest more in building
a robust organizing system for hardware systems and not focus
on applications running on that hardware. Finally, the team's
intellectual abilities and knowledge would influence the granularity
of the system. As the boundaries between physical and digital
resources fade, system designers could face some challenging
questions. For example, servers are, traditionally, considered
hardware resources. However, many organization have switched to
virtual servers running on big machines. In such a case, how would
you define a server? Is it the big machine or the individual virtual
servers? Is it a physical resource or a digital resource? If you have a
standby clone of a virtual server, would you consider both to be the
same entity or not?

Planning information is usually required to make business decisions
and is usually less granular. This could include information about
the purchase and maintenance costs, contracts, hardware life-times
...etc. Managers and planners could use this information to better
plan for business activities, manage operational and capital costs,
and make strategic decisions about the services and products the
data center offers.

   When is it being organized? Many data centers start building an
organizing system of data about their resources based on existing

                        Managing Information About Data Center Resources | 1121
resources. In such cases, building the system is the easy part. The
real challenge is maintaining the information up-to-date in an ever-
changing environment. Clear information life-cycle and change
management processes are required in parallel with work processes
to ensure information is updated.

   How or by whom is it being organized? Based on the scope and
level of granularity of the system, the number of resources could
potentially be gargantuan. The organization must try to maximize
the amount of information collected automatically using auto-
discovery "agents" to keep updated information. Inevitably, other
information, especially information describing interdependencies,
will require human entry. The organization must have a clear and
comprehensive governance framework that details the roles and
responsibilities of different parties in adding, and maintaining
information.

   Other considerations. Most big companies in the past operated
their own corporate data centers. Their organizing system might
have a smaller scope. The emergence of global cloud service
providers has extended the commoditization of IT products and
services across the entire technology landscape; from the
consumers all the way back to the servers that provide them. These
providers will have a bigger scope due to the diversity and dynamic
provisioning of their services.

93. Neuroscience Lab

By Colin Gerber, December 2013.
   Overview. A neuroscience lab is doing Parkinson's disease

research in which they do experiments with rats. They use different
types of rats, surgeries, and drugs for experiments and have to keep
track of all this information for data analysis, publications, and lab
inspectors.
The existing organizing system was developed before personal
computers were prevalent and has slowly evolved over time.
However, much of the underlying structure of the system still has its
roots in pre-computer concepts. In order to update the system to
incorporate more modern technologies what are the changes to the
resources, their descriptions, and the systems structure that need
to be made?

   What is being organized? Resources in the current organizing
system include rats, surgeries, experiments, drugs, and data
recorded from the experiments. There are some other resources
that could be incorporated into the organizing system.

          Neuroscience Research Equipment

                                                                        Neuroscience Lab | 1123
          Physical resources in the author's lab are arranged to
       facilitate the precise accuracy of interactions required
       in medical research. In this photo, an array of amplifiers
       and filters for processing and recording rats' brainwave
       signals (left) is installed in a vertical rack that can be
       located close to the equipment used to perform
       surgeries.

1124 | Neuroscience Lab
          (Photo by Colin Gerber. Used with permission.)

One such new resource is surgery techniques. Surgery techniques
have historically been passed down by the master apprentice
method and information was largely tacit knowledge that was held
by the researchers performing the surgeries and not explicitly in
the system. This was done because it is inherently difficult to store
the intricacies of surgery in text and even more difficult for a new
researcher to learn how to perform the surgery from textual
information. The ability to store and annotate multimedia changes
this however. It is now possible to make instructional videos for
each type of surgery, add resource descriptions to the video file and
store it in the organizing system.

There is also a resource that is treated as one resource through its
entire lifetime when it may actually be two. When rats are originally
brought into the organizing system they are treated as a
manifestation of the rat resource type. Meaning the rats are
interchangeable, you can use any rat from that group in your
surgery. Once the surgery has been performed the rat is modified
into a new resource instance. The specific rat the surgery was
performed on now has a new set of resource descriptions.

   Why is it being organized? Is the main purpose of the
organization system to make sure the correct rats are used in each
different experiment? Or is it to make sure the records are kept up
to date for the lab inspectors? It could also be making data analysis
and paper writing more efficient. These decisions will affect how
many different types of resource descriptions are required and the
granularity needed for those descriptions.

This system is just one of many organizing systems within a lab
so deciding the scope and interactions it will have with the other
organizing systems is very important. One important decision is if

                                                                        Neuroscience Lab | 1125
the system will support the training of new members of the lab
or not. Having resources such as video recording of surgeries and
experiments could enable teaching interactions for new
researchers. But there are many other aspects of training a new
researcher must go through, should these also be included in the
organizing system? If so, it would make the system much more
complex and expand the scope of the organizing system outside
of surgeries and experiments but would keep all of the teaching
resource in one system.

Another option would be to have a separate organizing system that
is responsible for training material which is able to interact with the
multimedia in the system that are relevant to training. This does not
expand the scope of the system but would make the maintenance
of it more difficult. Each time a surgery technique or experiment is
changed two systems would have to be updated to take the changes
into account.

   How much is it being organized? The system is accessed by many
types of users, each requiring a different type of interaction. The
researchers need to search for the correct rat and surgery
technique. The lab inspector needs to check for drug logs and make
sure all the surgery methods and equipment are up to date. The
principal investigator needs to see an overview of progress on
projects.

Currently the system is organized in hierarchical categories where
the top-level categories are surgery and experiments. This
organization makes it easy to retrieve specific resources. However,
the interactions normally performed with the system use resources
from both sub-trees, which makes the hierarchical approach less
than optimal.

A faceted classification approach could work well to enable these
interactions. The facets would incorporate the original categories of
surgery and experiments but also add facets for each common type
of interaction. In this case different resource descriptions of the

1126 | Neuroscience Lab
same resource will often be classified into different facets. These
resource descriptions will often act as resources themselves. For
example, a lab inspector is interested in retrieving the expiration
date and times a drug was used in surgery, not the drug itself.

   When is it being organized? In a neuroscience lab resource
descriptions are often lost if they are not recorded at the time
they are measured. For example, if a rat is weighed to calculate the
correct dosage of a drug, both the dosage and the weight should
be entered into the system. If the weight is not entered at the time
of measurement it would be impossible to weigh the rat later and
get the same result (as the rat changes weight over time.) This is a
common problem, so as a rule all resources and descriptions should
be entered into the system at the time they are acquired.

   How or by whom is it being organized? The researchers working
in the lab do all of the organizing. They are the ones creating new
resources, descriptions and have the most knowledge about the
resources and how they relate to each other.

   Other considerations. Changing the system and entering all of
the data at the time of measurement will initially cause more work
for the researchers but will result in more accuracy for the
interactions supported by the system and less retrieval work during
data analysis and paper writing.

                                                                        Neuroscience Lab | 1127
94. A Nonprofit Book

Publisher

By Emily Paul, December 2014.
   Overview. The New Press, a nonprofit book publisher with

approximately 1,000 published titles, roughly 800 of which are
actively in print and featured on the website, updated its book
categories for use on thenewpress.com as part of a website
redesign. Rather than fully adhering to an established book
classification system, such as BISAC, which is commonly used in
book retail, The New Press developed its own classification system.
In addition to the standard goal of allowing readers to browse
categories, this classification system is designed to represent the
press's focus and mission. The New Press classification system
employs a mix of principles and levels of granularity while
incorporating some elements of the institutional categories from
BISAC.

In order to gain some insight into how these dual goals affect
usability, I ran user tests on a mockup of the website with the
proposed categories. I conducted a think-aloud exercise in which
the users verbalized their thoughts as they browsed through the
categories and subcategories. I then asked the users to walk
through where they would go for a particular book in response to a
prompt from me that included the book's title, subtitle, and a brief
description. Lastly, I asked the users about what their impressions
were of The New Press after looking at the categories, whether they
were confused by the categories, and which categories they would
be interested in looking at if they visited the site.

   What is being organized? The resource being organized is the
digital presence of the books on thenewpress.com. The
classification system is only used on The New Press website and
is stored in a FileMaker database that pushes data to the website.

1128 | A Nonprofit Book Publisher
There is already a dedicated website classification system that this
new system builds on. It is worth noting that the book records
in the database also contain BISAC categories. These are entered
so that they can be sent out to distribution and bookseller feeds
that require the industry-standard categories. The BISAC categories
are institutional categories created by the Book Industry Standards
Group. The BISAC system is designed to reflect the interests and
understanding of general readers. As such, the BISAC categories
are informed by cultural categories and also influence cultural
categories because of their broad adoption in the book industry.
In addition to using some institutional categories from BISAC and
mainstream cultural categories, The New Press is using cultural
categories from specific groups, namely academics and political
progressives, to connect with specific readers.

   Why is it being organized? The books are being categorized to
facilitate browsing by readers and supporters on The New Press
website. In addition to the primary browsing interaction, the
categories are also being used as an opportunity to position The
New Press and to convey a sense of its mission.

   How much is it being organized? For the purposes of The New
Press website, books can be placed in multiple categories and
subcategories, but all books will have at least one category
designation. Because The New Press is not concerned with the
physical presentation of the resources, the books can be placed in as
many categories as are relevant. In contrast, library and bookstore
classifications need to satisfy the uniqueness principle, because the
book can only be located in one physical location.

Most of the categories are based on the subject matter of the books.
A book's subject matter is an intrinsic static property because it
does not change once it is published. However, the categories used
to describe this subject matter may change over time as new
categories are added to the classification system and retroactively
assigned to previously published books. The book subject categories
can generally be thought of as extrinsic and static because the

                                                           A Nonprofit Book Publisher | 1129
threshold for changing them is higher than it is for more dynamic
properties such as Current Season, Next Season, and Bestsellers.
These categories are also included on the site in a separate section
and are all extrinsic, dynamic properties because they are based
either on time or sales, rather than intrinsic properties of the books.

The New Press classification system includes hierarchical
categories, though only the subjects in which the press publishes
more extensively have subcategories. In areas for which there are
more books, the organization can be more granular without
creating a subcategory that contains only one or a few books.
Additionally, the greater institutional knowledge of the subject area
enables the staff to make more specific distinctions within the
broader subject category. One of the questions I explored in my user
testing was whether these differentiations are necessary to support
users' interactions with the books. If the users do not share the
same level of knowledge in the subject it may not be useful, and may
even diminish usability, to differentiate at the level of granularity
provided by the subcategories.

Even at the top category level, there is a range of granularity and
also a range of principles embodied in the categories. For example,
History and Immigration are both top-level categories, but
Immigration covers a more specific group of topics than History
does. Most categories are based on the subject of the books, but
there are several top-level categories based on other principles.
These include Graphic Nonfiction, which refers to format; Primary
Source Documents, which refers to the source material; and
Biography, which refers to the genre of the book but does not
express anything about its subject matter beyond the fact that it
is about someone's life. Mixing category principles can be useful,
particularly in a faceted system, which allows users to combine
different categories to increase precision. In a faceted version of
this system, a user could select Biography and Law in order to find
biographies written about a judge or lawyer. Because books are
assigned to all relevant categories in this system, this interaction

1130 | A Nonprofit Book Publisher
is feasible at the logic level even though the current presentation
does not allow it. If The New Press wanted to switch to a faceted
presentation it would likely visually separate the categories into
blocks based on the principles, so that users knew which facets
they could pivot their searches on. This might include creating a
genre section with Biography, Oral History, and Primary Source
Documents as well as a geography section with the subcategories
from World.

   When is it being organized? Once the updated categories are
finalized, all previously published books will be reviewed and
assigned to new categories as necessary. Going forward, new books
will be categorized on a seasonal basis and new categories may
occasionally be assigned to previously published books on an ad
hoc basis (this could be due to previous oversight in not assigning
the category, or to the creation of a new category or subcategory).
This system is flexible because books can be assigned to all relevant
categories, so the introduction of a new category does not mean
that all previous assignments will need to be changed. The
subcategories also allow for flexibility because if one of these
categories becomes more important over time, it can be changed at
the presentation layer to a top-level category with minimal effort.

   How or by whom is it being organized? The sales, marketing,
and inventory manager assigns the categories, with input from the
editorial and marketing teams. From time to time other
departments, such as fundraising or publicity, may suggest a new
category or category assignment for consideration. The categories
are assigned in a FileMaker database in which the categories can
be selected from a list of existing categories and subcategories. The
category assignments in the FileMaker database are pushed to the
website along with other book data.

   Other considerations. Creating a classification system that can
be widely understood is difficult to do. In this case, simplifying the
system would support The New Press's goal of reaching a broad
audience of readers. User testing revealed that the current category
system may be hindering this because of issues with semantics,

                                                           A Nonprofit Book Publisher | 1131
granularity, and structure. The structural issues are the most
important to address because the inconsistent use of subcategories
generated significant confusion during the user testing. By
removing the subcategories and instead allowing expert users or
those who know exactly what they are looking for to use search, the
press could maximize the categories' relevance for general readers.
This could be strengthened by an emphasis on using relevant
keywords in the book descriptions that support searching. Despite
some initial surprise from the test users about certain unusual top-
level categories, I would argue that after simplifying other aspects
of the system, the press could successfully keep some of these
in order to represent its publishing areas and connect with like-
minded readers. For example, Immigration and Criminal Justice are
not top-level BISAC categories, but are easily understood by general
readers and serve to highlight these important areas for The New
Press. Biases in classification systems are unavoidable. While this
can be negative, particularly when the organizers are not aware
of the biases, it can also be harnessed positively and used to
communicate a sense of the organization and its values. This needs
to be approached thoughtfully and carefully and tested on users to
understand how people outside the organization will interact with
the system.

ROBERT J. GLUSHKO

An Appendix to The Discipline of Organizing

We have reached the end of this book, but we are just at the
beginning of "the discipline of organizing." We hope that we have
demonstrated why thinking of the art and science of organizing in
a more abstract way can enable communication and cooperation
across the numerous disciplines that are concerned with
organizing, especially library and information science, computer
science, informatics, law, economics, and business. Instead of just
appropriating concepts and methods from these fields, we have
tried to unify them, filling in the gaps between their complementary
perspectives to yield a more comprehensive and generative
understanding of how they fit together.

Now it is your turn. Perhaps you have a job in one of the fields
we have brought together that involves organizing resources of
one type or another. After reading this book, you surely will not
approach that work the same way you did before. You will be able
to apply the design patterns and principles of The Discipline of
Organizing to make your existing organizing systems more capable,
and will be able to create entirely new ones that fill the white space
between the traditional categories.

We encourage people who read this book to contribute their own
case studies at DisciplineOfOrganizing.org, and we expect to
incorporate the most interesting and entertaining ones into this
collection.

ROBERT J. GLUSHKO

Philosophers, scientists, designers, and many others have sought to
make sense of how we organize our physical and intellectual worlds
for over two thousand years. We owe a great general obligation
to all of them, so we dedicated this book to them. However, it is
more important to acknowledge more specifically the people who
made The Discipline of Organizing happen. I think it is befitting
of a book about organizing to be organized in making these
acknowledgments, as follows in three categories:

The Motivators

Annalee Saxenian, the Dean of the UC Berkeley School of
Information, challenged me in 2005 to teach the "Information
Organization and Retrieval" course required of all entering graduate
students and provided me with a supportive environment in which
to do it. The lecture notes of my predecessors, Berkeley colleagues
Marti Hearst, Ray Larson, and Mark Davis, provided important
intellectual scaffolding as I developed my own syllabus and lectures.

When I discovered the little red book by Elaine Svenonius, The
Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization, my mind
opened up to library and information science. I aspired to write a
book that could build on and broaden those foundations to connect
with my own background in cognitive and computer science. A
few months later when I met Elaine I was very pleased when she
endorsed this ambitious effort.

                                                                       Acknowledgments | 1135
I have been continually encouraged by faculty members and deans
whenever I talked about this project at Schools of Information or
similar academic units. These include the U.S. universities of
Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and North Carolina, Canadian
universities of Toronto and Western Ontario, and European
universities in Vienna and Berlin. In particular, I would like to thank
Colin Allen, Ron Day, Miles Efron, Thomas Finholt, Dan O'Hair,
Margaret Hedstrom, Michael Jones, John King, Kathryn LaBarre,
Kelly Lyons, Gary Marchionini, Jerry McDonough, Allen Renear,
Seamus Ross, Victoria Rubin, Michael Seadle, and Linda Smith. I
especially appreciate the encouragement that Deans Marchionini
and Seadle gave to Ryan Shaw and Vivien Petras, two of the principal
authors of this book. I apologize to those of you that I have forgotten
to list here.

Margy Avery of The MIT Press has pushed hard when she needed to
and has been very receptive when I needed her to be.

The Contributors

It took me four years of teaching the IO & IR course at Berkeley
before I knew enough (or too little) to think I could put together
a book that might replace the diverse set of textbooks that course
was using. I did not realize at the time how much I was learning
from these teaching assistants, and I thank them for not making it
obvious to me. Later on, after the book project was underway, my
teaching assistants were invaluable in pointing out problems with
the book, often proposing their solutions as well.

Almost exactly three years ago the project to write this book began
in a graduate seminar whose goals were to define the topical
coverage and structure of the book, and then to write chapters
starting with my course lecture notes. Among the courageous
students in that seminar were many authors of the book being

1136 | Acknowledgments
published here: Rachelle Annechino, J.J.M. Ekaterin, Ryan
Greenberg, Jess Hemerly, Michael Manoochehri, Sean Marimpietri,
Kimra McPherson, Karen Nomorosa, Hyunwoo Park, Dan Turner,
and Longhao Wang. Nick Doty, Mohit Gupta, Erin Knight, and Joyce
Tsai also contributed during this start-up period.

In Spring 2011 Erik Wilde and I conducted a seminar titled
"Principles and Patterns of Organizing Systems" to refine the key
concepts of the evolving book. This seminar added Brendan Curran,
Krishna Janakiraman, Julian Limon, Rowyn McDonald, Elisa Oreglia,
Monica Rosenberg, Karen Rustad, Bailey Smith, Leslie Tom, and
Anne Wootton to the growing set of student contributors. Leslie
gets credit for the book's title.

In Spring 2012 Andrea Angquist, Jacob Portnoff, and Brian Rea,
supervised capably by Anne Wootton, were essential editorial
assistants in my end-to-end effort to rewrite the drafts of Chapters
1-7 to improve their conceptual integration and continuity.

I used draft chapters of the book in my IO & IR course three times,
beginning in Fall 2010. The final version of the book in 2013 barely
resembles those early drafts, which means that many students
suffered to improve the book. But they did not suffer passively.
Many students submitted problems with the Twitter hashtag
#tdofix, and submitted examples using #tdoexample, which
benefited the book greatly but which surely confused their regular
Twitter followers.

Many other Berkeley students did important work on the book.
Jen Wang designed the cover; Divya Anand, Ajeeta Dhole, Christina
Pham, and Raymon Sutedjo-The did the illustrations; Lisa Jervis,
Shohei Narron, and Anne Wootton worked on the extensive
bibliography. A group of students whose work does not appear in
the printed book but whose efforts will be revealed in future ebooks
include Luis Aguilar, Fred Chasen, Philip Foeckler, Jake Hartnell,
Eliot Nahman, and AJ Renold.

                                                                        Acknowledgments | 1137
Eliot Kimber showed me that it was possible to write a book that
could be published simultaneously in print and in ebooks. It has not
turned out to be as simple as someone as talented as Kimber can
make it seem, but I am grateful to Eliot for convincing me that I
should try to do it. With help from Bob Stayton, Adam Witwer (and
O'Reilly Media) we will get there.

I must also thank Christine Borgman of UCLA for bringing a group of
energetic and thoughtful UCLA graduate students into the project.
Two of them, Matt Mayernik and Alberto Pepe, are contributing
authors. Amelia Acker, Jillian Wallis, and Laura Wynholds taught me
a great deal about libraries and archives, and I am certain they tried
to teach me much more than I was able to learn.

Many people read draft chapters and were thankfully unsparing in
their criticism because they wanted to make this book as good as
it could be. Thank you Scott Abel, Larry Barsalou, Marcia Bates,
Christine Borgman, Michael Cohen, David Kirsh, Jeff Elman, Rob
Goldstone, Jonathan Grudin, Ben Hill, Mano Marks, Patrick Schmitz,
Elaine Svenonius, Jeff Zych, and everyone else whom I have
carelessly forgotten.

Few books have been as battle tested before they went to print as
this one. Let me thank those who have been willing to teach from
a book that did not entirely exist: Jane Greenberg, Irith Hartman,
Lauren Plews, Sarah Ramdeen, Christian Sandvig, Emily Seitz,
Isabelle Sperano, Konstantin Tovstiadi, Hong Zhang, and especially
Vivien Petras and Ryan Shaw who went to battle with (and for) this
book multiple times.

The Essentials

The third and final category of acknowledgments is for people who

1138 | Acknowledgments
were essential, without whom this project would never have been
finished.

Jess Hemerly and Kimra McPherson joined the project in the "first
campaign" of Spring 2010, worked tirelessly through that summer
to make chapter drafts course-worthy, and served as teaching
assistants in Fall 2010 when the book was first tested with students.
They helped me believe that there might be a book in there
somewhere when it took a lot of faith to see that.

Erik Wilde taught me much through our multi-year collaboration
and dialectic when he was on the Berkeley faculty from 2006-2011.
Erik made me understand the elegance and great scope of the word
"resource," which became the central concept in this book. His
meticulously annotated reviews of many chapters from a computer
science perspective helped inspire the idea of discipline-tagged
endnotes.

Ryan Shaw and Vivien Petras, both young professors at schools a
long distance from Berkeley, found courage in themselves and had
confidence in the draft book coming out of Berkeley in 2011--first
to teach with it, and then to help write it, becoming the primary
reviewers of my chapters and the first authors of Chapters 8 and 9.

Murray Maloney joined the project in April 2012 as copy editor, but
we together soon recognized that his nearly three decades of SGML,
XML, and publishing experience were too valuable not to exploit
further for the benefit of this book. Without Murray's work as the
markup and production editor, indexer and glossary-maker, there
would be too much work left to do and no one capable of doing
it as well as Murray has. Somehow along the way he also found
time to make important intellectual contributions as a co-author in
Chapters 5 and 8.

Finally, I want to thank Pam Samuelson. She has been far too patient
with me as I talked with her, to her, and at her for three years
while this book was being written, who turned many quarter-baked

                                                                       Acknowledgments | 1139
ideas into half-baked ones, and who turned many half-baked ones
into cornerstones of this book. Most importantly, she has helped
me focus on this book and get it finished when it would have been
easy to give up on it. I promise not to take on another book project
anytime soon because Pam has suffered enough for this one.

wherever practical, the contents of the glossary definitions are
transcluded from the chapters and hypertext links offer the gentle
reader with a means to go back to the source so that it can be

aboutness

      "Subject matter" organization involves the use of a classification
      system that provides categories and descriptive terms for
      indicating what a resource is about. Because they use aboutness
      properties that are not directly perceived, methods for
      assigning subject classifications are intellectually-intensive and
      in many cases require rigorous training to be performed
      consistently and appropriately. (From "Organizing Resources".)

absolute synonyms

      The strictest definition is that synonyms "are words that can
      replace each other in some class of contexts with insignificant
      changes of the whole text's meaning." (From "Synonymy".)

      See also synonym

abstract models

      Abstract models describe structures commonly found in
      resource descriptions and other information resources,
      regardless of the specific domain. (From "Structuring

acquisition

      Adding a resource to a library collection is called acquisition,
      but adding to a museum collection is called accessioning. (From
      "Introduction".)

      See also accessioning, collection development

active resources

      Active resources create effects or value on their own, sometimes
      when they initiate interactions with passive resources. Active
      resources can be people, other living resources, computational
      agents, active information sources, web-based services, self-
      driving cars, robots, appliances, machines or otherwise
      ordinary objects like light bulbs, umbrellas, and shoes that have
      been made "smarter." (From "Active or Operant Resources".)

activities

      There are four activities that occur naturally in every organizing
      system; how explicit they are depend on the scope, the breadth
      or variety of the resources, and the scale, the number of

                                                                                     Glossary | 1275

ad hoc category

      An ad hoc category or goal-derived category is a collection
      of resources that happen to go together to satisfy a goal. The
      resources might not have any discernible properties in
      common. (From "Principles for Creating Categories".)

affordance

      The concept of affordance, introduced by J. J. Gibson, then
      extended and popularized by Donald Norman, captures the idea
      that physical resources and their environments have inherent
      actionable properties that determine, in conjunction with an
      actor's capabilities and cognition, what can be done with the
      resource. (From "Affordance and Capability".)

      See also capability

agency

      Agency is the extent to which a resource can initiate actions
      on its own. We can define a continuum between completely
      passive resources that cannot initiate any actions and active
      resources that can initiate actions based on information they
      sense from their environments or obtain through interactions
      with other resources. (From "Resource Agency".)

agent

      We use the more general word, agent, for any entity capable
      of autonomous and intentional organizing effort, because it
      treats organizing work done by people and organizing work

      done by computers as having common goals, despite obvious
      differences in methods. (From "The Concept of "Agent"".)

agents

      Basically, people and the various groups and organizations with
      which they identify, whether based on physical, mental, socio-
      economic, or political characteristics--e.g., "stonemasons" or
      "socialists." (From "Faceted Classification in Description".)

analytico-synthetic classification

      In library science a classification system that builds categories
      by combination of facets is sometimes also called analytico-
      synthetic. (From "Classification Schemes".)

anchor text

      In web contexts, the words in which a structural link is
      embedded are called the anchor text. (From "Hypertext Links".)

antonymy
      Antonymy is the lexical relationship between two words that
      have opposite meanings. Antonymy is a very salient lexical
      relationship, and for adjectives it is even more powerful than
      synonymy. (From "Antonymy".)

      does it depreciate? Does it have a shelf life? Does it have any
      associated ratings, rankings, or quality measures? Moreover,
      what is the quality of those ratings, rankings and measures?
      (From "Resource Description to Support Selection".)

architectural perspective
      The architectural perspective emphasizes the number and
      abstraction level of the components of a relationship, which
      together characterize its complexity. (From "Describing
      Relationships: An Overview".)

arity

      The degree or arity of a relationship is the number of entity
      types or categories of resources in the relationship. This is

attribute

      Attribute is a synonym for "property."

      To attribute is to assert or assign a value to a property. See
      attribution relationship

      An attribute is a syntactic component of XML elements and
      a conceptual component of the XML Infoset, consisting of a
      potentially qualified name and a value, whose type may
      influence its interpretation. The value of an attribute in an XML
      document is a Unicode string. The value of that attribute in the
      XML Infoset could be a simple string of text, a precisely-typed
      numeric or temporal value, a list of references to document
      nodes, a hypertext link, or a reference to a formal notation. (See
      also element item)

attribution relationship

      Asserting or assigning values to properties; the predicate
      depends on the property: "is-the-author-of," "is-married-to,"
      "is-employed-by," etc. (From "Types of Semantic
      Relationships".)

      Is the resource what it claims to be? ("Authenticity") Resource
      descriptions that can support authentication include
      technological ones like time stamps, watermarking, encryption,
      checksums, and digital signatures. (From "Determining the
      Purposes".)

authenticity
      In ordinary use we say that something is authentic if it can be
      shown to be, or has come to be accepted as what it claims to
      be. The importance and nuance of questions about authenticity
      can be seen in the many words we have to describe the
      relationship between "the real thing" (the "original") and
      something else: copy, reproduction, replica, fake, phony,
      forgery, counterfeit, pretender, imposter, ringer, and so on.

authority control
      For bibliographic resources important aspects of vocabulary
      control include determining the authoritative forms for author
      names, uniform titles of works, and the set of terms by which a
      particular subject will be known. In library science, the process
      of creating and maintaining these standard names and terms
      is known as authority control. (From "Use Controlled
      Vocabularies".)

                                                                                     Glossary | 1281

bi-directional links
      When a bi-directional link is created between an anchor and a
      destination, it is as though a one-way link that can be followed
      in the opposite direction is automatically created. Two one-
      way links serve the same purpose, but the return link is not
      automatically established when the first one is created. (From

big data

      For digital resources, inexpensive storage and high bandwidth
      have largely eliminated capacity as a constraint for organizing
      systems, with an exception for big data, which is defined as
      a collection of data that is too big to be managed by typical
      database software and hardware architectures. (From
      "Architectural Thinking".)

binary antonyms

      Contrasting or binary antonyms are used in mutually exclusive
      contexts where one or the other word can be used, but never
      both. For example, "alive" and "dead" can never be used at the
      same time to describe the state of some entity, because the
      meaning of one excludes or contradicts the meaning of the
      other. (From "Antonymy".)

character

      Unicode makes the important distinction between characters
      and glyphs. A character is the smallest meaningful unit of a
      written language. In alphabet-based languages like English,
      characters are letters; in languages like Chinese, characters are
      ideographs. (From "Notations".)

character encoding

      A notation that has had numbers assigned to its characters is
      called a character encoding. (From "Notations".)

      The most ambitious character coding in existence is Unicode,
      which as of version 6.0 assigns numbers to 109,449 characters.
      Unicode makes the important distinction between characters
      and glyphs.

chronological ordering

      Chronological ordering is arranging resources according to the
      date of their creation or other important event in the lifetime of
      the resource (From "The Concept of "Organizing Principle"".).

classes

      In object-oriented programming languages, classes are schemas
      that serve as templates for the creation of objects. A class in a
      programming language is analogous to a database schema that
      specifies the structure of its member instances, in that the class
      definition specifies how instances of the class are constructed
      in terms of data types and possible values. Programming classes
      may also specify whether data in a member object can be
      accessed, and if so, how. (From "Implementing Categories
      Defined by Properties".)

classical categories

      Categories defined by necessary and sufficient properties are
      also called monothetic. They are also sometimes called classical
      categories because they conform to Aristotle's theory of how
      categories are used in logical deduction using syllogisms. (From
      "Necessary and Sufficient Properties".)

classification

      The systematic assignment of resources to a system of intentional
      categories, often institutional ones. (From "Classification vs.
      Categorization".)

      Classification is applied categorization - the assignment of
      resources to a system of categories, called classes, using a
      predetermined set of principles.

classification scheme

      See classifications

classifications

      A system of categories and its attendant rules or access
      methods is typically called a classification scheme or just the
      classifications. A system of categories captures the distinctions
      and relationships among its resources that are most important
      in a domain and for a particular context of use, creating a
      reference model or conceptual roadmap for its users. (From
      "Introduction".)

classifying

      When we make an assertion that a particular instance is a
      member of class, we are classifying the instance. (From
      "Inclusion".)

class inclusion

      Class inclusion is the fundamental and familiar "is-a," "is-a-
      type-of," or "subset" relationship between two entity types or
      classes where one is contained in and thus more specific than
      the other more generic one. (From "Inclusion".)

      See also inclusion

clustering

      Clustering techniques share the goal of creating meaningful
      categories from a collection of items whose properties are hard
      to directly perceive and evaluate, which implies that category
      membership cannot easily be reduced to specific property tests
      and instead must be based on similarity. (From "Categories
      Created by Clustering".)

      The end result of clustering is a statistically optimal set of

                                                                                    Glossary | 1289
      categories in which the similarity of all the items within a
      category is larger than the similarity of items that belong to
      different categories.

cognates

      Many words in different languages have common roots, and as
      a result are often spelled the same or nearly the same. This is
      especially true for technology words; for example, "computer"
      has been borrowed by many languages. The existence of these
      cognates and borrowed words makes us vulnerable to false
      cognates. When a word in one language has a different meaning
      and refers to different resources in another, the results can be
      embarrassing or disastrous. "Gift" is poison in German; "pain"
      is bread in French. (From "Homonymy, Polysemy, and False
      Cognates".)

collection

      A collection is a group of resources that have been selected for
      some purpose. (From "The Concept of "Collection"".)

collection development

      Libraries and museums usually make their selection principles
      explicit in collection development policies. Adding a resource to
      a library collection is called acquisition, but adding to a museum
      collection is called accessioning. Documenting the contents of
      library and museum collections to organize them is called
      cataloging. Circulation is a central interaction in libraries, but
      because museum resources do not circulate the primary
      interactions for museum users are viewing or visiting the
      collection. Maintenance activities are usually described as
      preservation or curation. (From "Introduction".)

collocation

      The Organizing System for a small collection can sometimes

1290 | Glossary
      use only the minimal or default organizing principle of
      colocation--putting all the resources in the same location: in the

      Compliance is a maintenance activity.

component-object inclusion

      Component-Object is the relationship type when the part is a

      components to create a larger resource. (From "Types of
      Semantic Relationships".)

compounding

      Putting two "free morphemes" together. (From "Derivational

constraint

      A limit or bound on a data type or structure, most usefully
      expressed in a schema or regular expression. Constraints on
      data types and structures can be expressed in a variety of
      natural, programming and schema languages with varying
      degrees of efficacy. (Ed.)

content rules

      Content rules are similar to controlled vocabularies because
      they also limit the possible values that can be used in
      descriptions. Instead of specifying a fixed set of values, content
      rules typically restrict descriptions by requiring them to be of
      a particular data type (integer, Boolean, Date, and so on). (From
      "Controlled Vocabularies and Content Rules".)

                                                                                     Glossary | 1291
contextual properties

      Contextual properties are those related to the situation or
      context in which a resource is described. Dey defines context
      as "any information that characterizes a situation related to the
      interactions between users, applications, and the surrounding
      environment." (From "Extrinsic Dynamic Properties".)

controlled vocabulary

      One way to encourage good names for a given resource domain
      or task is to establish a controlled vocabulary. A controlled
      vocabulary is like a fixed or closed dictionary that includes the
      terms that can be used in a particular domain. A controlled
      vocabulary shrinks the number of words used, reducing
      synonymy and homonymy, eliminating undesirable
      associations, leaving behind a set of words with precisely
      defined meanings and rules governing their use. (From "Use
      Controlled Vocabularies".)

crosswalk

      Similar to mapping, a straightforward approach to

      and writing systems from one organizing system to those of
      another. (From "Modes of Transformation".)

cultural categories
      Cultural categories are the archetypical form of categories upon
      which individual and institutional categories are usually based.
      Cultural categories tend to describe our everyday experiences
      of the world and our accumulated cultural knowledge. (From
      "Cultural Categories".)

cultural properties
      Cultural properties derive from conventional language or
      culture, often by analogy, because they can be highly evocative
      and memorable. (From "Extrinsic Dynamic Properties"

curation
      Curation is a maintenance activity.
      Curation usually refers to the methods or systems that add
      value to and preserve resources, while the concept of
      governance more often emphasizes the institutions or
      organizations that carry out those activities. The former is most
      often used for libraries, museums, or archives and the latter
      for enterprise or inter-enterprise contexts. (From "When Is It
      Being Organized?".)

data

      Data is a collection of one or more pieces if information. The
      singular noun form is "datum"; the plural forms are "datums"
      and "data"; the collective noun form is also "data". For example:
      Starting with a single datum; many more datums are
      subsequently identified; those data are then intentionally
      arranged; and, finally the data is organized.

data activities

      Data capture, extraction and generation are resource selection
      activities.

      Data cleaning and cleansing are maintenance activities.

      Data insertion and integration add resources to a collection.

      Data schemas that specify data entities, elements, identifiers,
      attributes, and relationships in databases and XML document
      types on the transactional end of the Document Type Spectrum
      ("Resource Domain") are implementations of the categories
      needed for the design, development and maintenance of
      information organization systems. Data schemas tend to rigidly
      define categories of resources. (From "Implementing

description resources

      Any primary resource can have one or more description
      resources associated with it to facilitate finding, interacting
      with, or interpreting the primary one. Description resources are
      essential in organizing systems where the primary resources
      are not under its control and can only be accessed or interacted
      with through the description. Description resources are often
      called metadata. (From "Resource Focus".)

      Description resources, such as physical or online catalog
      records, describe the primary resources that comprise the
      collection.

descriptive control

      Descriptive control is objective and straightforward, lining up
      a population of writings in any arbitrary order. (From
      "Bibliographic Descriptions".)

descriptor

      In the library science context of bibliographic description, a
      descriptor is one of the terms in a carefully designed language

dictionary

      A dictionary is a set of property-value pairs or entries. It is a set

      Note that this specialized meaning of dictionary is different
      from the more common meaning of "dictionary" as an
      alphabetized list of terms accompanied by sentences that
      define them. (From "Dictionaries".)

digitization

      Other digital resources are created by digitization, the process
      for transforming an artifact whose original format is physical
      so it can be stored and manipulated by a computer. (From
      "Resource Format".)

dimensionality reduction

      Dimensionality reduction implies transforming a high-
      dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one. Reducing the
      number of components in a multidimensional description can
      be accomplished by many different statistical techniques that
      go by names like "feature extraction," "principle components
      analysis," "orthogonal decomposition," "latent semantic
      analysis," "multidimensional scaling," and "factor analysis."

directionality

      The directionality of a relationship defines the order in which
      the arguments of the relationship are connected. A one-way

      directions. (From "Directionality".)

      Resource domain is an intuitive notion that groups resources

      to be in the same place at some time. (From "Resource

      Many resources, or their properties, also have locative or
      temporal effectivity, meaning that they come into effect at a

faceted classification
      In a faceted classification system, each resource is described

      using properties from multiple facets, but a person searching
      for resources does not need to consider all of the properties

      them in a fixed order, which an enumerative hierarchical
      classification requires. (From "Faceted Classification".)

family resemblance

      A second consequence is that the sharing of some but not

      still are recognizable as members of the same family. (From

finding

      What resources are available that "correspond to the user's
      stated search criteria" and thus can satisfy an information
      need? Before there were online catalogs and digital libraries,
      we found resources by referencing catalogs of printed resource
      descriptions incorporating the title, author, and subject terms
      as access points into the collection; the subject descriptions
      were the most important finding aids when the user had no
      particular resource in mind. Modern users accept that
      computerized indexing makes search possible over not only the
      entire description resource, but often over the entire content of
      the primary resource. (From "Resource Description to Support
      Interactions".)

flexibility of classification

      A related principle about maintaining classifications over time
      is flexibility, the degree to which the classification can
      accommodate new categories. Computer scientists typically
      describe this principle as extensibility, and library scientists
      sometimes describe it as hospitality. (From "Principles for
      Maintaining the Classification over Time".)

      (http://www.foaf-project.org/)

focus

      The contrast between primary resources and description
      resources is very useful in many contexts, but when we look
      more broadly at organizing systems, it is often difficult to
      distinguish them, and determining which resources are primary
      and which are metadata is often just a decision about which
      resource is currently the focus of our attention. (From
      "Resource Focus".)

fonds

      The "original order" of the resources in an archive embodies the
      implicit or explicit organizing system of the person or entity
      that created the documents; it is treated as an essential part
      of the meaning of the collection. As a result, the unit of
      organization for archival collections is the fonds--the original
      arrangement or grouping, preserving any hierarchy of boxes,
      folders, envelopes, and individual documents--and thus they
      are not re-organized according to other (perhaps more
      systematic) classifications. (From "What Is Being Organized?".)

font

      A font is a collection of glyphs used to depict some set of
      characters. A Unicode font explicitly associates each glyph with
      a particular number in the Unicode character encoding. (From
      "Notations".)

      often used for libraries, museums, or archives and the latter
      for enterprise or inter-enterprise contexts. (From "When Is It

      The syntax and grammar of a language consists of the rules
      that determine which combinations of its words are allowed
      and are thus grammatical or well-formed. Natural languages

      and other parts of speech, but they differ greatly in how they
      arrange them to create sentences. (From "Syntax and
      Grammar".)
granularity
      Granularity refers to the level of detail or precision for a
      specific information resource property. For instance, the postal
      address of a particular location might be represented as several
      different data items, including the number, street name, city,
      state, country and postal code (a high-granularity model). It
      might also be represented in one single line including all of
      the information above (a low-granularity model). (From
      "Granularity and Abstraction".)
graph
      Like a tree, a graph consists of a set of nodes connected by
      edges. These edges may or may not have a direction
      ("Directionality"). If they do, the graph is referred to as a
      "directed graph." If a graph is directed, it may be possible to
      start at a node and follow edges in a path that leads back to
      the starting node. Such a path is called a "cycle." If a directed
      graph has no cycles, it is referred to as an "acyclic graph." (From
      "Graphs".)

      Another purpose of resource description is to enable a user
      to confirm the identity of a specific resource or to distinguish
      among several that have some overlapping descriptions. In
      bibliographic contexts this might mean finding the resource
      that is identified by its citation. Computer processable resource
      descriptions like bar codes, QR codes, or RFID tags are also
      used to identify resources. In Semantic Web contexts, URIs
      serve this purpose. (From "Resource Description to Support

      in some technology environment. (From "Describing
      Relationships: An Overview".)

implicit classification

      Because names and dates can take on a great many values, an
      organizing principle like alphabetical or chronological ordering
      is unlikely to enumerate in advance an explicit category for
      each possible value. Instead, we can consider these organizing
      principles as creating an implicit or latent classification system
      in which the categories are generated only as needed. For
      example, the Q category only exists in an alphabetical scheme

                                                                                     Glossary | 1315

      One entity type contains or is comprised of other entity types;
      often expressed using "is-a," "is-a-type-of," "is-part-of," or "is-

      about the locations and frequencies of terms in a document

individual categorization

      Individual categories are created in an organizing system to
      satisfy the ad hoc requirements that arise from a person's
      unique experiences, preferences, and resource collections.
      Unlike cultural categories, which usually develop slowly and
      last a long time, individual categories are created by intentional
      activity, in response to a specific situation, or to solve an
      emerging organizational challenge. (From "Individual
      Categories".)

inflectional morphology

Inflectional mechanisms change the form of a word to

information. Unlike derivation, inflection never changes the
part-of-speech of the base morpheme. The inflectional
morphology of English is relatively simple compared with other
languages. (From "Inflectional Morphology".)

informatics

Informatics is a broad academic category encompassing the
science of information, including the automation of information
processing. Computer science, information architecture and
web architecture are among the related academic disciplines.

information architecture

Abstract patterns of information content or organization are
sometimes called architectures, so it is straightforward from
the perspective of the discipline of organizing to define the
activity of information architecture as designing an abstract and
effective organization of information and then exposing that
organization to facilitate navigation and information use. (From
""Information Architecture" and Organizing Systems".)

An information component can be: (1) Any piece of information
that has a unique label or identifier or (2) Any piece of
information that is self-contained and comprehensible on its
own. (From "Identity and Information Components".)

institutional categorization

      In contrast to cultural categories that are created and used
      implicitly, and to individual categories that are used by people
      acting alone, institutional categories are created and used
      explicitly, and most often by many people in coordination with
      each other. Institutional categories are most often created in
      abstract and information-intensive domains where
      unambiguous and precise categories are needed to regulate and
      systematize activity, to enable information sharing and reuse,
      and to reduce transaction costs. (From "Institutional
      Categories".)

institutional semantics

      Systems of institutional semantics offer precisely defined
      abstractions or information components ("Identity and
      Information Components") needed to ensure that information
      can be efficiently exchanged and used. (From "Institutional
      Semantics".)

institutional taxonomies

      Institutional taxonomies are classifications designed to make it
      more likely that people or computational agents will organize
      and interact with resources in the same way. (From

      Integration is the controlled sharing of information between

1318 | Glossary
      two (or more) business systems, applications, or services within
      or between firms. Integration means that one party can extract
      or obtain information from another one, it does not imply that
      the recipient can make use of the information. (From
      "Integration and Interoperability".)

integrity of classification

      Changes in the meaning of the categories in a classification
      threaten its integrity, the principle that categories should not
      move within the structure of the classification system. (From
      "Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time".)

intension

      Categories whose members are determined by one or more
      properties or rules follow the principle of intensional definition,
      and the defining properties are called the intension. (From
      "Single Properties".)

intentional arrangement

      Intentional arrangement emphasizes explicit or implicit acts of
      organization by people, or by computational processes acting
      as proxies for, or as implementations of, human intentionality.
      (From "The Concept of "Intentional Arrangement"".)

interaction

      An interaction is an action, function, service, or capability that
      makes use of the resources in a collection or the collection as a
      whole. The interaction of access is fundamental in any collection

                                                                                     Glossary | 1319
      of resources, but many Organizing Systems provide additional
      functions to make access more efficient and to support
      additional interactions with the accessed resources. (From "The
      Concept of "Interactions"".)

interoperability

      Interoperability goes beyond integration to mean that systems,
      applications, or services that exchange information can make
      sense of what they receive. Interoperability can involve
      identifying corresponding components and relationships in
      each system, transforming them syntactically to the same
      format, structurally to the same granularity, and semantically to
      the same meaning. (From "Integration and Interoperability".)

intrinsic meaning interpretation

      One of Panofsky's three levels of description for artistic
      resources. At this level, context and deeper understanding
      come into play--including what the creator of the description
      knows about the situation in which the work was created. Why,
      for example, did this particular artist create this particular
      depiction of The Last Supper in this way? Panofsky posited that
      professional art historians are needed here, because they are
      the ones with the education and background necessary to draw
      meaning from a work. (From "Describing Museum and Artistic
      Resources".)

inverse document frequency

      Inverse document frequency (idf) is a collection-level property.
      The document frequency (df) is the number of resources
      containing a particular term. The inverse document frequency
      (idf) for a term is defined as idft = log(N/dft), where N is the
      total number of documents. The inverse document frequency
      of a term decreases the more documents contain the term,
      providing a discriminating factor for the importance of terms

      Probabilistic Models".)

inverse relationship

      For asymmetric relationships, it is often useful to be explicit
      about the meaning of the relationship when the order of the
      arguments in the relationship is reversed. The resulting
      relationship is called the inverse or the converse of the first
      relationship. (From "Inverse".)

machine learning

      machine learning is home to numerous techniques for creating
      classifiers by training them with already correctly categorized
      examples. This training is called supervised learning; it is
      supervised because it starts with instances labeled by category,
      and it involves learning because over time the classifier
      improves its performance by adjusting the weights for features
      that distinguish the categories. But strictly speaking, supervised
      learning techniques do not learn the categories; they
      implement and apply categories that they inherit or are given
      to them. (From "Computational Categories".)

      Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)

      (http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/)

preservation

      Preservation is a maintenance activity.

      See also curation, collection development

preservation metadata

      Preservation metadata is technical information about resource
      formats and technology needed to ensure resource and
      collection integrity in a maintenance context. (From "Resource
      Description to Support Maintenance".)

primary resource

      Treating as a primary resource anything that can be identified is
      an important generalization of the concept because it enables
      web-based services, data feeds, objects with RFID tags, sensors
      or other smart devices, or computational agents to be part of
      Organizing Systems. (From "The Concept of "Resource"".)

primary subject matter

      One of Panofsky's three levels of description for artistic
      resources. At this level, we describe the most basic elements of
      a work in a generic way that would be recognizable by anyone
      regardless of expertise or training. The painting The Last
      Supper, for example, might be described as "13 people having
      dinner." (From "Describing Museum and Artistic Resources".)

property

      In this book we use property in a generic and ordinary sense as
      a synonym for feature or "characteristic." Many cognitive and

1340 | Glossary
      computer scientists are more precise in defining these terms
      and reserve property for binary predicates (e.g., something is
      red or not, round or not). If multiple values are possible, the
      property is called an attribute, "dimension," or "variable." (From
      "Organizing Resources".)

property-based categorization

      Property-based categorization works tautologically well for
      categories like "prime number" where the category is defined
      by necessary and sufficient properties. Property-based
      categorization also works well when properties are
      conceptually distinct and the value of a property is easy to
      perceive and examine, as they are with man-made physical
      resources like shirts. (From "The Limits of Property-Based
      Categorization".)

propositional synonyms

      Propositional synonyms are not identical in meaning, but they
      are equivalent enough that substituting one for the other will
      not change the truth value of the sentence. (From "Synonymy".)

provenance
      Provenance is the history of the ownership of a collection or
      the resources in it, where they have been and who has
      possessed them. In organizing systems like museums and
      archives that preserve rare or culturally important objects or
      documents, provenance describes a record of who has
      authenticated a resource over time. (From "Provenance"

                                                                                     Glossary | 1341

      catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43655)

qualified names

      Qualified names are identifiers which explicitly identify the
      domain, or namespace, from which they are drawn, thereby
      reducing identifier collision. (From "Make Identifiers Unique or
      Qualified".)

quality

      A quality is an attribute or property of a resource. A quality is
      logically ascribable by a subject. (Ed.)

      Quality is a measure of the fitness of purpose of a resource
      or service. It is the difference between what was planned or
      expected versus what was realized or manifest; it is as an
      assessment of the suitability of a resource or interaction. (Ed.)

querying

      Querying is a very common interaction in many organizing
      systems, including libraries, museums, archives, computer
      science, information architecture, data science, the Web,
      philosophy, cognitive sciences, linguistics, business, and law.
      Formulating a query in natural language is typically a precursor
      to application of more systematized techniques discussed
      throughout this book.

resolution

      For a digital resource, its identifier serves as the input to the
      system or function that determines its location so it can be
      retrieved, a process called resolving the identifier or resolution.
      (From "Identity, Identifiers, and Names".)

resource

      Resource has an ordinary sense of anything of value that can
      support goal-oriented activity. This definition means that a
      resource can be a physical thing, a non-physical thing,
      information about physical things, information about non-
      physical things, or anything you want to organize. Other words
      that aim for this broad scope are entity, object, item, and
      instance. Document is often used for an information resource
      in either digital or physical format; artifact refers to resources
      created by people, and asset for resources with economic value.

      Resource has specialized meaning in Internet architecture. It is
      conventional to describe web pages, images, videos, and so on
      as resources, and the protocol for accessing them, Hypertext
      Transfer Protocol (HTTP), uses the Uniform Resource Identifier
      (URI). (From "The Concept of "Resource"".)

resource description

      We describe resources so that we can refer to them, distinguish
      among them, search for them, manage access to them, preserve
      them, and make predictions about what might happen to them
      or what they might do. Each purpose may require different
      resource descriptions. We use resource descriptions in every
      communication and conversation; they are the enablers of
      organizing systems.

Resource Description Framework (RDF)

      The Resource Description Framework (RDF) metamodel is a

scalability

      Facet values must accommodate potential additions to the set
      of instances. Including an "Other" value is an easy way to ensure
      that a facet is flexible and hospitable to new instances, but it
      not desirable if all new instances will be assigned that value.
      (From "Design Principles and Pragmatics".)

scale

      The number of resources and interactions that the collection
      entails. (Ed.)

schema

      A schema (or model, or metadata standard) specifies the set
      of descriptions that apply to an entire resource type. (From
      "Abstraction in Resource Description".)

scientific warrant

      The principle of scientific warrant argues that only the
      categories recognized by the scientists or experts in a domain
      should be used in a classification system, and it is often
      opposed by the principle of use or user warrant, which chooses
      categories and descriptive terms according to their frequency
      of use by everyone, not just experts. (From "Principles
      Embodied in the Classification Scheme".)

scope

      The resource domain and scope circumscribe the describable
      properties and the possible purposes that descriptions might
      serve. (From "The Process of Describing Resources".)

                                                                                     Glossary | 1347
secondary subject matter

      One of Panofsky's three levels of description for artistic
      resources. Here, we introduce a level of basic cultural
      understanding into a description. Someone familiar with a
      common interpretation of the Bible, for example, could now
      see The Last Supper as representing Jesus surrounded by his
      disciples. (From "Describing Museum and Artistic Resources".)

selecting

      Determining the scope of the organizing system by specifying
      which resources should be included.

      Selecting in this context means the user activity of using
      resource descriptions to support a choice of resource from a
      collection, not the institutional activity of selecting resources
      for the collection in the first place. (From "Resource Description
      to Support Organizing".)

self-organizing systems

      Self-organizing systems can change their internal structure or
      their function in response to feedback or changed
      circumstances. (From "The Concept of "Intentional
      Arrangement"".)

semantic balance

      Top-level facets should be the properties that best differentiate
      the resources in the classification domain. The values should
      be of equal semantic scope so that resources are distributed
      among the subcategories. Subfacets of "Cookware" like
      "Sauciers and Saucepans" and "Roasters and Brasiers" are
      semantically balanced as they are both named and grouped by
      cooking activity. (From "Design Principles and Pragmatics".)

1348 | Glossary
semantic gap

      The semantic gap is the difference in perspective in naming
      and description when resources are described by automated
      processes rather than by people. (From "The Semantic Gap".)

semantic perspective

      The semantic perspective characterizes the meaning of the
      association between resources. (From "Describing
      Relationships: An Overview".)

semantic web

      The vision of a Semantic Web world builds upon the web world,
      but adds some further prescriptions and constraints for how
      to structure descriptions. The Semantic Web world unifies the
      concept of a resource as it has been developed in this book,
      with the web notion of a resource as anything with a URI.
      On the Semantic Web, anything being described must have
      a URI. Furthermore, the descriptions must be structured as
      graphs, adhering to the RDF metamodel and relating resources
      to one another via their URIs. Advocates of Linked Data further
      prescribe that those descriptions must be made available as
      representations transferred over HTTP. (From "The Semantic
      Web World".)

sensemaking

      Sensemaking (or sense-making) is the set of processes used
      by humans to derive meaning from experience or to enhance
      our understanding. Philosophy, the cognitive sciences and
      linguistics are among the related academic disciplines.

      See unsupervised learning

stemming

      These processing steps normalize inflectional and derivational
      variations in terms, e.g., by removing the "-ed" from verbs in
      the past tense. This homogenization can be done by following
      rules (stemming) or by using dictionaries (lemmatization). Rule-
      based stemming algorithms are easy to implement, but can
      result in wrongly normalized word groups, for example when
      "university" and "universe" are both stemmed to "univers."
      (From "Transforming Resources for Interactions".)

stopword elimination

      Stopwords are those words in a language that occur very
      frequently and are not very semantically expressive. Stopwords
      are usually articles, pronouns, prepositions, or conjunctions.
      Since they occur in every text, they can be removed because
      they cannot distinguish them. Of course, in some cases,
      removing stopwords might remove semantically important
      phrases (e.g., "To be or not to be"). (From "Transforming
      Resources for Interactions".)

stuff-object inclusion

      Stuff-Object relationships are most often expressed using "is-
      partly" or "is-made-of" and are distinguishable from
      component-object ones because the stuff cannot be separated
      from the object without altering its identity. The stuff is not
      a separate ingredient that is used to make the object; it is a
      constituent of it once it is made. (From "Types of Semantic
      Relationships".)

subject

      In the RDF metamodel, a pair of nodes and its edge is called
      a triple, because it consists of three parts (two nodes and one
      edge). The RDF metamodel is a directed graph, so it identifies
      one node (the one from which the edge is pointing) as the
      subject of the triple, and the other node (the one to which the
      edge is pointing) as its object. The edge is referred to as the

                                                                                    Glossary | 1353
      predicate or (as we have been saying) property of the triple.
      (From "RDF".)

sufficiency and necessity

      Descriptions should have enough information to serve their
      purposes and not contain information that is not necessary for
      some purpose; this might imply excluding some aspects of self-
      descriptions that are insignificant. (From "Principles of Good
      Description".)

supervised learning

      In supervised learning, a machine learning program is trained
      with sample items or documents that are labeled by category,
      and the program learns to assign new items to the correct
      categories. (From "Computational Categories"

syntax
      The syntax and grammar of a language consists of the rules
      that determine which combinations of its words are allowed
      and are thus grammatical or well-formed. Natural languages

      and other parts of speech, but they differ greatly in how they

tokenization

      Segments the stream of characters (in an encoding scheme,
      a space is also a character) into textual components, usually
      words. In English, a simple rule-based system can separate
      words using spaces. However, punctuation makes things more
      complicated. For example, periods at the end of sentences
      should be removed, but periods in numbers should not. Other
      languages introduce other problems for tokenization; in
      Chinese, a space does not mark the divisions between individual
      concepts. (From the sidebar Text Processing in "Transforming
      Resources for Interactions".)

topological inclusion

      Topological inclusion is a type of inclusion relationship
      between a container and what it surrounds or contains. It is
      most often expressed using "is-in" as the relationship.
      However, the entity that is contained or surrounded is not a
      part of the including one, so this is not a part-whole
      relationship. (From "Inclusion".)

training set

      A training set for supervised learning is taken from the labeled
      instances. The remaining instances are used for validation.
      (From "Computational Classification".)

transclusion

      The inclusion, by hypertext reference, of a resource or part
      of a resource into another resource is called transclusion.
      Transclusion is normally performed automatically, without user
      intervention. The inclusion of images in web documents is an
      example of transclusion. Transclusion is a frequently used
      technique in business and legal document processing, where
      re-use of consistent and up-to-date content is essential to
      achieve efficiency and consistency. (From "Hypertext Links")

transformation

      Transformation is a very broad concept but in the context of
      organizing systems it typically means a change in a resource
      representation or description. The transformation can involve
      the selection, restructuring, or rearrangement of resources or
      parts of them. (See "Transforming Resources for Interactions".)

transitivity

      Transitivity is another property that can apply to semantic
      relationships. When a relationship is transitive, if X and Y have
      a relationship, and Y and Z have the same relationship, then
      X also has the relationship with Z. Any relationship based on
      ordering is transitive, which includes numerical, alphabetic, and
      chronological ones as well as those that imply qualitative or
      quantitative measurement. (From "Transitivity".)

                                                                                    Glossary | 1359
tree

      Trees consist of nodes joined by edges, recursively nested.
      When a single, root dictionary is connected to child nodes that
      are themselves dictionaries, we say that the dictionaries are
      nested into a kind of tree structure.

      A tree is a constrained graph. Trees are directed graphs because
      the "parent of" relationship between nodes is asymmetric: the
      edges are arrows that point in a certain direction. Trees are
      acyclic graphs, because if you follow the directed edges from
      one node to another, you can never encounter the same node
      twice. Finally, trees have the constraint that every node (except
      the root) must have exactly one parent. (From "Trees".)

triple

      In the RDF metamodel, a pair of nodes and its edge is called
      a triple, because it consists of three parts (two nodes and one
      edge). The RDF metamodel is a directed graph, so it identifies
      one node (the one from which the edge is pointing) as the
      subject of the triple, and the other node (the one to which the
      edge is pointing) as its object. The edge is referred to as the
      predicate or (as we have been saying) property of the triple.
      (From "RDF".)

      The uniqueness principle means the categories in a

      "Principles for Assigning Resources to Categories".)

unsupervised learning

      In unsupervised learning, the program gets the same items but
      has to come up with the categories on its own by discovering
      the underlying correlations between the items; that is why
      unsupervised learning is sometimes called statistical pattern
      recognition. (From: "Computational Categories"

      Validation is the process of verifying that a document or data
      structure conforms with its schema or schemas. Markup
      validation confirms the structure of the document. Type
      validation confirms that the content of leaf nodes conforms
      with the specification of data types. Content validation
      confirms that the values of the leaf nodes are appropriate. Link
      validation confirms the integrity of the links between nodes and
      between documents. Cross validation is the method commonly
      used for model selection. Business rule validation confirms
      compliance with business rules. (Discussed in "Implementing
      Categories Defined by Properties", "Design Principles and

well-formed
      The syntax and grammar of a language consists of the rules

      and other parts of speech, but they differ greatly in how they
      arrange them to create sentences. (From "Syntax and

work

      An abstract idea of an author's intellectual or artistic creation.

      The distinctions put forth by Panizzi, Lubetzky, Svenonius and
      other library science theorists have evolved today into a four-
      step abstraction hierarchy (see Figure: The FRBR Abstraction
      Hierarchy.) between the abstract work, an expression in
      multiple formats or genres, a particular manifestation in one of
      those formats or genres, and a specific physical item.

writing system

      A writing system employs one or more notations, and adds
      a set of rules for using them. Most writing systems assume
      knowledge of a particular human language. These writing
      systems are known as glottic writing systems. But there are
      many writing systems, such as mathematical and musical ones,
      that are not tied to human languages in this way. Many of the
      writing systems used for describing resources belong to this
      latter group, meaning that (at least in principle) they can be
      used with equal facility by speakers of any language. (From
      "Writing Systems".)

      Some writing systems, such as XML and JSON, are closely
      identified with specific metamodels.

XML Information Set

      The XML Infoset is a tree structure, where each node of the
      tree is defined to be an "information item" of a particular type.
      Each information item has a set of type-specific properties
      associated with it. At the root of the tree is a "document item,"
      which has exactly one "element item" as its child. An element
      item has a set of attribute items, and a list of child nodes. These
      child nodes may include other element items, or they may be
      character items. (See "Kinds of Structures" below for more on
      characters.) Attribute items may contain character items, or
      they may contain typed data, such as name tokens, identifiers
      and references. Element identifiers and references (ID/IDREF)
      may be used to connect nodes, transforming a tree into a graph.

      documents for web display or PDF for print or screen display.
      XSLT processing entails taking an input document in XML
      format and one or more XSLT style sheets through a template-
      processing engine to produce a new document.

An Appendix to The Discipline of Organizing

          An Intentional Arrangement

          Progressive intentional
       arrangements guided by
       organizing principles.

          The cover is An
       Intentional Arrangement
       by Jen Wang. The cover
       font is HTF Knockout.

The authors created textual
content using various versions
of Microsoft Word. The editors managed, organized and massaged
the content in Word files using the DropBox cloud. Those Word
documents were then sent out for transformation into DocBook
representations using scripts and hand editing. Then the DocBook
files were encoded with extensive semantic tagging and hypertext
relationships, including bibliographic and index references, and
transclusion of content from the chapters into the quizzes and
glossary. The editors used vi, oXygen XML Editor, XML Spy and
XMetaL word processors on OS X and Windows platforms.
The content of the printed book, as well as the third and fourth

1604 | Colophon
edition PDF, is presented using OpenType DejaVu fonts. The text
font is DejaVuSerif; the heading font is DejaVuSans. The
monospaced font used for code samples and literal text is
DejaVuMono. The condensed font used in the index is
DejaVuSerifCondensed; some labels use DejaVuSansCondensed. A
small number of characters require a Unicode font to represent
them; the Unicode font used for print and PDF versions of this book
is Adobe Song Standard. Emphasis is presented in bold, italic, or
oblique variants of the corresponding font families.

The PDF manifestation of the third and fourth editions of The
Discipline of Organizing were built in oXygen using customized
XSLT scripts to profile and transform the DocBook5 files into
XHTML5 files, which are then processed using CSS and the Antenna
House Formatter V6 to produce an accessible paginated Portable
Document Format document. The first printed edition of The
Discipline of Organizing was built with Altas from O'Reilly Media.
The ePub3 electronic book editions offered by O'Reilly Media are
built from the DocBook 5 sources using customized XSLT scripts
created by Bob Stayton, Sagehill Enterprises and maintained by Jirka
Kosek. The scripts take advantage of discipline and user-level values
encoded in DocBook attributes to produce profiled, static ePub 3
editions.
The Pressbooks editions were built from the DocBook 5 sources
using customized XSLT scripts created by Bob Stayton, Sagehill
Enterprises.
