            Introduction

       Welcome to Information Systems for Business and Beyond. In this
       book, you will be introduced to the concept of information systems,
       their use in business, and how information systems can be used to
       gain competitive advantage.

              Audience

       This book is written as an introductory text, meant for those with
       little or no experience with computers or information systems.
       While sometimes the descriptions can get a bit technical, every
       effort has been made to convey the information essential to
       understanding a topic while not getting overly focused in detailed
       terminology.

          Chapter Outline

       The text is organized around thirteen chapters divided into three
       major parts, as follows:

          Part 1: What Is an Information System?
                Chapter 1: What Is an Information System? - This
                   chapter provides an overview of information systems,
                   including the history of how information systems got to
                   where it is today.
                Chapter 2: Hardware - This is a discussion of information
                   systems hardware and how it works. You will look at
                   different computer parts and learn how they interact.

                Chapter 3: Software - Without software, hardware is
                   useless. This chapter covers software and the role it plays
                   in an organization.

                Chapter 4: Data and Databases - This chapter explores
                   how organizations use information systems to turn data
                   into information that can then be used for competitive
                   advantage. Special attention is paid to the role of
                   databases.

                Chapter 5: Networking and Communication - Today's
                   computers are expected to also be communication
                   devices. This chapter reviews the history of networking,
                   how the Internet works, and the use of networks in
                   organizations today.

                Chapter 6: Information Systems Security - This chapter
                   discusses the information security triad of confidentiality,
                   integrity, and availability. Different security technologies
                   are reviewed, and the chapter concludes with a primer on
                   personal information security.

          Part 2: Information Systems for Strategic Advantage

                Chapter 7: Does IT Matter? - This chapter examines the
                   impact that information systems have on an organization.
                   Can IT give a company a competitive advantage? This
                   chapter discusses the seminal works by Brynjolfsson,
                   Carr, and Porter as they relate to IT and competitive
                   advantage.

                Chapter 8: Business Processes - Business processes are
                   the essence of what a business does, and information
                   systems play an important role in making them work.
                   This chapter will discuss business process management,
                   business process reengineering, and ERP systems.

                Chapter 9: The People in Information Systems - This
                   chapter will provide an overview of the different types of
                   people involved in information systems. This includes

          For the Student

       Each chapter in this text begins with a list of the relevant learning
       objectives and ends with a chapter summary. Following the
       summary is a list of study questions that highlight key topics in
       the chapter. In order to get the best learning experience, you
       would be wise to begin by reading both the learning objectives
       and the summary and then reviewing the questions at the end of
       the chapter.

         For the Instructor

       Instructors: if you have adopted this book for your course, would
       you be so kind as to let us know in the instructor survey?

       Learning objectives can be found at the beginning of each
       chapter. Of course, all chapters are recommended for use in an
       introductory information systems course. However, for courses
       on a shorter calendar or courses using additional textbooks, a
       review of the learning objectives will help determine which
       chapters can be omitted.

       At the end of each chapter, there is a set of study questions and
       exercises (except for chapter 1, which only offers study
       questions). The study questions can be assigned to help focus
       students' reading on the learning objectives. The exercises are
       meant to be a more in-depth, experiential way for students to
       learn chapter topics. It is recommended that you review any
       exercise before assigning it, adding any detail needed (such as

Introduction

       Welcome to the world of information systems, a world that seems
       to change almost daily. Over the past few decades information
       systems have progressed to being virtually everywhere, even to the
       point where you may not realize its existence in many of your daily
       activities. Stop and consider how you interface with various
       components in information systems every day through different

       electronic devices. Smartphones, laptop, and personal computers
       connect us constantly to a variety of systems including
       messaging, banking, online retailing, and academic resources,
       just to name a few examples. Information systems are at the
       center of virtually every organization, providing users with
       almost unlimited resources.

       Have you ever considered why businesses invest in technology?
       Some purchase computer hardware and software because everyone
       else has computers. Some even invest in the same hardware and
       software as their business friends even though different technology
       might be more appropriate for them. Finally, some businesses do
       sufficient research before deciding what best fits their needs. As you
       read through this book be sure to evaluate the contents of each
       chapter based on how you might someday apply what you have
       learned to strengthen the position of the business you work for, or
       maybe even your own business. Wise decisions can result in
       stability and growth for your future enterprise.

       Information systems surround you almost every day. Wi-fi
       networks on your university campus, database search services in
       the learning resource center, and printers in computer labs are
       good examples. Every time you go shopping you are interacting
       with an information system that manages inventory and sales.
       Even driving to school or work results in an interaction with the
       transportation information system, impacting traffic lights,
       cameras, etc. Vending machines connect and communicate using
       the Internet of Things (IoT). Your car's computer system does
       more than just control the engine - acceleration, shifting, and
       braking data is always recorded. And, of course, everyone's
       smartphone is constantly connecting to available networks via
       Wi-fi, recording your location and other data.

       Can you think of some words to describe an information system?
       Words such as "computers," "networks," or "databases" might pop
       into your mind. The study of information systems encompasses a
       broad array of devices, software, and data systems. Defining an

       information system provides you with a solid start to this course
       and the content you are about to encounter.

Defining Information Systems

       Many programs in business require students to take a course in
       information systems. Various authors have attempted to define the
       term in different ways. Read the following definitions, then see if
       you can detect some variances.

          "An information system (IS) can be defined technically as a
             set of interrelated components that collect, process, store, and
             distribute information to support decision making and control
             in an organization." 1

          "Information systems are combinations of hardware,
             software, and telecommunications networks that people
             build and use to collect, create, and distribute useful data,
             typically in organizational settings." -2

          "Information systems are interrelated components working
             together to collect, process, store, and disseminate
             information to support decision making, coordination,
             control, analysis, and visualization in an organization." 3

       As you can see these definitions focus on two different ways of
       describing information systems: the components that make up an
       information system and the role those components play in an
       organization. Each of these need to be examined.

The Components of Information
Systems

       Information systems can be viewed as having five major
       components: hardware, software, data, people, and processes. The
       first three are technology. These are probably what you thought of
       when defining information systems. The last two components,
       people and processes, separate the idea of information systems from
       more technical fields, such as computer science. In order to fully
       understand information systems, you will need to understand how
       all of these components work together to bring value to an
       organization.

Technology

       Technology can be thought of as the application of scientific
       knowledge for practical purposes. From the invention of the
       wheel to the harnessing of electricity for artificial lighting,
       technology has become ubiquitous in daily life, to the degree that
       it is assumed to always be available for use regardless of
       location. As discussed before, the first three components of
       information systems - hardware, software, and data - all fall
       under the category of technology. Each of these will be addressed
       in an individual chapter. At this point a simple introduction
       should help you in your understanding.

Hardware

       Hardware is the tangible, physical portion of an information system
       - the part you can touch. Computers, keyboards, disk drives, and

       Flash drives are all examples of systems hardware. How these
       hardware components function and work together will be
       covered in Chapter 2.

Software

       Software comprises the set of instructions that tell the hardware
       what to do. Software is not tangible - it cannot be touched.
       Programmers create software by typing a series of instructions
       telling the hardware what to do. Two main categories of software
       are: Operating Systems and Application software. Operating
       Systems software provides the interface between the hardware
       and the Application software. Examples of operating systems for
       a personal computer include Microsoft Windows and Ubuntu
       Linux. The mobile phone operating system market is dominated
       by Google Android and Apple iOS. Application software allows
       the user to perform tasks such as creating documents, recording
       data in a spreadsheet, or messaging a friend. Software will be
       explored more thoroughly in Chapter 3.

Data

       The third technology component is data. You can think of data
       as a collection of facts. For example, your address (street, city
       state, postal code), your phone number, and your social

       networking account are all pieces of data. Like software, data is also
       intangible, unable to be seen in its native state. Pieces of unrelated
       data are not very useful. But aggregated, indexed, and organized
       together into a database, data can become a powerful tool for
       businesses. Organizations collect all kinds of data and use it to make
       decisions which can then be analyzed as to their effectiveness. The
       analysis of data is then used to improve the organization's
       performance. Chapter 4 will focus on data and databases, and how
       it is used in organizations.

Networking Communication

       Besides the technology components (hardware, software, and
       data) which have long been considered the core technology of
       information systems, it has been suggested that one other
       component should be added: communication. An information
       system can exist without the ability to communicate - the first
       personal computers were stand-alone machines that did not
       access the Internet. However, in today's hyper-connected world,
       it is an extremely rare computer that does not connect to another
       device or to an e-network. Technically, the networking
       communication component is made up of hardware and
       software, but it is such a core feature of today's information
       systems that it has become its own category. Networking will be
       covered in Chapter 5.

            When  thinking  about  information

systems, it is easy to focus on the technology

components and forget to look beyond these

tools to fully understand their integration into

an organization. A focus on the people

involved in information systems is the next

step. From the front-line user support staff, to

systems analysts, to developers, all the way

up to the chief information officer (CIO), the

people involved with information systems are an essential element.

The people component will be covered in Chapter 9.

Process

    The last component of information systems is process. A
process is a series of steps undertaken to achieve a desired outcome
or goal. Information systems are becoming more integrated with
organizational processes, bringing greater productivity and better
control to those processes. But simply automating activities using
technology is not enough - businesses looking to utilize information
systems must do more. The ultimate goal is to improve processes
both internally and externally, enhancing interfaces with suppliers
and customers. Technology buzzwords such as "business process
re-engineering," "business process management," and "enterprise
resource planning" all have to do with the continued improvement
of these business procedures and the integration of technology with
them. Businesses hoping to gain a competitive advantage over their
competitors are highly focused on this

component of information systems. The process element in
information systems will be discussed in Chapter 8.

The Role of Information Systems

You should now understand that information systems have a
number of vital components, some tangible, others intangible, and
still others of a personnel nature. These components collect, store,
organize, and distribute data throughout the organization. You may
have even realized that one of the roles of information systems is to
take data and turn it into information, and then transform that
information into organizational knowledge. As technology has
developed, this role has evolved into the backbone of the
organization, making information systems integral to virtually
every business. The integration of information systems into
organizations has progressed over the decades.

The Mainframe Era

From the late 1950s through the 1960s, computers were seen as

                               a way to more efficiently do

                               calculations. These first

                               business computers were room-

                               sized monsters, with several

                               machines linked together. The

                               primary work was to organize

                               and store large volumes of

government agencies could afford them, and they took a crew of

specialized personnel and dedicated facilities to provide

information to organizations.

same building or miles away. Typical functions included scientific
calculations and accounting, all under the broader umbrella of "data
processing."

In the late 1960s, Manufacturing  Resources Planning (MRP)

systems were introduced. This software, running on a mainframe

computer, gave companies the ability to manage the

manufacturing process, making it more efficient. From tracking
inventory to creating bills of materials to scheduling production,
the MRP systems gave more businesses a reason to integrate
computing into their processes. IBM became the dominant
mainframe company. Continued improvement in software and
the availability of cheaper hardware eventually brought
mainframe computers (and their little sibling, the minicomputer)
into most large businesses.

Today you probably think of Silicon Valley in northern California
as the center of computing and technology. But in the days of the
mainframe's dominance corporations in the cities of Minneapolis
and St. Paul produced most computers. The advent of the personal
computer resulted in the "center of technology" eventually moving
to Silicon Valley.

The PC Revolution

       In 1975, the first microcomputer was announced on the cover of
       Popular Mechanics: the Altair 8800. Its immediate popularity

       sparked the imagination of entrepreneurs everywhere, and there
       were soon dozens of companies manufacturing these "personal
       computers." Though at first just a niche product for computer
       hobbyists, improvements in usability and the availability of
       practical software led to growing sales. The most prominent of these
       early personal computer makers was a little company known as
       Apple Computer, headed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, with
       the hugely successful "Apple II." Not wanting to be left out of the
       revolution, in 1981 IBM teamed with Microsoft, then just a startup
       company, for their operating system software and hurriedly released
       their own version of the personal computer simply called the "PC."
       Small businesses finally had affordable computing that could
       provide them with needed information systems. Popularity of the
       IBM PC gave legitimacy to the microcomputer and it was named
       Time magazine's "Man of the Year" for 1982.

IBM PC
            Because of the IBM PC's open architecture, it was easy for other

       companies to copy, or "clone" it. During the 1980s, many new
       computer companies sprang up, offering less expensive versions of
       the PC. This drove prices down and spurred innovation. Microsoft
       developed the Windows operating system, with version 3.1 in 1992
       becoming the first commercially successful release. Typical uses
       for the PC during this period included word processing,
       spreadsheets, and databases. These early PCs were standalone
       machines, not connected to a network.

Client-Server

            In the mid-1980s, businesses began to see the need to connect
       their computers as a way to collaborate and share resources. Known
       as "client-server," this networking architecture allowed users to log
       in to the Local Area Network (LAN) from their PC (the "client") by
       connecting to a central computer called a "server." The server
       would lookup permissions for each user to determine who had
       access to various resources such as printers and files. Software
       companies began developing applications that allowed multiple
       users to access the same data at the same time. This evolved into
       software applications for communicating, with the first popular use
       of electronic mail appearing at this time.

        Registered Trademark of SAP
       This networking and data sharing all stayed mainly within the
       confines of each business. Sharing of electronic data between
       companies was a very specialized function.
       Computers were now seen as tools to collaborate internally within
       an organization. These networks of computers were becoming so
       powerful that they were replacing many of the functions previously
       performed by the larger mainframe computers at a fraction of the
       cost. It was during this era that the first Enterprise Resource
       Planning (ERP) systems were developed and run on the client-
       server architecture. An ERP system is an application with a
       centralized database that can be used to run a company's entire
       business. With separate modules for accounting, finance, inventory,
       human resources, and many more, ERP systems, with Germany's
       SAP leading the way, represented the state of the art in information
       systems integration. ERP systems will be discussed in Chapter 9.

The Internet, World Wide Web
and E-Commerce

       The first long distance transmission between two computers
       occurred on October 29, 1969 when developers under the direction
       of Dr. Leonard Kleinrock sent the word "login" from the campus of
       UCLA to Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California, a
       distance of over 350 miles. The United States Department of
       Defense created and funded ARPA Net (Advanced Research
       Projects Administration), an experimental network which
       eventually became known as the Internet. ARPA Net began with
       just four nodes or sites, a very humble start for today's Internet.

ARPA Net, 1969
       Initially, the Internet was confined to use by universities,
       government agencies, and researchers. Users were required to type
       commands (today we refer to this as "command line") in order to
       communicate and transfer files. The first e-mail messages on the
       Internet were sent in the early 1970s as a few very large companies
       expanded from local networks to the Internet. The computer was
       now evolving from a purely computational device into the world of
       digital communications. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee developed a
       simpler way for researchers to share information over the Internet,

       the catalyst for the growth of the Internet as a way for businesses to
       share information about themselves. As web browsers and Internet
       connections became the norm, companies rushed to grab domain
       names and create websites.

       In 1991 the National Science Foundation, which governed how
       the Internet was used, lifted restrictions on its commercial use.
       Corporations soon realized the huge potential of a digital
       marketplace on the Internet and in 1994 both eBay and Amazon
       were founded. A mad rush of investment in Internet-based
       businesses led to the dot-com boom through the late 1990s, and then
       the dot-com bust in 2000. The bust occurred as investors, tired of
       seeing hundreds of companies reporting losses, abandoned their
       investments. An important outcome for businesses was that
       thousands of miles of Internet connections, in the form of fiber optic
       cable, were laid around the world during that time. The world
       became truly "wired" heading into the new millennium, ushering in
       the era of globalization, which will be discussed in Chapter 11. This
       TED Talk video focuses on connecting Africa to the Internet
       through undersea fibre optic cable.
       The digital world also became a more dangerous place as virtually
       all companies connected to the Internet. Computer viruses and
       worms, once slowly propagated through the sharing of computer
       disks, could now grow with tremendous speed via the Internet.
       Software and operating systems written for a standalone world
       found it very difficult to defend against these sorts of threats. A
       whole new industry of computer and Internet security arose.
       Information security will be discussed in Chapter 6.

Web 2.0

       As the world recovered from the dot-com bust, the use of
       technology in business continued to evolve at a frantic pace.
       Websites became interactive. Instead of just visiting a site to find
       out about a business and then purchase its products, customers
       wanted to be able to customize their experience and interact online
       with the business. This new type of interactive website, where you
       did not have to know how to create a web page or do any
       programming in order to put information online, became known as
       Web 2.0. This new stage of the Web was exemplified by blogging,
       social networking, and interactive comments being available on
       many websites. The new Web 2.0 world, in which online interaction
       became expected, had a major impact on many businesses and even
       whole industries. Many bookstores found themselves relegated to a
       niche status. Video rental chains and travel agencies simply began
       going out of business as they were replaced by online technologies.
       The newspaper industry saw a huge drop in circulation with some
       cities such as New Orleans no longer able to support a daily
       newspaper.
       Disintermediation is the process of technology replacing a
       middleman in a transaction. Web 2.0 allowed users to get
       information and news online, reducing dependence of physical
       books and newspapers.
       As the world became more connected, new questions arose. Should
       access to the Internet be considered a right? Is it legal to copy a
       song that had been downloaded from the Internet? Can information
       entered into a website be kept private? What information is
       acceptable to collect from children? Technology moved so fast that
       policymakers did not have enough time to enact appropriate laws.
       Ethical issues surrounding information systems will be covered in
       Chapter 12.

The Post-PC World, Sort of

            Ray Ozzie, a technology visionary at Microsoft, stated in
       2012 that computing was moving into a phase he called the post-
       PC wo-rld.5 Now six years later that prediction has not stood up
       very well to reality. As you will read in Chapter 13, PC sales
       have dropped slightly in recent years while there has been a
       precipitous decline in tablet sales. Smartphone sales have
       accelerated, due largely to their mobility and ease of operation.
       Just as the mainframe before it, the PC will continue to play a
       key role in business, but its role will be somewhat diminished as
       people emphasize mobility as a central feature of technology.
       Cloud computing provides users with mobile access to data and
       applications, making the PC more of a part of the
       communications channel rather than a repository of programs
       and information. Innovation in the development of technology
       and communications will continue to move businesses forward.

Can Information Systems Bring
Competitive Advantage?

         It has always been the assumption that the implementation of
       information systems will bring a business competitive
       advantage. If installing one computer to manage inventory can
       make a company more efficient, then it can be expected that

       installing several computers can improve business processes and
       efficiency. In 2003, Nicholas Carr wrote an article in the Harvard
       Business Review that questioned this assumption. Entitled "I.T.
       Doesn't Matter." Carr was concerned that information technology
       had become just a commodity. Instead of viewing technology as an
       investment that will make a company stand out, Carr said
       technology would become as common as electricity - something to
       be managed to reduce costs, ensure that it is always running, and be
       as risk-free as possible.
       The article was both hailed and scorned. Can I.T. bring a
       competitive advantage to an organization? It sure did for Walmart
       (see sidebar). Technology and competitive advantage will be
       discussed in Chapter 7.

      Sidebar: Walmart Uses
 Information Systems to Become
  the World's Leading Retailer

              ~:~

        Registered Trademark of Walmart, Inc.
            Walmart is the world's largest retailer, earning 8.1 billion for the

       fiscal year that ended on January 31, 2018. Walmart currently
       serves over 260 million customers every week worldwide through
       its 11,700 stores in 28 countries.6In 2018 Fortune magazine for the
       sixth straight year ranked Walmart the number one company for
       annual revenue as they again exceeded $500 billion in annual
       sales. The next closest company, Exxon, had less than half of
       Walmart's total revenue.7 Walmart's rise to prominence is due
       in large part to making information systems a high priority,
       especially in their Supply Chain Management (SCM) system

       known as Retail Linking $14.3 billion on sales of $30.
       This system, unique when initially implemented in the mid-1980s,
       allowed Walmart's suppliers to directly access the inventory levels
       and sales information of their products at any of Walmart's more
       than eleven thousand stores. Using Retail Link, suppliers can
       analyze how well their products are selling at one or more Walmart
       stores with a range of reporting options. Further, Walmart requires
       the suppliers to use Retail Link to manage their own inventory
       levels. If a supplier feels that their products are selling out too
       quickly, they can use Retail Link to petition Walmart to raise the
       inventory levels for their products. This has essentially allowed
       Walmart to "hire" thousands of product managers, all of whom have
       a vested interest in the products they are managing. This
       revolutionary approach to managing inventory has allowed
       Walmart to continue to drive prices down and respond to market
       forces quickly.
       Today Walmart continues to innovate with information technology.
       Using its tremendous market presence, any technology that
       Walmart requires its suppliers to implement immediately becomes
       a business standard. For example, in 1983 Walmart became the first
       large retailer to require suppliers to the use Uniform Product Code
       (UPC) labels on all products. Clearly, Walmart has learned how to
       use I.T. to gain a competitive advantage.

              Summary

       In this chapter you have been introduced to the concept of
       information systems. Several definitions focused on the main
       components: technology, people, and process. You how the
       business use of information systems has evolved over the years,
       from the use of large mainframe computers for number crunching,

       through the introduction of the PC and networks, all the way to the
       era of mobile computing. During each of these phases, new
       innovations in software and technology allowed businesses to
       integrate technology more deeply into their organizations.
       Virtually every company uses information systems which leads to
       the question: Does information systems bring a competitive
       advantage? In the final analysis the goal of this book is to help you
       understand the importance of information systems in making an
       organization more competitive. Your challenge is to understand the
       key components of an information system and how it can be used
       to bring a competitive advantage to every organization you will
       serve in your career.

       Chapter 2: Hardware

              Upon successful completion of this chapter, you
              will be able to:
               Describe information systems hardware;
               Identify the primary components of a

                    computer and the functions they perform;
                    and
               Explain the effect of the commoditization of
                    the personal computer.

            Introduction

       As you learned in the first chapter, an information system is
       made up of five components: hardware, software, data, people,
       and process. The physical parts of computing devices - those that
       you can actually touch - are referred to as hardware. In this
       chapter, you will take a look at this component of information
       systems, learn a little bit about how it works, and discuss some
       of the current trends surrounding it.
       As stated above, computer hardware encompasses digital devices
       that you can physically touch. This includes devices such as the
       following:

          desktop computers
          laptop computers
          mobile phones
          tablet computers
          e-readers

          storage devices, such as flash drives
          input devices, such as keyboards, mice, and scanners
          output devices such as printers and speakers.

       Besides these more traditional computer hardware devices, many
       items that were once not considered digital devices are now
       becoming computerized themselves. Digital technologies are
       being integrated into many everyday objects so the days of a
       device being labeled categorically as computer hardware may be
       ending. Examples of these types of digital devices include
       automobiles, refrigerators, and even beverage dispensers. In this
       chapter, you will also explore digital devices, beginning with
       defining what is meant by the term itself.

          Digital Devices

            A digital device processes electronic signals into discrete values,
       of which there can be two or more. In comparison analog signals
       are continuous and can be represented by a smooth wave pattern.
       You might think of digital (discrete) as being the opposite of analog.
       Many electronic devices process signals into two discrete values,
       typically known as binary. These values are represented as either
       a one ("on") or a zero ("off"). It is commonly accepted to refer to
       the on state as representing the presence of an electronic signal. It
       then follows that the off state is represented by the absence of an
       electronic signal. Note: Technically, the voltages in a system are
       evaluated with high voltages converted into a one or on state and
       low voltages converted into a zero or off state.

       Each one or zero is referred to as a bit (a blending of the two words
       "binary" and "digit"). A group of eight bits is known as a byte. The
       first personal computers could process 8 bits of data at once. The
       number of bits that can be processed by a computer's processor at
       one time is known as word size. Today's PCs can process 64 bits of
       data at a time which is where the term 64-bit processor comes from.

You are most likely using a computer with a 64-bit processor.

Sidebar: Understanding Binary

   The numbering system you first learned was Base 10 also known as
   Decimal. In Base 10 each column in the number represents a power
   of 10 with the exponent increasing in each column as you move to
   the left, as shown in the table:

 Thousands Hundreds Tens Units
       103 102 101 100

The rightmost column represents units or the values zero through
nine. The next column from the left represents tens or the values
teens, twenties, thirties, etc., followed by the hundred's column
(one hundred, two hundred, etc.), then the thousands column
(one thousand, two thousand) etc. Expanding the table above,
you can write the number 3456 as follows:

Thousands Hundreds Tens Units

103        102      101 100

3          4        5    6

3000       400      50 6

Computers use the Base 2 numbering system. Similar to Base 10,
each column has a Base of 2 and has an increasing exponent
value moving to the left as shown in the table below:

Two cubed    Two    Two  Units
     23    squared   21   20

The rightmost column represents 20 or units (1). The next column
from the left represents 21 twos or (2). The third column represents
22 or (4) and the fourth column represents 23 or (8). Expanding the
table above, you can see how the decimal number 15 is converted
to 1111 in binary as follows:

Two cubed    Two    Two Units
           squared
     23             21  20
       1      22
       8            1   1
               1
                    2   1
               4

8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15

Understanding binary is important because it helps us understand
how computers store and transmit data. A "bit" is the lowest level
of data storage, stored as either a one or a zero. If a computer wants
to communicate the number 15, it would need to send 1111 in
binary (as shown above). This is four bits of data since four digits
are needed. A "byte" is 8 bits. If a computer wanted to transmit the
number 15 in a byte, it would send 00001111. The highest number
that can be sent in a byte is 255, which is 11111111, which is equal
to 27 + 26 + 25 + 24 + 23 + 22 + 21 + 20.

       As the capacities of digital devices grew, new terms were developed
       to identify the capacities of processors, memory, and disk storage
       space. Prefixes were applied to the word byte to represent different
       orders of magnitude. Since these are digital specifications, the
       prefixes were originally meant to represent multiples of 1024
       (which is 210), but have more recently been rounded for the sake of
       simplicity to mean multiples of 1000, as shown in the table below:

         Tour of a PC

    All personal computers consist of the same basic
components: A Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, circuit
board, storage, and input/output devices. Almost every digital
device uses the same set of components, so examining the
personal computer will give you insight into the structure of a
variety of digital devices. Here's a "tour" of a personal computer.

Processing Data: The CPU

            The core of a computer is the Central Processing Unit, or CPU.
       It can be thought of as the "brains" of the device. The CPU carries
       out the commands sent to it by the software and returns results to
       be acted upon.

                                                    Intel Core i7 CPU
                                              The earliest CPUs were large circuit
                                              boards with limited functionality.
                                              Today, a CPU can perform a large
                                              variety of functions. There are two
                                              primary manufacturers of CPUs for
                                              personal computers: Intel and
       Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).
       The speed ("clock time") of a CPU is measured in hertz. A hertz is
       defined as one cycle per second. A kilohertz (abbreviated kHz) is
       one thousand cycles per second, a megahertz (mHz) is one million
       cycles per second, and a gigahertz (gHz) is one billion cycles per
       second. The CPU's processing power is increasing at an amazing
       rate (see the sidebar about Moore's Law).
       Besides a faster clock time, today's CPU chips contain multiple
       processors. These chips, known as dual-core (two processors) or
       quad-core (four processors), increase the processing power of a
       computer by providing the capability of multiple CPUs all sharing
       the processing load. Intel's Core i7 processors contain 6 cores and
       their Core i9 processors contain 16 cores. This video shows how a
       CPU works.

    Sidebar: Moore's Law and
           Huang's Law

            As you know computers get faster every year. Many times,
       we are not sure if we want to buy today's model because next
       week it won't be the most advanced any more. Gordon Moore,
       one of the founders of Intel, recognized this phenomenon in
       1965, noting that microprocessor transistor counts had been

doubling every year.1 His insight eventually evolved into Moore's
Law:

     The number of integrated circuits on a chip doubles every two years.

Moore's Law has been generalized into the concept that
computing power will double every two years for the same price
point. Another way of looking at this is to think that the price for
the same computing power will be cut in half every two years.
Moore's Law has held true for over forty years (see figure below).

The limits of Moore's Law are now being reached and circuits
cannot be reduced further. However, Huang's Law regarding
Graphics Processors Units (GPUs) may extend well into the
future. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang spoke at the GPU
Technology Conference in March 2018 announcing that the speed
of GPUs is increasing faster than Moore's Law. Nvidia's GPUs are
25 times faster than five years ago. He admitted that the
advancement is because of advances in architecture, memory
technology, algorithms, and interconnects.2

Motherboard

                    The motherboard is the main

                    circuit board on the computer. The

                    CPU, memory, and storage

                    components, among other things,

                    all connect into the motherboard.

                    Motherboards come in different

                    shapes and sizes, depending upon

Motherboard how compact or

expandable the computer is

designed to be. Most modern

motherboards  have  many Motherboard bus traces

sound processing,  which  previously  required                 separate
components.

 The motherboard provides much of the bus of the computer (the
term bus refers to the electrical connections between different
computer components). The bus is an important factor in
determining the computer's speed - the combination of how fast
the bus can transfer data and the number of data bits that can be
moved at one time determine the speed. The traces shown in the
image are on the underside of the motherboard and provide
connections between motherboard components.

Random-Access Memory

       When a computer boots, it begins to load information on from
       storage into its working memory. This working memory, called
       Random- Access Memory (RAM), can transfer data much faster
       than the hard disk. Any program that you are running on the
       computer is loaded into RAM for processing. In order for a
       computer to work effectively, some minimal amount of RAM must
       be installed. In most cases, adding more RAM will allow the
       computer to run faster. Another characteristic of RAM is that it is
       "volatile." This means that it can store data as long as it is receiving
       power. When the computer is turned off, any data stored in RAM is
       lost.

RAM is generally installed in a personal computer through the use

                          of a Double Data Rate (DDR)

                          memory module. The type of

                          DDR accepted into a computer

DDR4 Memory        is dependent upon the motherboard.

There have been basically four generations of DDR: DDR1, DDR2,

DDR3, and DDR4. Each generation runs faster than the previous with

DDR4 capable of speeds twice as fast as DDR3 while consuming

less voltage.

Hard Disk

            While the RAM is used as working memory, the computer also

       needs a place to store data for the longer term. Most of today's personal
       computers use a hard disk for long-term data storage. A hard disk is
       considered non-volatile storage because when the computer is turned
       off the data remains in storage on the disk, ready for when the computer
       is turned on.

                                                         Drives with a capacity less than

                                                         one platter. Notice the single
                                                         platter in the image. The
                                                         read/write arm must be
                                                         positioned over the appropriate
                                                         track before accessing or
                                                         writing data.

Solid State Drives

       Solid State Drives (SSD) are becoming more popular in personal
       computers. The SSD performs the same function as a hard disk,
       namely long-term storage. Instead of spinning disks, the SSD uses
       flash memory that incorporates EEPROM (Electrically Erasable
       Programmable Read Only Memory) chips, which is much faster.

                                            Solid-state drives are currently a bit
                                           more expensive than hard disks.
                                           However, the use of flash memory
                                           instead of disks makes them much
                                           lighter and faster than hard disks. SSDs
       are primarily utilized in portable computers, making them
       lighter, more durable, and more efficient
       Some computers combine the two storage technologies, using the
       SSD for the most accessed data (such as the operating system) while
       using the hard disk for data that is accessed less frequently. SSDs
       are considered more reliable since there are no moving parts.

Removable Media

        USB Drive
            Removable storage has changed greatly over the four decades of

       PCs. Floppy disks have been replaced by CD-ROM drives, then
       they were replaced by USB (Universal Serial Bus) drives. USB
       drives are now standard on all PCs with capacities approaching 512
       gigabytes. Speeds have also increased from 480 Megabits in USB 2.0
       to 10 Gigabits in USB 3.1. USB devices also use EEPROM
       technology.3

Network Connection

       When personal computers were first stand-alone units when first
       developed, which meant that data was brought into the computer
       or removed from the computer via removable media. Beginning
       in the mid-1980s, however, organizations began to see the value
       in connecting computers together via a digital network. Because
       of this, personal computers needed the ability to connect to these
       networks. Initially, this was done by adding an expansion card to
       the computer that enabled the network connection. These cards
       were known as Network Interface Cards (NIC). By the mid-
       1990s an Ethernet network port was built into the motherboard
       on most personal computers. As wireless technologies began to
       dominate in the early 2000s, many personal computers also began
       including wireless networking capabilities. Digital communication
       technologies will be discussed further in Chapter 5.

Input and Output

            In order for a personal computer to be useful, it must have
       channels for receiving input from the user and channels for
       delivering output to the user. These input and output devices
       connect to the computer via various connection ports, which

                                                           generally, are part of the
                                                          motherboard and are
                                                          accessible outside the
                                                          computer case. In early
                                                          personal computers, specific
                                                          ports were designed for each
                                                          type of output device. The
                                                          configuration of these ports
       has evolved over the years, becoming more and more
       standardized over time. Today, almost all devices plug into a
       computer through the use of a USB port. This port type, first
       introduced in 1996, has increased in its capabilities, both in its
       data transfer rate and power supplied.

Bluetooth

            Besides USB, some input and output devices connect to the
       computer via a wireless-technology standard called Bluetooth
       which was invented in 1994. Bluetooth exchanges data over
       short distances of 10 meters up to 100 meters using radio waves.
       Two devices communicating with Bluetooth must both have a
       Bluetooth communication chip installed. Bluetooth devices
       include pairing your phone to your car, computer keyboards,
       speakers, headsets, and home security, to name just a few.

Input Devices

            All personal computers need components that allow the user

       to input data. Early computers simply used a keyboard for
       entering data or select an item from a menu to run a program.
       With the advent operating systems offering the graphical user
       interface, the mouse became a standard component of a
       computer. These two components are still the primary input
       devices to a personal computer, though variations of each have
       been introduced with varying levels of success over the years.
       For example, many new devices now use a touch screen as the
       primary way of data entry.
       Other input devices include scanners which allow users to input
       documents into a computer either as images or as text. Microphones
       can be used to record audio or give voice commands. Webcams and
       other types of video cameras can be used to record video or
       participate in a video chat session.

Output Devices

            Output devices are essential as well. The most obvious output
       device is a display or monitor, visually representing the state of
       the computer. In some cases, a personal computer can support
       multiple displays or be connected to larger-format displays such
       as a projector or large-screen television. Other output devices
       include speakers for audio output and printers for hardcopy
       output.

 Components Contribute to the

    Speed of Your Computer

            The speed of a computer is determined by many elements, some

       related to hardware and some related to software. In hardware,
       speed is improved by giving the electrons shorter distances to travel
       in completing a circuit. Since the first CPU was created in the early
       1970s, engineers have constantly worked to figure out how to shrink
       these circuits and put more and more circuits onto the same chip -
       these are known as integrated circuits. And this work has paid off
       - the speed of computing devices has been continuously improving.
       Multi-core processors, or CPUs, have contributed to faster
       speeds. Intel engineers have also improved CPU speeds by using
       QuickPath Interconnect, a technique which minimizes the
       processor's need to communicate directly with RAM or the hard
       drive. Instead, the CPU contains a cache of frequently used data
       for a particular program. An algorithm evaluates a program's data
       usage and determines which data should be temporarily stored in
       the cache.
       The hardware components that contribute to the speed of a
       personal computer are the CPU, the motherboard, RAM, and the
       hard disk. In most cases, these items can be replaced with newer,
       faster components. The table below shows how each of these
       contributes to the speed of a computer. Besides upgrading
       hardware, there are many changes that can be made to the

    Other Computing Devices

            A personal computer is designed to be a general-purpose device,
       able to solve many different types of problems. As the technologies
       of the personal computer have become more commonplace, many
       of the components have been integrated into other devices that
       previously were purely mechanical. The definition or description
       of what defines a computer has changed. Portability has been an
       important feature for most users. Here is an overview of some trends
       in personal computing.

Portable Computers

                                                         Portable computing today
                                                    includes laptops, notebooks and
                                                    netbooks, many weighing less
                                                    than 4 pounds and providing
                                                    longer battery life. The MacBook
                                                    Air is a good example of this: it
                                                    weighs less than three pounds
       MacBook Air
                         and is only 0.68 inches thick! Netbooks (short for
       Network Books) are extremely light because they do not have a hard
       drive, depending instead on the Internet "cloud" for data and
       application storage. Netbooks depend on a Wi-Fi connection and
       can run Web browsers as well as a word processor.

Smartphones

            While cell phones were introduced in the 1970s, smartphones
       have only been around for the past 20 years. As cell phones evolved,
       they gained a broader array of features and programs. Today's
       smartphones provide the user with telephone, email, location, and
       calendar services, to name a few. They function as a highly mobile
       computer, able to connect to the Internet through either cell
       technology or Wi-Fi. Smartphones have revolutionized computing,
       bringing the one feature PCs and laptops could not deliver, namely
       mobility. Consider the following data regarding mobile computing
       4:

          There are 3.7 billion global mobile Internet users as at January
             2018.

          Mobile devices influenced sales to the tune of over $1.4

          Mobile commerce revenue in the U.S. is projected to be

             $459.38 billion in 2018, and it is estimated to be $693.36
             billion by 2019.
          By the end of 2018, over $1 trillion -- or 75 percent -- of
             ecommerce sales in China will be done via mobile devices.
          The average order value for online orders placed on
             Smartphones in the first quarter of 2018 is $84.55 while the
             average order value for orders placed on Tablets is $94.91.
          Of the 2.79 billion active social media users in the world, 2.55
             billion actively use their mobile devices for social media-
             related activities.
          90 percent of the time spent on mobile devices is spent in
             apps.
          Mobile traffic is responsible for 52.2 percent of Internet traffic
             in 2018 -- compared to 50.3 percent from 2017.
          While the total percentage of mobile traffic is more than
             desktop, engagement is higher on desktop. 55.9 percent of
             time spent on sites is by desktop users and 40.1 percent of
             time spent on sites is by mobile users.
          By 2020, mobile commerce will account for 45 percent of all
             e- commerce activities -- compared to 20.6 percent in 2016.

       The Apple iPhone was introduced in January 2007 and went on the
       market in June of that same year. Its ease of use and intuitive
       interface made it an immediate success and solidified the future of
       smartphones. The first Android phone was released in 2008 with
       functionality similar to the iPhone.

Tablet Computers

iPad Air
             A tablet computer uses a touch screen as

       its primary input and is small enough and
       light enough to be easily transported. They
       generally have no keyboard and are self-
       contained inside a rectangular case. Apple set
       the standard for tablet computing with the introduction of the iPad
       in 2010 using iOS, the operating system of the iPhone. After the
       success of the iPad, computer manufacturers began to develop new
       tablets that utilized operating systems that were designed for mobile
       devices, such as Android.
       Global market share for tablets has changed since the early days of
       Apple's dominance. Today the iPad has about 25% of the global
       market while Amazon Fire has 15% and Samsung Galaxy has 14%.
       5 However, the popularity of tablets has declined sharply in recent
       years.

Integrated Computing and
Internet of Things (IoT)

       Along with advances in computers themselves, computing
       technology is being integrated into many everyday products.
       From automobiles to refrigerators to airplanes, computing
       technology is enhancing what these devices can do and is adding
       capabilities into our everyday lives thanks in part to IoT.

       The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of billions of devices, each
       with their own unique network address, around the world with
       embedded electronics allowing them to connect to the Internet
       for the purpose of collecting and sharing data, all without the
       involvement of human beings.6
       Objects ranging from a simple light bulb to a fitness band such as
       FitBit to a driverless truck are all part of IoT thanks to the
       processors inside them. A smartphone app can control and/or
       communicate with each of these devices as well as others such as
       electric garage door openers (for those who can't recall if the door
       has been closed), kitchen appliances ("Buy milk after work
       today."), thermostats such as Nest, home security, audio speakers,
       and the feeding of pets.
       Here are three of the latest ways that computing technologies are
       being integrated into everyday products through IoT:

The Commoditization of the
Personal Computer

            Over the past forty years, as the personal computer has gone
       from technical marvel to part of everyday life, it has also become a
       commodity. There is very little differentiation between computer
       models and manufacturers, and the primary factor that controls their
       sale is their price. Hundreds of manufacturers all over the world
       now create parts for personal computers which are purchased and
       assembled. As commodities, there are essentially little or no
       differences between computers made by these different companies.
       Profit margins for personal computers are minimal, leading
       hardware developers to find the lowest-cost manufacturing
       methods.
       There is one brand of computer for which this is not the case -
       Apple. Because Apple does not make computers that run on the
       same open standards as other manufacturers, they can design and
       manufacture a unique product that no one can easily copy. By
       creating what many consider to be a superior product, Apple can
       charge more for their computers than other manufacturers. Just as
       with the iPad and iPhone, Apple has chosen a strategy of
       differentiation, an attempt to avoid commoditization.

Summary

            Information systems hardware consists of the components of
       digital technology that you can touch. This chapter covered the
       components that make up a personal computer, with the
       understanding that the configuration of a personal computer is
       very similar to that of any type of digital computing device. A
       personal computer is made up of many components, most
       importantly the CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard disk, removable
       media, and input/ output devices. Variations on the personal
       computer, such as the smartphone, were also examined. Finally,
       commoditization of the personal computer was addressed.

            Introduction

       The second component of an information system is software, the set
       of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. Software is
       created by developers through the process of programming
       (covered in more detail in Chapter 10). Without software, the
       hardware would not be functional.

         Types of Software

       Software can be broadly divided into two categories: operating
       systems and application software. Operating systems manage the
       hardware and create the interface between the hardware and the
       user. Application software performs specific tasks such as word
       processing, accounting, database management, video games, or
       browsing the web.

Operating Systems

       An operating system is first loaded into the computer by the boot
       program, then it manages all of the programs in the computer,
       including both programs native to the operating system such as
       file and memory management and application software.
       Operating systems provide you with these key functions:

        1. managing the hardware resources of the computer;
        2. providing the user-interface components;

3. providing a platform for software developers to write
    applications.

All computing devices require an operating system. The most
popular operating systems for personal computers are: Microsoft
Windows, Apple's Mac OS, and various versions of Linux.
Smartphones and tablets run operating systems as well, such as
iOS (Apple), Android (Google), Windows Mobile (Microsoft), and
Blackberry.

Microsoft provided the first operating system for the IBM-PC,
released in 1981. Their initial venture into a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) operating system, known as Windows, occurred in
1985. Today's Windows 10 supports the 64-bit Intel CPU. Recall
that "64-bit" indicates the size of data that can be moved within the
computer.

Apple introduced the Macintosh computer 1984 with the first

commercially successful GUI. Apple's operating system for the

Macintosh is known as "Mac OS" and also uses an Intel CPU

supporting 64-bit processing. Mac OS versions have been named after

mountains such as El Capitan, Sierra, and High Sierra. Multitasking,

virtual memory, and voice input have become standard features of both

operating systems.

The Linux operating system is open source, meaning individual

developers are allowed to make modifications to the programming

code. Linux is a version of the Unix operating. Unix runs on large

and                 expensive

minicomputers.      Linux

develop Linus Torvalds, a

professor in Finland and the

creator of Linux, wanted to

find a way to make Unix run

on less expensive personal

computers. Linux has many Linux Ubuntu desktop

variations and now powers a

large percentage of web servers in the world.

    Sidebar: Why Is Microsoft
  Software So Dominant in the

         Business World?

       If you've worked in business, you may have noticed that almost all
       computers in business run a version of Microsoft Windows.
       However, in classrooms from elementary to college, there is almost
       a balance between Macs and PCs. Why has this not extended into
       the business world?
       As discussed in Chapter 1, many businesses used IBM mainframe
       computers back in the 1960s and 1970s. When businesses migrated to
       the microcomputer (personal computer) market, they elected to stay
       with IBM and chose the PC. Companies took the safe route, invested
       in the Microsoft operating system and in Microsoft
       software/applications.
       Microsoft soon found itself with the dominant personal computer
       operating system for businesses. As the networked PC began to
       replace the mainframe computer, Microsoft developed a network
       operating system along with a complete suite of programs focused
       on business users. Today Microsoft Office in its various forms
       controls 85% of the market. 1

Application Software

       The second major category of software is application software.

The "Killer" App

generally a small group of technology enthusiasts who will

purchase it just for the joy of figuring out how it works. A "killer"

device just to run that application. For the personal computer, the
killer application was the spreadsheet.

The first spreadsheet was created by an MBA student at Harvard
University who tired of making repeated calculations to determine
the optimal result on a problem and decided to create a tool that
allowed the user to easily change values and recalculate formulas.
The result was the spreadsheet. Today's dominant spreadsheet is
Microsoft Excel which still retains the basic functionality of the first
spreadsheet.

Productivity Software

            Along with the spreadsheet, several other software applications
       have become standard tools for the workplace. Known as
       productivity software, these programs allow office employees to

       complete their daily work efficiently. Many times, these
       applications come packaged together, such as in Microsoft's Office
       suite. Here is a list of some of these applications and their basic
       functions:

          Word processing Users can create and edit documents
             using this class of software. Functions include the ability to
             type and edit text, format fonts and paragraphs, as well as
             add, move, and delete text throughout the document. Tables
             and images can be inserted. Documents can be saved in a
             variety of electronic file formats with Microsoft Word's
             DOCX being the most popular. Documents can also be
             converted to other formats such as Adobe's PDF (Portable
             Document Format) or a .TXT file.

          Spreadsheet This class of software provides a way to do
             numeric calculations and analysis, displaying the result in
             charts and graphs. The working area is divided into rows and
             columns, where users can enter numbers, text, or formulas. It
             is the formulas that make a spreadsheet powerful, allowing the
             user to develop complex calculations that can change based
             on the numbers entered. The most popular spreadsheet
             package is Microsoft Excel, which saves its files in the
             XLSX format.

          Presentation Users can create slideshow presentations using
             this class of software. The slides can be projected, printed, or
             distributed to interested parties. Text, images, audio, and
             visual can all be added to the slides. Microsoft's PowerPoint
             is the most popular software right now, saving its files in
             PPTX format.

          Some office suites include other types of software. For
             example, Microsoft Office includes Outlook, its e-mail
             package, and OneNote, an information-gathering
             collaboration tool. The professional version of Office also
             includes Microsoft Access, a database package. (Databases
             are covered more in Chapter 4).

Microsoft popularized the idea of the office-software
productivity bundle with their release of the Microsoft Office
Suite. This package continues to dominate the market and most
businesses expect employees to know how to use this software.
However, many competitors to Microsoft Office do exist and are
compatible with the file formats used by Microsoft (see table
below). Microsoft also offers a cloud-based version of their
office suite named Microsoft Office 365. Similar to Google

Utility Software and Programming Software

       Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or
       modify your computer in some way. Examples include anti-
       malware software and programs that totally remove software you
       no longer want installed. These types of software packages were
       created to fill shortcomings in operating systems. Many times, a
       subsequent release of an operating system will include these
       utility functions as part of the operating system itself.
       Programming software's purpose is to produce software. Most of
       these programs provide developers with an environment in

  Sidebar: I Own This Software,
           Right? Well...

            When you purchase software and install it on your computer,
       are you the owner of that software? Technically, you are not!
       When you install software, you are actually just being given a
       license to use it. When you first install a package, you are asked
       to agree to the terms of service or the license agreement. In that
       agreement, you will find that your rights to use the software are
       limited. For example, in the terms of the Microsoft Office
       software license, you will find the following statement: "This
       software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you
       some rights to use the features included in the software edition
       you licensed."
       For the most part, these restrictions are what you would expect. You
       cannot make illegal copies of the software and you may not use it
       to do anything illegal. However, there are other, more unexpected
       terms in these software agreements. For example, many software
       agreements ask you to agree to a limit on liability. Again, from
       Microsoft: "Limitation on and exclusion of damages. You can
       recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to
       the amount you paid for the software. You cannot recover any other
       damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or
       incidental damages." This means if a problem with the software
       causes harm to your business, you cannot hold Microsoft or the
       supplier responsible for damages.

       As the personal computer proliferated inside organizations, control
       over the information generated by the organization began
       splintering. For instance, the customer service department creates
       a customer database to keep track of calls and problem reports, and
       the sales department also creates a database to keep track of
       customer information. Which one should be used as the master list
       of customers? Or perhaps someone in sales might create a
       spreadsheet to calculate sales revenue, while someone in finance
       creates a different revenue document that meets the needs of their
       department, but calculates revenue differently. The two
       spreadsheets will report different revenue totals. Which one is
       correct? And who is managing all of this information?

Enterprise Resource Planning

       SAP Trademark Logo

       In the 1990s the need to bring an organization's information
       back under centralized control became more apparent. The
       Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system (sometimes just called
       enterprise software) was developed to bring together an entire
       organization within one program. ERP software utilizes a central
       database that is implemented throughout the entire organization.
       Here are some key points about ERP.

          A software application. ERP is an application that is used by
             many of an organization's employees.

          Utilizes a central database. All users of the ERP edit and

             database, etc.
          Implemented organization-wide. ERP systems include
             functionality that covers all of the essential components of a
             business. An organization can purchase modules for its ERP
             system that match specific needs such as order entry,
             manufacturing, or planning.

       ERP systems were originally marketed to large corporations.
       However, as more and more large companies began installing
       them, ERP vendors began targeting mid-sized and even smaller
       businesses. Some of the more well-known ERP systems include
       those from SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft.
       In order to effectively implement an ERP system in an organization,
       the organization must be ready to make a full commitment. All
       aspects of the organization are affected as old systems are replaced
       by the ERP system. In general, implementing an ERP system can
       take two to three years and cost several million dollars.
       So why implement an ERP system? If done properly, an ERP
       system can bring an organization a good return on their investment.
       By consolidating information systems across the enterprise and
       using the software to enforce best practices, most organizations see
       an overall improvement after implementing an ERP. Business
       processes as a form of competitive advantage will be covered in
       Chapter 9.

Customer Relationship Management

       A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system manages an
       organization's customers. In today's environment, it is important
       to develop relationships with your customers, and the use of a well-
       designed CRM can allow a business to personalize its relationship with
       each of its customers. Some ERP software systems include CRM
       modules. An example of a well-known CRM package is Salesforce.

            Suppliers

          Supply Chain

          Many organizations must deal with the complex task of managing
       their supply chains. At its simplest, a supply chain is the linkage
       between an organization's suppliers, its manufacturing facilities,
       and the distributors of its products. Each link in the chain has a
       multiplying effect on the complexity of the process. For example, if
       there are two suppliers, one manufacturing facility, and two
       distributors, then the number of links to manage = 4 (2 x 1 x 2).
       However, if two more suppliers are added, plus another
       manufacturing facility, and two more distributors, then the number
       of links to manage = 32 (4 x 2 x 4). Also, notice in the above
       illustration that all arrows have two heads, indicating that
       information flows in both directions. Suppliers are part of a
       business's supply chain. They provide information such as price,
       size, quantity, etc. to the business. In turn, the business provides
       information such as quantity on hand at every store to the supplier.
       The key to successful supply chain management is the information
       system.
       A Supply Chain Management (SCM) system handles the
       interconnection between these links as well as the inventory of the
       products in their various stages of development. As discussed
       previously much of Walmart's success has come from its ability to
       identify and control the supply chain for its products. Walmart invested
       heavily in their information system so they could communicate with
       their suppliers and manage the thousands of products they sell.

       Walmart realized in the 1980s that the key to their success was
       information systems. Specifically, they needed to manage their
       complex supply chain with its thousands of suppliers, thousands
       of retail outlets, and millions of customers. Their success came
       from being able to integrate information systems to every entity
       (suppliers, warehouses, retail stores) through the sharing of sales
       and inventory data. Take a moment to study the diagram
       above...look for the double-headed arrow. Notice that data flows
       down the supply chain from suppliers to retail stores. But it also
       flows up the supply chain, back to the suppliers so they can be
       up to date regarding production and shipping.

       Mobile Applications

            Just as with the personal computer, mobile devices such as
       smartphones and electronic tablets also have operating systems and
       application software. These mobile devices are in many ways just
       smaller versions of personal computers. A mobile app is a software
       application designed to run specifically on a mobile device.
       As shown in Chapter 2, smartphones are becoming a dominant form
       of computing, with more smartphones being sold than personal
       computers. A greater discussion of PC and smartphone sales
       appears in Chapter 13, along with statistics regarding the decline in
       tablet sales. Businesses have adjusted to this trend by increasing
       their investment in the development of apps for mobile devices. The
       number of mobile apps in the Apple App Store has increased from
       zero in 2008 to over 2 million in 2017.-3 Building a mobile app will
       be covered in Chapter 10.

         Cloud Computing

            Historically, for software to run on a computer an individual
       copy of the software had to be installed on the computer. The
       concept of "cloud" computing changes this.

       Cloud Computing
       The "cloud" refers to applications, services, and data storage
       located on the Internet. Cloud service providers rely on giant server
       farms and massive storage devices that are connected via the
       Internet. Cloud computing allows users to access software and data
       storage services on the Internet.
       You probably already use cloud computing in some form. For
       example, if you access your e-mail via your web browser, you are
       using a form of cloud computing if you are using Google Drive's
       applications. While these are free versions of cloud computing,
       there is big business in providing applications and data storage over
       the web. Cloud computing is not limited to web applications. It can
       also be used for services such as audio or video streaming.

    Advantages of Cloud Computing

          No software to install or upgrades to maintain.
          Available from any computer that has access to the

             Internet.

      Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

          Your information is stored on someone else's computer.
          You must have Internet access to use it.
          You are relying on a third-party to provide these services.

       Cloud computing has the ability to really impact how
       organizations manage technology. For example, why is an IT
       department needed to purchase, configure, and manage personal
       computers and software when all that is really needed is an
       Internet connection?

Using a Private Cloud

            Many organizations are understandably nervous about giving up
       control of their data and some of their applications by using cloud
       computing. But they also see the value in reducing the need for
       installing software and adding disk storage to local computers. A
       solution to this problem lies in the concept of a private cloud. While
       there are various models of a private cloud, the basic idea is for the
       cloud service provider to section off web server space for a specific
       organization. The organization has full control over that server
       space while still gaining some of the benefits of cloud computing.

Virtualization

            Virtualization is the process of using software to simulate a
       computer or some other device. For example, using virtualization

       a single physical computer can perform the functions of several
       virtual computers, usually referred to as Virtual Machines (VMs).
       Organizations implement virtual machines in an effort to reduce the
       number of physical servers needed to provide the necessary services
       to users. This reduction in the number of physical servers also
       reduces the demand for electricity to run and cool the physical
       servers. For more detail on how virtualization works, see this
       informational page from VMWare.

         Software Creation

                                                                      {

        Example program "Hello World" written in Java
            Modern software applications are written using a programming

       language such as Java, Visual C, C++, Python, etc. A programming
       language consists of a set of commands and syntax that can be
       organized logically to execute specific functions. Using this
       language, a programmer writes a program (known as source
       code) that can then be compiled into machine-readable form, the
       ones and zeroes necessary to be executed by the CPU. Languages
       such as HTML and JavaScript are used to develop web pages.

      Open-Source Software

            When the personal computer was first released, computer
       enthusiasts banded together to build applications and solve
       problems. These computer enthusiasts were motivated to share any
       programs they built and solutions to problems they found. This
       collaboration enabled them to more quickly innovate and fix
       problems.

As software began to become a business, however, this idea of
sharing everything fell out of favor with many developers. When
a program takes hundreds of hours to develop, it is
understandable that the programmers do not want to just give it
away. This led to a new business model of restrictive software
licensing which required payment for software, a model that is
still dominant today. This model is sometimes referred to as
closed source, as the source code is not made available to others.

There are many, however, who feel that software should not be

restricted. Just as with those early hobbyists in the 1970s, they

feel that innovation and progress can be made much more rapidly

if they share what has been learned. In the 1990s, with Internet

access connecting more people together, the open-source

movement  gained            steam.

                        to

          OpenOffice.org

        ....

       Open-source software makes the source code available for anyone
       to copy and use. For most people having access to the source code
       of a program does little good since it is challenging to modify
       existing programming code. However, open-source software is also
       available in a compiled format that can be downloaded and
       installed. The open-source movement has led to the development
       of some of the most used software in the world such as the Firefox
       browser, the Linux operating system, and the Apache web server.

       Many businesses are wary of open-source software precisely
       because the code is available for anyone to see. They feel that

       this increases the risk of an attack. Others counter that this
       openness actually decreases the risk because the code is exposed
       to thousands of programmers who can incorporate code changes
       to quickly patch vulnerabilities.
       There are thousands of open-source applications available for
       download. For example, you can get the productivity suite from
       Open Office. One good place to search for open-source software
       is sourceforge.net, where thousands of programs are available for
       free download.

              Summary

       Software gives the instructions that tell the hardware what to do.
       There are two basic categories of software: operating systems
       and applications. Operating systems interface with the computer
       hardware and make system resources available. Application
       software allows users to accomplish specific tasks such as word
       processing, presentations, or databases. This group is also
       referred to as productivity software. An ERP system stores all
       data in a centralized database that is made accessible to all
       programs and departments across the organization. Cloud
       computing provides access to software and databases from the
       Internet via a web browser. Developers use various programming
       languages to develop software.

          Study Questions

        1. Develop your own definition of software being certain to
             explain the key terms.

        2. What are the primary functions of an operating system?

             closed- source software? Give an example of each.
        8. What does a software license grant to the purchaser of the
             software?

              Exercises

        1. Find a case study online about the implementation of an
             ERP system. Was it successful? How long did it take? Does
             the case study tell you how much money the organization
             spent?

        2. If you were running a small business with limited funds for
             information technology, would you consider using cloud
             computing? Find some web-based resources that support your
             decision.

        3. Go to sourceforge.net and review their most downloaded
             software applications. Report on the variety of applications
             you find. Then pick one that interests you and report back
             on what it does, the kind of technical support offered, and
             the user reviews.

        4. Review this article on the security risks of open-source
             software. Write a short analysis giving your opinion on the
             different risks discussed.

            Introduction

            You have already been introduced to the first two components
       of information systems: hardware and software. However, those
       two components by themselves do not make a computer useful.
       Imagine if you turned on a computer, started the word processor,
       but could not save a document. Imagine if you opened a music

       player but there was no music to play. Imagine opening a web
       browser but there were no web pages. Without data, hardware and
       software are not very useful! Data is the third component of an
       information system.

      Data, Information, and
             Knowledge

            There have been many definitions and theories about data,
       information, and knowledge. The three terms are often used
       interchangeably, although they are distinct in nature. We define and
       illustrate the three terms from the perspective of information
       systems.

      Knowledge

     Information

         Data

       Data are the raw facts, and may be devoid of context or intent. For
       example, a sales order of computers is a piece of data. Data can be
       quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is numeric, the result
       of a measurement, count, or some other mathematical calculation.
       Qualitative data is descriptive. "Ruby Red," the color of a 2013
       Ford Focus, is an example of qualitative data. A number can be
       qualitative too: if I tell you my favorite number is 5, that is
       qualitative data because it is descriptive, not the result of a

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
       measurement or mathematical calculation.

       Information is processed data that possess context, relevance, and
       purpose. For example, monthly sales calculated from the collected
       daily sales data for the past year are information. Information
       typically involves the manipulation of raw data to obtain an
       indication of magnitude, trends, in patterns in the data for a purpose.
       Knowledge in a certain area is human beliefs or perceptions
       about relationships among facts or concepts relevant to that area.
       For example, the conceived relationship between the quality of
       goods and the sales is knowledge. Knowledge can be viewed as
       information that facilitates action.
       Once we have put our data into context, aggregated and analyzed it,
       we can use it to make decisions for our organization. We can say
       that this consumption of information produces knowledge. This
       knowledge can be used to make decisions, set policies, and even
       spark innovation.
       Explicit knowledge typically refers to knowledge that can be
       expressed into words or numbers. In contrast, tacit knowledge
       includes insights and intuitions, and is difficult to transfer to another
       person by means of simple communications.
       Evidently, when information or explicit knowledge is captured and
       stored in computer, it would become data if the context or intent is
       devoid.
       The final step up the information ladder is the step from
       knowledge (knowing a lot about a topic) to wisdom. We can say
       that someone has wisdom when they can combine their
       knowledge and experience to produce a deeper understanding of
       a topic. It often takes many years to develop wisdom on a
       particular topic, and requires patience.

              Big Data

            Almost all software programs require data to do anything

       useful. For example, if you are editing a document in a word
       processor such as Microsoft Word, the document you are
       working on is the data. The word-processing software can
       manipulate the data: create a new document, duplicate a
       document, or modify a document. Some other examples of data
       are: an MP3 music file, a video file, a spreadsheet, a web page, a
       social media post, and an e-book.
       Recently, big data has been capturing the attention of all types of
       organizations. The term refers to such massively large data sets that
       conventional data processing technologies do not have sufficient

       power to analyze them. For example, Walmart must process
       millions customer transactions every hour across the world.
       Storing and analyzing that much data is beyond the power of
       traditional data management tools. Understanding and
       developing the best tools and techniques to manage and analyze
       these large data sets are a problem that governments and
       businesses alike are trying to solve.

              Databases

            The goal of many information systems is to transform data into
       information in order to generate knowledge that can be used for
       decision making. In order to do this, the system must be able to take
       data, allow the user to put the data into context, and provide tools
       for aggregation and analysis. A database is designed for just such a
       purpose.

Why Databases?

          Data is a valuable resource in the organization. However, many
       people do not know much about database technology, but use
       non- database tools, such as Excel spreadsheet or Word
       document, to store and manipulate business data, or use poorly

designed databases for business processes. As a result, the data
are redundant, inconsistent, inaccurate, and corrupted. For a
small data set, the use of non-database tools such as spreadsheet
may not cause serious problem. However, for a large
organization, corrupted data could lead to serious errors and
destructive consequences. The common defects in data resources
management are explained as follows.

(1) No control of redundant data

People often keep redundant data for convenience. Redundant

data could make the data set inconsistent. We use an illustrative

example to explain why redundant data are harmful. Suppose the

registrar's office has two separate files that store student data:

one is the registered student roster which records all students

who have registered and paid the tuition, and the other is student

grade roster which records all students who have received

grades.

As you can see from the two spreadsheets, this data management
system has problems. The fact that "Student 4567 is Mary
Brown, and her major is Finance" is stored more than once. Such
occurrences are called data redundancy. Redundant data often
make data access convenient, but can be harmful. For example,
if Mary Brown changes her name or her major, then all her names
and major stored in the system must be changed altogether. For
small data systems, such a problem looks trivial. However, when
the data system is huge, making changes to all redundant data is
difficult if not impossible. As a result of data redundancy, the
entire data set can be corrupted.

          (2) Violation of data integrity
       Data integrity means consistency among the stored data. We use
       the above illustrative example to explain the concept of data
       integrity and how data integrity can be violated if the data system is
       flawed. You can find that Alex Wilson received a grade in
       MKT211; however, you can't find Alex Wilson in the student
       roster. That is, the two rosters are not consistent. Suppose we have
       a data integrity control to enforce the rules, say, "no student can
       receive a grade unless she/he has registered and paid tuition", then
       such a violation of data integrity can never happen.

          (3) Relying on human memory to store and to search needed
              data.

       The third common mistake in data resource management is the over
       use of human memory for data search. A human can remember what
       data are stored and where the data are stored, but can also make
       mistakes. If a piece of data is stored in an un-remembered place, it
       has actually been lost. As a result of relying on human memory to
       store and to search needed data, the entire data set eventually
       becomes disorganized.
       To avoid the above common flaws in data resource management,
       database technology must be applied. A database is an organized
       collection of related data. It is an organized collection, because in
       a database, all data is described and associated with other data. For
       the purposes of this text, we will only consider computerized
       databases.
       Though not good for replacing databases, spreadsheets can be ideal
       tools for analyzing the data stored in a database. A spreadsheet
       package can be connected to a specific table or query in a database
       and used to create charts or perform analysis on that data.

    Databases can be organized in many different ways by using
different models. The data model of a database is the logical
structure of data items and their relationships. There have been
several data models. Since the 1980s, the relational data model has
been popularized. Currently, relational database systems are
commonly used in business organizations with few exceptions. A
relational data model is easy to understand and use.

In a relational database, data is organized into tables (or relations).
Each table has a set of fields which define the structure of the data
stored in the table. A record is one instance of a set of fields in a
table. To visualize this, think of the records as the rows (or tuple)
of the table and the fields as the columns of the table.

In the example below, we have a table of student data, with each
row representing a student record, and each column representing
one filed of the student record. A special filed or a combination
of fields that determines the unique record is called primary key (or
key). A key is usually the unique identification number of the
records.

Designing a Database

       Suppose a university wants to create a School Database to track
       data. After interviewing several people, the design team learns
       that the goal of implementing the system is to give better insight
       into students' performance and academic resources. From this,

       the team decides that the system must keep track of the students,
       their grades, courses, and classrooms. Using this information, the
       design team determines that the following tables need to be
       created:

          STUDENT: student name, major, and e-mail.
          COURSE: course title, enrollment capacity.

          GRADE: this table will correlate STUDENT with COURSE,
             allowing us to have any given student to enroll multiple
             courses and to receive a grade for each course.

          CLASSROOM: classroom location, classroom type, and
             classroom capacity

       Now that the design team has determined which tables to create,
       they need to define the specific data items that each table will
       hold. This requires identifying the fields that will be in each
       table. For example, course title would be one of the fields in the
       COURSE table. Finally, since this will be a relational database,
       every table should have a field in common with at least one other
       table (in other words, they should have relationships with each
       other).

       A primary key must be selected for each table in a relational
       database. This key is a unique identifier for each record in the table.
       For example, in the STUDENT table, it might be possible to use the
       student name as a way to identify a student. However, it is more
       than likely that some students share the same name. A student's e-
       mail address might be a good choice for a primary key, since e- mail
       addresses are unique. However, a primary key cannot change, so
       this would mean that if students changed their e-mail address, we
       would have to remove them from the database and then re-insert
       them - not an attractive proposition. Our solution is to use student
       ID as the primary key of the STUDENT table. We will also do this
       for the COURSE table and the CLASSROOM table. This solution
       is quite common and is the reason you have so many IDs! The
       primary key of table can be just one field, but can also be a

combination of two or more fields. For example, the combination
of StudentID and CourseID the GRADE table can be the primary
key of the GRADE table, which means that a grade is received by a
particular student for a specific course.

The next step of design of database is to identify and make the
relationships between the tables so that you can pull the data
together in meaningful ways. A relationship between two tables is
implemented by using a foreign key. A foreign key is a field in one
table that connects to the primary key data in the original table. For
example, ClassroomID in the COURSE table is the foreign key that
connects to the primary key ClassroomID in the CLASSROOM
table. With this design, not only do we have a way to organize all
of the data we need and have successfully related all the table
together to meet the requirements, but have also prevented
invalid data from being entered into the database. You can see
the final database design in the figure below:

Normalization

            When designing a database, one important concept to understand
       is normalization. In simple terms, to normalize a database means to
       design it in a way that: 1) reduces data redundancy; and 2) ensure data
       integrity.
       In the School Database design, the design team worked to
       achieve these objectives. For example, to track grades, a simple
       (and wrong) solution might have been to create a Student field in
       the COURSE table and then just list the names of all of the
       students there. However, this design would mean that if a student

                                          This content downloaded from

       takes two or more courses, then his or her data would have to be
       entered twice or more times. This means the data are redundant.
       Instead, the designers solved this problem by introducing the
       GRADE table.
       In this design, when a student registers into the school system before
       taking a course, we first must add the student to the STUDENT
       table, where their ID, name, major, and e-mail address are entered.
       Now we will add a new entry to denote that the student takes a
       specific course. This is accomplished by adding a record with the
       StudentID and the CourseID in the GRADE table. If this student
       takes a second course, we do not have to duplicate the entry of the
       student's name, major, and e-mail; instead, we only need to make
       another entry in the GRADE table of the second course's ID and the
       student's ID.
       The design of the School database also makes it simple to change
       the design without major modifications to the existing structure.
       For example, if the design team were asked to add functionality to
       the system to track instructors who teach the courses, we could
       easily accomplish this by adding a PROFESSOR table (similar to
       the STUDENT table) and then adding a new field to the COURSE
       table to hold the professors' ID.

Data Types

       When defining the fields in a database table, we must give each field
       a data type. For example, the field StudentName is text string, while
       Enrollment Capacity is number. Most modern databases allow for
       several different data types to be stored. Some of the more common
       data types are listed here:

          Text: for storing non-numeric data that is brief, generally
             under 256 characters. The database designer can identify
             the maximum length of the text.

          Number: for storing numbers. There are usually a few
             different number types that can be selected, depending on

Information Systems for Business and Beyond (2019) pg. 74

                                          This content downloaded from

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
             how large the largest number will be.
          Boolean: a data type with only two possible values, such as 0 or

             1, "true" or "false", "yes" or "no".
          Date/Time: a special form of the number data type that can

             be interpreted as a number or a time.
          Currency: a special form of the number data type that

             formats all values with a currency indicator and two
             decimal places.
          Paragraph Text: this data type allows for text longer than 256
             characters.
          Object: this data type allows for the storage of data that
             cannot be entered via keyboard, such as an image or a
             music file.

       There are two important reasons that we must properly define the
       data type of a field. First, a data type tells the database what
       functions can be performed with the data. For example, if we
       wish to perform mathematical functions with one of the fields,
       we must be sure to tell the database that the field is a number data
       type. For example, we can subtract the course capacity from the
       classroom capacity to find out the number of extra seats
       available.
       The second important reason to define data type is so that the
       proper amount of storage space is allocated for our data. For
       example, if the StudentName field is defined as a Text (50) data
       type, this means 50 characters are allocated for each name we
       want to store. If a student's name is longer than 50 characters,
       the database will truncate it.

        Open Office Database Management System

       To the computer, a database looks like one or more files. In order
       for the data in the database to be stored, read, changed, added, or
       removed, a software program must access it. Many software
       applications have this ability: iTunes can
       read its database to give you a listing of its songs (and play the
       songs); your mobile-phone software can interact with your list of
       contacts. But what about applications to create or manage a
       database? What software can you use to create a database,
       change a database's structure, or simply do analysis? That is the
       purpose of a category of software applications called database
       management systems (DBMS).

       DBMS packages generally provide an interface to view and change
       the design of the database, create queries, and develop reports. Most
       of these packages are designed to work with a specific type of
       database, but generally are compatible with a wide range of
       databases.

       A database that can only be used by a single user at a time is not
       going to meet the needs of most organizations. As computers have
       become networked and are now joined worldwide via the Internet,
       a class of database has emerged that can be accessed by two, ten, or
       even a million people. These databases are sometimes installed on
       a single computer to be accessed by a group of people at a single
       location. Other times, they are installed over several servers
       worldwide, meant to be accessed by millions. In enterprises the
       relational DBMS are built and supported by companies such as
       Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM Db2. The open-source

       MySQL is also an enterprise database.
       Microsoft Access and Open Office Base are examples of
       personal database-management systems. These systems are
       primarily used to develop and analyze single-user databases.
       These databases are not meant to be shared across a network or
       the Internet, but are instead installed on a particular device and
       work with a single user at a time. Apache OpenOffice.org Base
       (see screen shot) can be used to create, modify, and analyze
       databases in open-database (ODB) format. Microsoft's Access
       DBMS is used to work with databases in its own Microsoft
       Access Database format. Both Access and Base have the ability
       to read and write to other database formats as well.

Structured Query Language

            Once you have a database designed and loaded with data, how
       will you do something useful with it? The primary way to work
       with a relational database is to use Structured Query Language,
       SQL (pronounced "sequel," or simply stated as S-Q-L). Almost all
       applications that work with databases (such as database
       management systems, discussed below) make use of SQL as a way
       to analyze and manipulate relational data. As its name implies, SQL
       is a language that can be used to work with a relational database.
       From a simple request for data to a complex update operation, SQL
       is a mainstay of programmers and database administrators. To give
       you a taste of what SQL might look like, here are a couple of
       examples using our School database:

       The following query will retrieve the major of student John Smith
       from the STUDENT table:

Information Systems for Business and Beyond (2019) pg. 77

                                          This content downloaded from

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
        SELECT StudentMajor
         FROM STUDENT
        WHERE StudentName = `John Smith';

       The following query will list the total number of students in the
       STUDENT table:
        SELECT COUNT (*)
        FROM STUDENT;

       SQL can be embedded in many computer languages that are used
       to develop platform-independent web-based applications. An in-
       depth description of how SQL works is beyond the scope of this
       introductory text, but these examples should give you an idea of
       the power of using SQL to manipulate relational databases.
       Many DBMS, such as Microsoft Access, allow you to use QBE
       (Query-by- Example), a graphical query tool, to retrieve data
       though visualized commands. QBE generates SQL for you, and
       is easy to use. In comparison with SQL, QBE has limited
       functionalities and is unable to work without the DBMS
       environment.

Other Types of Databases

       The relational database model is the most used database model
       today. However, many other database models exist that provide
       different strengths than the relational model. The hierarchical
       database model, popular in the 1960s and 1970s, connected data
       together in a hierarchy, allowing for a parent/child relationship
       between data. The document-centric model allowed for a more
       unstructured data storage by placing data into "documents" that
       could then be manipulated.
       Perhaps the most interesting new development is the concept of
       NoSQL (from the phrase "not only SQL"). NoSQL arose from the need
       to solve the problem of large-scale databases spread over several
       servers or even across the world. For a relational database to work
       properly, it is important that only one person be able to manipulate a

       piece of data at a time, a concept known as record- locking. But with
       today's large-scale databases (think Google and Amazon), this is just
       not possible. A NoSQL database can work with data in a looser way,
       allowing for a more unstructured environment, communicating
       changes to the data over time to all the servers that are part of the
       database.
       As stated earlier, the relational database model does not scale well.
       The term scale here refers to a database getting larger and larger,
       being distributed on a larger number of computers connected via a
       network. Some companies are looking to provide large-scale
       database solutions by moving away from the relational model to
       other, more flexible models. For example, Google now offers the
       App Engine Datastore, which is based on NoSQL. Developers can
       use the App Engine Datastore to develop applications that access
       data from anywhere in the world. Amazon.com offers several
       database services for enterprise use, including Amazon RDS, which
       is a relational database service, and Amazon DynamoDB, a NoSQL
       enterprise solution.

Sidebar: What Is Metadata?

       The term metadata can be understood as "data about data."
       Examples of metadata of database are:

          number of records
          data type of field
          size of field
          description of field
          default value of field
          rules of use.

Finding Value in Data: Business
Intelligence

            With the rise of Big Data and a myriad of new tools and
       techniques at their disposal, businesses are learning how to use
       information to their advantage. The term business intelligence is
       used to describe the process that organizations use to take data they
       are collecting and analyze it in the hopes of obtaining a competitive
       advantage. Besides using their own data, stored in data warehouses
       (see below), firms often purchase information from data brokers to
       get a big- picture understanding of their industries and the economy.
       The results of these analyses can drive organizational strategies and
       provide competitive advantage.

Data Visualization

            Data visualization is the graphical representation of
       information and data. These graphical representations (such as
       charts, graphs, and maps) can quickly summarize data in a way
       that is more intuitive and can lead to new insights and
       understandings. Just as a picture of a landscape can convey much
       more than a paragraph of text attempting to describe it, graphical
       representation of data can quickly make meaning of large
       amounts of data. Many times, visualizing data is the first step
       towards a deeper analysis and understanding of the data collected
       by an organization. Examples of data visualization software

Data Warehouses

       As organizations have begun to utilize databases as the
       centerpiece of their operations, the need to fully understand and
       leverage the data they are collecting has become more and more
       apparent. However, directly analyzing the data that is needed for
       day-to-day operations is not a good idea; we do not want to tax
       the operations of the company more than we need to. Further,
       organizations also want to analyze data in a historical sense: How
       does the data we have today compare with the same set of data
       this time last month, or last year? From these needs arose the
       concept of the data warehouse.
       The concept of the data warehouse is simple: extract data from one
       or more of the organization's databases and load it into the data
       warehouse (which is itself another database) for storage and
       analysis. However, the execution of this concept is not that simple.
       A data warehouse should be designed so that it meets the following
       criteria:

          It uses non-operational data. This means that the data
             warehouse is using a copy of data from the active databases
             that the company uses in its day-to-day operations, so the
             data warehouse must pull data from the existing databases
             on a regular, scheduled basis.

          The data is time-variant. This means that whenever data is
             loaded into the data warehouse, it receives a time stamp,
             which allows for comparisons between different time
             periods.

          The data is standardized. Because the data in a data
             warehouse usually comes from several different sources, it
             is possible that the data does not use the same definitions or
             units. For example, each database uses its own format for
             dates (e.g., mm/dd/yy, or dd/mm/yy, or yy/mm/dd, etc.). In

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
             order for the data warehouse to match up dates, a standard
             date format would have to be agreed upon and all data
             loaded into the data warehouse would have to be converted
             to use this standard format. This process is called
             extraction-transformation-load (ETL).

       There are two primary schools of thought when designing a data
       warehouse: bottom-up and top-down. The bottom-up approach
       starts by creating small data warehouses, called data marts, to
       solve specific business problems. As these data marts are created,
       they can be combined into a larger data warehouse. The top-
       down approach suggests that we should start by creating an
       enterprise- wide data warehouse and then, as specific business
       needs are identified, create smaller data marts from the data
       warehouse.

Benefits of Data Warehouses

         Data Warehouse Process (top-down)

                                                              Organizations find data
         warehouses quite beneficial for a number of reasons:
          The process of developing a data warehouse forces an

             organization to better understand the data that it is currently
             collecting and, equally important, what data is not being
             collected.
          A data warehouse provides a centralized view of all data
             being collected across the enterprise and provides a means for
             determining data that is inconsistent.
          Once all data is identified as consistent, an organization can
             generate "one version of the truth". This is important when
             the company wants to report consistent statistics about
             itself, such as revenue or number of employees.

          By having a data warehouse, snapshots of data can be taken
             over time. This creates a historical record of data, which
             allows for an analysis of trends.

          A data warehouse provides tools to combine data, which can
             provide new information and analysis.

Data Mining and Machine Learning

       Data mining is the process of analyzing data to find previously
       unknown and interesting trends, patterns, and associations in order
       to make decisions. Generally, data mining is accomplished through
       automated means against extremely large data sets, such as a data
       warehouse. Some examples of data mining include:

          An analysis of sales from a large grocery chain might
             determine that milk is purchased more frequently the day after
             it rains in cities with a population of less than 50,000.

          A bank may find that loan applicants whose bank accounts
             show particular deposit and withdrawal patterns are not good
             credit risks.

          A baseball team may find that collegiate baseball players with
             specific statistics in hitting, pitching, and fielding make for
             more successful major league players.

       One data mining method that an organization can use to do these
       analyses is called machine learning. Machine learning is used to
       analyze data and build models without being explicitly
       programmed to do so. Two primary branches of machine
       learning exist: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
       Supervised learning occurs when an organization has data about
       past activity that has occurred and wants to replicate it. For
       example, if they want to create a new marketing campaign for a
       particular product line, they may look at data from past
       marketing campaigns to see which of their consumers responded
       most favorably. Once the analysis is done, a machine learning
       model is created that can be used to identify these new

       customers. It is called "supervised" learning because we are
       directing (supervising) the analysis towards a result (in our
       example: consumers who respond favorably). Supervised
       learning techniques include analyses such as decision trees,
       neural networks, classifiers, and logistic regression.
       Unsupervised learning occurs when an organization has data and
       wants to understand the relationship(s) between different data
       points. For example, if a retailer wants to understand purchasing
       patterns of its customers, an unsupervised learning model can be
       developed to find out which products are most often purchased
       together or how to group their customers by purchase history. Is it
       called "unsupervised" learning because no specific outcome is
       expected? Unsupervised learning techniques include clustering and
       association rules.

Privacy Concerns

       The increasing power of data mining has caused concerns for many,
       especially in the area of privacy. In today's digital world, it is
       becoming easier than ever to take data from disparate sources and
       combine them to do new forms of analysis. In fact, a whole industry
       has sprung up around this technology: data brokers. These firms
       combine publicly accessible data with information obtained from
       the government and other sources to create vast warehouses of data
       about people and companies that they can then sell. This subject
       will be covered in much more detail in chapter 12 - the chapter on
       the ethical concerns of information systems.

       The term "data science" is a popular term meant to describe the
       analysis of large data sets to find new knowledge. For the past
       several years, it has been considered one of the best career fields to
       get into due to its explosive growth and high salaries. While a data
       scientist does many different things, their focus is generally on
       analyzing large data sets using various programming methods and
       software tools to create new knowledge for their organization. Data
       scientists are skilled in machine learning and data visualization
       techniques. The field of data science is constantly changing, and
       data scientists are on the cutting edge of work in areas such as
       artificial intelligence and neural networks.

Knowledge Management

            We end the chapter with a discussion on the concept of
       knowledge management (KM). All companies accumulate
       knowledge over the course of their existence. Some of this
       knowledge is written down or saved, but not in an organized
       fashion. Much of this knowledge is not written down; instead, it
       is stored inside the heads of its employees. Knowledge
       management is the process of creating, formalizing the capture,
       indexing, storing, and sharing of the company's knowledge in
       order to benefit from the experiences and insights that the
       company has captured during its existence.

Summary

            In this chapter, we learned about the role that data and databases
       play in the context of information systems. Data is made up of facts
       of the world. If you process data in a particular context, then you have
       information. Knowledge is gained when information is consumed and

       used for decision making. A database is an organized collection of
       related data. Relational databases are the most widely used type of
       database, where data is structured into tables and all tables must be
       related to each other through unique identifiers. A database
       management system (DBMS) is a software application that is used to
       create and manage databases, and can take the form of a personal
       DBMS, used by one person, or an enterprise DBMS that can be used
       by multiple users. A data warehouse is a special form of database that
       takes data from other databases in an enterprise and organizes it for
       analysis. Data mining is the process of looking for patterns and
       relationships in large data sets. Many businesses use databases, data
       warehouses, and data-mining techniques in order to produce business
       intelligence and gain a competitive advantage.

            Introduction

            In the early days of computing, computers were seen as
       devices for making calculations, storing data, and automating
       business processes. However, as the devices evolved, it became
       apparent that many of the functions of telecommunications could
       be integrated into the computer. During the 1980s, many
       organizations began

       combining their once-separate telecommunications and
       information systems departments into an Information
       Technology (IT) department. This ability for computers to
       communicate with one another and to facilitate communication
       between individuals and groups has had a major impact on the
       growth of computing over the past several decades.
       Computer networking began in the 1960s with the birth of the
       Internet. However, while the Internet and web were evolving,
       corporate networking was also taking shape in the form of local
       area networks and client-server computing. The Internet went
       commercial in 1994 as technologies began to pervade all areas
       of the organization. Today it would be unthinkable to have a
       computer that did not include communications capabilities. This
       chapter reviews the different technologies that have been put in
       place to enable this communications revolution.

 A Brief History of the Internet
In the Beginning: ARPANET

            The story of the Internet, and networking in general, can be
       traced back to the late 1950s. The United States was in the depths
       of the Cold War with the USSR as each nation closely watched the
       other to determine which would gain a military or intelligence
       advantage. In 1957, the Soviets surprised the U.S. with the launch
       of Sputnik, propelling us into the space age. In response to Sputnik,
       the U.S. Government created the Advanced Research Projects
       Agency (ARPA), whose initial role was to ensure that the U.S. was
       not surprised again. It was from ARPA, now called DARPA
       (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), that the Internet
       first sprang.

       ARPA was the center of computing research in the 1960s, but
       there was just one problem. Many of the computers could not
       communicate with each other. In 1968 ARPA sent out a request
       for proposals for a communication technology that would allow
       different computers located around the country to be integrated
       together into one network. Twelve companies responded to the
       request, and a company named Bolt, Beranek, and Newman
       (BBN) won the contract. They immediately began work and
       were able to complete the job just one year later.

          ARPA Net 1969
       Professor Len Kleinrock of UCLA along with a group of
       graduate students were the first to successfully send a
       transmission over the ARPANET. The event occurred on
       October 29, 1969 when they attempted to send the word "login"
       from their computer at UCLA to the Stanford Research Institute.
       You can read their actual notes. The first four nodes were at
       UCLA, University of California, Stanford, and the University of
       Utah.

The Internet and the World Wide
Web

            Over the next decade, the ARPANET grew and gained
       popularity. During this time, other networks also came into
       existence. Different organizations were connected to different
       networks. This led to a problem. The networks could not
       communicate with each other. Each network used its own
       proprietary language, or protocol (see sidebar for the definition
       of protocol) to send information back and forth. This problem
       was solved by the invention of Transmission Control
       Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TCP/IP was designed to
       allow networks running on different protocols to have an
       intermediary protocol that would allow them to communicate. So
       as long as your network supported TCP/IP, you could
       communicate with all of the other networks running TCP/IP.
       TCP/IP quickly became the standard protocol and allowed
       networks to communicate with each other. It is from this
       breakthrough that we first got the term Internet, which simply
       means "an interconnected network of networks."

Sidebar: An Internet Vocabulary
Lesson

         Network communication is full of some very technical concepts
       based on simple principles. Learn the following terms and you'll be
       able to hold your own in a conversation about the Internet.

          Packet The fundamental unit of data transmitted over the
             Internet. When a host (PC, workstation, server, printer, etc.)
             intends to send a message to another host (for example,
             your PC sends a request to YouTube to open a video), it
             breaks the message down into smaller pieces, called
             packets. Each packet has the sender's address, the
             destination address, a sequence

                                          This content downloaded from

             number, and a piece of the overall message to be sent.
             Different packets in a single message can take a variety of
             routes to the destination and they can arrive at different
             times. For this reason, the sequence number is used to
             reassemble the packets in the proper order at the destination.

          Switch A network device that connects multiple hosts together
             and forwards packets based on their destination within the local
             network which is commonly known as a Local Area Network
             (LAN).

          Router A device that receives and analyzes packets and then
             routes them towards their destination. In some cases, a
             router will send a packet to another router. In other cases, it
             will send it directly to its destination. Routers are used to
             connect one network to another network.

          IP Address Every device on the Internet (personal computer, a
             tablet, a smartphone, etc.) is assigned a unique identifying
             number called an IP (Internet Protocol) address. Originally, the
             IPv4 (version 4) standard was used. It had a format of four
             numbers with values ranging from 0 and 255 separated by a
             period. For example, the domain Dell.com has the IPv4 address
             107.23.196.166. The IPv4 standard has a limit of 4,294,967,296
             possible addresses. As the use of the Internet has grown, the
             number of IP addresses needed has increased to the point where
             the use of IPv4 addresses will be exhausted. This has led to the
             new IPv6 standard. The IPv6 standard is formatted as eight
             groups of four hexadecimal digits, such as
             2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334. The IPv6 standard
             has a limit of 3.41038 possible addresses. For example, the
             domain LinkedIn.com has an IPv6 address of:
             [2620:109:c002::6cae:a0a]. You probably noticed that the
             address has only five groups of numbers. That's because IPv6
             allows the use of two semi-colons (::) to indicate groups that
             are all zeroes and do not need to be displayed. For more detail
             about the IPv6 standard, see this Wikipedia article.

              every web site you wanted to access; the Internet would not be
              nearly as easy to use. A domain name is a human-friendly
              name, convenient for remembering a website. These names
              generally consist of a descriptive word followed by a dot
              (period) and the Top-Level Domain (TLD). For example,
              Wikipedia's domain name is wikipedia.org. Wikipedia
              describes the organization and .org is the TLD. Other well-
              known TLDs include .com, .net, and .gov. For a list and
              description of top level domain names, see this Wikipedia
              article.
          DNS DNS stands for "domain name server or system." DNS
             acts as the directory of websites on the Internet. When a
             request to access a host with a domain name is given, a DNS
             server is queried. It returns the IP address of the host
             requested, allowing for proper routing.
          Packet-switching When a message's packets are sent on the
             Internet, routers try to find the optimal route for each
             packet. This can result in packets being sent on different
             routes to their destination. After the packets arrive, they are
             re- assembled into the original message for the recipient.
             For more details on packet-switching, see this interactive
             web page.
          Protocol A protocol is the set of rules that govern how
             communications take place on a network. For example, File
             Transfer Protocol (FTP) are the communication rules for
             transferring files from one host to another. TCP/IP, discussed
             earlier, is known as a protocol suite since it contains numerous
             protocols.

          Internet Users Worldwide, December 2017.
          (Public Domain. Courtesy of the Miniwatts Marketing Group)
       The 1980s witnessed a significant growth in Internet usage.
       Internet access came primarily from government, academic, and
       research organizations. Much to the surprise of the engineers, the
       early popularity of the Internet was driven by the use of electronic
       mail (see the next sidebar).
       Initially, Internet use meant having to type commands, even
       including IP addresses, in order to access a web server. That all
       changed in 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee introduced his World Wide
       Web project which provided an easy way to navigate the Internet
       through the use of hypertext. The World Wide Web gained even
       more steam in 1993 with the release of the Mosaic browser which
       allowed graphics and text to be combined as a way to present
       information and navigate the Internet.

The Dot-Com Bubble

            In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Internet was being managed
       by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The NSF had restricted
       commercial ventures on the Internet, which meant that no one could
       buy or sell anything online. In 1991, the NSF transferred its role to
       three other organizations, thus getting the US government out of
       direct control over the Internet and essentially opening up
       commerce online.
       This new commercialization of the Internet led to what is now

       known as the dot-com bubble. A frenzy of investment in new dot-
       com companies took place in the late 1990s with new tech
       companies issuing Initial Public Offerings (IPO) and heating up the
       stock market. This investment bubble was driven by the fact that
       investors knew that online commerce would change everything.
       Unfortunately, many of these new companies had poor business
       models and anemic financial statements showing little or no profit.
       In 2000 and 2001, the bubble burst and many of these new
       companies went out of business. Some companies survived,
       including Amazon (started in 1994) and eBay (1995). After the dot-
       com bubble burst, a new reality became clear. In order to succeed
       online, e-business companies would need to develop business
       models appropriate for the online environment.

Web 2.0

       In the first few years of the World Wide Web, creating and hosting
       a website required a specific set of knowledge. A person had to
       know how to set up a web server, get a domain name, create web
       pages in HTML, and troubleshoot various technical issues.
       Starting in the early 2000s, major changes came about in how the
       Internet was being used. These changes have come to be known
       as Web 2.0. Here are some key characteristics in Web 2.0.

          Universal access to Apps
          Value is found in content, not display software
          Data can be easily shared
          Distribution is bottom up, not top down
          Employees and customers can use access and use tools on

             their own
          Informal networking is encouraged since more contributors

             results in better content

            -
          Social tools encourage people to share information 1

    Social networking, the last item in the list, has led to major changes
    in society. Prior to Web 2.0 major news outlets investigated and
    reported important news stories of the day. But in today's world
    individuals are able to easily share their own views on various events.
    Apps such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and personal blogs allow
    people to express their own viewpoint.

Sidebar: E-mail Is the "Killer"
App for the Internet

       As discussed in chapter 3, a "killer app" is a use of a device that
       becomes so essential that large numbers of people will buy the
       device just to run that application. The killer app for the personal
       computer was the spreadsheet, enabling users to enter data, write
       formulas, and easily make "what if" decisions. With the
       introduction of the Internet came another killer app - E-mail.
       The Internet was originally designed as a way for the Department
       of Defense to manage projects. However, the invention of
       electronic mail drove demand for the Internet. While this wasn't
       what developers had in mind, it turned out that people connecting
       with people was the killer app for the Internet. As we look back
       today, we can see this being repeated again and again with new
       technologies that enable people to connect with each other.

Are Not the Same Thing

            Many times, the terms "Internet" and "World Wide Web," or
       even just "the web," are used interchangeably. But really, they are
       not the same thing.
       The Internet is an interconnected network of networks. Services
       such as email, voice and video, file transfer, and the World Wide
       Web all run across the Internet. The World Wide Web is simply one
       part of the Internet. It is made up of web servers that have HTML
       pages that are being viewed on devices with web browsers.

The Growth of High-Speed
Internet

            In the early days of the Internet, most access was accomplished
       via a modem over an analog telephone line. A modem was
       connected to the incoming phone line when then connected to a
       computer. Speeds were measured in bits-per-second (bps), with
       speeds growing from 1200 bps to 56,000 bps over the years.
       Connection to the Internet via modems is called dial-up access. As
       the web became more interactive, dial-up hindered usage when
       users wanted to transfer more and more data. As a point of
       reference, downloading a typical 3.5 MB song would take 24
       minutes at 1200 bps and 2 minutes at 28,800 bps.
       High speed Internet speeds, by definition, are a minimum of
       256,000 bps, though most connections today are much faster,
       measured in millions of bits per second (megabits or Mbps) or even
       billions (gigabits). For the home user, a high-speed connection is
       usually accomplished via the cable television lines or phone lines
       using a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). Both cable and DSL have
       similar prices and speeds

       , though price and speed can vary in local communities. According
       to the website Recode, the average home

       broadband speed ranges from 12 Mbps and 125 Mbps.2
       Telecommunications companies provide T1 and T3 lines for greater
       bandwidth and reliability.
       High speed access, also known as broadband, is important because
       it impacts how the Internet is used. Communities with high speed
       Internet have found residences and businesses increase usage of
       digital resources. Access to high speed Internet is now considered a
       basic human right by the United Nations, as declared in their 2011
       statement:
       "Broadband technologies are fundamentally transforming the way
       we live," the Broadband Commission for Digital Development, set
       up in 2017 by the UN Educational Scientific and Cultural
       Organization (UNESCO) and the UN International
       Telecommunications Union (ITU), said in issuing "The Broadband
       Challenge" at a leadership summit in Geneva.
       "It is vital that no one be excluded from the new global knowledge
       societies we are building. We believe that communication is not just
       a human need -it is a right."3

Wireless Networking

       Thanks to wireless technology, access to the Internet is virtually
       everywhere, especially through a smartphone.

Wi-Fi

       Wi-Fi takes an Internet signal and converts it into radio waves.
       These radio waves can be picked up within a radius of

       approximately 65 feet by devices with a wireless adapter. Several
       Wi-Fi specifications have been developed over the years, starting
       with 802.11b in 1999, followed by the 802.11g specification in
       2003 and 802.11n in 2009. Each new specification improved the
       speed and range of Wi-Fi, allowing for more uses. One of the
       primary places where Wi-Fi is being used is in the home. Home
       users access Wi-Fi via in-home routers provided by the
       telecommunications firm that services the residence.

Mobile Network

            As the cellphone has evolved into the smartphone, the desire
       for Internet access on these devices has led to data networks
       being included as part of the mobile phone network. While
       Internet connections were technically available earlier, it was
       really with the release of the 3G networks in 2001 (2002 in the
       US) that smartphones and other cellular devices could access
       data from the Internet. This new capability drove the market for
       new and more powerful smartphones, such as the iPhone,
       introduced in 2007. In 2011, wireless carriers began offering 4G
       data speeds, giving the cellular networks the same speeds, that
       customers were accustomed to getting via their home
       connection.
       Beginning in 2019, some part of the world began seeing the
       implementation of 5G communication networks. Speeds
       associated with 5G will be greater than 1 GB/second, providing
       connection speeds to handle just about any type of application.
       Some have speculated that the 5G implementation will lead
       households to eliminate the purchase of wired Internet
       connections for their homes, just using 5G wireless connections
       instead.

Sidebar: Why Doesn't My
Cellphone Work When I Travel
Abroad?

            As mobile phone technologies have evolved, providers in
       different countries have chosen different communication standards
       for their mobile phone networks. There are two competing
       standards in the US: GSM (used by AT&T and T-Mobile) and
       CDMA (used by the other major carriers). Each standard has its pros
       and cons, but the bottom line is that phones using one standard
       cannot easily switch to the other. This is not a big deal in the US
       because mobile networks exist to support both standards. But when
       traveling to other countries, you will find that most of them use
       GSM networks. The one exception is Japan which has standardized
       on CDMA. It is possible for a mobile phone using one type of
       network to switch to the other type of network by changing out
       the SIM card, which controls your access to the mobile network.
       However, this will not

       consult with your mobile provider to determine the best way to
       access a mobile network.

Bluetooth

       Bluetooth Logo

            While Bluetooth is not generally used to connect a device to the
       Internet, it is an important wireless technology that has enabled
       many functionalities that are used every day. When created in 1994
       by Ericsson, it was intended to replace wired connections between
       devices. Today, it is the standard method for wirelessly connecting
       nearby devices. Bluetooth has a range of approximately 300 feet
       and consumes very little power, making it an excellent choice for
       a variety of purposes. Some applications of Bluetooth include:
       connecting a printer to a personal computer, connecting a mobile
       phone and headset, connecting a wireless keyboard and mouse to a
       computer, or connecting your mobile phone to your car, resulting in
       hands free operation of your phone.

Voice over IP (VoIP) allows analog signals to be converted to
digital signals, then transmitted on a network. By using existing
technologies and software, voice communication over the
Internet is now available to anyone with a browser (think Skype,
WebEx, Google Hangouts). Beyond this, many companies are
now offering VoIP-based telephone service for business and
home use.

          Scope of business networks
       While the Internet was evolving and creating a way for
       organizations to connect to each other and the world, another
       revolution was taking place inside organizations. The proliferation
       of personal computers led to the need to share resources such as
       printers, scanners, and data. Organizations solved this problem
       through the creation of local area networks (LANs), which allowed
       computers to connect to each other and to peripherals.
       A LAN is a local network, usually operating in the same building or
       on the same campus. A Wide Area Network (WAN) provides
       connectivity over a wider area such as an organization's locations
       in different cities or states.

Client-Server

       Client-server computing provides stand-alone devices such as
       personal computers, printers, and file servers to work together. The
       personal computer originally was used as a stand-alone computing
       device. A program was installed on the computer and then used to
       do word processing or calculations. With the advent of networking
       and local area networks, computers could work together to solve
       problems. Higher-end computers were installed as servers, and
       users on the local network could run applications and share
       information among departments and organizations.

Intranet

       An intranet, as the name implies, provides web-based resources for
       the users within an organization. These web pages are not accessible
       to those outside the company. The pages typically contain
       information useful to employees such as policies and procedures. In
       an academic setting the intranet provides an interface to learning
       resources for students.

Extranet

       Sometimes an organization wants to be able to collaborate with its
       customers or suppliers while at the same time maintaining the
       security of being inside its own network. In cases like this a
       company may want to create an extranet, which is a part of a
       company's network that can be made available securely to those
       outside of the company. Extranets can be used to allow customers
       to log in and place orders, or for suppliers to check their customers'
       inventory levels.

       Sometimes an organization will need to allow someone who is not
       located physically within its internal network to gain secure access
       to the intranet. This access can be provided by a virtual private
       network (VPN). VPNs will be discussed further in Chapter 6 which
       focuses on Information Security.

Sidebar: Microsoft's SharePoint
Powers the Intranet

            As organizations begin to see the power of collaboration
       between their employees, they often look for solutions that will
       allow them to leverage their intranet to enable more collaboration.
       Since most companies use Microsoft products for much of their
       computing, some are using Microsoft's SharePoint to support
       employee collaboration.
       SharePoint provides a communication and collaboration
       platform that integrates seamlessly with Microsoft's Office suite
       of applications. Using SharePoint, employees can share a
       document and edit it together, avoiding the need to email the
       document for others to review. Projects and documents can be
       managed collaboratively across the organization. Corporate
       documents are indexed and made available for search.

            Cloud computing was covered in Chapter 3. The universal
       availability of the Internet combined with increases in processing
       power and data-storage capacity have made cloud computing a
       viable option for many companies. Using cloud computing,
       companies or individuals can contract to store data on storage
       devices somewhere on the Internet. Applications can be "rented" as
       needed, giving a company the ability to quickly deploy new
       applications. The I.T. department benefits from not having to
       maintain software that is provided on the cloud.

Sidebar: Metcalfe's Law

            Just as Moore's Law describes how computing power is
       increasing over time, Metcalfe's Law describes the power
       of networking. Metcalfe's Law states that the value of a
       telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the
       number of connected users of the system, or N2. If a network has 10
       nodes, the inherent value is 100, or 102.
       Metcalfe's Law is attributed to Robert Metcalfe, the co-inventor of
       Ethernet. It attempts to address the added value provided by each
       node on the network. Think about it this way: If none of your friends
       were on Instagram, would you spend much time there? If no one
       else at your school or place of work had e-mail, would it be very
       useful to you? Metcalfe's Law tries to quantify this value.

             the next month. Consult your wireless carrier to determine
             if your mobile phone would work properly in those
             countries. What would the costs be? What alternatives do
             you have if it would not work?

Labs

        1. Check the speed of your Internet connection by going to the
             following web site: speedtest.net. What is your download
             and upload speed?

        2. What is the IP address of your computer? How did you find
             it? Hint for Windows: Go to the start icon and click Run.
             Then open the Command Line Interface by typing: cmd Then
             type: ipconfig. What is your IPv4 address? What is your IPv6
             address?

        3. When you enter an address in your web browser, a Domain
             Name Server (DNS) is used to lookup the IP address of the
             site you are seeking. To locate the DNS server your computer
             is using, type: nslookup. Write down the name and address of
             your DNS server. Use the nslookup command to find the
             address for a favorite web site. For example, to find the IP
             address of ESPN type: nslookup espn. Write down your
             website's name and address. Note: it is on the line following
             the name of the web site you entered.

        4. You can use the tracert (trace route) command to display the
             path from your computer to the web site's IP address you
             used in the previous lab. For example, tracert
             199.181.132.250. Be patient as tracert contacts each router in
             the path to your website's server. A "Request timed out"
             message indicates the tracing is taking too long, probably due
             to a lack of bandwidth. You can stop the trace by pressing Ctrl
             + C

        5. The ping command allows you check connectivity between
             the local host (your computer) and another host. If you are
             unable to connect to another host, the ping command can be
             used to incrementally test your connectivity. The IP address
             127.0.0.1 is known as your home address (local host). Begin
             your test by going to your command line interface (command
             prompt) and pinging your local host: ping 127.0.0.1You
             should get a series of "Reply from 127.0.0.1" messages. Next,
             ping the IP address you used in lab #3. Sometimes a failed
             ping is not the result of a lack of connectivity. Network
             administrators of some IP addresses/hosts do not want their
             site pinged so they block all ICMP packets. That's the
             protocol used for pinging.

          The whois.domaintools.com site provides you with
             information about a web site. For example, to find
             information about google.com open your web browser and
             type: whoisdomaintools.com Then in the Lookup window,
             type: google.com. Find information about a favorite site of
             yours. Record the following: administrator name, phone
             number, when the site was created, and the site's name
             servers (the names begin with "ns").

          Network statistics can be displayed using the netstat
             command. In the command line window (see lab #2 for
             instructions on how to get to the command line), type:
             netstat-e. How many bytes were sent and how many were
             received? Execute the command again and record your
             results. You should see an increase in both received and sent
             bytes. To see a complete list of options/switches for the
             netstat command, type: netstat?

     on how organizations can stay secure. Several different measures
     that a company can take to improve security will be discussed.
     Finally, you will review a list of security precautions that
     individuals can take in order to secure their personal computing
     environment.

The Information Security Triad:
    Confidentiality, Integrity,
        Availability (CIA)
          Confidentiality

          Protecting information means you want to want to be able to
     restrict access to those who are allowed to see it. This is sometimes
     referred to as NTK, Need to Know. Everyone else should be
     disallowed from learning anything about its contents. This is the
     essence of confidentiality. For example, federal law requires that
     universities restrict access to private student information. Access
     to grade records should be limited to those who have authorized
     access.

Integrity

            Integrity is the assurance that the information being accessed
       has not been altered and truly represents what is intended. Just as
       a person with integrity means what he or she says and can be
       trusted to consistently represent the truth, information integrity
       means information truly represents its intended meaning.
       Information can lose its integrity through malicious intent, such
       as when someone who is not authorized makes a change to
       intentionally misrepresent something. An example of this would
       be when a hacker is hired to go into the university's system and
       change a student's grade. Integrity can also be lost unintentionally,
       such as when a computer power surge corrupts a file or someone
       authorized to make a change accidentally deletes a file or enters
       incorrect information.

Availability

            Information availability is the third part of the CIA triad.
       Availability means information can be accessed and modified by
       anyone authorized to do so in an appropriate timeframe. Depending
       on the type of information, appropriate timeframe can mean
       different things. For example, a stock trader needs information to
       be available immediately, while a sales person may be happy to get
       sales numbers for the day in a report the next morning. Online
       retailers require their servers to be available twenty-four hours a
       day, seven days a week. Other companies may not suffer if their
       web servers are down for a few minutes once in a while.

 Tools for Information Security

            In order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
       of information, organizations can choose from a variety of tools.
       Each of these tools can be utilized as part of an overall information-
       security policy.

Authentication

            The most common way to identify someone is through their
       physical appearance, but how do we identify someone sitting
       behind a computer screen or at the ATM? Tools for
       authentication are used to ensure that the person accessing the
       information is, indeed, who they present themselves to be.
       Authentication can be accomplished by identifying someone
       through one or more of three factors:

        1. Something they know,
        2. Something they have, or
        3. Something they are.

            For example, the most common form of authentication today
       is the user ID and password. In this case, the authentication is
       done by confirming something that the user knows (their ID and
       password). But this form of authentication is easy to compromise
       (see sidebar) and stronger forms of authentication are sometimes
       needed. Identifying someone only by something they have, such
       as a key or a card, can also be problematic. When that identifying
       token is lost or stolen, the identity can be easily stolen. The final
       factor, something you are, is much harder to compromise. This
       factor identifies a user through the use of a physical
       characteristic, such as a retinal scan,

Information Systems for Business and Beyond (2019) pg. 117

                                          This content downloaded from

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
       fingerprint, or facial geometry. Identifying someone through
       their physical characteristics is called biometrics.

                                                                        RSA SecureID token
            A more secure way to authenticate a user is through multi-factor
       authentication. By combining two or more of the factors listed
       above, it becomes much more difficult for someone to misrepresent
       themselves. An example of this would be the use of an RSA
       SecurID token. The RSA device is something you have, and it
       generates a new access code every sixty seconds. To log in to an
       information resource using the RSA device, you combine
       something you know, such as a four-digit PIN, with the code
       generated by the device. The only way to properly authenticate is
       by both knowing the code and having the RSA device.

Access Control

            Once a user has been authenticated, the next step is to ensure
       that they can only access the information resources that are
       appropriate. This is done through the use of access control. Access
       control determines which users are authorized to read, modify,
       add, and/ or delete information. Several different access control
       models exist. Two of the more common are: The Access Control
       List (ACL) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). An
       information security employee can produce an ACL which
       identifies a list of users who have the capability to take specific
       actions with an information resource such as data files. Specific

permissions are assigned to each user such as read, write, delete,
or add. Only users with those permissions are allowed to perform
those functions.

ACLs are simple to understand and maintain, but there are
several drawbacks. The primary drawback is that each
information resource is managed separately, so if a security
administrator wanted to add or remove a user to a large set of
information resources, it would be quite difficult. And as the
number of users and resources increase, ACLs become harder to
maintain. This has led to an improved method of access control,
called role-based access control, or RBAC. With RBAC, instead
of giving specific users access rights to an information resource,
users are assigned to roles and then those roles are assigned the
access. This allows the administrators to manage users and roles
separately, simplifying administration and, by extension,
improving security.

The following image shows an ACL with permissions granted to
individual users. RBAC allows permissions to be assigned to roles,
as shown in the middle grid, and then in the third grid each user is
assigned a role. Although not modeled in the image, each user can
have multiple roles such as Reader and Editor.

       considered a secure method of authentication? It turns out that
       this single-factor authentication is extremely easy to
       compromise. Good password policies must be put in place in
       order to ensure that passwords cannot be compromised. Below
       are some of the more common policies that organizations should
       use.

          Require complex passwords. One reason passwords are
             compromised is that they can be easily guessed. A recent
             study found that the top three passwords people used were
             password, 123456 and 12345678.[-1] A password should not be
             simple, or a word that can be found in a dictionary. Hackers
             first attempt to crack a password by testing every term in
             the dictionary. Instead, a good password policy should
             require the use of a minimum of eight characters, at least
             one upper-case letter, one special character, and one digit.

          Change passwords regularly. It is essential that users
             change their passwords on a regular basis. Also, passwords
             may not be reused. Users should change their passwords
             every sixty to ninety days, ensuring that any passwords that
             might have been stolen or guessed will not be able to be
             used against the company.

          Train employees not to give away passwords. One of the
             primary methods used to steal passwords is to simply figure
             them out by asking the users for their password. Pretexting
             occurs when an attacker calls a helpdesk or security
             administrator and pretends to be a particular authorized
             user having trouble logging in. Then, by providing some
             personal information about the authorized user, the attacker
             convinces the security person to reset the password and tell
             him what it is. Another way that employees may be tricked
             into giving away passwords is through e-mail phishing.
             Phishing occurs when a user receives an e-mail that looks
             as if it is from a trusted source, such as their bank or
             employer. In the e-mail the user is asked to click a link and
             log in to a website that mimics the genuine website, then
             enter their ID and password. The userID and password are

             then captured by the attacker.

Encryption

            Many times, an organization needs to transmit information
       over the Internet or transfer it on external media such as a flash
       drive. In these cases, even with proper authentication and access
       control, it is possible for an unauthorized person to gain access
       to the data. Encryption is a process of encoding data upon its
       transmission or storage so that only authorized individuals can
       read it. This encoding is accomplished by software which
       encodes the plain text that needs to be transmitted (encryption).
       Then the recipient receives the cipher text and decodes it
       (decryption). In order for this to work, the sender and receiver
       need to agree on the method of encoding so that both parties have
       the same message. Known as symmetric key encryption, both
       parties share the encryption key, enabling them to encode and
       decode each other's messages.
       An alternative to symmetric key encryption is public key
       encryption. In public key encryption, two keys are used: a public
       key and a private key. To send an encrypted message, you obtain
       the public key, encode the message, and send it. The recipient
       then uses their private key to decode it. The public key can be
       given to anyone who wishes to send the recipient a message.
       Each user simply needs one private key and one public key in
       order to secure messages. The private key is necessary in order
       to decrypt a message sent with the public key.
       Notice in the image how the sender on the left creates a plaintext
       message which is then encrypted with a public key. The ciphered
       text is transmitted through the communication channel and the
       recipient uses their private key to decrypt the message and then
       read the plain text.

 Sidebar: Blockchain & Bitcoin
Blockchain

            Introduced in 2008 as part of a proposal for Bitcoin, Blockchain
       is a peer-to-peer network which provides an open, distributed
       record of transactions between two parties. A "peer-to-peer"
       network is one where there is no server between the two nodes
       trying to communicate. Essentially, this means that each node acts
       as a server and a client.

       Supporters see blockchain as a tool to simplify all types of
       transactions: payments, contracts, etc. Motivation comes from

       the desire to remove the middleman (lawyer, banker, broker)
       from transactions, making them more efficient and readily
       available across the Internet. Blockchain is already being used to
       track products through supply chains. Blockchain is considered a
       foundational technology, potentially creating new foundations in
       economics and social systems. There are numerous concerns about
       Blockchain and its adoption. Consider the following:

          Speed of adoption. Initially there is a great deal of
             enthusiasm by a small group. However, adoption on a larger
             scale can take a great number of years even decades for a
             worldwide acceptance of a new method of doing business.

          Governance. The banking sector, both in individual countries
             (U. S. Federal Reserve System) and the world at large (the
             International Monetary Fund), controls financial transactions.
             One purpose of these organizations is an attempt to avoid
             banking and financial systems collapse. Blockchain will result
             in the governance of financial transactions shifting away from
             these government-controlled institutions.

          Smart contracts. The smart contract will re-shape how
             businesses interact. It is possible for blockchain to
             automatically send payment to a vendor the instant the
             product is delivered to the customer. Such "self-executing"
             contracts are already taking place in banking and venture
             capital funding. 1

       Many are forecasting some universal form of payment or value
       transfer for business transactions. Blockchain and Bitcoin are
       being used to transform banking in various locations around the
       world.

       It functions without a central bank, operating as a peer-to-peer
       network with transactions happening directly between vendors
       and buyers. Records for transactions are recorded in the
       blockchain. Bitcoin technology was released in 2009. The

Backups

         Another essential tool for information security is a comprehensive
       backup plan for the entire organization. Not only should the data on
       the corporate servers be backed up, but individual computers used
       throughout the organization should also be backed up. A good
       backup plan should consist of several components.

          Full understanding of the organization's information
             resources. What information does the organization actually
             have? Where is it stored? Some data may be stored on the
             organization's servers, other data on users' hard drives, some
             in the cloud, and some on third-party sites. An organization
             should make a full inventory of all of the information that
             needs to be backed up and determine the best way to back it
             up.

          Regular backups of all data. The frequency of backups
             should be based on how important the data is to the company,
             combined with the ability of the company to replace any data

       critical data could be backed up weekly. Most large
       organizations today use data redundancy so their records are
       always backed up.

          Offsite storage of backup data sets. If all backup data is
             being stored in the same facility as the original copies of
             the data, then a single event such as an earthquake, fire, or
             tornado would destroy both the original data and the
             backup. It is essential the backup plan includes storing the
             data in an offsite location.

          Test of data restoration. Backups should be tested on a
             regular basis by having test data deleted then restored from
             backup. This will ensure that the process is working and will
             give the organization confidence in the backup plan.

       Besides these considerations, organizations should also examine
       their operations to determine what effect downtime would have
       on their business. If their information technology were to be
       unavailable for any sustained period of time, how would it
       impact the business?
       Additional concepts related to backup include the following:

          Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). A UPS provides
             battery backup to critical components of the system, allowing
             them to stay online longer and/or allowing the IT staff to shut
             them down using proper procedures in order to prevent data
             loss that might occur from a power failure.

          Alternate, or "hot" sites. Some organizations choose to
             have an alternate site where an exact replica of their critical
             data is always kept up to date. When the primary site goes
             down, the alternate site is immediately brought online so
             that little or no downtime is experienced.

       As information has become a strategic asset, a whole industry has
       sprung up around the technologies necessary for implementing a
       proper backup strategy. A company can contract with a service

       provider to back up all of their data or they can purchase large
       amounts of online storage space and do it themselves. Technologies
       such as Storage Area Networks (SAN) and archival systems are
       now used by most large businesses for data backup.

Firewalls

       Diagram of a network configuration with firewalls, a router, and a DMZ.
            Firewalls are another method that an organization can use for

       increasing security on its network. A firewall can exist as hardware
       or software, or both. A hardware firewall is a device that is
       connected to the network and filters the packets based on a set of
       rules. One example of these rules would be preventing packets
       entering the local network that come from unauthorized users. A
       software firewall runs on the operating system and intercepts
       packets as they arrive to a computer.
       A firewall protects all company servers and computers by stopping
       packets from outside the organization's network that do not meet a
       strict set of criteria. A firewall may also be configured to restrict the
       flow of packets leaving the organization. This may be done to
       eliminate the possibility of employees watching YouTube videos or
       using Facebook from a company computer.
       A demilitarized zone (DMZ) implements multiple firewalls as part of
       network security configuration, creating one or more sections of their
       network that are partially secured. The DMZ typically contains
       resources that need broader access but still need to be secured.

Intrusion Detection Systems

            Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can be placed on the network
       for security purposes. An IDS does not add any additional security.
       Instead, it provides the capability to identify if the network is being
       attacked. An IDS can be configured to watch for specific types of
       activities and then alert security personnel if that activity occurs. An
       IDS can also log various types of traffic on the network for analysis
       later. It is an essential part of any good security system.

              Networks

            Using firewalls and other security technologies, organizations
       can effectively protect many of their information resources by
       making them invisible to the outside world. But what if an employee
       working from home requires access to some of these resources?
       What if a consultant is hired who needs to do work on the internal
       corporate network from a remote location? In these cases, a Virtual
       Private Network (VPN) is needed.

                   Ludovic.ferre.

            A VPN allows a user who is outside of a corporate network to take
       a detour around the firewall and access the internal network from the
       outside. Through a combination of software and security measures, a
       VPN provides off-site access to the organization's network while
       ensuring overall security.
       The Internet cloud is essentially an insecure channel through which
       people communicate to various web sites/servers.
       Implementing a VPN results in a secure pathway, usually referred
       to as a tunnel, through the insecure cloud, virtually guaranteeing
       secure access to the organization's resources. The diagram
       represents security by way of the functionality of a VPN as it
       "tunnels" through the insecure Internet Cloud. Notice that the
       remote user is given access to the organization's intranet, as if the
       user was physically located within the intranet.

Physical Security

         An organization can implement the best authentication scheme
       in the world, develop superior access control, and install
       firewalls and intrusion detection, but its security cannot be
       complete without implementation of physical security. Physical
       security is the protection of the actual hardware and networking
       components that store and transmit information resources. To
       implement physical security, an organization must identify all of
       the vulnerable resources and take measures to ensure that these
       resources cannot be physically tampered with or stolen. These
       measures include the following.

          Locked doors. It may seem obvious, but all the security in the
             world is useless if an intruder can simply walk in and
             physically remove a computing device. High value
             information assets should be secured in a location with limited
             access.

          Physical intrusion detection. High value information
             assets should be monitored through the use of security
             cameras and other means to detect unauthorized access to
             the physical locations where they exist.

          Secured equipment. Devices should be locked down to
             prevent them from being stolen. One employee's hard drive
             could contain all of your customer information, so it is
             essential that it be secured.

          Environmental monitoring. An organization's servers and
             other high value equipment should always be kept in a
             room that is monitored for temperature, humidity, and
             airflow. The risk of a server failure rises when these factors
             exceed acceptable ranges.

          Employee training. One of the most common ways thieves
             steal corporate information is the theft of employee laptops
             while employees are traveling. Employees should be trained
             to secure their equipment whenever they are away from the
             office.

Security Policies

            Besides the technical controls listed above, organizations also
       need to implement security policies as a form of administrative
       control. In fact, these policies should really be a starting point in
       developing an overall security plan. A good information security
       policy lays out the guidelines for employee use of the information
       resources of the company and provides the company recourse in the
       event that an employee violates a policy.
       According to the SANS Institute, a good policy is "a formal, brief,
       and high-level statement or plan that embraces an organization's
       general beliefs, goals, objectives, and acceptable procedures for a
       specified subject area." Policies require compliance. Failure to
       comply with a policy will result in disciplinary action. A policy does
       not list the specific technical details, instead it focuses on the
       desired results. A security policy should be based on the guiding
       principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.4 Web use is
       a familiar example of a security policy. A web use policy lays out the
       responsibilities of company employees as they use company resources
       to access the Internet. A good example of a web use policy is included
       in Harvard University's "Computer Rules and Responsibilities"
       policy, which can be found here.
       A security policy should also address any governmental or industry
       regulations that apply to the organization. For example, if the
       organization is a university, it must be aware of the Family Educational
       Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which restricts access to student
       information. Health care organizations are obligated to

       follow several regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability
       and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
       A good resource for learning more about security policies is the SANS
       Institute's Information Security Policy Page.

    Sidebar: Mobile Security

            As the use of mobile devices such as laptops and smartphones
       proliferate, organizations must be ready to address the unique
       security concerns that the use of these devices bring. One of the
       first questions an organization must consider is whether to allow
       mobile devices in the workplace at all. Many employees already
       have these devices, so the question becomes: Should we allow
       employees to bring their own devices and use them as part of
       their employment activities? Or should we provide the devices
       to our employees? Creating a BYOD ("Bring Your Own Device")
       policy allows employees to integrate themselves more fully into
       their job and can bring higher employee satisfaction and
       productivity. In many cases, it may be virtually impossible to
       prevent employees from having their own smartphones or
       laptops in the workplace. If the organization provides the devices
       to its employees, it gains more control over use of the devices,
       but it also increases the burden of having to administrate
       distribution and use.
       Mobile devices can pose many unique security challenges to an
       organization. Probably one of the biggest concerns is theft of
       intellectual property. For an employee with malicious intent, it
       would be a very simple process to connect a mobile device either to
       a computer via the USB port, or wirelessly to the corporate network,
       and download confidential data. It would also be easy to secretly
       take a high-quality picture using a built-in camera.

       When an employee does have permission to access and save

       company data on his or her device, a different security threat
       emerges. Namely, that device now becomes a target for thieves.
       Theft of mobile devices (in this case, including laptops) is one of
       the primary methods that data thieves use.
       So, what can be done to secure mobile devices? Begin with a good
       policy regarding their use. According to a 2013 SANS study,
       organizations should consider developing a mobile device policy
       that addresses the following issues: use of the camera, use of voice
       recording, application purchases, encryption at rest, Wi-Fi auto
       connect settings, Bluetooth settings, VPN use, password settings,
       lost or stolen device reporting, and backup. 5
       Besides policies, there are several different tools that an
       organization can use to mitigate some of these risks. For example,
       if a device is stolen or lost, geolocation software can help the
       organization find it. In some cases, it may even make sense to install
       remote data removal software, which will remove data from a
       device if it becomes a security risk.

Usability

            When looking to secure information resources, organizations
       must balance the need for security with users' needs to
       effectively access and use these resources. If a system's security
       measures make it difficult to use, then users will find ways around
       the security, which may make the system more vulnerable than
       it would have been without the security measures. Consider
       password policies. If the organization requires an extremely long
       password with several

       us, as individual users, can take to secure our computing
       technologies. There is no way to have 100% security, but there are

   advisable not to access your financial or personal data
   while attached to a Wi-Fi hotspot. You should also be
   aware that connecting USB flash drives to your device
   could also put you at risk.

 Do not attach an unfamiliar flash drive to your device unless
you can scan it first with your security software.

          Backup your data. Just as organizations need to backup
             their data, individuals need to so as well. The same rules
             apply. Namely, do it regularly and keep a copy of it in
             another location. One simple solution for this is to set up an
             account with an online backup service to automate your
             backups.

          Secure your accounts with two-factor authentication. Most
             e-mail and social media providers now have a two-factor
             authentication option. When you log in to your account from
             an unfamiliar computer for the first time, it sends you a text
             message with a code that you must enter to confirm that you
             are really you. This means that no one else can log in to your
             accounts without knowing your password and having your
             mobile phone with them.

          Make your passwords long, strong, and unique. Your
             personal passwords should follow the same rules that are
             recommended for organizations. Your passwords should be
             long (at least 12 random characters) and contain at least two
             of the following: uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and
             special characters. Passwords should not include words that
             could be tied to your personal information, such as the name
             of your pet. You also should use different passwords for
             different accounts, so that if someone steals your password
             for one account, they still are locked out of your other
             accounts.

          Be suspicious of strange links and attachments. When you
             receive an e-mail, tweet, or Facebook post, be suspicious of
             any links or attachments included there. Do not click on the
             link directly if you are at all suspicious. Instead, if you want to
             access the website, find it yourself with your browser and
             navigate to it directly. The I Love You virus was distributed

Summary

            As computing and networking resources have become more an
       integral part of business, they have also become a target of
       criminals. Organizations must be vigilant with the way they protect
       their resources. The same holds true for individuals. As digital
       devices become more intertwined in everyone's life, it becomes
       crucial for each person to understand how to protect themselves.

        1. The Caesar Cipher. One of the oldest methods of encryption
             was used by Julius Caesar and involved simply shifting text a
             specified number of positions in the alphabet. The number of
             shifted positions is known as the key. So, a key = 3 would
             encrypt ZOO to CRR. Decrypt the following message which
             has a key = 3: FRPSXWHU

        2. The Vigenere Cipher. This cipher was used as recently as the
             Civil War by the Confederate forces. The key is slightly more
             complex than the Caesar Cipher. Vigenere used the number of
             letters after `A' for his key. For example, if the key = COD,
             the first letter in the cypher is shifted 2 characters (because
             "C" is 2 letters after the letter `A'), the second letter is shifted
             14 letters (O being 14 letters after `A'), and the third letter is
             shifted 3 letters (D being 3 letters after `A'). Then the pattern
             is repeated for subsequent letters. Decrypt the following
             message which has a key = COD: YSPGSWCHGCKQ

        3. Frequency and Pattern Analysis. If you've ever watched
             Wheel of Fortune you know that contestants look for patterns
             and frequencies in trying to solve a puzzle. Your job in this
             lab is to analyze letter frequency and letter patterns to
             determine the plaintext message which in this case is a single
             word. The key is a simple substitution where the same letter in
             plaintext always results in the same letter in the cyphertext.
             The most frequently used letters in the English language are:
             E, A, O, I, T, S, N. Pattern analysis includes knowing words
             that have double letters such as "school." Other patterns
             include "ing" at the end of a word, "qu" and "th" as a pair of
             letters. Cyphertext = CAGGJ. What is the key and the
             plaintext?

   Chapter 7: Does IT Matter?

              Upon successful completion of this chapter, you
              will be able to:
               Define the productivity paradox and explain

                     the current thinking on this topic;
               Evaluate Carr's argument in "Does IT

                     businesses with competitive advantage.

            Introduction

            For over fifty years, computing technology has been a part of
       business. Organizations have spent trillions of dollars on
       information technologies. But has all this investment in IT made
       a difference? Have there been increases in productivity? Are
       companies that invest in IT more competitive? This chapter looks
       at the value IT can bring to an organization and attempts to answer

       these questions. Two important works in the past two decades
       have attempted to address this issue.

    The Productivity Paradox

            In 1991, Erik Brynjolfsson wrote an article, published in
       the Communications of the ACM, entitled "The Productivity
       Paradox of Information Technology: Review and Assessment."
       After reviewing studies about the impact of IT investment on
       productivity, Brynjolfsson concluded that the addition of
       information technology to business had not improved productivity
       at all. He called this the "productivity paradox." While he did not
       draw any specific conclusions from his work, 1 he did provide the
       following analysis.

       Although it is too early to conclude that IT's productivity
       contribution has been subpar, a paradox remains in our inability
       to unequivocally document any contribution after so much effort.
       The various explanations that have been proposed can be
       grouped into four categories:

                         1) Mismeasurement of outputs and inputs
                         2) Lags due to learning and adjustment
                         3) Redistribution and dissipation of profits
                         4) Mismanagement of information and technology

       In 1998, Brynjolfsson and Lorin Hitt published a follow-up paper
       entitled "Beyond the Productivity Paradox [2] In this paper, the
       authors utilized new data that had been collected and found that IT
       did, indeed, provide a positive result for businesses. Further, they
       found that sometimes the true advantages in using technology were
       not directly relatable to higher productivity, but to "softer"
       measures, such as the impact on organizational structure. They also
       found that the impact of information technology can vary widely

       between companies.

         IT Doesn't Matter

            Just as a consensus was forming about the value of IT, the
       Internet stock market bubble burst. Two years later in 2003,
       Harvard professor Nicholas Carr wrote his article "IT Doesn't
       Matter" in the Harvard Business Review. In this article Carr
       asserted that as information technology had become ubiquitous, it
       has also become less of a differentiator, much like a commodity.
       Products that have the same features and are virtually
       indistinguishable are considered to be commodities. Price and
       availability typically become the only discriminators when
       selecting a source for a commodity. In Carr's view all information
       technology was the same, delivering the same value regardless of
       price or supplier. Carr suggested that since IT is essentially a
       commodity, it should be managed like one. Just select the one with
       the lowest cost this is most easily accessible. He went on to say IT
       management should see themselves as a utility within the company
       and work to keep costs down. For Carr IT's goal is to provide the
       best service with minimal downtime. Carr saw no competitive
       advantage to be gained through information technology.
       As you can imagine, this article caused quite an uproar, especially
       from IT companies. Many articles were written in defense of IT
       while others supported Carr. In 2004 Carr released a book based on
       the article entitled Does IT Matter? A year later he was interviewed
       by CNET on the topic "IT still doesn't matter." Click here to watch
       the video of Carr being interviewed about his book on CNET.
       Probably the best thing to come out of the article and subsequent
       book were discussions on the place of IT in a business strategy, and

       exactly what role IT could play in competitive advantage. That is
       the question to be addressed in this chapter.

     Competitive Advantage

            What does it mean when a company has a competitive
       advantage? What are the factors that play into it? Michael Porter in
       his book Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior
       Performance writes that a company is said to have a competitive
       advantage over its rivals when it is able to sustain profits that exceed
       the average for the industry. According to Porter, there are two
       primary methods for obtaining competitive advantage: cost
       advantage and differentiation advantage. 2 So, the question for I.T.
       becomes: How can information technology be a factor in one or both of
       these methods?
       The following sections address this question by using two of
       Porter's analysis tools: the value chain and the five forces model.
       Porter's analysis in his 2001 article "Strategy and the Internet,"
       which examines the impact of the Internet on business strategy and
       competitive advantage, will be used to shed further light on the role
       of information technology in gaining competitive advantage.3

The Value Chain

        Diagram of Porter's Value Chain (click to enlarge)

            In his book Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining
       Performance Porter describes exactly how a company can create
       value and therefore profit. Value is built through the value chain: a

       series of activities undertaken by the company to produce a product
       or service. Each step in the value chain contributes to the overall
       value of a product or service. While the value chain may not be a
       perfect model for every type of company, it does provide a way to
       analyze just how a company is producing value. The value chain is
       made up of two sets of activities: primary activities and support
       activities. An explanation of these activities and a discussion of how
       information technology can play a role in creating value by
       contributing to cost advantage or differentiation advantage appears
       next.

       Primary activities are the functions that directly impact the
       creation of a product or service. The goal of a primary activity is
       to add value that is greater than the cost of that activity. The
       primary activities are:

          Inbound logistics. These are the processes that bring in
             raw materials and other needed inputs. Information
             technology can be used to make these processes more
             efficient, such as with supply-chain management systems
             which allow the suppliers to manage their own inventory.

          Operations. Any part of a business that converts the raw
             materials into a final product or service is a part of operations.
             From manufacturing to business process management
             (covered in Chapter 8), information technology can be used to
             provide more efficient processes and increase innovation
             through flows of information.

          Outbound logistics. These are the functions required to get
             the product out to the customer. As with inbound logistics, IT
             can be used here to improve processes, such as allowing for
             real-time inventory checks. IT can also be a delivery
             mechanism itself.

          Sales/Marketing. The functions that will entice buyers to
             purchase the products are part of sales and marketing.
             Information technology is used in almost all aspects of this
             activity. From online advertising to online surveys, IT can be
             used to innovate product design and reach customers as never

             before. The company website can be a sales channel itself.

          Service. Service activity involves the functions a business
             performs after the product has been purchased to maintain and
             enhance the product's value. Service can be enhanced via
             technology as well, including support services through
             websites and knowledge bases.

       The support activities are the functions in an organization that
       support all of the primary activities. Support activities can be
       considered indirect costs to the organization. The support activities
       are:

          Firm infrastructure. An organization's infrastructure
             includes finance, accounting, ERP systems (covered in
             Chapter 9) and quality control. All of these depend on
             information technology and represent functions where I.T. can
             have a positive impact.

          Human Resource Management Human Resource
             Management (HRM) consists of recruiting, hiring, and other
             services needed to attract and retain employees. Using the
             Internet, HR departments can increase their reach when
             looking for candidates. I.T. also allows employees to use
             technology for a more flexible work environment.

          Technology development. Technology development provides
             innovation that supports primary activities. These advances
             are integrated across the firm to add value in a variety of
             departments. Information technology is the primary
             generator of value in this support activity.

          Procurement. Procurement focuses on the acquisition of
             raw materials used in the creation of products. Business-to-
             business e-commerce can be used to improve the
             acquisition of materials.

       This analysis of the value chain provides some insight into how
       information technology can lead to competitive advantage. Another
       important concept from Porter is the "Five Forces Model."

                                                         Porter developed the Five
                                                         Forces model as a framework
                                                         for industry analysis. This
                                                         model can be used to help
                                                         understand the degree of
       competition in an industry and analyze its strengths and
       weaknesses. The model consists of five

       elements, each of which plays a role in determining the average
       profitability of an industry. In 2001 Porter wrote an article entitled
       "Strategy and the Internet," in which he takes this model and looks
       at how the Internet impacts the profitability of an industry. Below
       is a quick summary of each of the Five Forces and the impact of the
       Internet.

          Threat of substitute products or services. The first force
             challenges the user to consider the likelihood of another
             produce or service replacing the product or service you offer.
             The more types of products or services there are that can meet
             a particular need, the less profitability there will be in an
             industry. In the communications industry, the smartphone has
             largely replaced the pager. In some construction projects,
             metal studs have replaced wooden studs for framing. The
             Internet has made people more aware of substitute products,
             driving down industry profits in those industries in which
             substitution occurs. Please notice that substitution refers to a
             product being replaced by a similar product for the purpose of
             accomplishing the same task. It does not mean dissimilar
             products or services such as flying to a destination rather than
             traveling by rail.

          Bargaining power of suppliers. A supplier's bargaining
             power is strong when there are few suppliers from which your
             company can obtain a needed product or service. Conversely,
             when they are many suppliers their bargaining power is lower
             since your company would have many sources from which to
             source a product. When your company has several suppliers to

             choose from, you can negotiate a lower price. When a sole
             supplier exists, then your company is at the mercy of the
             supplier. For example, if only one company makes the
             controller chip for a car engine, that company can control the
             price, at least to some extent. The Internet has given
             companies access to more suppliers, driving down prices.

          Bargaining power of customers. A customer's bargaining
             power is strong when your company along with your
             competitors is attempting to provide the same product to this
             customer. In this instance the customer has many sources
             from which to source a product so they can approach your
             company and seek a price reduction. If there are few suppliers
             in your industry, then the customer's bargaining power is
             considered low.

          Barriers to entry. The easier it is to enter an industry, the
             more challenging it will be to make a profit in that industry.
             Imagine you are considering starting a lawn mowing business.
             The entry barrier is very low since all you need is a lawn
             mower. No special skills or licenses are required. However,
             this means your neighbor next door may decide to start
             mowing lawns also, resulting in increased competition. In
             contrast a highly technical industry such as manufacturing of
             medical devices has numerous barriers to entry. You would
             need to find numerous suppliers for various components, hire
             a variety of highly skilled engineers, and work closely with
             the Food and Drug Administration to secure approval for the
             sale of your products. In this example the barriers to entry are
             very high so you should expect few competitors.

          Rivalry among existing competitors: Rivalry among
             existing competitors helps you evaluate your entry into the
             market. When rivalry is fierce, each competitor is
             attempting to gain additional market share from the others.
             This can result in aggressive pricing, increasing customer
             support, or other factors which might lure a customer away
             from a competitor. Markets in which rivalry is low may be
             easier to enter and become profitable sooner because all of

             the competitors are accepting of each other's presence.
       Porter's five forces are used to analyze an industry to determine the
       average profitability of a company within that industry. Adding in
       Porter's analysis of the Internet to his Five Forces results in the
       realization that technology has lowered overall profitability. 4

  Using Information Systems for
      Competitive Advantage

            Having learned about Porter's Five Forces and their impact on a
       firm's ability to generate a competitive advantage, it is time to look
       at some examples of competitive advantage. A strategic information
       system is designed specifically to implement an organizational
       strategy meant to provide a competitive advantage. These types of
       information systems began popping up in the 1980s, as noted in a
       paper by Charles Wiseman entitled "Creating Competitive
       Weapons from Information Systems."5
       A strategic information system attempts to do one or more of the
       following:

          Deliver a product or a service at a lower cost;
          Deliver a product or service that is differentiated;
          Help an organization focus on a specific market segment;
          Enable innovation.
       Here are some examples of information systems that fall into this
       category.

In their book, IT Doesn't Matter - Business Processes Do, Howard
Smith and Peter Fingar argue that it is the integration of information
systems with business processes that leads to competitive
advantage. The authors state that Carr's article is dangerous because
it gave CEOs and IT managers approval to start cutting their
technology budgets, putting their companies in peril. True
competitive advantage can be found with information systems that
support business processes. Chapter 8 focuses on the use of business
processes for competitive advantage.

Electronic Data Interchange

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) provides a competitive

advantage through integrating the supply chain electronically. EDI

can be thought of as the computer-to-computer exchange of business

documents in a standard electronic format between business

partners. By integrating suppliers and distributors via EDI, a

company can vastly reduce the resources required to manage the

relevant information. Instead of manually ordering supplies, the

company can simply place an order via the computer and the

products are ordered.

Collaborative Systems

            As organizations began to implement networking technologies,
       information systems emerged that allowed employees to begin
       collaborating in different ways. These systems allowed users to
       brainstorm ideas together without the necessity of physical, face-
       to-face meetings. Tools such as video conferencing with Skype or
       WebEx, collaboration and document sharing with Microsoft
       SharePoint, and project management with SAP's Project System
       make collaboration possible in a variety of endeavors.

       Broadly speaking, any software that allows multiple users to
       interact on a document or topic could be considered collaborative.
       Electronic mail, a shared Word document, and social networks fall
       into this broad definition. However, many software tools have been
       created that are designed specifically for collaborative purposes.
       These tools offer a broad spectrum of collaborative functions. Here
       is just a short list of some collaborative tools available for
       businesses today:

          Google Drive. Google Drive offers a suite of office
             applications (such as a word processor, spreadsheet,
             drawing, presentation) that can be shared between
             individuals. Multiple users can edit the documents at the
             same time and the threaded comments option is available.

          Microsoft SharePoint. SharePoint integrates with Microsoft
             Office and allows for collaboration using tools most office
             workers are familiar with. SharePoint was covered in greater
             detail in chapter 5.

          Cisco WebEx. WebEx combines video and audio
             communications and allows participants to interact with
             each other's computer desktops. WebEx also provides a
             shared whiteboard and the capability for text-based chat to
             be going on during the sessions, along with many other
             features. Mobile editions of WebEx allow for full

Decision Support Systems

            A decision support system (DSS) helps an organization make a
       specific decision or set of decisions. DSSs can exist at different
       levels of decision-making within the organization, from the CEO
       to first level managers. These systems are designed to take inputs
       regarding a known (or partially-known) decision making process
       and provide the information necessary to make a decision. DSSs
       generally assist a management level person in the decision-making
       process, though some can be designed to automate decision-
       making.
       An organization has a wide variety of decisions to make, ranging
       from highly structured decisions to unstructured decisions. A
       structured decision is usually one that is made quite often, and one
       in which the decision is based directly on the inputs. With structured
       decisions, once you know the necessary information you also know
       the decision that needs to be made. For example, inventory reorder
       levels can be structured decisions. Once your inventory of widgets
       gets below a specific threshold, automatically reorder ten more.
       Structured decisions are good candidates for automation, but
       decision-support systems are generally not built for them.
       An unstructured decision involves a lot of unknowns. Many times,
       unstructured decisions are made for the first time. An information
       system can support these types of decisions by providing the
       decision makers with information gathering tools and collaborative
       capabilities. An example of an unstructured decision might be
       dealing with a labor issue or setting policy for the
       implementation of a new technology.
       Decision support systems work best when the decision makers are
       having to make semi-structured decisions. A semi-structured

decision is one in which most of the factors needed for making the
decision are known but human experience and other outside factors
may still impact the decision. A good example of a semi-structured
decision would be diagnosing a medical condition (see sidebar).

As with collaborative systems, DSSs can come in many different
formats. A nicely designed spreadsheet that allows for input of
specific variables and then calculates required outputs could be
considered a DSS. Another DSS might be one that assists in
determining which products a company should develop. Input
into the system could include market research on the product,
competitor information, and product development costs. The
system would then analyze these inputs based on the specific
rules and concepts programmed into it. The system would report
its results with recommendations and/or key indicators to be used
in making a decision. A DSS can be looked at as a tool for
competitive advantage because it can give an organization a
mechanism to make wise decisions about products and
innovations.

            A discussed in the text, DSSs are best applied to semi- structured
       decisions, in which most of the needed inputs are known but human
       experience and environmental factors also play a role. A good
       example for today is Isabel, a health care DSS. The creators of
       Isabel explain how it works:
       Isabel uses the information routinely captured during your
       workup, whether free text or structured data, and instantaneously
       provides a diagnosis checklist for review. The checklist contains
       a list of possible diagnoses with critical "Don't Miss Diagnoses"
       flagged. When integrated into your Electronic Medical Records
       (EMR) system, Isabel can provide "one click" seamless diagnosis
       support with no additional data entry. 6

 Investing in IT for Competitive
             Advantage

            In 2008, Brynjolfsson and McAfee published a study in the
       Harvard Business Review on the role of IT in competitive
       advantage, entitled "Investing in the IT That Makes a Competitive
       Difference." Their study confirmed that IT can play a role in
       competitive advantage if deployed wisely. In their study, they drew
       three conclusions7:

                  First, the data show that IT has sharpened differences
                    among companies instead of reducing them. This reflects
                    the fact that while companies have always varied widely
                    in their ability to select, adopt, and exploit innovations,
                    technology has accelerated and amplified these
                    differences.

                  Second, good management matters. Highly qualified
                    vendors, consultants, and IT departments might be

                    necessary for the successful implementation of
                    enterprise technologies themselves, but the real value
                    comes from the process innovations that can now be
                    delivered on those platforms. Fostering the right
                    innovations and propagating them widely are both
                    executive responsibilities - ones that can't be
                    delegated.
                  Finally, the competitive shakeup brought on by IT is not
                    nearly complete, even in the IT-intensive US economy.
                    You can expect to see these altered competitive
                    dynamics in other countries, as well, as their IT
                    investments grow.

       Information systems can be used for competitive advantage, but
       they must be used strategically. Organizations must understand how
       they want to differentiate themselves and then use all the elements
       of information systems (hardware, software, data, people, and
       process) to accomplish that differentiation.

Summary

       Information systems are integrated into all components of
       business today, but can they bring competitive advantage? Over
       the years, there have been many answers to this question. Early
       research could not draw any connections between IT and
       profitability, but later studies have shown that the impact can be
       positive. IT is not a panacea. Just purchasing and installing the
       latest technology will not by itself make a company more
       successful. Instead, the combination of the right technologies and
       good management will give a company the best chance for a
       positive result.

       ways do processes have a role in business? This chapter looks to
       answer those questions and also describe how business processes
       can be used for strategic advantage.

  What Is a Business Process?

            We have all heard the term process before, but what exactly
       does it mean? A process is a series of tasks that are completed in
       order to accomplish a goal. A business process, therefore, is a
       process that is focused on achieving a goal for a business.
       Processes are something that businesses go through every day in
       order to accomplish their mission. The better their processes, the
       more effective the business. Some businesses see their processes
       as a strategy for achieving competitive advantage. A process that
       achieves its goal in a unique way can set a company apart. A
       process that eliminates costs can allow a company to lower its
       prices (or retain more profit). If you have worked in a business
       setting, you have participated in a business process. Anything
       from a simple process for making a sandwich at Subway to
       building a space shuttle utilizes one or more business processes.
       In the context of information systems, a business process is a set
       of business activities performed by human actors and/or the
       information system to accomplish a specific outcome.

Documenting a Process

            Every day each of us will perform many processes without
       even thinking about them such as getting ready for work, using
       an ATM, texting a friend, etc. As processes grow more complex,
       documenting becomes necessary. It is essential for businesses to
       do this because it allows them to ensure control over how
       activities are undertaken in their organization. It also allows for

       standardization. For example, McDonald's has the same process for
       building a Big Mac in all of its restaurants. The simplest way to
       document a process is to just create a list. The list shows each step
       in the process. Each step can be checked off upon completion. A
       simple process such as how to create an account on Gmail might
       look like this:

        1. Go to gmail.com.
        2. Click "Create account."
        3. Enter your contact information in the "Create your Google

             Account" form.
        4. Choose your username and password.
        5. Agree to User Agreement and Privacy Policy by clicking on

             "Submit."
       For processes that are not so straightforward, documenting all of
       the steps as a checklist may not be sufficient. For example, here
       is the process for determining if an article for a term needs to be
       added to Wikipedia:

        1. Search Wikipedia to determine if the term already exists.
        2. If the term is found, then an article is already written, so you

             must think of another term. Go to step 1.
        3. If the term is not found, then look to see if there is a related

             term.
        4. If there is a related term, then create a redirect.
        5. If there is not a related term, then create a new article.

       This procedure is relatively simple. In fact, it has the same
       number of steps as the previous example, but because it has some
       decision points, it is more difficult to track as a simple list. In
       these cases, it may make more sense to use a diagram to
       document the process.

Business Process Modeling
Notation

            A diagramming tool for documentation of business process is a
       formalized visual language that provides systems analysts with the
       ability to describe the business processes unambiguously, to
       visualize the business processes for systematic understanding,
       and to communicate the business process for business process
       management. Natural languages (e.g., English) are incapable to
       explain complex business processes. Diagrams have been used
       as tools for business process modeling in the information systems
       field. There have been many types of business process
       diagramming tools, and each of them has its own style and syntax
       to serve its particular purpose. The most commonly used
       business process diagramming tools are Business Process
       Modeling Notation (BPMN), Data Flow Diagram (DFD), and the
       Unified Modeling Language (UML).

       BPMN is an extension of the traditional flowchart method by
       adding more diagramming elements for descriptions of business

       process. The objective of BPMN is to support business process
       documentation by providing intuitive notations for business rules.
       The flowchart style diagrams in BPMN can provide detailed
       specifications business processes from start to end. However,
       BPMN is short of the ability of system decomposition for large
       information systems. DFD has served as a foundation of many
       other tools of documentation of business process. The central
       concept of DFD is a top-down approach to understanding a
       system. The top-down approach is consistent with the system
       concept that views a system in a holistic manner and concerns an
       understanding of a system by examining the components and
       their interactions within the system. More importantly, while
       describing a business process by using DFD, the data stores used
       in the process and generated data flows in the process are also
       defined. We will provide an example of DFD in the Sidebar
       section of this chapter to illustrate the integration of data and
       business tasks in documenting a business process.

       The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose
       modeling tool in the field of software engineering for constructing
       all types of computerized systems. UML includes a set of various
       types of diagrams with different subjects of modeling and
       diversified graphics styles. The diversified diagrams in UML can
       provide detailed specifications for software engineering in many
       perspectives for construction of information systems, but could be
       too complicated for documenting business processes from the
       perspective of business process management.

Managing Business Process Documentation

         As organizations begin to document their processes, it becomes an
       administrative responsibility to keep track of them. As processes
       change and improve, it is important to know which processes are
       the most recent. It is also important to manage the process so that it
       can be easily updated. The requirement to manage process
       documentation has been one of the driving forces behind the
       creation of the document management system. A document

       management system stores and tracks documents and supports the
       following functions.

          Versions and timestamps. The document management
             system will keep multiple versions of documents. The most
             recent version of a document is easy to identify and will be
             considered the default.

          Approvals and workflows. When a process needs to be
             changed, the system will manage both access to the
             documents for editing and the routing of the document for
             approval.

          Communication. When a process changes, those who
             implement the process need to be made aware of the
             changes. The document management system will notify the
             appropriate people when a change to a document has been
             approved.

       Of course, document management systems are not only used for
       managing business process documentation. Many other types of
       documents are managed in these systems, such as legal
       documents or design documents.

       are some of the main components of an ERP system.
       Computer program. The system is a computer program, which
       means that it has been developed with specific logic and rules
       behind it. It is customized and installed to work specifically for an
       individual organization.

               Centralized database.
                  All data in an ERP
                  system is stored in a
                  single, central database.
                  Centralization is key to
                  the success of an ERP. Data
                  entered in one part of the
                  company can be immediately
                  available to other parts of the company.

                 Used to run an entire company. An ERP can be used to
                    manage an entire organization's operations. Companies
                    can purchase modules for an ERP that represent different
                    functions within the organization such as finance,
                    manufacturing, and sales. Some companies choose to
                    purchase many modules, others choose a subset of the
                    modules.

         An ERP system not only centralizes an organization's data, but
       the processes it enforces are the processes the organization has
       adopted. When an ERP vendor designs a module, it has to
       implement the rules for the associated business processes. Best
       practices can be built into the ERP - a major selling point for
       ERP. In other words, when an organization implements an ERP,
       it also gets improved best practices as part of the deal.
       For many organizations the implementation of an ERP system is an
       excellent opportunity to improve their business practices and
       upgrade their software at the same time. But for others an ERP
       brings a challenge. Is the process embedded in the ERP really better
       than the process they are currently utilizing? And if they implement
       this ERP and it happens to be the same one that all of their
       competitors have, will they simply become more like them, making
       it much more difficult to differentiate themselves? A large
       organization may have one version of the ERP, then acquire a

       subsidiary which has a more recent version. Imagine the challenge
       of requiring the subsidiary to change back to the earlier version.
       One of the criticisms of ERP systems has been that they
       commoditize business processes, driving all businesses to use the
       same processes and thereby lose their uniqueness. The good
       news is that ERP systems also have the capability to be
       configured with custom processes. For organizations that want
       to continue using their own processes or even design new ones,
       ERP systems offer customization so the ERP is unique to the
       organization.

       There is a drawback to customizing an ERP system. Namely,
       organizations have to maintain the changes themselves.
       Whenever an update to the ERP system comes out, any
       organization that has created a custom process will be required
       to add that change to their new ERP version. This requires
       someone to maintain a listing of these changes as well as re-
       testing the system every time an upgrade is made. Organizations
       will have to wrestle with this decision. When should they go
       ahead and accept the best-practice processes built into the ERP
       system and when should they spend the resources to develop
       their own processes?
       Some of the best-known ERP vendors are SAP, Microsoft, and
       Oracle.

       processes will also create structures to manage those processes.
       Business process management (BPM) can be thought of as an
       intentional effort to plan, document, implement, and distribute an
       organization's business processes with the support of information
       technology.

       BPM is more than just automating some simple steps. While
       automation can make a business more efficient, it cannot be used
       to provide a competitive advantage. BPM, on the other hand, can
       be an integral part of creating that advantage.

       Not all of an organization's processes should be managed this way.
       An organization should look for processes that are essential to the
       functioning of the business and those that may be used to bring a
       competitive advantage. The best processes to look at are those that
       include employees from multiple departments, those that require
       decision-making that cannot be easily automated, and processes that
       change based on circumstances. Here is an example.

       Suppose a large clothing retailer is looking to gain a competitive
       advantage through superior customer service. A task force is
       created to develop a state-of-the-art returns policy that allows
       customers to return any article of clothing, no questions asked. The
       organization also decides that, in order to protect the competitive
       advantage that this returns policy will bring, they will develop their
       own customization to their ERP system to implement this returns
       policy. In preparation for the rollout of the system, all customer
       service employees are trained, showing how to use the new system
       and specifically how to process returns. Once the updated returns
       process is implemented, the organization will be able to measure
       several key indicators about returns that will allow them to adjust
       the policy as needed. For example, if it is determined that many
       women are returning their high-end dresses after wearing them
       once, they could implement a change to the process that limits the
       return period to 14 days from the original purchase date. As changes
       to the returns policy are made, the changes are rolled out via internal
       communications and updates to the returns processing on the
       system are made.

       If done properly, business process management will provide several

       key benefits to an organization, which can be used to contribute to
       competitive advantage. These benefits include:

          Empowering employees. When a business process is
             designed correctly and supported with information
             technology, employees will be able to implement it on their
             own authority. In the returns policy example, an employee
             would be able to accept returns made before fourteen days or
             use the system to make determinations on what returns would
             be allowed after fourteen days.

          Built-in reporting. By building measurement into the
             programming, the organization can stay current on key
             metrics regarding their processes. In this example, these can
             be used to improve the returns process and also, ideally, to
             reduce returns.

          Enforcing best practices. As an organization implements
             processes supported by information systems, it can work to
             implement the best practices for that class of business process.
             In this example, the organization may want to require that all
             customers returning a product without a receipt show a legal
             ID. This requirement can be built into the system so that the
             return will not be processed unless a valid ID number is
             entered.

          Enforcing consistency. By creating a process and enforcing it
             with information technology, it is possible to create
             consistency across the entire organization. In this example, all
             stores in the retail chain can enforce the same returns policy.
             If the returns policy changes, the change can be instantly
             enforced across the entire chain.

Business Process Re-engineering

            As organizations look to manage their processes to gain a
       competitive advantage, it is also important to understand that

       existing ways of doing things may not be the most effective or
       efficient. A process developed in the 1950s is not going to be better
       just because it is now supported by technology.
       In 1990 Michael Hammer published an article in the Harvard
       Business Review entitled "Reengineering Work: Don't Automate,
       Obliterate." This article suggested that simply automating a bad
       process does not make it better. Instead, companies should "blow
       up" their existing processes and develop new processes that take
       advantage of the new technologies and concepts. He states in the
       introduction to the article:

       Many of our job designs, work flows, control mechanisms, and
       organizational structures came of age in a different competitive
       environment and before the advent of the computer. They are
       geared towards greater efficiency and control. Yet the watchwords
       of the new decade are innovation and speed, service, and quality.
       It is time to stop paving the cow paths. Instead of embedding
       outdated processes in silicon and software, we should obliterate
       them and start over. We should "re- engineer" our businesses: use
       the power of modern information technology to radically redesign
       our business processes in order to achieve dramatic
       improvements in their performance.1

       Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) is not just taking an
       existing process and automating it. BPR is fully understanding
       the goals of a process and then dramatically redesigning it from
       the ground up to achieve dramatic improvements in productivity
       and quality. But this is easier said than done. Most people think
       in terms of how to do small, local improvements to a process.
       Complete redesign requires thinking on a larger scale. Hammer
       provides some guidelines for how to go about doing business
       process re-engineering:

          Organize around outcomes, not tasks. This simply means
             design the process so that, if possible, one person performs all

             the steps. Instead of passing the task on to numerous people,
             one person does the entire process, resulting in greater speed
             and customer responsiveness.

          Have those who use the outcomes of the process perform
             the process. With the use of information technology many
             simple tasks are now automated so the person who needs the
             outcome should be empowered to perform it. Hammer
             provides the following example. Instead of having every
             department in the company use a purchasing department to
             order supplies, have the supplies ordered directly by those
             who need the supplies using an information system.

          Merge information processing work into the real work
             that produces the information. When one part of the
             company creates information, such as sales information or
             payment information, it should be processed by that same
             department. There is no need for one part of the company to
             process information created in another part of the company.

          Treat geographically dispersed resources as though they
             were centralized. With the communications technologies
             available today, it becomes easier than ever to focus on physical
             location. A multinational organization does not need separate
             support departments (such as IT, purchasing, etc.) for each
             location anymore.

          Link parallel activities instead of integrating their results.
             Departments that work in parallel should be sharing data and
             communicating with each other during a process instead of
             waiting until each group is done and then comparing notes.
             The outdated concept of only linking outcomes results in re-
             work, increased costs, and delays.

          Put the decision points where the work is performed, and
             build controls into the process. The people who do the work
             should have decision making authority and the process itself
             should have built-in controls using information technology.
             Today's workforce is more educated and knowledgeable than
             in the past so providing workers with information technology
             can result in the employees controlling their processes.

          Capture information at the source. Requiring information
             to be entered more than once causes delays and errors. With
             information technology, an organization can capture it once
             and then make it available whenever needed.

       These principles may seem like common sense today, but in 1990
       they took the business world by storm. Hammer gives example after
       example of how organizations improved their business processes by
       many orders of magnitude without adding any new employees,
       simply by changing how they did things (see sidebar).
       Unfortunately, business process re-engineering got a bad name
       in many organizations. This was because it was used as an excuse
       for cost cutting that really had nothing to do with BPR. For
       example, many companies simply used it as a reason for laying
       off part of their workforce. However, today many of the
       principles of BPR have been integrated into businesses and are
       considered part of good business-process management.

    Sidebar: Reengineering the
         College Bookstore

       The process of purchasing the correct textbooks in a timely manner
       for college classes has always been problematic. Now with online
       bookstores competing directly with the college bookstore for
       students' purchases, the college bookstore is under pressure to
       justify its existence.
       But college bookstores have one big advantage over their
       competitors, namely they have access to students' data. Once a
       student has registered for classes, the bookstore knows exactly what
       books that student will need for the upcoming term. To leverage this
       advantage and take advantage of new technologies, the bookstore

wants to implement a new process that will make purchasing
books through the bookstore advantageous to students. Though
they may not be able to compete on price, they can provide other
advantages such as reducing the time it takes to find the books
and the ability to guarantee that the book is the correct one for
the class. In order to do this, the bookstore will need to undertake
a process redesign.

The goal of the process redesign is simple. Capture a higher
percentage of students as customers of the bookstore. After
diagramming the existing process and meeting with student
focus groups, the bookstore comes up with a new process. In the
new process the bookstore utilizes information technology to
reduce the amount of work the students need to do in order to get
their books. In this new process the bookstore sends the students
an e-mail with a list of all the books required for their upcoming
classes. By clicking a link in this e-mail, the students can log into
the bookstore, confirm their books, and complete the purchase.
The bookstore will then deliver the books to the students. And
there is an additional benefit to the faculty: Professors are no
longer asked to delay start of semester assignments while
students wait for books to arrive in the mail. Instead, students can
be expected to promptly complete their assignments and the
course proceeds on schedule.

Cert  iI i e d

       Many organizations now claim that they are using best practices
       when it comes to business processes. In order to set themselves
       apart and prove to their customers, and potential customers, that
       they are indeed doing this, these organizations are seeking out an
       ISO 9000 certification. ISO is an acronym for International
       Standards Organization (website here). This body defines quality
       standards that organizations can implement to show that they are,
       indeed, managing business processes in an effective way. The ISO
       9000 certification is focused on quality management.

       In order to receive ISO certification, an organization must be
       audited and found to meet specific criteria. In its most simple form,
       the auditors perform the following review.

          Tell me what you do (describe the business process).

          Show me where it says that (reference the process
             documentation).

          Prove that this is what happened (exhibit evidence in
             documented records).

       Over the years, this certification has evolved and many branches
       of the certification now exist. ISO certification is one way to
       separate an organization from others. You can find out more
       about the ISO 9000 standard here.

Summary

       The advent of information technologies has had a huge impact
       on how organizations design, implement, and support business
       processes. From document management systems to ERP
       systems, information systems are tied into organizational
       processes. Using business process management, organizations
       can empower employees and leverage their processes for
       competitive advantage. Using business process reengineering,
       organizations can vastly improve their effectiveness and the
       quality of their products and services. Integrating information
       technology with business processes is one way that information
       systems can bring an organization lasting competitive advantage.

Exercises

        1. Think of a business process that you have had to perform in
             the past. How would you document this process? Would a
             diagram make more sense than a checklist? Document the
             process both as a checklist and as a diagram.

        2. Review the return policies at your favorite retailer, then
             answer this question. What information systems do you think
             would need to be in place to support their return policy?

        3. If you were implementing an ERP system, in which cases
             would you be more inclined to modify the ERP to match your
             business processes? What are the drawbacks of doing this?

        4. Which ERP is the best? Do some original research and
             compare three leading ERP systems to each other. Write a
             two- to three-page paper that compares their features.

            The opening chapters of this text focused on the technology
       behind information systems, namely hardware, software, data, and
       networking. The last chapter covered business processes and the
       key role they can play in the success of a business. This chapter
       discusses people, the last component of an information system.
       People are involved in information systems in just about every way.

   The Creators of Information
               Systems

       The first group of people to be considered play a role in designing,
       developing, and building information systems. These people are
       generally technical and have a background in programming,
       analysis, information security, or database design. Just about
       everyone who works in the creation of information systems has a
       minimum of a bachelor's degree in computer science or information
       systems, though that is not necessarily a requirement. The process
       of creating information systems will be covered in more detail in
       Chapter 10. The following chart shows the U. S. Bureau of Labor
       Statistics projections for computing career employment in 2020.

Systems Analyst

            The systems analyst straddles the divide between identifying
       business needs and imagining a new or redesigned system to

       fulfill those needs. This individual works with a team or
       department seeking to identify business requirements and
       analyze the specific details of an existing system or a system that
       needs to be built. Generally, the analyst is required to have a
       good understanding of the business itself, the purpose of the
       business, the business processes involved, and the ability to
       document them well. The analyst identifies the different
       stakeholders in the system and works to involve the appropriate
       individuals in the analysis process.

       Prior to analyzing the problem or the system of concern, the
       analyst needs to a) clearly identify the problem, b) gain approval
       for the project, c) identify the stakeholders, and d) develop a plan
       to monitor the project. The analysis phase of the project can be
       broken down into five steps.

        1. Seek out and identify the details

        2. Specify requirements

        3. Decide which requirements are most important

        4. Create a dialog showing how the user interacts with the
             existing system

        5. Ask users to critique the list of requirements that have been
             developed

       The analysis phase involves both the systems analyst and the users.
       It is important to realize the role the users take in the analysis of the
       system. Users can have significant insights into how well the
       current system functions as well as suggest improvements. Once the
       requirements are determined, the analyst begins the process of
       translating these requirements into an information systems design.
       It is important to understand which different technological solutions
       will work and provide several alternatives to the client, based on the
       company's budgetary constraints, technology constraints, and

       culture. Once the solution is selected, the analyst will create a
       detailed document describing the new system. This new
       document will require that the analyst understand how to speak
       in the technical language of systems developers.

       The design phase results in the components of the new system
       being identified, including how they relate to one another. The
       designer needs to communicate clearly with software developers
       as well database administrators by using terminology that is
       consistent with both of these specialties. The design phase of the
       project can be broken down into six steps.

        1. Design the hardware environment
        2. Design the software
        3. Design how the new system will interface with the users
        4. Design hardware interfaces
        5. Design database tables
        6. Design system security

       A systems analyst generally is not the one who does the actual
       development of the information system. The design document
       created by the systems analyst provides the detail needed to create
       the system and is handed off to a developer to actually write the
       software and to the database administrator to build the database and
       tables that will be in the database.
       Sometimes the system may be assembled from off-the-shelf
       components by a person called a systems integrator. This is a
       specific type of systems analyst that understands how to get
       different software packages to work with each other.
       To become a systems analyst, you should have a background both
       in the business analysis and in systems design. Many analysts first
       work as developers and have business experience before becoming
       system analysts. It is vital for analysts to clearly understand the
       purpose of the business of interest, realizing that all businesses are
       unique.

Programmer/Developer

            Programmers spend their time writing computer code in a

       programming language. In the case of systems development,
       programmers generally attempt to fulfill the design specifications
       given to them by a systems analyst/designer. Many different styles
       of software development exist a programmer may work alone for
       long stretches of time or work as part of a team with other
       developers. A programmer needs to be able to understand complex
       processes and also the intricacies of one or more programming
       languages.

Computer Engineer

         Computer engineers design the computing devices that are used
       every day. There are many types of computer engineers who
       work on a variety of different types of devices and systems.
       Some of the more prominent computer engineering jobs are as
       follows:

          Hardware engineer. A hardware engineer designs hardware
             and test components such as microprocessors, memory
             devices, routers, and networks. Many times, a hardware
             engineer is at the cutting edge of computing technology,
             creating something brand new. Other times, the hardware
             engineer's job is to re-engineer an existing component to
             work faster or use less power. Many times, hardware
             engineer's job is to write code to create a program that will be
             implemented directly on a computer chip.

          Software engineer. Software engineers tend to focus on a
             specific area of software such as operating systems,
             networks, applications, or databases. Software engineers
             use three primary skill areas: computer science,
             engineering, and mathematics.

          Systems engineer. A systems engineer takes the components
             designed by other engineers and makes them all work
             together, focusing on the integration of hardware and
             software. For example, to build a computer the mother board,

             processor, memory, and hard disk all have to work together. A
             systems engineer has experience with many different types of
             hardware and software and knows how to integrate them to
             create new functionality.
          Network engineer. A network engineer understands the
             networking requirements of an organization and then designs
             a communications system to meet those needs, using the
             networking hardware and software, sometimes referred to as a
             network operating system. Network engineers design both
             local area networks as well as wide area networks.

       There are many different types of computer engineers, and often
       the job descriptions overlap. While many may call themselves
       engineers based on a company job title, there is also a
       professional designation of "professional engineer" which has
       specific requirements. In the United States each state has its own
       set of requirements for the use of this title, as do different
       countries around the world. Most often, it involves a professional
       licensing exam.

 Information Systems Operations
        and Administration

            Another group of information systems professionals are
       involved in the day-to-day operations and administration of IT.
       These people must keep the systems running and up-to-date so
       that the rest of the organization can make the most effective
       use of these resources.

Computer Operator

            A computer operator is the person who oversees the mainframe

       computers and data centers in organizations. Some of their duties
       include keeping the operating systems up to date, ensuring available
       memory and disk storage, providing for redundancy (think
       electricity, connectivity to the Internet, and database backups), and
       overseeing the physical environment of the computer. Since
       mainframe computers increasingly have been replaced with servers,
       storage management systems, and other platforms, computer
       operators' jobs have grown broader and include working with these
       specialized systems.

Database Administrator

            A Database Administrator (DBA) is the person who designs and
       manages the databases for an organization. This person creates and
       maintains databases that are used as part of applications or the data
       warehouse. The DBA also consults with systems analysts and
       programmers on projects that require access to or the creation of
       databases.

Help Desk/Support Analyst

            Most mid-size to large organizations have their own
       information technology help desk. The help desk is the first line
       of support for computer users in the company. Computer users
       who are having problems or need information can contact the
       help desk for assistance. Many times, a help desk worker is a
       junior level employee who is able to answer basic issues that
       users need assistance with. Help desk analysts work with senior
       level support analysts or have a computer knowledgebase at their
       disposal to help them investigate the problem at hand. The help desk
       is a great place to break into working in IT because it exposes you
       to all of the different technologies within the company. A successful
       help desk analyst should have good communications skills and a
       sincere interest in helping users.

Trainer

            A computer trainer conducts classes to teach people specific
       computer skills. For example, if a new ERP system is being
       installed in an organization, one part of the implementation process
       is to teach all of the users how to use the new system. A trainer may
       work for a software company and be contracted to come in to
       conduct classes when needed; a trainer may work for a company
       that offers regular training sessions. Or a trainer may be employed
       full time for an organization to handle all of their computer
       instruction needs. To be successful as a trainer you need to be able
       to communicate technical concepts clearly and demonstrate
       patience with learners.

 Managing Information Systems

            The management of information-systems functions is critical
       to the success of information systems within the organization.
       Here are some of the jobs associated with the management of
       information systems.

CIO

            The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is the head of the
       information- systems function. This person aligns the plans and
       operations of the information systems with the strategic goals of the
       organization. Tasks include budgeting, strategic planning, and
       personnel decisions for the information systems function. The CIO
       must also be the face of the IT department within the organization.
       This involves working with senior leaders in all parts of the

       organization to ensure good communication, planning, and
       budgeting.
       Interestingly, the CIO position does not necessarily require a lot of
       technical expertise. While helpful, it is more important for this
       person to have good management skills and understand the
       business. Many organizations do not have someone with the title
       of CIO. Instead, the head of the information systems function is
       called the Vice President of Information Systems or Director of
       Information Systems.

Functional Manager

            As an information systems organization becomes larger, many
       of the different functions are grouped together and led by a
       manager. These functional managers' report to the CIO and manage
       the employees specific to their function. For example, in a large
       organization there are a group of systems analysts who report to a
       manager of the systems analysis function. For more insight into how
       this might look, see the discussion later in the chapter of how
       information systems are organized.

ERP Management

            Organizations using an ERP require one or more individuals to
       manage these systems. EPR managers make sure that the ERP
       system is completely up to date, work to implement any changes to
       the ERP that are needed, and consult with various user departments
       on needed reports or data extracts.

Gantt Chart for managing projects

    Information systems projects are notorious for going over
budget and being delivered late. In many cases a failed IT project
can spell doom for a company. A project manager is responsible for
keeping projects on time and on budget. This person works with the
stakeholders of the project to keep the team organized and
communicates the status of the project to management. Gantt charts,
shown above, are used to graphically illustrate a project's schedule,
tasks, and resources.

A project manager does not have authority over the project team.
Instead, the project manager coordinates schedules and resources
in order to maximize the project outcomes. This leader must be a
good communicator and an extremely organized person. A project
manager should also have good people skills. Many organizations
require each of their project managers to become certified as a
Project Management Professional (PMP).

Information Security Officer

            An information security officer is in charge of setting

       information security policies for an organization and then
       overseeing the implementation of those policies. This person
       may have one or more people reporting to them as part of the
       information security team. As information has become a critical
       asset, this position has become highly valued. The information
       security officer must ensure that the organization's information
       remains secure from both internal and external threats.

Emerging Roles

            As technology evolves many new roles are becoming more
       common as other roles diminish. For example, as we enter the
       age of "big data," we are seeing the need for more data analysts
       and business intelligence specialists. Many companies are now
       hiring social media experts and mobile technology specialists.
       The increased use of cloud computing and Virtual Machine
       (VM) technologies also is increasing demand for expertise in
       those areas.

These job descriptions do not represent

all possible jobs within an information

systems organization.  Larger

organizations will have more specialized

roles, while smaller organizations may

combine some of these roles. Many of these

roles may exist outside of a traditional

information- systems organization, as we

will discuss below.

Working with information systems can be a

rewarding career choice. Whether you want      Tr,c1-. -

to be involved in very technical jobs (programmer, database

administrator), or you want to be involved in working with people

(systems analyst, trainer, project manager), there are many

different career paths available.

    Many times, those in technical jobs who want career
advancement find themselves in a dilemma. A person can continue
doing technical work, where sometimes their advancement options
are limited, or become a manager of other employees and put
themselves on a management career track. In many cases those
proficient in technical skills are not gifted with managerial skills.
Some organizations, especially those that highly value their
technically skilled employees, create a technical track that exists in
parallel to the management track so that they can retain employees
who are contributing to the organization with their technical skills.

       employees with technical skills is becoming critical. But how can
       an organization ensure that the person they are hiring has the
       necessary skills? Many organizations are including technical
       certifications as a prerequisite for getting hired.

Cisco Certification Badge

          Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert.
          Certifications are designations given by a certifying body
       that someone has a specific level of knowledge in a specific
       technology. This certifying body is often the vendor of the product
       itself, though independent certifying organizations, such as
       CompTIA, also exist.
       Many of these organizations offer certification tracks, allowing a
       beginning certificate as a prerequisite to getting more advanced
       certificates. To get a certificate, you generally attend one or more
       training classes and then take one or more certification exams.
       Passing the exams with a certain score will qualify you for a
       certificate. In most cases, these classes and certificates are not free.
       In fact, a highly technical certification can cost thousands of dollars.
       Some examples of the certifications in highest demand include
       Microsoft (software certifications), Cisco (networking), and SANS
       (security). For many working in IT, determining whether to
       pursue one or more of these certifications is an important
       question. For many jobs, such as those involving networking or
       security, a certificate will be required by the employer as a way to
       determine which potential employees have a basic level of skill. For
       those who are already in an IT career, a more advanced certificate
       may lead to a promotion. For those wondering about the importance
       of certification, the best solution is to talk to potential employers
       and those already working in the field to determine the best choice.

    Organizing the Information
         Systems Function

            In the early years of computing, the information-systems
       function (generally called "data processing") was placed in the
       finance or accounting department of the organization. As
       computing became more important, a separate information-
       systems function was formed, but it still was generally placed
       under the Chief Financial Officer and considered to be an
       administrative function of the company. By the 1980s and 1990s,
       when companies began networking internally and then
       connecting to the Internet, the information systems function was
       combined with the telecommunications functions and designated
       as the Information Technology (IT) department. As the role of
       information technology continued to increase, its place in the
       organization became more important. In many organizations
       today, the head of IT (the CIO) reports directly to the CEO.

Where in the Organization
Should IS Be?

            Before the advent of the personal computer, the information
       systems function was centralized within organizations in order to
       maximize control over computing resources. When the PC began
       proliferating, many departments within organizations saw it as a

       chance to gain some computing resources for themselves. Some
       departments created an internal information systems group,
       complete with systems analysts, programmers, and even
       database administrators. These departmental IS groups were
       dedicated to the information needs of their own departments,
       providing quicker turnaround and higher levels of service than a
       centralized IT department. However, having several IS groups
       within an organization led to a lot of inefficiencies. There were
       now several people performing the same jobs in different
       departments. This decentralization also led to company data
       being stored in several places all over the company.

       In some organizations a matrix reporting structure developed in
       which IT personnel were placed within a department and
       reported to both the department management and the functional
       management within IS. The advantages of dedicated IS
       personnel for each department must be weighed against the need
       for more control over the strategic information resources of the
       company.

       For many companies, these questions are resolved by the
       implementation of the ERP system (see discussion of ERP in
       Chapter 8). Because an ERP system consolidates most corporate
       data back into a single database, the implementation of an ERP
       system requires organizations to find "silos" of data so that they
       can integrate them back into the corporate system. The ERP
       allows organizations to regain control of their information and
       influences organizational decisions throughout the company.

Outsourcing

            Frequently an organization needs a specific skill for a limited
       period of time. Instead of training existing employees or hiring new
       staff, it may make more sense to outsource the job. Outsourcing
       can be used in many different situations within the information
       systems function, such as the design and creation of a new
       website or the upgrade of an ERP system. Some organizations
       see outsourcing as a cost-cutting move, contracting out a whole

New Models of Organizations

            The integration of information technology has influenced the
       structure of organizations. The increased ability to communicate
       and share information has led to a "flattening" of the
       organizational structure due to the removal of one or more layers
       of management. The network-based organizational structure is
       another changed enabled by information systems. In a network-
       based organizational structure, groups of employees can work
       somewhat independently to accomplish a project. People with
       the right skills are brought together for a project and then
       released to work on other projects when that project is over.
       These groups are somewhat informal and allow for all members
       of the group to maximize their effectiveness.

   Information Systems Users -
           Types of Users

            Besides the people who work to create, administer, and
       manage information systems, there is one more extremely
       important group of people, namely, the users of information
       systems. This group represents a very large percentage of an
       organization's employees. If the user is not able to successfully
       learn and use an information system, the system is doomed to
       failure.

          Technology adoption user types

       One tool that can be used to understand how users will adopt a new
       technology comes from a 1962 study by Everett Rogers. In his
       book, Diffusion of Innovation,[1]Rogers studied how farmers

adopted new technologies and noticed that the adoption rate
started slowly and then dramatically increased once adoption hit
a certain point. He identified five specific types of technology
adopters:

                                     100

                                     75

                           34 %            enlarge)

       13.5 % 34 %

 Innovators. Innovators are the first individuals to adopt a
   new technology. Innovators are willing to take risks, are the
   youngest in age, have the highest social class, have great
   financial liquidity, are very social, and have the closest
   contact with scientific sources and interaction with other
   innovators. Risk tolerance is high so there is a willingness
   to adopt technologies that may ultimately fail. Financial
   resources help absorb these failures (Rogers, 1962, p. 282).

 Early adopters. The early adopters are those who adopt
   innovation soon after a technology has been introduced and
   proven. These individuals have the highest degree of opinion
   leadership among the other adopter categories, which means
   that these adopters can influence the opinions of the largest
   majority. Characteristics include being younger in age, having
   a higher social status, possessing more financial liquidity,
   having advanced education, and being more socially aware
   than later adopters. These adopters are more discrete in
   adoption choices than innovators, and realize judicious choice
   of adoption will help them maintain a central communication
   position (Rogers, 1962, p. 283).

          Early majority. Individuals in this category adopt an
             innovation after a varying degree of time. This time of
             adoption is significantly longer than the innovators and early
             adopters. This group tends to be slower in the adoption
             process, has above average social status, has contact with

             early adopters, and seldom holds positions of opinion
             leadership in a system (Rogers, 1962, p. 283).
          Late majority. The late majority will adopt an innovation
             after the average member of the society. These individuals
             approach an innovation with a high degree of skepticism, have
             below average social status, very little financial liquidity, are
             in contact with others in the late majority and the early
             majority, and show very little opinion leadership.
          Laggards. Individuals in this category are the last to adopt
             an innovation. Unlike those in the previous categories,
             individuals in this category show no opinion leadership.
             These individuals typically have an aversion to change
             agents and tend to be advanced in age. Laggards typically
             tend to be focused on "traditions," are likely to have the
             lowest social status and the lowest financial liquidity, be
             oldest of all other adopters, and be in contact with only
             family and close friends.[2]
       These five types of users can be translated into information
       technology adopters as well, and provide additional insight into
       how to implement new information systems within the
       organization. For example, when rolling out a new system, IT
       may want to identify the innovators and early adopters within the
       organization and work with them first, then leverage their
       adoption to drive the rest of the implementation to the other
       users.

Summary

            In this chapter we have reviewed the many different categories
       of individuals who make up the people component of information
       that new roles are being created all the time and roles that existed
       for decades are being phased out. This chapter this chapter
       should have given you a good idea and appreciation for the
       importance of the people component of information systems.

        Programming

    Software is created via programming, as discussed in Chapter 2.
Programming is the process of creating a set of logical instructions
for a digital device to follow using a programming language. The
process of programming is sometimes called "coding" because the
developer takes the design and encodes it into a programming
language which then runs on the computer.

The process of developing good software is usually not as simple
as sitting down and writing some code. Sometimes a programmer
can quickly write a short program to solve a need, but in most
instances the creation of software is a resource-intensive process
that involves several different groups of people in an
organization. In order to do this effectively, the groups agree to
follow a specific software development methodology. The
following sections review several different methodologies for
software development, as summarized in the table below and
more fully described in the following sections.

       developed in the 1960s to manage the large software projects
       associated with corporate systems running on mainframes. This
       approach to software development is very structured and risk
       averse, designed to manage large projects that include multiple
       programmers and systems that have a large impact on the
       organization. It requires a clear, upfront understanding of what
       the software is supposed to do and is not amenable to design
       changes. This approach is roughly similar to an assembly line
       process, where it is clear to all stakeholders what the end product
       should do and that major changes are difficult and costly to
       implement. Various definitions of the SDLC methodology exist,
       but most contain the following phases.

        1. Preliminary Analysis. A request for a replacement or new
             system is first reviewed. The review includes questions such
             as: What is the problem-to-be-solved? Is creating a solution
             possible? What alternatives exist? What is currently being
             done about it? Is this project a good fit for our organization?
             After addressing these questions, a feasibility study is
             launched. The feasibility study includes an analysis of the
             technical feasibility, the economic feasibility or affordability,
             and the legal feasibility. This step is important in determining
             if the project should be initiated and may be done by someone
             with a title of Requirements Analyst or Business Analyst

        2. System Analysis. In this phase one or more system analysts
             work with different stakeholder groups to determine the
             specific requirements for the new system. No programming
             is done in this step. Instead, procedures are documented,
             key players/users are interviewed, and data requirements
             are developed in order to get an overall impression of
             exactly what the system is supposed to do. The result of
             this phase is a system requirements document and may be
             done by someone with a title of Systems Analyst.

        3. System Design. In this phase, a designer takes the system
             requirements document created in the previous phase and
             develops the specific technical details required for the
             system. It is in this phase that the business requirements are

             translated into specific technical requirements. The design
             for the user interface, database, data inputs and outputs, and
             reporting are developed here. The result of this phase is a
             system design document. This document will have
             everything a programmer needs to actually create the
             system and may be done by someone with a title of
             Systems Analyst, Developer, or Systems Architect, based
             on the scale of the project.

        4. Programming. The code finally gets written in the
             programming phase. Using the system design document as a
             guide, programmers develop the software. The result of this
             phase is an initial working program that meets the
             requirements specified in the system analysis phase and the
             design developed in the system design phase. These tasks are
             done by persons with titles such as Developer, Software
             Engineer, Programmer, or Coder.

        5. Testing. In the testing phase the software program developed
             in the programming phase is put through a series of structured
             tests. The first is a unit test, which evaluates individual parts
             of the code for errors or bugs. This is followed by a system
             test in which the different components of the system are tested
             to ensure that they work together properly. Finally, the user
             acceptance test allows those that will be using the software to
             test the system to ensure that it meets their standards. Any
             bugs, errors, or problems found during testing are resolved
             and then the software is tested again. These tasks are done by
             persons with titles such as Tester, Testing Analyst, or Quality
             Assurance.

        6. Implementation. Once the new system is developed and
             tested, it has to be implemented in the organization. This
             phase includes training the users, providing documentation,
             and data conversion from the previous system to the new
             system. Implementation can take many forms, depending
             on the type of system, the number and type of users, and
             how urgent it is that the system become operational. These
             different forms of implementation are covered later in the

             chapter.
        7. Maintenance. This final phase takes place once the

             implementation phase is complete. In the maintenance
             phase the system has a structured support process in place.
             Reported bugs are fixed and requests for new features are
             evaluated and implemented. Also, system updates and
             backups of the software are made for each new version of
             the program. Since maintenance is normally an Operating
             Expense (OPEX) while much of development is a Capital
             Expense (CAPEX), funds normally come out of different
             budgets or cost centers.

       The SDLC methodology is sometimes referred to as the waterfall
       methodology to represent how each step is a separate part of the
       process. Only when one step is completed can another step begin.
       After each step an organization must decide when to move to the
       next step. This methodology has been criticized for being quite
       rigid, allowing movement in only one direction, namely, forward in
       the cycle. For example, changes to the requirements are not allowed
       once the process has begun. No software is available until after the
       programming phase.
       Again, SDLC was developed for large, structured projects. Projects
       using SDLC can sometimes take months or years to complete.
       Because of its inflexibility and the availability of new programing
       techniques and tools many other software development
       methodologies have been developed. Many of these retain some of

Rapid Application Development

        RAD Methodology (click to enlarge)
            Rapid Application Development (RAD) focuses on quickly

       building a working model of the software, getting feedback from
       users, and then using that feedback to update the working model.
       After several iterations of development, a final version is developed
       and implemented.
       The RAD methodology consists of four phases.

        1. Requirements Planning. This phase is similar to the
             preliminary analysis, system analysis, and design phases of
             the SDLC. In this phase the overall requirements for the
             system are defined, a team is identified, and feasibility is
             determined.

        2. User Design. In the user design phase representatives of the
             users work with the system analysts, designers, and programmers
             to interactively create the design of the system. Sometimes a
             Joint Application Development (JAD) session is used to
             facilitate working with all of these various stakeholders. A JAD
             session brings all of the stakeholders for a structured discussion

             about the design of the system. Application developers also
             participate and observe, trying to understand the essence of the
             requirements.

        3. Construction. In the construction phase the application
             developers, working with the users, build the next version of
             the system through an interactive process. Changes can be
             made as developers work on the program. This step is
             executed in parallel with the User Design step in an iterative
             fashion, making modifications until an acceptable version of
             the product is developed.

        4. Cutover. Cutover involves switching from the old system to
             the new software. Timing of the cutover phase is crucial and
             is usually done when there is low activity. For example, IT
             systems in higher education undergo many changes and
             upgrades during the summer or between fall semester and
             spring semester. Approaches to the migration from the old to
             the new system vary between organizations. Some prefer to
             simply start the new software and terminate use of the old
             software. Others choose to use an incremental cutover,
             bringing one part online at a time. A cutover to a new
             accounting system may be done one module at a time such as
             general ledger first, then payroll, followed by accounts
             receivable, etc. until all modules have been implemented. A
             third approach is to run both the old and new systems in
             parallel, comparing results daily to confirm the new system is
             accurate and dependable. A more thorough discussion of
             implementation strategies appears near the end of this chapter.

       As you can see, the RAD methodology is much more compressed
       than SDLC. Many of the SDLC steps are combined and the focus
       is on user participation and iteration. This methodology is much
       better suited for smaller projects than SDLC and has the added
       advantage of giving users the ability to provide feedback
       throughout the process. SDLC requires more documentation and
       attention to detail and is well suited to large, resource-intensive
       projects. RAD makes more sense for smaller projects that are less

Agile Methodologies

            Agile methodologies are a group of methodologies that utilize
       incremental changes with a focus on quality and attention to detail.
       Each increment is released in a specified period of time (called a
       time box), creating a regular release schedule with very specific
       objectives. While considered a separate methodology from RAD,
       the two methodologies share some of the same principles such as
       iterative development, user interaction, and flexibility to change.
       The agile methodologies are based on the "Agile Manifesto," first
       released in 2001.

Agile Methodology

Agile and Iterative Development

            The diagram above emphasizes iterations in the center of agile
       development. You should notice how the building blocks of the
       developing system move from left to right, a block at a time, not the
       entire project. Blocks that are not acceptable are returned through
       feedback and the developers make the needed modifications.

       Finally, notice the Daily Review at the top of the diagram. Agile
       Development means constant evaluation by both developers and
       customers (notice the term "Collaboration") of each day's work.
       The characteristics of agile methodology include:

          Small cross-functional teams that include development
             team members and users;

          Daily status meetings to discuss the current state of the
             project;

          Short time-frame increments (from days to one or two
             weeks) for each change to be completed; and

          Working project at the end of each iteration which
             demonstrates progress to the stakeholders.

       The goal of agile methodologies is to provide the flexibility of an
       iterative approach while ensuring a quality product.

Lean Methodology

       taken from the business bestseller The Lean Startup by Eric Reis.
       Lean focuses on taking an initial idea and developing a Minimum
       Viable Product (MVP). The MVP is a working software application
       with just enough functionality to demonstrate the idea behind the
       project.
       Once the MVP is developed, the development team gives it to
       potential users for review. Feedback on the MVP is generated in
       two forms. First, direct observation and discussion with the users
       and second, usage statistics gathered from the software itself.
       Using these two forms of feedback, the team determines whether
       they should continue in the same direction or rethink the core
       idea behind the project, change the functions, and create a new
       MVP. This change in strategy is called a pivot. Several iterations
       of the MVP are developed, with new functions added each time
       based on the feedback, until a final product is completed.
       The biggest difference between the iterative and non-iterative
       methodologies is that the full set of requirements for the system are
       not known when the project is launched. As each iteration of the
       project is released, the statistics and feedback gathered are used
       to determine the requirements. The lean methodology works best
       in an entrepreneurial environment where a company is interested
       in determining if their idea for a program is worth developing.

        The quality triangle (click to enlarge)
       When developing software or any sort of product or service,
       there exists a tension between the developers and the different
       stakeholder groups such as management, users, and investors.
       This tension relates to how quickly the software can be
       developed (time), how much money will be spent (cost), and how
       well it will be built (quality). The quality triangle is a simple
       concept. It states that for any product or service being developed,
       you can only address two of the following: time, cost, and quality.

       So why can only two of the three factors in the triangle be
       considered? Because each of these three components are in
       competition with each other! If you are willing and able to spend
       a lot of money, then a project can be completed quickly with high
       quality results because you can provide more resources towards its
       development. If a project's completion date is not a priority, then it
       can be completed at a lower cost with higher quality results using a
       smaller team with fewer resources. Of course, these are just
       generalizations, and different projects may not fit this model
       perfectly. But overall, this model is designed to help you understand
       the trade-offs that must be made when you are developing new
       products and services.

       There are other, fundamental reasons why low-cost, high-quality
       projects done quickly are so difficult to achieve.

        1. The human mind is analog and the machines the software run
             on are digital. These are completely different natures that
             depend upon context and nuance versus being a 1 or a 0.
             Things that seem obvious to the human mind are not so
             obvious when forced into a 1 or 0 binary choice.

        2. Human beings leave their imprints on the applications or
             systems they design. This is best summed up by Conway's
             Law (1968) - "Organizations that design information systems
             are constrained to do so in a way that mirrors their internal
             communication processes." Organizations with poor
             communication processes will find it very difficult to

             communicate requirements and priorities, especially for
             projects at the enterprise level (i.e., that affect the whole
             organization.

    Programming Languages

            As noted earlier, developers create programs using one of
       several programming languages. A programming language is an
       artificial language that provides a way for a developer to create
       programming code to communicate logic in a format that can be
       executed by the computer hardware. Over the past few decades,
       many different types of programming languages have evolved to
       meet a variety of needs. One way to characterize programming
       languages is by their "generation."

Generations of Programming
Languages

       Early languages were specific to the type of hardware that had to be
       programmed. Each type of computer hardware had a different low-
       level programming language. In those early languages very specific
       instructions had to be entered line by line - a tedious process.

First generation languages were called machine code because
programming was done in the format the machine/computer could
read. So programming was done by directly setting actual ones and
zeroes (the bits) in the program using binary code. Here is an example
program that adds 1234 and 4321 using machine language:

10111001  00000000
11010010  10100001
00000100  00000000
10001001  00000000

10001001  10100011
00001110  00000100
00000010  00000000

Assembly language is the second-generation language and uses
English-like phrases rather than machine-code instructions,
making it easier to program. An assembly language program
must be run through an assembler, which converts it into
machine code. Here is a sample program that adds 1234 and 4321
using assembly language.

MOV CX,1234
MOV DS:[0], CX MOV CX,4321 MOV AX, DS:[0]
MOV BX, DS:[2] ADD AX, BX
MOV DS:[4], AX

       Third-generation languages are not specific to the type of
       hardware on which they run and are similar to spoken languages.
       Most third-generation languages must be compiled. The developer
       writes the program in a form known generically as source code, then
       the compiler converts the source code into machine code, producing
       an executable file. Well known third-generation languages include
       BASIC, C, Python, and Java. Here is an example using BASIC:

       A=1234 B=4321 C=A+B END

Fourth-generation languages are a class of programming tools
that enable fast application development using intuitive
interfaces and environments. Many times, a fourth-generation
language has a very specific purpose, such as database
interaction or report-writing. These tools can be used by those
with very little formal training in programming and allow for the
quick development of applications and/or functionality.
Examples of fourth-generation languages include: Clipper,
FOCUS, SQL, and SPSS.

Why would anyone want to program in a lower level language
when they require so much more work? The answer is similar to
why some prefer to drive manual transmission vehicles instead
of automatic transmission, namely, control and efficiency.
Lower level languages, such as assembly language, are much
more efficient and execute much more quickly. The developer
has finer control over the hardware as well. Sometimes a
combination of higher and lower level languages is mixed
together to get the best of both worlds.

The programmer can create the overall structure and interface
using a higher-level language but use lower level languages for
the parts of the program that are used many times, require more
precision, or need greater speed.

Compiled vs. Interpreted

            Besides identifying a programming language based on its
       generation, we can also classify it through the distinction of whether
       it is compiled or interpreted. A computer language is written in a
       human-readable form. In a compiled language the program code is
       translated into a machine-readable form called an executable that
       can be run on the hardware. Some well-known compiled languages
       include C, C++, and COBOL.
       Interpreted languages require a runtime program to be installed
       in order to execute. Each time the user wants to run the software
       the runtime program must interpret the program code line by line,
       then run it. Interpreted languages are generally easier to work
       with but also are slower and require more system resources.
       Examples of popular interpreted languages include:

       BASIC, PHP, PERL, and Python. The web languages of HTML and
       JavaScript are also considered interpreted because they require a
       browser in order to run.
       The Java programming language is an interesting exception to this
       classification, as it is actually a hybrid of the two. A program written
       in Java is partially compiled to create a program that can be
       understood by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Each type of
       operating system has its own JVM which must be installed before
       any program can be executed. The JVM approach allows a single
       Java program to run on many different types of operating systems.

Procedural vs. Object-Oriented

            A procedural programming language is designed to allow a
       programmer to define a specific starting point for the program and
       then execute sequentially. All early programming languages

       worked this way. As user interfaces became more interactive and
       graphical, it made sense for programming languages to evolve to
       allow the user to have greater control over the flow of the program.
       An object- oriented programming language is designed so that the
       programmer defines "objects" that can take certain actions based on
       input from the user. In other words, a procedural program focuses
       on the sequence of activities to be performed while an object-
       oriented program focuses on the different items being manipulated.

            j ect : EMPLOYEE
        EMPLOYEEID
        FIRSTNAM E
        LASTNAM E
        BIRTH DATE
        HIREDATE
        ADDEMPLOYEE()
        EDITEM PLOYEE()

        Employee object
       Consider a human resources system where an "EMPLOYEE"
       object would be needed. If the program needed to retrieve or set
       data regarding an employee, it would first create an employee object
       in the program and then set or retrieve the values needed. Every
       object has properties, which are descriptive fields associated with
       the object. Also known as a Schema, it is the logical view of the
       object (i.e., each row of properties represents a column in the actual
       table, which is known as the physical view). The employee object
       has the properties "EMPLOYEEID", "FIRSTNAME", "LASTNAME",
       "BIRTHDATE" and "HIREDATE". An object also has methods
       which can take actions related to the object. There are two methods
       in the example. The first is "ADDEMPLOYEE()", which will
       create another employee record. The second is
       "EDITEMPLOYEE()" which will modify an employee's data.

    To write a program, you need little more than a text editor
and a good idea. However, to be productive you must be able to
check the syntax of the code, and, in some cases, compile the
code. To be more efficient at programming, additional tools,
such as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or
computer-aided software-engineering (CASE) tools can be used.

       For most programming languages an Integrated Development
       Environment (IDE) can be used to develop the program. An IDE
       provides a variety of tools for the programmer, and usually
       includes:

          Editor. An editor is used for writing the program. Commands
             are automatically color coded by the IDE to identify
             command types. For example, a programming comment might
             appear in green and a programming statement might appear in
             black.

             regarding the programming language.

          Compiler/Interpreter. The compiler/interpreter converts
             the programmer's source code into machine language so it
             can be executed/run on the computer.

          Debugging tool. Debugging assists the developer in locating
             errors and finding solutions.

          Check-in/check-out mechanism. This tool allows teams of
             programmers to work simultaneously on a program without
             overwriting another programmer's code.

       Examples of IDEs include Microsoft's Visual Studio and Oracle's
       Eclipse. Visual Studio is the IDE for all of Microsoft's programming
       languages, including Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Visual C#. Eclipse
       can be used for Java, C, C++, Perl, Python, R, and many other
       languages.

CASE Tools

            While an IDE provides several tools to assist the programmer in
       writing the program, the code still must be written. Computer-
       Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools allow a designer to
       develop software with little or no programming. Instead, the CASE
       tool writes the code for the designer. CASE tools come in many
       varieties. Their goal is to generate quality code based on input
       created by the designer.

       (HTML). Today most websites are built with a variety of tools, but
       the final product that is transmitted to a browser is still HTML. At
       its simplest HTML is a text language that allows you to define the
       different components of a web page. These definitions are handled
       through the use of HTML tags with text between the tags or
       brackets. For example, an HTML tag can tell the browser to show a
       word in italics, to link to another web page, or to insert an image.
       The HTML code below selects two different types of headings (h1
       and h2) with text below each heading. Some of the text has been
       italicized. The output as it would appear in a browser is shown after
       the HTML code.

       <h1>This is a first-level heading</h1>

       Here is some text. <em>Here is some emphasized text. </em>

       While HTML is used to define the components of a web page,
       Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to define the styles of the
       components on a page. The use of CSS allows the style of a website
       to be set and stay consistent throughout. For example, a designer
       who wanted all first-level headings (h1) to be blue and centered

       The combination of HTML and CSS can be used to create a wide
       variety of formats and designs and has been widely adopted by the
       web design community. The standards for HTML are set by a
       governing body called the World Wide Web Consortium. The
       current version of HTML 5 includes new standards for video, audio,
       and drawing.

       When developers create a website, they do not write it out manually
       in a text editor. Instead, they use web design tools that generate the
       HTML and CSS for them. Tools such as Adobe Dreamweaver allow
       the designer to create a web page that includes images and
       interactive elements without writing a single line of code. However,
       professional web designers still need to learn HTML and CSS in
       order to have full control over the web pages they are developing.

Sidebar: Building a Mobile App

            In many ways building an application for a mobile device is
       exactly the same as building an application for a traditional
       computer. Understanding the requirements for the application,
       designing the interface, and working with users are all steps that
       still need to be carried out.

Mobile Apps

        So, what's different about building an application for a mobile
       device? There are five primary differences:

        1. Breakthroughs in component technologies. Mobile
             devices require multiple components that are not only
             smaller but more energy-efficient than those in full-size
             computers (laptops or desktops). For example, low-power
             CPUs combined with longer-life batteries, touchscreens, and
             Wi-Fi enable very efficient computing on a phone, which
             needs to do much less actual processing than their full-size
             counterparts.

        2. Sensors have unlocked the notion of context. The
             combination of sensors like GPS, gyroscopes, and cameras
             enables devices to be aware of things like time, location,
             velocity, direction, altitude, attitude, and temperature.
             Location in particular provides a host of benefits.

        3. Simple, purpose-built, task-oriented apps are easy to
             use. Mobile apps are much narrower in scope than enterprise

    software and therefore easier to use. Likewise, they need to
    be intuitive and not require any training.

4. Immediate access to data extends the value proposition.
    In addition to the app providing a simpler interface on the
    front end, cloud-based data services provide access to data
    in near real-time, from virtually anywhere (e.g., banking,
    travel, driving directions, and investing). Having access to
    the cloud is needed to keep mobile device size and power
    use down.

5. App stores have simplified acquisition. Developing,
    acquiring, and managing apps has been revolutionized by app
    stores such as Apple's App Store and Google Play.
    Standardized development processes and app requirements
    allow developers outside Apple and Google to create new
    apps with a built-in distribution channel. Average low app
    prices (including many of which that are free) has fueled
    demand.

In sum, the differences between building a mobile app and other
types of software development look like this:

       Building a mobile app for both iOS and Android operating systems
       is known as cross platform development. There are a number of
       third-party toolkits available for creating your app. Many will
       convert existing code such as HTML5, JavaScript, Ruby, C++, etc.
       However, if your app requires sophisticated programming, a cross
       platform developer kit may not meet your needs.

       Responsive Web Design (RWD) focuses on making web pages

       content to the device on which it is being viewed. You can find out
       more about responsive design here.

Build vs. Buy

            When an organization decides that a new program needs to be
       developed, they must determine if it makes more sense to build it
       themselves or to purchase it from an outside company. This is the
       "build vs. buy" decision.
       There are many advantages to purchasing software from an outside
       company. First, it is generally less expensive to purchase software
       than to build it. Second, when software is purchased, it is available
       much more quickly than if the package is built in-house. Software
       can take months or years to build. A purchased package can be up
       and running within a few days. Third, a purchased package has
       already been tested and many of the bugs have already been worked
       out. It is the role of a systems integrator to make various purchased
       systems and the existing systems at the organization work together.
       There are also disadvantages to purchasing software. First, the same
       software you are using can be used by your competitors. If a
       company is trying to differentiate itself based on a business process
       incorporated into purchased software, it will have a hard time doing
       so if its competitors use the same software. Another disadvantage
       to purchasing software is the process of customization. If you
       purchase software from a vendor and then customize it, you will
       have to manage those customizations every time the vendor
       provides an upgrade. This can become an administrative headache,
       to say the least.
       Even if an organization determines to buy software, it still makes
       sense to go through the same analysis as if it was going to be

       developed. This is an important decision that could have a long-
       term strategic impact on the organization.

Web Services

            Chapter 3 discussed how the move to cloud computing has
       allowed software to be viewed as a service. One option, known as
       web services, allows companies to license functions provided by
       other companies instead of writing the code themselves. Web
       services can greatly simplify the addition of functionality to a
       website. Suppose a company wishes to provide a map showing the
       location of someone who has called their support line. By utilizing
       Google Maps API web services, the company can build a Google
       Map directly into their application. Or a shoe company could make
       it easier for its retailers to sell shoes online by providing a shoe
       sizing web service that the retailers could embed right into their
       website. Web services can blur the lines between "build vs. buy."
       Companies can choose to build an application themselves but then
       purchase functionality from vendors to supplement their system.

End-User Computing (EUC)

            In many organizations, application development is not limited
       to the programmers and analysts in the information technology
       department. Especially in larger organizations, other departments
       develop their own department-specific applications. The people
       who build these applications are not necessarily trained in
       programming or application development, but they tend to be adept
       with computers. A person who is skilled in a particular program,
       such as a spreadsheet or database package, may be called upon to
       build smaller applications for use by their own department. This
       phenomenon is referred to as end-user development, or end-user
       computing. End-user computing can have many advantages for an
       organization. First, it brings the development of applications closer

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
       to those who will use them. Because IT departments are
       sometimes backlogged, it also provides a means to have software
       created more quickly. Many organizations encourage end-user
       computing to reduce the strain on the IT department.
       End-user computing does have its disadvantages as well. If
       departments within an organization are developing their own
       applications, the organization may end up with several applications
       that perform similar functions, which is inefficient, since it is a
       duplication of effort. Sometimes these different versions of the
       same application end up providing different results, bringing
       confusion when departments interact. End-user applications are
       often developed by someone with little or no formal training in
       programming. In these cases, the software developed can have
       problems that then have to be resolved by the IT department.
       End-user computing can be beneficial to an organization provided
       it is managed. The IT department should set guidelines and provide
       tools for the departments who want to create their own solutions.
       Communication between departments can go a long way towards
       successful use of end-user computing.

   Sidebar: Risks of EUC's as
            "Shadow IT"

       The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Company, better known as
       Freddie Mac, was fined over $100 million in 2003 in part for
       understating its earnings. This triggered a large-scale project to
       restate its financials, which involved automating financial reporting
       to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Part of the
       restatement project found that EUCs (such as spreadsheets and
       databases on individual laptops) were feeding into the General
       Ledger. While EUCs were not the cause of Freddie Mac's problems
       (they were a symptom of insufficient oversight) to have such poor

       IT governance in such a large company was a serious issue. It
       turns these EUCs were done in part to streamline the time it took
       to make changes to their business processes (a common
       complaint of IT departments in large corporations is that it takes
       too long to get things done). As such, these EUCs served as a
       form of "shadow IT" that had not been through a normal rigorous
       testing process.

Implementation Methodologies

            Once a new system is developed or purchased, the organization
       must determine the best method for implementation. Convincing a
       group of people to learn and use a new system can be a very difficult
       process. Asking employees to use new software as well as follow a
       new business process can have far reaching effects within the
       organization. There are several different methodologies an
       organization can adopt to implement a new system. Four of the most
       popular are listed below.

          Direct cutover. In the direct cutover implementation
             methodology, the organization selects a particular date to
             terminate the use of the old system. On that date users
             begin using the new system and the old system is
             unavailable. Direct cutover has the advantage of being very
             fast and the least expensive implementation method.
             However, this method has the most risk. If the new system
             has an operational problem or if the users are not properly
             prepared, it could prove disastrous for the organization.

          Pilot implementation. In this methodology a subset of the
             organization known as a pilot group starts using the new
             system before the rest of the organization. This has a smaller

             impact on the company and allows the support team to
             focus on a smaller group of individuals. Also, problems
             with the new software can be contained within the group
             and then resolved.
          Parallel operation. Parallel operations allow both the old and
             new systems to be used simultaneously for a limited period of
             time. This method is the least risky because the old system is
             still being used while the new system is essentially being
             tested. However, this is by far the most expensive
             methodology since work is duplicated and support is needed
             for both systems in full.
          Phased implementation. Phased implementation provides for
             different functions of the new application to be gradually
             implemented with the corresponding functions being turned
             off in the old system. This approach is more conservative
             as it allows an organization to slowly move from one
             system to another.

       Your choice of an implementation methodology depends on the
       complexity of both the old and new systems. It also depends on
       the degree of risk you are willing to take.

Change Management

            As new systems are brought online and old systems are phased
       out, it becomes important to manage the way change is
       implemented in the organization. Change should never be
       introduced in a vacuum. The organization should be sure to
       communicate proposed changes before they happen and plan to
       minimize the impact of the change that will occur after
       implementation. Change management is a critical component of IT
       oversight.

 Sidebar: Mismanaging Change

            Target Corporation, which operates more than 1,500 discount
       stores throughout the United States, opened 133 similar stores in
       Canada between 2013 and 2015. The company decided to implement
       a new Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) system that would
       integrate data from vendors, customers, and do currency calculations
       (US Dollars and Canadian Dollars). This implementation coincided
       with Target Canada's aggressive expansion plan and stiff
       competition from Wal-Mart. A two-year timeline - aggressive by any
       standard for an implementation of this size - did not account for data
       errors from multiple sources that resulted in erroneous inventory
       counts and financial calculations. Their supply chain became chaotic
       and stores were plagued by not having sufficient stock of common
       items, which prevented the key advantage of "one-stop shopping" for
       customers. In early 2015, Target Canada announced it was closing all
       133 stores. In sum, "This implementation broke nearly all of the
       cardinal sins of ERP projects. Target set unrealistic goals, didn't leave
       time for testing, and neglected to train employees properly."1

            Maintenance

       After a new system has been introduced, it enters the maintenance
       phase. The system is in production and is being used by the
       organization. While the system is no longer actively being
       developed, changes need to be made when bugs are found or new
       features are requested. During the maintenance phase, IT
       management must ensure that the system continues to stay aligned
       with business priorities and continues to run well.

Summary

       Software development is about so much more than programming. It
       is fundamentally about solving business problems. Developing new
       software applications requires several steps, from the formal SDLC
       process to more informal processes such as agile programming or
       lean methodologies. Programming languages have evolved from
       very low-level machine-specific languages to higher-level
       languages that allow a programmer to write software for a wide
       variety of machines. Most programmers work with software
       development tools that provide them with integrated components
       to make the software development process more efficient. For some
       organizations, building their own software does not make the most
       sense. Instead, they choose to purchase software built by a third
       party to save development costs and speed implementation. In end-
       user computing, software development happens outside the
       information technology department. When implementing new
       software applications, there are several different types of
       implementation methodologies that must be considered.

This chapter looks at the implications of globalization and the
impact it is having on the world.

             What Is Globalization?

    Globalization refers to the integration of goods, services, and
culture among the nations of the world. Globalization is not
necessarily a new phenomenon. In many ways, globalization has
existed since the days of European colonization. Further
advances in telecommunication and transportation technologies
accelerated globalization. The advent of the worldwide Internet
has made all nations virtual next-door neighbors.

The Internet is truly a worldwide phenomenon. As of December

2017 the Internet was being used by over 4.1 billion people
worldwide.1 From its initial beginnings in the United States in the
1970s to the development of the World Wide Web in the 1990s to
the social networks and e-commerce of today, the Internet has
continued to increase the integration between countries, making
globalization a fact of life for citizens all over the world.

The Network Society

            In 1996 social-sciences researcher Manuel Castells published
       The Rise of the Network Society, in which he identified new ways
       economic activity was being organized around the networks that
       the new telecommunication technologies had provided. This
       new, global economic activity was different from the past,
       because "it is an economy with the capacity to work as a unit in
       real time on a planetary scale."2 Having a world connected via
       the Internet has some massive implications.

The World Is Flat

         Thomas Friedman's 2005 book The World Is Flat uses anecdotal
       evidence to present the impact the personal computer, the
       Internet, and communication software have had on business,
       specifically the impact on globalization. Three eras of
       globalization are defined at the beginning of the book.3:

          "Globalization 1.0 occurred from 1492 until about 1800. In
             this era globalization was centered around countries. It was
             about how much horsepower, wind power, and steam power a
             country had and how creatively it was deployed. The world
             shrank from size "large" to size "medium."

          "Globalization 2.0 occurred from about 1800 until 2000,
             interrupted only by the two World Wars. In this era, the
             dynamic force driving change was multinational companies.
             The world shrank from size "medium" to size "small."

          "Globalization 3.0 is our current era, beginning in the year
             2000. The convergence of the personal computer, fiber-
             optic Internet connections, and software has created a "flat-
             world platform" that allows small groups and even
             individuals to go global. The world has shrunk from size
             "small" to size "tiny."

       According to Friedman, this third era of globalization was brought
       about, in many respects, by information technology. Some of the
       specific technologies include:

          Graphical user interface for the personal computer
             popularized in the late 1980s. Before the graphical user
             interface, using a computer was relatively difficult,
             requiring users to type commands rather than click a
             mouse. By making the personal computer something that
             anyone could use, the computer became a tool of virtually
             every person, not just those intrigued by technology.
             Friedman says the personal computer made people more
             productive and, as the Internet evolved, made it simpler to
             communicate information worldwide.

          Build-out of the Internet infrastructure during the dot-
             com boom during the late-1990s. During the late 1990s,
             telecommunications companies laid thousands of miles of
             fiber optic cable all over the world, turning network
             communications into a commodity. At the same time, the
             Internet protocols, such as SMTP (e-mail), HTML (web
             pages), and TCP/IP (network communications) became
             standards that were available for free and used by everyone
             through their email programs and web browsers.

          Introduction of software to automate and integrate
             business processes. As the Internet continued to grow and
             become the dominant form of communication, it became
             essential to build on the standards developed earlier so that the
             websites and applications running on the Internet would work
             well together. Friedman calls this "workflow software," by
             which he means

            software that allows people to work together more easily, and
            allows different software and databases to integrate with each
            other more easily. Examples include payment processing
            systems and shipping calculators.

       These three technologies came together in the late 1990s to
       create a "platform for global collaboration." Once these
       technologies were in place, they continued to evolve. Friedman
       also points out a couple more technologies that have contributed
       to the flat-world platform, namely the open source movement
       discussed in Chapter 10 and the advent of mobile technologies.
       Economist Pankaj Ghemawat authored the book World 3.0 in
       2011 in an attempt to provide a more moderate and research-
       based analysis of globalization. While Friedman talked with
       individuals and produced an anecdotally-based book,
       Ghemawat's approach was to research economic data, then draw
       conclusions about globalization. His research found the
       following:

          Mailed letters that cross international borders = 1%
          Telephone calling minutes that are international = 2%
          Internet traffic that is routed across international borders =

             18%
          National, as opposed to international, TV news sources = 95%
          First generation immigrants as portion of world's population =

             3%
          People who at some time in their lives will cross an

             international border = 10%
          Global exports as portion of the value of all goods

             produced in the world = 20% 4

       According to Ghemawat, while the Internet has had an impact on

       can be expected to continue to be the main focus in most
       countries. You can watch Ghemawat's Ted Talk here. Current
       and future trends will be discussed in Chapter 13.

         The new era of globalization allows virtually any business to
       become international. By accessing this new platform of
       technologies, Castells' vision of working as a unit in real time on
       a planetary scale can be a reality. Some of the advantages
       include:

          Ability to locate expertise and labor around the world.
             Instead of drawing employees from their local area,
             organizations can now hire people from the global labor pool.
             This also allows organizations to pay a lower labor cost for
             the same work based on the prevailing wage in different
             countries.

          Ability to operate 24 hours a day. With employees in
             different time zones all around the world, an organization can
             literally operate around the clock, handing off work on
             projects from one part of the world to another as the normal
             business day ends in one region and begins in another. A few
             years ago, three people decided to open a web hosting
             company. They strategically relocated to three places in the
             world which were eight hours apart, giving their business 24-
             hour coverage while allowing each to work during the normal
             business day. Operating expenses were minimized and the
             business provided 24/7 support to customers worldwide.

          Larger market for their products. Once a product is being
             sold online, it is available for purchase from a worldwide
             customer base. Even if a company's products do not appeal

             beyond its own country's borders, being online has made the
             product more visible to consumers within that country.

       In order to fully take advantage of these new capabilities,
       companies need to understand that there are also challenges in
       dealing with employees and customers from different cultures.
       Some of these challenges include:

          Infrastructure differences. Each country has its own
             infrastructure with varying levels of quality and bandwidth. A
             business cannot expect every country it deals with to have the
             same Internet speeds. See the sidebar titled "How Does My
             Internet Speed Compare?"

          Labor laws and regulations. Different countries (even
             different states in the United States) have different laws and
             regulations. A company that wants to hire employees from
             other countries must understand the different regulations and
             concerns.

          Legal restrictions. Many countries have restrictions on what
             can be sold or how a product can be advertised. It is important
             for a business to understand what is allowed. For example, in
             Germany, it is illegal to sell anything Nazi related.

          Language, customs, and preferences. Every country has its
             own unique culture which a business must consider when
             trying to market a product there. Additionally, different
             countries have different preferences. For example, in many
             parts of Europe people prefer to eat their french fries with
             mayonnaise instead of ketchup. In South Africa a
             hamburger comes delivered to your table with gravy on top.

          International shipping. Shipping products between countries
             in a timely manner can be challenging. Inconsistent address
             formats, dishonest customs agents, and prohibitive shipping
             costs are all factors that must be considered when trying to
             deliver products internationally.

       Because of these challenges, many businesses choose not to
       expand globally, either for labor or for customers. Whether a

business has its own website or relies on a third-party, such as
Amazon or eBay, the question of whether or not to globalize
must be carefully considered.

        The Digital Divide

            As the Internet continues to make inroads across the world, it is
       also creating a separation between those who have access to this
       global network and those who do not. This separation is called the
       "digital divide" and is of great concern. An article in Crossroads
       puts it this way:
       Adopted by the ACM Council in 1992, the ACM Code of Ethics
       and Professional Conduct focuses on issues involving the Digital
       Divide that could prevent certain categories of people -- those from
       low-income households, senior citizens, single-parent children, the
       undereducated, minorities, and residents of rural areas -- from
       receiving adequate access to the wide variety of resources offered
       by computer technology. This Code of Ethics positions the use of
       computers as a fundamental ethical consideration: "In a fair society,
       all individuals would have equal opportunity to participate in, or
       benefit from, the use of computer resources regardless of race, sex,
       religion, age, disability, national origin, or other similar factors."
       This article summarizes the digital divide in its various forms, and
       analyzes reasons for the growing inequality in people's
       access to Internet services. It also describes how society can bridge
       the digital divide: the serious social gap between information
       "haves" and "have-nots."5 The digital divide can occur between
       countries, regions, or even neighborhoods. In many US cities, there
       are pockets with little or no Internet access, while just a few miles
       away high-speed broadband is common.

       Solutions to the digital divide have had mixed success over the
       years. Many times, just providing Internet access and/or
       computing devices is not enough to bring true Internet access to
       a country, region, or neighborhood.

A New Understanding of the Digital Divide

         In 2006, web-usability consultant Jakob Nielsen wrote an article
       that got to the heart of our understanding of this problem. In his
       article he breaks the digital divide up into three stages: the economic
       divide, the usability divide, and the empowerment divide6.

          Economic divide. This is what many call the digital divide.
             The economic divide is the idea that some people can afford
             to have a computer and Internet access while others cannot.
             Because of Moore's Law (see Chapter 2), the price of
             hardware has continued to drop and, at this point, we can now
             access digital technologies, such as smartphones, for very
             little. Nielsen asserts that for all intents and purposes, the
             economic divide is a moot point and we should not focus our
             resources on solving it.

          Usability divide. Usability is concerned with the fact that
             "technology remains so complicated that many people
             couldn't use a computer even if they got one for free." And
             even for those who can use a computer, accessing all the
             benefits of having one is beyond their understanding.
             Included in this group are those with low literacy and
             seniors. According to Nielsen, we know how to help users,
             but we are not doing it because there is little profit in doing
             so.

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
          Empowerment divide. Empowerment is the most difficult
             to solve. It is concerned with how we use technology to
             empower ourselves. Very few users truly understand the
             power that digital technologies can give them. In his article,
             Nielsen explains that his and others' research has shown
             that very few users contribute content to the Internet, use
             advanced search, or can even distinguish paid search ads
             from organic search results. Many people will limit what
             they can do online by accepting the basic, default settings
             of their computer and not work to understand how they can
             truly be empowered.

       Understanding the digital divide using these three stages
       provides a more nuanced view of how we can work to alleviate
       it. More work needs to be done to address the second and third
       stages of the digital divide for a more holistic solution.

   Refining the Digital Divide

         The Miniwatts Marketing Group, host of Internet World Stats, has
       sought in 2018 to further clarify the meaning of digital divide by
       acknowledging that the divide is more than just who does or does
       not have access to the Internet. In addition to Nielsen's economic,
       usability, and empowerment divides, this group sees the following
       concerns.

          Social mobility. Lack of computer education works to the
             disadvantage of children with lower socioeconomic status.

          Democracy. Greater use of the Internet can lead to
             healthier democracies especially in participation in
             elections.

          Economic growth. Greater use of the Internet in
             developing countries could provide a shortcut to economic
             advancement. Using the latest technology could give

             companies in these countries a competitive advantage.

       The focus on the continuing digital divide has led the European
       Union to create an initiative known as The European 2020 Strategy.
       Five major areas are being targeted: a) research and development,
       b) climate/energy, c) education, d) social inclusion, and e) poverty
       reduction.7

         the Digital Divide

            Paul Kim, the Assistant Dean and Chief Technology Officer
       of the Stanford Graduate School of Education, designed a project
       to address the digital divide for children in developing countries.
       8 In their project the researchers wanted to learn if children can
       adopt and teach themselves mobile learning technology, without
       help from teachers or other adults, and the processes and factors
       involved in this phenomenon. The researchers developed a
       mobile device called TeacherMate, which contained a game
       designed to help children learn math. The unique part of this
       research was that the researchers interacted directly with the
       children. They did not channel the mobile devices through the
       teachers or the schools. There was another important factor to
       consider. In order to understand the context of the
       children's educational environment, the researchers began the
       project by working with

       parents and local nonprofits six months before their visit. While
       the results of this research are too detailed to go into here, it can
       be said that the researchers found that children can, indeed, adopt
       and teach themselves mobile learning technologies.
       What makes this research so interesting when thinking about the
       digital divide is that the researchers found that, in order to be
       effective, they had to customize their technology and tailor their
       implementation to the specific group they were trying to reach.
       One of their conclusions stated the following:

       Considering the rapid advancement of technology today, mobile
       learning options for future projects will only increase.
       Consequently, researchers must continue to investigate their
       impact. We believe there is a specific need for more in-depth studies
       on ICT [Information and Communication Technology] design
       variations to meet different challenges of different localities.

Summary

            Information technology has driven change on a global scale.
       Technology has given us the ability to integrate with people all over
       the world using digital tools. These tools have allowed businesses
       to broaden their labor pools, their markets, and even their operating
       hours. But they have also brought many new complications for
       businesses, which now must understand regulations, preferences,
       and cultures from many different nations. This new globalization
       has also exacerbated the digital divide. Nielsen has suggested that
       the digital divide consists of three stages (economic, usability, and
       empowerment), of which the economic stage is virtually solved.

       New technologies create new situations that have never had to be
       confronted before. One issue is how to handle the new capabilities
       that these devices provide to users. What new laws are going to be
       needed for protection from misuse of new technologies. This
       chapter begins with a discussion of the impact of information
       systems has on user behavior or ethics. This will be followed with
       the new legal structures being put in place with a focus on
       intellectual property and privacy.

   Information Systems Ethics

       The term ethics means "a set of moral principles" or "the principles
       of conduct governing an individual or a group."1 Since the dawn
       of civilization, the study of ethics and their impact has fascinated
       mankind. But what do ethics have to do with information systems?
       The introduction of new technology can have a profound effect on
       human behavior. New technologies give us capabilities that we did
       not have before, which in turn create environments and situations
       that have not been specifically addressed in an ethical context.
       Those who master new technologies gain new power while those
       who cannot or do not master them may lose power. In 1913 Henry
       Ford implemented the first moving assembly line to create his
       Model T cars. While this was a great step forward technologically
       and economically, the assembly line reduced the value of human
       beings in the production process. The development of the atomic
       bomb concentrated unimaginable power in the hands of one
       government, who then had to wrestle with the decision to use it.
       Today's digital technologies have created new categories of ethical
       dilemmas.

       For example, the ability to anonymously make perfect copies of
       digital music has tempted many music fans to download
       copyrighted music for their own use without making payment to the
       music's owner. Many of those who would never have walked into
       a music store and stolen a CD find themselves with dozens of
       illegally downloaded albums.
       Digital technologies have given us the ability to aggregate
       information from multiple sources to create profiles of people.
       What would have taken weeks of work in the past can now be done
       in seconds, allowing private organizations and governments to
       know more about individuals than at any time in history. This
       information has value, but also chips away at the privacy of
       consumers and citizens.

            In early 2018 Facebook acknowledged a data breach affecting
       87 million users. The app "thisisyourdigitallife", created by Global
       Science Research, informed users that they could participate in a
       psychological research study. About 270,000 people decided to
       participate in the research, but the app failed to tell users that the
       data of all of their friends on Facebook would be automatically

       it did not become public until four years later.
       In 2015 Facebook learned about Global Science Research's
       collection of data on millions of friends of the users in the research.
       Global Science Research agreed to delete the data, but it had already
       been sold to Cambridge Analytica who used it in the 2016
       presidential primary campaign. The ensuing firestorm resulted in
       Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, testifying before the U.S.
       Congress in 2018 on what happened and what Facebook would
       do in the future to protect users' data. Congress is working on
       legislation to protect user data in the future, a prime example of
       technology advancing faster than the laws needed to protect
       users. More information about this case of data privacy can be
       found at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. 2

Code of Ethics

          A code of ethics is one method for navigating new ethical waters.
       A code of ethics outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a
       professional or social group. Generally, it is agreed to by all
       members of the group. The document details different actions that
       are considered appropriate and inappropriate.

          A good example of a code of ethics is the Code of Ethics and
       Professional Conduct of the Association for Computing
       Machinery,3 an organization of computing professionals that
       includes academics, researchers, and practitioners. Here is a quote
       from the preamble:
       Commitment to ethical professional conduct is expected of every
       member (voting members, associate members, and student
       members) of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
       This Code, consisting of 24 imperatives formulated as statements
       of personal responsibility, identifies the elements of such a
       commitment. It contains many, but not all, issues professionals are

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
       likely to face. Section 1 outlines fundamental ethical
       considerations, while Section 2 addresses additional, more specific
       considerations of professional conduct. Statements in Section 3
       pertain more specifically to individuals who have a leadership role,
       whether in the workplace or in a volunteer capacity such as with
       organizations like ACM. Principles involving compliance with this
       Code are given in Section 4.

       In the ACM's code you will find many straightforward ethical
       instructions such as the admonition to be honest and trustworthy.
       But because this is also an organization of professionals that
       focuses on computing, there are more specific admonitions that
       relate directly to information technology:

          No one should enter or use another's computer system,
             software, or data files without permission. One must always
             have appropriate approval before using system resources,
             including communication ports, file space, other system
             peripherals, and computer time.

          Designing or implementing systems that deliberately or
             inadvertently demean individuals or groups is ethically
             unacceptable.

          Organizational leaders are responsible for ensuring that
             computer systems enhance, not degrade, the quality of
             working life. When implementing a computer system,
             organizations must consider the personal and professional
             development, physical safety, and human dignity of all
             workers. Appropriate human-computer ergonomic
             standards should be considered in system design and in the
             workplace.

       One of the major advantages of creating a code of ethics is that it
       clarifies the acceptable standards of behavior for a professional
       group. The varied backgrounds and experiences of the members of
       a group lead to a variety of ideas regarding what is acceptable
       behavior. While the guidelines may seem obvious, having these

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
       items detailed provides clarity and consistency. Explicitly stating
       standards communicates the common guidelines to everyone in a
       clear manner.
       A code of ethics can also have some drawbacks. First, a code of
       ethics does not have legal authority. Breaking a code of ethics is not
       a crime in itself. What happens if someone violates one of the
       guidelines? Many codes of ethics include a section that describes
       how such situations will be handled. In many cases repeated
       violations of the code result in expulsion from the group.
       In the case of ACM: "Adherence of professionals to a code of ethics
       is largely a voluntary matter. However, if a member does not follow
       this code by engaging in gross misconduct, membership in ACM
       may be terminated." Expulsion from ACM may not have much of
       an impact on many individuals since membership in ACM is
       usually not a requirement for employment. However, expulsion
       from other organizations, such as a state bar organization or medical
       board, could carry a huge impact.
       Another possible disadvantage of a code of ethics is that there is
       always a chance that important issues will arise that are not
       specifically addressed in the code. Technology is quickly changing
       and a code of ethics might not be updated often enough to keep up
       with all of the changes. A good code of ethics, however, is written
       in a broad enough fashion that it can address the ethical issues of
       potential changes to technology while the organization behind the
       code makes revisions.
       Finally, a code of ethics could also be a disadvantage in that it may
       not entirely reflect the ethics or morals of every member of the
       group. Organizations with a diverse membership may have internal
       conflicts as to what is acceptable behavior. For example, there may
       be a difference of opinion on the consumption of alcoholic
       beverages at company events. In such cases the organization must

       make a choice about the importance of addressing a specific
       behavior in the code.

Sidebar: Acceptable Use Policies

            Many organizations that provide technology services to a group
       of constituents or the public require agreement to an Acceptable
       User Policy (AUP) before those services can be accessed. Similar
       to a code of ethics, this policy outlines what is allowed and what is
       not allowed while someone is using the organization's services. An
       everyday example of this is the terms of service that must be agreed
       to before using the public Wi-Fi at Starbucks, McDonald's, or even
       a university. Here is an example of an acceptable use policy from
       Virginia Tech.
       Just as with a code of ethics, these acceptable use policies specify
       what is allowed and what is not allowed. Again, while some of
       the items listed are obvious to most, others are not so obvious:

          "Borrowing" someone else's login ID and password is
             prohibited.

          Using the provided access for commercial purposes, such as
             hosting your own business website, is not allowed.

          Sending out unsolicited email to a large group of people is
             prohibited.

       As with codes of ethics, violations of these policies have various
       consequences. In most cases, such as with Wi-Fi, violating the
       acceptable use policy will mean that you will lose your access to the
       resource. While losing access to Wi-Fi at Starbucks may not have a
       lasting impact, a university student getting banned from the
       university's Wi-Fi (or possibly all network resources) could have a

       large impact.

Intellectual Property

       One of the domains that has been deeply impacted by digital
       technologies is intellectual property. Digital technologies have
       driven a rise in new intellectual property claims and made it
       much more difficult to defend intellectual property. Intellectual
       property is defined as "property (as an idea, invention, or process)
       that derives from the work of the mind or intellect."4 This could
       include creations such as song lyrics, a computer program, a new
       type of toaster, or even a sculpture.
       Practically speaking, it is very difficult to protect an idea. Instead,
       intellectual property laws are written to protect the tangible results
       of an idea. In other words, just coming up with a song in your head
       is not protected, but if you write it down it can be protected.
       Protection of intellectual property is important because it gives
       people an incentive to be creative. Innovators with great ideas
       will be more likely to pursue those ideas if they have a clear
       understanding of how they will benefit. In the US Constitution,
       Article 8, Section 8, the authors saw fit to recognize the
       importance of protecting creative works:

       Congress shall have the power . . . To promote the Progress of
       Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors
       and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and
       Discoveries.

       An important point to note here is the "limited time"
       qualification. While protecting intellectual property is important
       because of the incentives it provides, it is also necessary to limit
       the amount of benefit that can be received and allow the results
       of ideas to become part of the public domain. Outside of the US,
       intellectual property protections vary. You can find out more about
       a specific country's intellectual property laws by visiting the World
       Intellectual Property Organization. The following sections
       address three of the best-known intellectual property protections:
       copyright, patent, and trademark.

Copyright

         Copyright is the protection given to songs, computer programs,
       books, and other creative works. Any work that has an "author" can
       be copyrighted. Under the terms of copyright, the author of a work
       controls what can be done with the work, including:

          Who can make copies of the work.
          Who can make derivative works from the original work.
          Who can perform the work publicly.
          Who can display the work publicly.
          Who can distribute the work.

       Many times, a work is not owned by an individual but is instead
       owned by a publisher with whom the original author has an
       agreement. In return for the rights to the work, the publisher will
       market and distribute the work and then pay the original author
       a portion of the proceeds.
       Copyright protection lasts for the life of the original author plus
       seventy years. In the case of a copyrighted work owned by a
       publisher or another third party, the protection lasts for ninety-
       five years from the original creation date. For works created
       before

       1978, the protections vary slightly. You can see the full details on
       copyright protections by reviewing the Copyright Basics document
       available at the US Copyright Office's website.

Obtaining Copyright Protection

            In the United States a copyright is obtained by the simple act of
       creating the original work. In other words, when an author writes
       down a song, makes a film, or develops a computer program, the
       author has the copyright. However, for a work that will be used
       commercially, it is advisable to register for a copyright with the US
       Copyright Office. A registered copyright is needed in order to bring
       legal action against someone who has used a work without
       permission.

First Sale Doctrine

            If an artist creates a painting and sells it to a collector who
       then, for whatever reason, proceeds to destroy it, does the
       original artist have any recourse? What if the collector, instead
       of destroying it, begins making copies of it and sells them? Is this
       allowed? The first sale doctrine is a part of copyright law that
       addresses this, as shown below5:
       The first sale doctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C.  109, provides that an
       individual who knowingly purchases a copy of a copyrighted work
       from the copyright holder receives the right to sell, display or
       otherwise dispose of that particular copy, notwithstanding the
       interests of the copyright owner.
       Therefore, in our examples the copyright owner has no recourse
       if the collector destroys the artwork. But the collector does not
       have the right to make copies of the artwork.

Fair Use

            Another important provision within copyright law is that of
       fair use. Fair use is a limitation on copyright law that allows for
       the use of protected works without prior authorization in specific
       cases. For example, if a teacher wanted to discuss a current event
       in class, copies of the copyrighted new story could be handed out
       in class without first getting permission. Fair use is also what
       allows a student to quote a small portion of a copyrighted work
       in a research paper.
       Unfortunately, the specific guidelines for what is considered fair
       use and what constitutes copyright violation are not well defined.
       Fair use is a well-known and respected concept and will only be
       challenged when copyright holders feel that the integrity or market
       value of their work is being threatened. The following four factors
       are considered when determining if something constitutes fair
       use: 6

        1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether
             such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit
             educational purposes;

        2. The nature of the copyrighted work;
        3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in

             relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;
        4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value

             of, the copyrighted work.

       If you are ever considering using a copyrighted work as part of
       something you are creating, you may be able to do so under fair
       use. However, it is always best to check with the copyright owner
       to be sure you are staying within your rights and not infringing

  Sidebar: The History of
        Copyright Law

As noted above, current copyright law grants copyright protection
for seventy years after the author's death, or ninety-five years from
the date of creation for a work created for hire. But it was not always
this way.

The first US copyright law, which only protected books, maps,
and charts, provided protection for only 14 years with a
renewable term of 14 years. Over time copyright law was revised
to grant protections to other forms of creative expression, such
as photography and motion pictures. Congress also saw fit to
extend the length of the protections, as shown in the following
chart. Today, copyright has become big business with many
businesses relying on the income from copyright protected works
for their income.

Many now think that the protections last too long. The Sonny Bono
Copyright Term Extension Act has been nicknamed the "Mickey
Mouse Protection Act," as it was enacted just in time to protect the
copyright on the Walt Disney Company's Mickey Mouse character.
Because of this term extension, many works from the 1920s and
1930s that would have been available now in the public domain are
still restricted.

The Digital Millennium
Copyright Act

         As digital technologies have changed what it means to create,
       copy, and distribute media, a policy vacuum has been created. In
       1998, the US Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright
       Act (DMCA), which extended copyright law to take into
       consideration digital technologies. Two of the best-known
       provisions from the DMCA are the anti-circumvention provision
       and the "safe harbor" provision.

          The anti-circumvention provision makes it illegal to create
             technology to circumvent technology that has been put in
             place to protect a copyrighted work. This provision
             includes not just the creation of the technology but also the
             publishing of information that describes how to do it. While
             this provision does allow for some exceptions, it has
             become quite controversial and has led to a movement to
             have it modified.

          The "safe harbor" provision limits the liability of online
             service providers when someone using their services commits
             copyright infringement. This is the provision that allows
             YouTube, for example, not to be held liable when someone
             posts a clip from a copyrighted movie. The provision does
             require the online service provider to take action when they
             are notified of the violation (a "takedown" notice). For an
             example of how takedown works, here's how YouTube
             handles these requests: YouTube Copyright Infringement
             Notification.

       Many think that the DMCA goes too far and ends up limiting our
       freedom of speech. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is
       at the forefront of this battle. In discussing the anti-

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
       circumvention provision, the EFF states:

       Yet the DMCA has become a serious threat that jeopardizes fair use,
       impedes competition and innovation, chills free expression and
       scientific research, and interferes with computer intrusion laws. If
       you circumvent DRM [digital rights management] locks for non-
       infringing fair uses or create the tools to do so you might be on the
       receiving end of a lawsuit.

   Sidebar: Creative Commons

            Chapter 2 introduced the topic of open-source software. Open-
       source software has few or no copyright restrictions. The creators
       of the software publish their code and make their software available
       for others to use and distribute for free. This is great for software,
       but what about other forms of copyrighted works? If an artist or
       writer wants to make their works available, how can they go about
       doing so while still protecting the integrity of their work? Creative
       Commons is the solution to this problem.
       Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that provides
       legal tools for artists and authors. The tools offered make it
       simple to license artistic or literary work for others to use or
       distribute in a manner consistent with the author's intentions.
       Creative Commons licenses are indicated with the symbol. It is
       important to note that Creative Commons and public domain are
       not the same. When something is in the public domain, it has
       absolutely no restrictions on its use or distribution. Works whose
       copyrights have expired are in the public domain.
       By using a Creative Commons license, authors can control the use
       of their work while still making it widely accessible. By attaching a
       Creative Commons license to their work, a legally binding license
       is created. Here are some examples of these licenses:

Information Systems for Business and Beyond (2019) pg. 264

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
          CC-BY. This is the least restrictive license. It lets others
             distribute and build upon the work, even commercially, as
             long as they give the author credit for the original work.

          CC-BY-SA. This license restricts the distribution of the
             work via the "share-alike" clause. This means that others
             can freely distribute and build upon the work, but they must
             give credit to the original author and they must share using
             the same Creative Commons license.

          CC-BY-NC. This license is the same as CC-BY but adds the
             restriction that no one can make money with this work. NC
             stands for "non-commercial."

          CC-BY-NC-ND. This license is the same as CC-BY-NC but
             also adds the ND restriction, which means that no
             derivative works may be made from the original.

       These are a few of the more common licenses that can be created
       using the tools that Creative Commons makes available. For a full
       listing of the licenses and to learn much more about Creative
       Commons, visit their web site.

Patent

         Patents are another important form of intellectual property
       protection. A patent creates protection for someone who invents a
       new product or process. The definition of invention is quite broad
       and covers many different fields. Here are some examples of items
       receiving patents:

          circuit designs in semiconductors;

Information Systems for Business and Beyond (2019) pg. 265

          prescription drug formulas;
          firearms;
          locks;
          plumbing;
          engines;
          coating processes; and
          business processes.

       Once a patent is granted it provides the inventor with protection
       from others infringing on his or her patent. A patent holder has the
       right to "exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or
       selling the invention throughout the United States or importing the
       invention into the United States for a limited time in exchange for
       public disclosure of the invention when the patent is granted."7
       As with copyright, patent protection lasts for a limited period of
       time before the invention or process enters the public domain. In
       the US, a patent lasts twenty years. This is why generic drugs are
       available to replace brand-name drugs after twenty years.

Obtaining Patent Protection

         Unlike copyright, a patent is not automatically granted when
       someone has an interesting idea and writes it down. In most
       countries a patent application must be submitted to a government
       patent office. A patent will only be granted if the invention or
       process being submitted meets certain conditions.

          Must be original. The invention being submitted must not
             have been submitted before.

          Must be non-obvious. You cannot patent something that
             anyone could think of. For example, you could not put a

             chair.
          Must be useful. The invention being submitted must serve
             some purpose or have some use that would be desired.

       The job of the patent office is to review patent applications to ensure
       that the item being submitted meets these requirements. This is not
       an easy job. In 2017 the US Patent Office granted 318,849 patents,
       an increase of 5.2% over 2016.8 The current backlog for a patent
       approval is 15.6 months. Information Technology firms have
       applied for a significant number of patents each year. Here are the
       top five I.T. firms in terms of patent applications filed since 2009.
       The percent indicate the percent of total I.T. patents filed since
       2009. Notice that over half of patent filings come from just these
       five corporations.

          International Business Machines (IBM) 21.6%
          Microsoft Corporation 14.2%
          AT & T, Inc. 7.1%
          Alphabet (Google), Inc. 5.0%

Sidebar: What Is a Patent Troll?

            The advent of digital technologies has led to a large increase
       in patent filings and therefore a large number of patents being
       granted. Once a patent is granted, it is up to the owner of the
       patent to enforce it. If someone is found to be using the invention

       without permission, the patent holder has the right to sue to force
       that person to stop and to collect damages.
       The rise in patents has led to a new form of profiteering called
       patent trolling. A patent troll is a person or organization who gains
       the rights to a patent but does not actually make the invention that
       the patent protects. Instead, the patent troll searches for those who
       are illegally using the invention in some way and sues them. In
       many cases the infringement being alleged is questionable at best.
       For example, companies have been sued for using Wi-Fi or for
       scanning documents, technologies that have been on the market for
       many years.
       Recently, the U.S. government has begun taking action against
       patent trolls. Several pieces of legislation are working their way
       through the U.S. Congress that will, if enacted, limit the ability of
       patent trolls to threaten innovation. You can learn a lot more about
       patent trolls by listening to a detailed investigation conducted by the
       radio program This American Life, by clicking this link.

Trademark

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
            A trademark is a word, phrase, logo, shape or sound that
       identifies a source of goods or services. For example, the Nike
       "Swoosh," the Facebook "f", and Apple's apple (with a bite taken out
       of it) are all trademarked. The concept behind trademarks is to
       protect the consumer. Imagine going to the local shopping center to
       purchase a specific item from a specific store and finding that there
       are several stores all with the same name!
       Two types of trademarks exist - a common law trademark and a
       registered trademark. As with copyright, an organization will
       automatically receive a trademark if a word, phrase, or logo is being
       used in the normal course of business (subject to some restrictions,
       discussed below). A common law trademark is designated by placing
       "TM" next to the trademark. A registered trademark is one that has
       been examined, approved, and registered with the trademark office,
       such as the Patent and Trademark Office in the US. A registered
       trademark has the circle-R () placed next to the trademark.

       While most any word, phrase, logo, shape, or sound can be
       trademarked, there are a few limitations. A trademark will not hold
       up legally if it meets one or more of the following conditions:

          The trademark is likely to cause confusion with a mark in a
             registration or prior application.

          The trademark is merely descriptive for the goods/services.
             For example, trying to register the trademark "blue" for a blue
             product you are selling will not pass muster.

          The trademark is a geographic term.
          The trademark is a surname. You will not be allowed to

             trademark "Smith's Bookstore."
          The trademark is ornamental as applied to the goods. For

             example, a repeating flower pattern that is a design on a
             plate cannot be trademarked.

       As long as an organization uses its trademark and defends it against

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
       infringement, the protection afforded by it does not expire. Because
       of this, many organizations defend their trademark against other
       companies who's branding even only slightly copies their
       trademark. For example, Chick-fil-A has trademarked the phrase
       "Eat Mor Chikin" and has vigorously defended it against a small
       business using the slogan "Eat More Kale." Coca-Cola has
       trademarked the contour shape of its bottle and will bring legal
       action against any company using a bottle design similar to theirs.
       Examples of trademarks that have been diluted and have now lost
       their protection in the US include: "aspirin" (originally trademarked
       by Bayer), "escalator" (originally trademarked by Otis), and "yo-
       yo" (originally trademarked by Duncan).

Information Systems and
Intellectual Property

            The rise of information systems has resulted in rethinking
       how to deal with intellectual property. From the increase in
       patent applications swamping the government's patent office to
       the new laws that must be put in place to enforce copyright
       protection, digital technologies have impacted our behavior.

Privacy

            The term privacy has many definitions, but for purposes here,
       privacy will mean the ability to control information about oneself.
       The ability to maintain our privacy has eroded substantially in the
       past decades, due to information systems.

       that persons identity is called personally identifiable information,
       or PII. This is a broad category that includes information such as:

          Name;
          Social Security Number;
          Date of birth;
          Place of birth;
          Mother`s maiden name;
          Biometric records (fingerprint, face, etc.);
          Medical records;
          Educational records;
          Financial information; and
          Employment information.

       Organizations that collect PII are responsible to protect it. The
                                                                  -

       Department of Commerce recommends that "organizations
       minimize the use, collection, and retention of PII to what is strictly
       necessary to accomplish their business purpose and mission." They
       go on to state that "the likelihood of harm caused by a breach
       involving PII is greatly reduced if an organization minimizes the
       amount of PII it uses, collects, and stores."10 Organizations that do
       not protect PII can face penalties, lawsuits, and loss of business. In
       the US, most states now have laws in place requiring organizations
       that have had security breaches related to PII to notify potential
       victims, as does the European Union.
       Just because companies are required to protect your information
       does not mean they are restricted from sharing it. In the US,
       companies can share your information without your explicit
       consent (see the following sidebar), though not all do so.
       Companies that collect PII are urged by the FTC to create a
       privacy policy and post it on their website. The State of
       California requires a privacy policy for any website that does
       business with a resident of the state (see

       http://www.privacy.ca.gov/lawenforcement/laws.htm).
       While the privacy laws in the US seek to balance consumer
       protection with promoting commerce, privacy in the European
       Union is considered a fundamental right that outweighs the interests
       of commerce. This has led to much stricter privacy protection in the
       EU, but also makes commerce more difficult between the US and
       the EU.

Non-Obvious Relationship
Awareness

            Digital technologies have given people many new capabilities
       that simplify and expedite the collection of personal information.
       Every time a person comes into contact with digital technologies,
       information about that person is being made available. From
       location to web-surfing habits, your criminal record to your credit
       report, you are constantly being monitored. This information can
       then be aggregated to create profiles of each person.

       While much of the information collected was available in the past,
       collecting it and combining it took time and effort. Today, detailed
       information about a person is available for purchase from different
       companies. Even information not categorized as PII can be
       aggregated in such a way that an individual can be identified.
       This process of collecting large quantities of a variety of
       information and then combining it to create profiles of individuals
       is known as Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness, or NORA. First
       commercialized by big casinos looking to find cheaters, NORA is
       used by both government agencies and private organizations, and it
       is big business.

Non-obvious relationship awareness (NORA)

In some settings NORA can bring many benefits such as in law
enforcement. By being able to identify potential criminals more
quickly, crimes can be solved sooner or even prevented before
they happen. But these advantages come at a price, namely, our
privacy.

Restrictions on Data Collecting

    In the United State the government has strict guidelines on
how much information can be collected about its citizens.
Certain classes of information have been restricted by laws over
time and the advent of digital tools has made these restrictions
more important than ever.

    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

       Websites that collect information from children under the age of
       thirteen are required to comply with the Children's Online Privacy
       Protection Act (COPPA), which is enforced by the Federal Trade

       Commission (FTC). To comply with COPPA, organizations must
       make a good-faith effort to determine the age of those accessing
       their websites and, if users are under thirteen years old, must obtain
       parental consent before collecting any information.
    Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
       The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a US
       law that protects the privacy of student education records. In brief,
       this law specifies that parents have a right to their child's
       educational information until the child reaches either the age of
       eighteen or begins attending school beyond the high school level.
       At that point control of the information is given to the child. While
       this law is not specifically about the digital collection of
       information on the Internet, the educational institutions that are
       collecting student information are at a higher risk for disclosing it
       improperly because of digital technologies.

    Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

       The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
       (HIPAA) singles out records related to health care as a special class
       of personally identifiable information. This law gives patients
       specific rights to control their medical records, requires health care
       providers and others who maintain this information to get specific
       permission in order to share it, and imposes penalties on the
       institutions that breach this trust. Since much of this information is
       now shared via electronic medical records, the protection of those
       systems becomes paramount.

    General Data Protection Regulation

        GDPR Logo
       The European Union, in an effort to help people take control over
       their personal data, passed the General Data Protection Regulation
       (GDPR) in May 2016. While this protection applies to the countries
       in the EU, it is having an impact of U.S. companies using the
       Internet as well. The regulation went into effect May 25, 2018.
       EU and non-EU countries have different approaches to protecting
       the data of individuals. The focus in the U.S. has been on
       protecting data privacy so that it does not impact commercial
       interests.
       In the EU, the individual's data privacy rights supersede those of
       business. Under GDPR data cannot be transferred to countries

that do not have adequate data protection for individuals.
Currently, those countries include, but are not limited to, the
United States, Korea, and Japan. While the GDPR applies to
countries in the EU, it is having an impact around the world as
businesses in other countries seek to comply with this regulation. IEEE
Spectrum. Retrieved from https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/internet/your-

One week prior to the effective date of May 25, 2018, only 60% of companies

surveyed reported they would be ready by the deadline. Information

Clearly, the message of GDPR has gone out around the world. It is
likely that greater data protection regulations will forthcoming from
the U.S. Congress as well.

   Sidebar: Do Not Track

    When it comes to getting permission to share personal
information, the US and the EU have different approaches. In the
US, the "opt- out" model is prevalent. In this model the default
agreement states that you have agreed to share your information
with the organization and must explicitly tell them that you do not
want your information shared. There are no laws prohibiting the
sharing of your data, beyond some specific categories of data such
as medical records. In the European Union the "opt-in" model is
required to be the default. In this case you must give your explicit
permission before an organization can share your information.

       To combat this sharing of information, the Do Not Track initiative
       was created. As its creators explain13:

       Do Not Track is a technology and policy proposal that enables users
       to opt out of tracking by websites they do not visit, including
       analytics services, advertising networks, and social platforms. At
       present few of these third parties offer a reliable tracking opt out
       and tools for blocking them are neither user-friendly nor
       comprehensive. Much like the popular Do Not Call registry, Do Not
       Track provides users with a single, simple, persistent choice to opt
       out of third- party web tracking.

Summary

            The rapid changes in information technology in the past few
       decades have brought a broad array of new capabilities and powers
       to governments, organizations, and individuals alike. These new
       capabilities have required thoughtful analysis and the creation of
       new norms, regulations, and laws. This chapter has covered the
       areas of intellectual property and privacy regarding how these
       domains have been affected by new information systems
       capabilities and how the regulatory environment has been changed
       to address them.

              Upon successful completion of this chapter, you
              will be able to:
               Describe current trends in information

                     systems.
               Know how to think about the impacts of

                     changes in technology on society and
                     culture.

            Introduction

            Information systems have evolved at a rapid pace ever since
       their introduction in the 1950s. Today devices you can hold in
       one hand are more powerful than the computers used to land a
       man on the moon in 1969. The Internet has made the entire world
       accessible to you, allowing you to communicate and collaborate
       like never before. This chapter examines current trends and looks
       ahead to what is coming next. As you read about technology
       trends in this chapter, think how you might gain competitive
       advantage in a future career through implementation of some of
       these devices.

The first trend to note is the continuing expansion of globalization.
The use of the Internet is growing all over the world, and with it the
use of digital devices. Penetration rates, the percent of the
population using the Internet, remains high in the developed world,
but other continents are gaining.1

In addition to worldwide growth in Internet penetration, the number
of mobile phones in use continues to increase. At the end of 2017
the world population of people over the age 10 years (those old
enough to possibly have their own mobile phone) was about 5.7
billion with an estimated 4.77 billion mobile phone users. This
equates to over 80% of people in the world having a mobile phone.2

Personal

            Ever since the advent of Web 2.0 and e-commerce, users of
       information systems have expected to be able to modify their
       experiences to meet their personal tastes. From custom
       backgrounds on computer desktops to unique ringtones on
       mobile phones, makers of digital devices provide the ability to
       personalize how we use them. More recently, companies such as
       Netflix have begun assisting their users with personalization by
       viewing suggestions. In the future, we will begin seeing devices
       perfectly matched to our personal preferences, based upon
       information collected about us.

Mobile

         Perhaps the most impactful trend in digital technologies in the last
       decade has been the advent of mobile technologies. Beginning with
       the simple cellphone in the 1990s and evolving into the
       smartphones of today, the growth of mobile has been
       overwhelming. Here are some key indicators of this trend:

          Mobile vs. Desktop. Minutes spent each day on a mobile
             device are 2.5 times the number of minutes spent on a
             desktop computer.

          Daytime vs. Evening. Desktop use dominates in the
             daytime hours, but mobile devices are dominant in the
             evening, with peak usage around 8:00 pm.

          Device usage. Smartphones are used more than any other
              technology. Laptops are in second place, followed by tablets
             holding a slight edge over desktops. 9

          Smartphone sales decline. According to Gartner Group,

             wide smartphone sales declined in the fourth quarter of 2017
             by 4.7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. This is the
             first decline in global smartphone sales since Gartner began
             tracking mobile phone sales in 2004. 10
          The rise and fall of tablets. In 2012 the iPad sold more than
             three times as many units in its first twelve months as the
             iPhone did in its first twelve months. However, tablet sales
             dropped 20% from the fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter
             2016. 11 The decline in tablet sales continued into 2017 when
             first quarter sales dropped 8.5% to their lowest total since the
             third quarter of 2012, the year they were introduced. 12 In
             comparison, PC sales dropped only 1.7% in 2017 compared
             with tablet sales being down 10%. 13

       As discussed in chapter 5, the advent of 5G connection technologies
       will accelerate an "always-connected" state for a majority of people
       around the world.

Wearable

            The average smartphone user looks at his or her smartphone 150
       times a day for functions such as messaging (23 times), phone calls
       (22), listening to music (13), and social media (9). Many of these
       functions would be much better served if the technology was worn
       on, or even physically integrated into, our bodies. This
       technology is known as a "wearable."
       Wearables have been around for a long time, with technologies
       such as hearing aids and, later, Bluetooth earpieces. Now the
       product lines have expanded to include the Smartwatch, body
       cameras, sports watch, and various fitness monitors. The
       following table from the Gartner Group reports both historical

            As more people use smartphones and wearables, it will be
       simpler than ever to share data with each other for mutual
       benefit. Some of this sharing can be done passively, such as
       reporting your location in order to update traffic statistics. Other
       data can be reported actively, such as adding your rating of a
       restaurant to a review site.

       The smartphone app Waze is a community-based tool that keeps
       track of the route you are traveling and how fast you are making
       your way to your destination. In return for providing your data,
       you can benefit from the data being sent from all of the other
       users of the app. Waze directs you around traffic and accidents
       based upon real-time reports from other users.

       Yelp! allows consumers to post ratings and reviews of local
       businesses into a database, and then it provides that data back to
       consumers via its website or mobile phone app. By compiling
       ratings of restaurants, shopping centers, and services, and then
       allowing consumers to search through its directory, Yelp! has
       become a huge source of business for many companies. Unlike
       data collected passively however, Yelp! relies on its users to take

Printable

            One of the most amazing innovations to be developed recently
       is the 3-D printer. A 3-D printer allows you to print virtually any 3-
       D object based on a model of that object designed on a computer.
       3-D printers work by creating layer upon layer of the model using
       malleable materials, such as different types of glass, metals, or even
       wax. 3-D printing is quite useful for prototyping the designs of
       products to determine their feasibility and marketability. 3-D
       printing has also been used to create working prosthetic legs and an
       ear that can hear beyond the range of normal hearing. The US
       military now uses 3-D printed parts on aircraft such as the F-18.14
       Here are more amazing productions from 3D printers.

          Buildings. Researchers at MIT in 2017 unveiled a 3D printing
             robot that can construct a building. It has a large arm and
             small arm. The large arm moves around the perimeter of the
             building while the small arm sprays a variety of materials
             including concrete and insulation. Total time to construct a
             dome- shaped building is just 14 hours.

          Musical Instruments. Flutes, fiddles, and acoustic guitars are
             being produced with 3D printing using both metal and plastic.
             You can click here for an example of making a violin.

          Medical Models. Medical models are being used to help
             doctors train in the areas of orthopedics, transplant surgery,
             and oncology. Using a 3D printed brain model similar to
             the one shown here, surgeons were able to save a patient
             from a cerebral aneurysm.

          Clothing. How would you like clothes that fit perfectly?
             Special software is used to measure a person, then 3D
             printing produces the clothing to the exact measurements.

             The result is well-fitting clothes that consume less raw
             materials. Initially the challenge was to find materials that
             would not break. You can read more about 3D printing of
             clothes and shoes.15.

            3-D printing is one of many technologies embraced by the
       "maker" movement. Chris Anderson, editor of Wired magazine,
       puts it this way16:
       In a nutshell, the term "Maker" refers to a new category of builders
       who are using open-source methods and the latest technology to
       bring manufacturing out of its traditional factory context, and into
       the realm of the personal desktop computer. Until recently, the
       ability to manufacture was reserved for those who owned factories.
       What's happened over the last five years is that we've brought the
       Web's democratizing power to manufacturing. Today, you can
       manufacture with the push of a button.

Findable

       The "Internet of Things" (IoT) refers to devices that have been
       embedded into a variety of objects including appliances, lamps,
       vehicles, lightbulbs, toys, thermostats, jet engines, etc. and then
       connecting them via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or LTE to the Internet.

Information Systems for Business and Beyond (2019) pg. 292

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
       Principally three factors have come together to give us IoT:
       inexpensive processors, wireless connectivity, and a new standard
       for addresses on the Internet known as IPv6. The result is these
       small, embedded objects (things) are capable of sending and
       receiving data. Lights can be turned on or off remotely. Thermostats
       can be reset with anyone being present. And, perhaps on the
       downside, how you drive your car can be monitored and evaluated
       by your insurance company.

       Processors have become both smaller and cheaper in recent years,
       leading to their being embedded in more devices. Consider
       technological advancements in your vehicles. Your car can now
       collect data about how fast you drive, where you go, radio stations
       you listen to, and your driving performance such as acceleration and
       braking. Insurance companies are offering discounts for the right to
       monitor your driving behavior. On the positive side, imagine the
       benefit of being informed instantly of anticipated traffic delays
       each time you adjust your route to work in the morning.

       Think of IoT as devices that you wouldn't normally consider being
       connected to the Internet. And, the connection is independent of
       human intervention. So, a PC is not an IoT, but a fitness band could
       be. One keyword for IoT would be "independent", not relying
       directly or constantly on human action.

       Another keyword would be "interconnected", in the sense that
       IoTs are connected to other IoTs and data collection points or
       data servers. This interconnectedness or uploading of data is
       virtually automatic.

       "Ubiquitous" is also a good descriptor of IoTs. And so is
       "embeddedness." It is reasonable to expect that devices through
       IoTs are reporting data about conditions and events that are not
       foremost in our thinking, at least not on a continuous basis. Today
       there are IoTs for monitoring traffic, air quality, soil moisture,
       bridge conditions, consumer electronics, autonomous vehicles, and
       the list seemingly never stops. The question that might come to
       mind is "How many IoTs are there today?"

       The Gartner Group released a study in January 2017 which

Information Systems for Business and Beyond (2019) pg. 293

                                 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
       attempted to identify where IoTs exist. They reported that over half
       of all IoTs are installed in devices used by consumers. They also
       noted that growth in IoTs increased by over 30% from 2016 to the
       projected levels for 2017.17
       Benefits from IoTs are virtually everywhere. Here is a quick list.

          Optimization of Processes. IoTs in manufacturing monitor a
             variety of conditions that impact production including
             temperature, humidity, barometric pressure - all factors which
             require adjustment in application of manufacturing formulas.

          Component Monitoring. IoTs are added to components in
             the manufacturing process, then monitored to see how each
             component is performing.

          Home Security Systems. IoTs make the challenge of
             monitoring activity inside and outside your home are now
             easier.

          Smart Thermostats. Remote control of home thermostats
             through the use of IoTs allows the homeowner to be more
             efficient in consumption of utilities.

          Residential Lighting. IoTs provide remote control of
             lighting, both interior and exterior, and at any time of day.18

       Security issues need to be acknowledged and resolved, preferably
       before IoTs in the form of remote lighting, thermostats, and security
       systems are installed in a residence. Here are some security
       concerns that need monitoring.

          Eavesdropping. Smart speaker systems in residences have
             been hacked, allowing others to eavesdrop on conversations
             within the home.

          Internet-connected Smart Watches. These devices are
             sometimes used to monitor the location of children in the
             family. Unfortunately, hackers have been able to break in and

             again, eavesdrop as well as learn where children are located.
          Lax Use by Owners. Devices such as smart thermometers,

             security systems, etc. come with a default password. Many
             owners fail to change the password, thereby allowing easy
             access by a hacker.

Autonomous

            Another trend that is emerging is an extension of the Internet
       of Things: autonomous robots and vehicles. By combining
       software, sensors, and location technologies, devices that can
       operate themselves to perform specific functions are being
       developed. These take the form of creations such as medical
       nanotechnology robots (nanobots), self-driving cars, or
       unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
       A nanobot is a robot whose components are on the scale of about a
       nanometer, which is one-billionth of a meter. While still an
       emerging field, it is showing promise for applications in the medical
       field. For example, a set of nanobots could be introduced into the
       human body to combat cancer or a specific disease.
       In March of 2012, Google introduced the world to their driverless
       car by releasing a video on YouTube showing a blind man driving
       the car around the San Francisco area. The car combines several
       technologies, including a laser radar system, worth about $150,000.
       While the car is not available commercially yet, three US states
       (Nevada, Florida, and California) have already passed legislation
       making driverless cars legal.
       A UAV, often referred to as a "drone," is a small airplane or helicopter
       that can fly without a pilot. Instead of a pilot, they are either run
       autonomously by computers in the vehicle or operated by a person
       using a remote control. While most drones today are used for military
       or civil applications, there is a growing market for personal drones. For
       around $300, a consumer can purchase a drone for personal use.

Secure

            As digital technologies drive relentlessly forward, so does the
       demand for increased security. One of the most important
       innovations in security is the use of encryption, which we covered
       in chapter 6.

Summary

            As the world of information technology moves forward, we will
