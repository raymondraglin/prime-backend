PREFACE


In this edition I have endeavoured to keep down additions as much
as possible, so as not to overload the book; but I have not been
sparing in adding cross-references (especially in the Index) and
quotations from standard authors. These quotations seldom give
the first occasion on which a proverb has been used, as in most
cases it is impossible to find it.

I have placed an asterisk before all recognised proverbs; these
will serve as a first course for those students who do not wish
to read through the whole book at once. In a few cases I have
added explanations of English proverbs; during the eleven years
I have been using the book I have frequently found that pupils
were, for instance, as ignorant of “to bell the cat” as they were
of “attacher le grelot.”

I must add a warning to students who use the book when
translating into French. They must not use expressions marked
“familiar” or “popular” except when writing in a familiar or
low-class style. I have included these forms, because they are
often heard in conversation, but they are seldom met with in
serious French literature. A few blank pages have been added at
the end for additions. Accents have been placed on capitals to
aid the student; they are usually omitted in French printing.

In conclusion, I have to thank Mr. W. G. Lipscomb, M.A.,
Headmaster of Bolton Grammar School, Mr. E. Latham, and
especially M. Georges Jamin of the École Lavoisier, Paris, for
valuable suggestions; while M. Marius Deshumbert, and Professor
Walter Rippmann, in reading through the proof sheets, have made
many corrections and additions of the greatest value, for which I
owe them my sincere gratitude.

                                               DE V. PAYEN-PAYNE.

FRENCH IDIOMS AND PROVERBS


_Expressions to which an Asterisk is prefixed are Proverbs._


A.


A

  _Il ne sait ni A ni B_ = He does not know B from a bull’s foot;
  He cannot read; He is a perfect ignoramus.

  _Être marqué à l’A_ = To stand high in the estimation of others.

    [This expression is supposed to have originated in the custom of
    stamping French coin with different letters of the alphabet. The
    mark of the Paris Mint was an “A,” and its coins were supposed
    to be of a better quality than those stamped at provincial
    towns. But as this custom only began in 1418 by command of the
    Dauphin, son of Charles VI., and as the saying was known long
    previous, it is more probable that its origin is to be sought in
    the pre-eminence that A has always held in all Aryan languages,
    and that the French have borrowed it from the Romans. Compare
    MARTIAL, ii. 57, and our A i, at Lloyd’s.]


Abandon

  _Tout est à l’abandon_ = Everything is at sixes and sevens, in
  utter neglect, in confusion.

    [Also: _Tout va à la dérive._]


Abattre

  *_Petite pluie abat grand vent_ = A little rain lays much dust;
  Often quite a trifle calms a torrent of wrath.

    [Compare: “Hi motus animorum atque haec certamina tanta Pulveris
    exigui jactu compressa quiescunt.”
                                      VERGIL, _Georgics_, iv. 86-7.]

  _Abattre de l’ouvrage_ = To get through a great deal of work.


Aboi

  _Être aux abois_ = To be reduced to the last extremity; To be at
  bay.

    [Compare BOILEAU: “Dès que j’y veux rêver, ma veine est aux
    abois.”]

  have too much of a good thing.

  _Parler avec abondance_ = To speak fluently.

  with heaven.

    [Compare MOLIÈRE, _Tartufe_, iv. 5:

      “Le ciel défend, de vrai, certains contentements,
      Mais on trouve avec lui des accommodements.”

    The scene in which Orgon, hidden beneath the table, learns
    Tartufe’s hypocrisy.]

  _Un méchant accommodement est mieux que le meilleur procès_ = A
  bad arrangement is better than the best lawsuit.

  _Le bas âge_ = Infancy.

  _Le bel âge_ = Childhood; youth.

    [Some idea is generally understood after _le bel âge_. Thus
    “childhood” is not always the right translation. For an author

                                     POPE, _Moral Essays_, i. 262.]

  needle in a bundle (bottle) of hay.


Aiguillon

  _A dur âne dur aiguillon_ = In dealing with obstinate natures one
  must use severe measures.

    given to the Swiss roll of the drum; and as the other soldiers

    was taken from the Abbot Martin on account of his punctuation
    of a sentence over the gateway. Instead of: _Porta patens esto,
    nulli claudaris honesto_ (Gate be open, and be closed to no
    honest man), he punctuated: _Porta patens esto nulli, claudaris

    [The origin of this expression is obscure. Larousse gives the
    following explanation, adding that it was probably invented to
    explain the saying, as it can be found in no ancient author.
    “Odo Rigaud was formerly Archbishop of Rouen, and in celebration
    of his appointment he had a huge bell cast for his cathedral in
    1282. This bell was called after him _la Rigaud_. After ringing
    this bell, the bellringers required much wine to refresh them;
    hence _boire à tire larigot_, or _la Rigaud_, meant to drink
    like one who has been ringing a heavy bell.” Littré favours the
    derivation from _larigot_, or _arigot_, a little flute, and then
    the expression would be analogous to _flûter_, a popular word
    for _boire_. But probably the correct explanation is that of
    Sainte-Palaye, who says that a later meaning of _arigot_ was the
    _tap_ of a cask, so that this being pulled out, one could drink
    more without any delay.]

    king he says: “car chacun est roy en sa maison, comme respondit
    le charbonnier à votre ayeul.” M. de Ruble appends this note:
    “François I^{er}, à la suite d’une chasse qui l’avait séparé de
    sa suite, se perdit dans une forêt et chercha un asile dans la
    cabane d’un charbonnier. L’homme était absent; le roi ne trouva
    que la charbonnière, s’empara du meilleur siège et demanda à
    souper. La femme voulut attendre l’arrivée de son mari. A son
    retour, celui-ci reprit brusquement son siège et offrit un simple
    escabeau au roi: ‘Je prendz cette chaise,’ dit-il, ‘parce qu’elle
    est à moi:

      Or, par droit et par raison,
      Chacun est maître en sa maison.’

    Le roi, charmé de n’être point reconnu, obéit à son hôte. On
    soupa d’un quartier de chevreuil tué en cachette, on médit
    du roi, des tailles qu’il venait d’ordonner et surtout de sa
    sévérité pour la chasse. Le lendemain, François se fit connaître.
    Le charbonnier se crut perdu, mais le roi le rassura, et, pour
    prix de son hospitalité, lui accorda de grandes faveurs, entre
    autres le droit de chasser. A son retour à la cour, il rapporta
    le récit de son aventure et surtout le proverbe qu’il venait
    d’apprendre.” Also in _La Belle Arsène, comédie-féerie de C. S.

    FONTAINE, _Fables_, ii. 18:

      “Tant le naturel a de force!
      Il se moque de tout...

    [This expression is found from the thirteenth century. The
    explanation that would ascribe it to the followers of the Duc
    d’Anjou when he became Philippe V. of Spain must therefore be
    incorrect. The phrases “Châteaux en Asie, en Albanie” were
    also used, so that it comes to mean “to build castles in
    foreign countries, where one is not,” and hence “to indulge in
    illusions.”--LITTRÉ, _s.v._

    “Chatiaus en Espagne.”--GUILLAUME DE LORRIS, _Roman de la Rose_,
    l. 2530.

    it.]

Chien

  _C’est le chien de Jean de Nivelle, il s’enfuit quand on
  l’appelle_ = The more you call him, the more he runs away, like
  John de Nivelle’s dog.

    [Jean de Nivelle was the eldest son of Jean II., Duc de
    Montmorency, and was born about 1423. Having been summoned
    to appear before the Judges at Paris for having espoused the
    cause of the Duke of Burgundy against the wishes of the king,
    Louis XI., and of his father, who disinherited him, he fled to
    Flanders, where his wife had property. He therefore became an
    object of scorn to the people for refusing to answer the summons
    of his king, and they called him _chien_: the saying ought to
    run: _C’est_ CE _chien de Jean de Nivelle_. La Fontaine evidently
    thought the phrase referred to a real dog when he wrote:--

      “Une traîtresse voix bien souvent vous appelle,
        Ne vous pressez donc nullement,
      Ce n’était pas un sot, non, non et croyez m’en.

    an ancient King of Samos, treated with extreme cruelty his
    slaves who were planting a vineyard for him; until at length one
    more ill-used than the rest prophesied that for his cruelty he
    should never drink of its wine. When the first vintage was over
    the master bade this slave fill him a goblet, and, taking it in
    his hands, he taunted him with the failure of his prophecy. The
    slave answered with these words; and as he was speaking news
    was brought of a huge wild boar that was wasting the vineyard.
    Setting down the untasted cup and snatching up a spear the master
    went out to meet the wild boar and was slain in the encounter.

    young master, Léandre, pretends that the latter has been taken
    prisoner on board a Turkish galley and that the captain demands

    themselves from the cat. They resolved to hang a bell round his
    neck, so that they might hear him coming and run away. But the
    difficulty was to find a volunteer “to bell the cat.” In Scottish
    history Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus (1449-1514), was
    called Bell-the-Cat. James III. used to make favourites of
    architects and masons. The Scotch nobles held a council in the
    Church of Lauder for the purpose of putting down these upstarts.
    Lord Gray asked who would bell the cat. “That will I,” said
    Douglas, and fearlessly he put the minions to death in the King’s

    Ξυρεῖν λέοντα (= to shave the lion) occurs in Plato, Republic,

Hallebarde

  _Cela rime comme hallebarde et miséricorde_ = That does not rhyme
  at all.

    [The usual explanation of this expression is, that, on the death
    of the verger of St. Eustache, one of his friends--a small
    shopkeeper of the neighbourhood--wished to write an epitaph for
    his tomb. Being entirely ignorant of the rules of verse, he
    composed the following:--

        “Ci-gît mon ami Mardoche
      Il a voulu être enterré à Saint Eustache
      Il y porta trente-deux ans la hallebarde
          Dieu lui fasse miséricorde.”
                              (Par son ami, J. Cl. Bombet, 1727.)

    But in reality the proverb is much older. It dates from the time
    of the old versifiers, one of whose rules was that two consonants
    followed by an _e_ mute were sufficient to form a feminine rhyme.
    This led to abuses like the above, and this rule was superseded
    by another, that the vowel preceding the two consonants must be
    alike in both cases.]

    The origin of the word _haro_ is disputed; Littré quotes Diez,
    who connects it with O.H.G. _hera_ = here. The old opinion was
    that it was derived from _Ha-Raoul_, an appeal to Rollo, or
    Hrolf, first Duke of Normandy, and a mighty lawgiver. However,
    within living recollection the cry of _Ha-Ro! à l’aide, mon
    Prince!_ was used in the Channel Islands as a protection against
    force and fraud, when no other defence was possible. See a
    curious tale in “The Gossiping Guide to Jersey,” by J. Bertrand
    Payne, London, 1863, p. 15.]

    packed up some dust in small packets which he labelled, “Poison
    for the King,” “Poison for the Dauphin,” and so on. The innkeeper
    noticing these packets and their terrible inscriptions, informed
    the police, who took Rabelais to Paris free of charge to suffer

    There has been much discussion as to what Buffon really did
    write, whether _le style est l’homme même_ or _le style est_ DE
    _l’homme même_. In most editions after that of Didot (1843) the
    latter form will be found, whilst in editions from 1800-1843 the

    probably corrected by Buffon himself. There is a small pamphlet,
    _Discours prononcé dans l’Académie française, par M. de Buffon,
    le samedi 25 août 1753_, which is probably earlier still, in
    which it is also printed thus. However this may be, the phrase

            Trop parler nuit,
        Trop manger n’est pas sage.
             A barbon gris
             Jeune souris:
        L’Amour est de tout âge.
      Enfants de Paris, quel temps fait-il?
         Il pleut là-bas, il neige ici
               Pendant la nuit
               Tous chats sont gris.
         Pour faire route sûre
               Si l’amour va
               Cahin-caha
         Ménage ta monture._”

                                       CHARLES COLLÉ (1709-1783).
